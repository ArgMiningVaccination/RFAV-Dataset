Gallatin and his cofounders envisioned a \"national university\" that would provide a \"rational and practical education for all.\" The result of the founders' foresight is today a university that is recognized both nationally and internationally as a leader in scholarship. NYU is one of only 26 private universities in the nation to have member-ship in the distinguished Association of American Universities. Students come to NYU from all 50 states and more than 140 foreign countries. New York University includes three degree-granting campuses: New York City, United States; Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; and Shanghai, China. In addition, the University has 11 global academic centers: Accra, Czech Republic; Sydney, Australia; Tel Aviv, Israel; and Washington, DC, United States. Although overall the University is large, the divisions are small- to moderate-size units\u2014each with its own traditions, programs, and faculty. Enrollment in the undergraduate divisions at NYU ranges between 129 and 7,330, and the University offers over 11,000 courses and grants more than 25 different degrees. Classes vary in size, but the University strives to create a sense of community among students within and among the different disciplines. The founding of New York University in 1831 by a group of eminent private citizens marked a historic event in American education. In the early 19th century, the major emphasis in higher education was on the mastery of Greek and Latin, with little attention given to modern subjects. The founders of New York University intended to enlarge the scope of higher education to meet the needs of those aspiring to careers in business, industry, science, and the arts, as well as in law, medicine, and the ministry. The opening of the University of London in 1828 convinced New Yorkers that New York, too, should have a new university that fed off the energy and vibrancy of the city. 6 INTRODUCTION TO NEW YORK UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITY1832 College of Ar ts and Science 1835 School of Law 1841 School of M edicine 1854 T andon School of Engineering (January 2014) 1865 College of D entistry (including the College of Nursing [1947]) 1886 G raduate School of Arts and Science 1890 S teinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development1900 Leonar d N.

The Division of Libraries holds 4 million book volumes. Its online catalog, BobCat, contains 3.6 million records, including 1.1 million e-books, 110,000 e-journals, 261,893 serial titles, and 163,000 audio and video recordings. The special collections are uniquely strong in the performing arts, radical and labor history, and the history of New York and its avant-garde culture. Bobst Library serves as a center for the NYU community's intellectual life and offers approximately 2,500 seats for student study. The Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media is one of the world's largest academic media centers and will move in summer 2016 to new quarters in the library with advanced technology to support the newest modes of music listening. The Digital Studio offers a constantly evolving, leading-edge resource for faculty and student projects and promotes and supports access to digital resources for teaching, learning, research, and arts events. The Data Service Studio provides expert staff and access to software, statistical computing, geographical information systems analysis, data collection resources, and data management services in support of quantitative research at NYU. The Fales Library, a special collection within Bobst Library, is home to the unparalleled Fales Collection of English and American Literature; the Marion Nestle Food Studies Collection, the country's largest trove of cookbooks, food writing, pamphlets, paper, and archives, dating from the 1790s; and the Downtown Collection, an extraordinary multimedia archive documenting the avant-garde New York art world since 1975. Bobst Library also houses the Tamiment Library, the country's leading repository of research materials in the history of left politics and labor. T wo fellowship programs bring scholars from around the world to Tamiment to explore the history of the Cold War and its wide-ranging impact on American institutions and to research the history of progressive social policies and promote public discus-sion of their role in our society. Tamiment's Robert F . Wagner Labor Archives contain, among other resources, the archives of the Jewish Labor Committee and of more than 200 New York City labor organiza-tions. Fales, Tamiment, and the University Archives hold over 41,000 linear feet of archival materials.Beyond Bobst, the library of the renowned Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences focuses on research-level material in mathe-matics, computer science, and related fields. The Stephen Chan Library of Fine Arts at the Institute of Fine Arts (IFA) houses the rich collections that support the research and curricular needs of the institute's gradu-ate programs in art history and archaeology. The Jack Brause Library at SPS Midtown, the most comprehensive facility of its kind, serves the information needs of every sector of the real estate community. The Library of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (ISAW) is a resource for advanced research and graduate education in ancient civilizations from the western Mediterranean to China. The Bern Dibner Library serves the NYU Tandon School of Engineering. The libraries of NYU Abu Dhabi and NYU Shanghai provide access to all the resources in BobCat and are building their own collection of books and other print materials in support of the schools' developing curricula. Complementing the collections of the Division of Libraries are those of the Health Sciences Library and School of Law. The NYU Division of Libraries continually enhances its student and faculty services and expands its research collections, responding to the extraordinary growth 7 INTRODUCTION TO NEW YORK UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYof the University's academic programs in recent years and to the rapid expansion of electronic information resources. Bobst Library's professional staff includes more than 38 subject specialists who select materials and work with faculty and gradu-ate students in every field of study at NYU. The staff also includes specialists in under-graduate outreach, instructional services, preservation, geospatial information, digital information, scholarly communication, intellectual property, and more. The Larger Campus New York University is an integral part of the metropolitan community of New York City\u2014the business, cultural, artistic, and financial center of the nation and the home of the United Nations. The city's extraor-dinary resources enrich both the academic programs and the experience of living at New York University. Professors whose extracurricular activities include service as editors for publishing houses and magazines; as advisers to city government, banks, school systems, and social agencies; and as consultants for museums and industrial corporations bring to teaching an experience of the world and a professional sophistication that are difficult to match. Students also, either through course work or in outside activities, tend to be involved in the vigorous and varied life of the city. Research for term papers in the humanities and social sciences may take them to such diverse places as the American Museum of Natural History, the Museum of Modern Art, a garment factory, a deteriorating neighborhood, or a foreign consulate. Students in science work with their professors on such problems of immediate impor-tance for urban society as the pollution of waterways and the congestion of city streets. Business majors attend seminars in corpora-tion boardrooms and intern as executive assistants in business and financial houses. The schools, courts, hospitals, settlement houses, theatres, playgrounds, and prisons of the greatest city in the world form a regular part of the educational scene for students of medicine, dentistry, education, social work, law, business and public administration, and the creative and performing arts. The chief center for undergraduate and graduate study is at Washington Square in Greenwich Village, long famous for its contributions to the fine arts, literature, and drama and its personalized, smaller-scale, European style of living. NYU itself makes a significant contribution to the creative activity of the Village through the high concentration of faculty and students who reside within a few blocks of the University. NYU's Tandon School of Engineering, located in downtown Brooklyn, connects academics with creative research and technology in the burgeoning Tech T riangle and is just a short subway ride away from Washington Square. University apartment buildings provide housing for over 2,100 members of the faculty and administration, and University student residence halls accommodate over 11,000 men and women. Many more faculty and students reside in private housing in the area.A Private University Since its founding, New York University has been a private university. It operates under a board of trustees and derives its income from tuition, endowment, grants from private foundations and government, and gifts from friends, alumni, corporations, and other private philanthropic sources. The University is committed to a policy of equal treatment and opportunity in every aspect of its relations with its faculty, students, and staff members, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender and/or gender identity or expression, marital or parental status, national origin, ethnicity, citizenship status, veteran or military status, age, disability, and any other legally protected basis.

Styron, Writer and Human Rights Activist Ex-Officio Andrew Hamilton, President, New York UniversityARTS AND SCIENCE BOARD OF OVERSEERS The original Gothic-style University building, which was first occupied by NYU in 1835. 13 A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE College of Arts and Science BRIEF HISTORY OF CAS COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYThus, in addition to offering the standard classical curriculum, early NYU was also a center for science. John W. Draper invented modern photography, and the American Chemical Society was founded here. In the arts and culture, too, it can be argued that the College not only participated in but also generated much of the creative energy that has characterized Greenwich Village. The original University Building housed ateliers that were the forerunners of the current downtown art scene. And although Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was turned down for a teaching post, literature thrived, with University Building even featured in an 1861 novel by Theodore Winthrop. Finally, this neighborhood and this institution have had a long tradition of social and political activism\u2014from the Stonecutters Riot over the construction of the University's first building in 1834 to the tragic T riangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in 1911, a major event in U.S. labor history that took place in what is now the Brown Building. From its earliest days, then, the College on Washington Square has been at the cutting edge of intellectual, cultural, and social developments. In 1895, however, NYU's great chancellor, Henry McCracken, decided to reserve Washington Square for the professional schools, which had prolifer-ated under his leadership, and to move University College to a beautiful campus in the Bronx\u2014University Heights\u2014designed by Stanford White. The College's move to the Heights reflected McCracken's \"Ivy\" aspirations for the school and his successful effort to raise quality by attracting the best students nationally. Also relevant was the ascendant, non-urban collegiate ideal of a residential community, with fine teaching, extracurricular activities, fraternities, and intercollegiate athletics. A few years later, an undergraduate presence was restored downtown with the opening of a Collegiate Division (1903), soon to become Washington Square College (1913). This school had a more diverse student body, opening its doors to women, recent immigrants, commuters, and professional students. For over 60 years, undergraduate liberal arts education at NYU took place in two locations\u2014University College (and the Engineering School) at the Heights and the College on Washington Square, both offering excellent, but different, educational and social experiences. In the 1970s, the College underwent yet another major transformation. In response to financial pressures, the Heights campus was closed in 1973, and University College merged with Washington Square College. The new institution, which is now known simply as the College of Arts and Science, is the beneficiary of both traditions\u2014the Heights' residential and collegiate culture and the Square's progressive urban focus. At that time, a decision was also made to build aggressively for quality\u2014to recruit the very best faculty and students, to update and expand the physical plant, and to create distinguished programs both here and abroad. In recent years, the College has become recognized as a national leader for its efforts to reinvent a liberal arts education for the 21st century. With a challenging liberal arts foundation, the College Core Curriculum, at the center of the under-graduate experience, the College emphasizes student inquiry and research, offers unique opportunities for international and pre-professional study, and makes use of the city as a site for learning and service. A liberal arts education thus reconceived is not only personally enriching but also eminently practical in developing the skills and perspectives essential to assume a leadership role in the 21st century. As the new millennium proceeds, the College continues to build on its founders' goal of providing \"Useful Knowledge.\" The history of the College of Arts and Science begins with the founding of the University by a number of prominent New Yorkers, led by Albert Gallatin, a member of Jefferson's cabinet. Unlike other institutions at the time, it was to be nonsectarian and to produce a different sort of elite citizen, not born to privilege but set apart for leadership by talent and effort. To that end, it provided a more practical education, what the 19th century called \"Useful Knowledge.\"14 College Directory COLLEGE DIRECTORY COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYG.

Study of a foreign language 2. The Expository Writing Program3. Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC)4. Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) Though structured and integrated, the Core Curriculum affords students flexibility in a number of ways. It permits the choice of different tracks in each component, the satisfaction of some courses by examination or Advanced Placement (or equivalent international) credit (foreign language, FSI), and the substitution of departmental courses (FSI, Societies and the Social Sciences in FCC). Given this flexibility, students work individually with advisers to plan course schedules that take into account their past preparation, current interests, and longer-term goals. While there is no prescribed schedule of courses that will be appropriate for every student, the following broad guidelines should be kept in mind: I ncoming freshmen should complete their Core courses by the end of sophomore year. This will leave them free in their junior and senior years to focus on their major and elective courses. Some science majors, engineering students, prehealth students, and students placed in the International Writing Workshop sequence may need to delay starting, and thus finishing, a component of the Core Curriculum for a semester or more. Students who study away may also need to delay completing their Core courses beyond the sophomore year. S tudents must complete Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1) during their first year. Those placed into the Liberal Studies Writing or International Writing Workshop sequences must begin in their first semester and must register for their remaining writing course(s) in the semester(s) immediately following. I n designing the College Core Curriculum, the faculty sought to ensure that all students would receive a broad exposure to the liberal arts early in their college careers. With this wide academic horizon, the Core Curriculum encourages students to discover new intellectual interests outside their intended areas of specialization and to pursue those interests with elective courses outside their majors in their later undergraduate years.PROGRAMDirector of the College Core Curriculum Associate Professor Ertman Director of the Expository Writing Program Associate Professor Regaignon Director of Foundations of Contemporary Culture Clinical Professor Renzi Director of Foundations of Scientific Inquiry Clinical Professor JordanThe Core Curriculum of the College of Arts and Science provides a foundational academic experience of general education in the liberal arts for undergraduates at NYU. Through a challenging array of courses, the College Core Curriculum heightens cultural awareness, hones critical reading skills, and promotes creative and logical thinking. It also gives students extensive practice writing and speaking English and proficiency in at least one other language. Rather than specifying a fixed canon of knowledge, Core courses focus on modes and methods of humanistic and scientific inquiry. In each case, students are free to pursue particular interests by choosing among a number of courses. Students examine our contemporary culture\u2014its origins and social structures, its modes of expression, and its inherent diversity and evolving patterns of thought. In other classes, they consider the place and importance of modern science\u2014its quantitative and analytical foundations, its processes of reasoning, and its relationship to technology and to our views of the natural world. By helping them to broaden their perspectives, gain new pathways for intellectual inquiry, and develop the skills, background, and social awareness to thrive in dynamic circumstances, the Core Curriculum seeks to prepare students for their later studies and to equip them well for lives as thinking individuals and members of society. www.core.cas.nyu.edu Silver Center 100 Washington Square East, Room 903 New York, NY 10003-6680 212-998-8119The College Core Curriculum18 COLLEGE CORE CURRICULUM COLLEGE CORE CURRICULUM COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYThe study of foreign languages is an integral part of a liberal arts education. It nurtures an awareness of the diversity of human culture and serves the practical need for language skills in fields such as govern-ment, business, and research. New York University is a particularly exciting setting for language study because of its location in a great cosmopolitan city, its international student body, its many renowned language programs and centers, and its numerous opportunities for study away. In addition to the foreign language courses offered for academic credit, the College offers opportunities for students of modern languages to practice their skills in real-world situations outside the classroom. NYU Speaking Freely is a free, noncredit program that allows students to practice their speaking and aural comprehension skills and to explore the linguistically diverse cultures of New York City. For more information about this popular program, con-tact the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 909; 212-998-8140; speakingfreely.cas.nyu.edu. Increasingly, college graduates must be prepared to function in a global society. Apart from the inherent interest of learning about other cultures, many NYU students take the opportunity to study or travel abroad as preparation for their future careers. For more information about study away programs, visit the Office of Global Programs, 110 East 14th Street, New York, NY 10003-4170; 212-998-4433; www.nyu.edu/global/global-academic-centers.html; and consult the study away section of this Bulletin. Requirement To fulfill the foreign language component of the College Core Curriculum, students must demon-strate or attain proficiency in a foreign language through the intermediate level. Ordinarily, this is accomplished by the successful completion of two years of language study in the College, through the second semester of a regular intermediate-level language sequence. Some languages are also taught as intensive courses, allowing students to complete the equivalent of two years of study in a single year. After two years of college language study or the equivalent demonstrated proficiency, students should have gained a broad competence in a language, but true fluency of written or oral expression will not usually have been developed at this point. For this reason, all students are encouraged to continue their language study beyond the intermediate level. In particular, students studying modern languages will find it most beneficial to immerse themselves in the living culture of a language by studying, traveling, or working abroad. Likewise, students of all languages, whether ancient or modern, are encouraged to con-tinue their studies with elective courses in literature at the advanced level. Exemptions Students may fulfill the foreign language component of the College Core Curriculum by presenting outstanding scores on the SAT Subject Test or Advanced Placement Test (or equivalent interna-tional examination) in certain foreign languages, or by passing a CAS or departmental proficiency examination. For further information on lan-guage placement and exemption, see \"placement examinations\" in the academic policies section of this Bulletin. For Advanced Placement Test and international examination equivalencies, consult the chart in the admission section, also in this Bulletin. Students whose secondary schooling was in a language other than English and other than a language offered in the College, or who complete the International Writing Workshop I, II sequence (EXPOS-UA 4, 9), are exempt from the foreign language requirement. Also exempt are students in the dual-degree engineering program. Courses Listed below are courses covering the second semester of the intermediate level of language study. Intensive courses, which allow students to complete the equivalent of two years of study in a single year, are also listed where available. Completion of any of the following courses will fulfill the foreign language requirement. Please consult the individual departmental listings for information on prerequisite courses.

Thanks to an exchange arrangement with Columbia University, students may also enroll in the following languages, offered through the intermediate level and given at Columbia: Armenian, Bengali, Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian, Catalan, Czech (Elementary I and II are offered in the College; intermediate-level courses are offered at Columbia), Dutch, Finnish, Hungarian, Indonesian, Ottoman T urkish, Polish,, Punjabi, Romanian, Sanskrit, Swahili, Swedish, Tamil, Modern Tibetan, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Wolof, Yoruba (Elementary I and II are offered in the College; intermediate-level courses are offered at Columbia), and Zulu. For information about these courses, visit the Office of Academic Affairs, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 908; 212-998-8110. Not every language is offered at Columbia every semester. EXPOSITORY WRITINGThe practice of including writing in the Core Curriculum reflects NYU's longstanding commitment to the centrality of written inquiry to undergraduate education. Expository writing courses at NYU teach students to move from answering teachers' question to identifying and responding to questions and problems that they themselves identify. To this end, students learn to use writing as a flexible tool for exploring ideas, taking intellectual and creative risks, analyzing data (sources, text, visual material, and empirical data), making and rethinking observations, and investigating questions and curiosities. Students also learn to think of writing as a process of consciously crafting a text that purposefully communicates an idea, finding, result, insight, or interpretation to a specific imagined audience. Most students fulfill the expository writing component of the Core through completion of Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1). Subject to proficiency recommendations, some international students may be placed in the two-semester sequence International Writing Workshop I and II (EXPOS-UA 4 and 9). A number of advanced elective courses are also available. For a complete description of the program and its course offerings, see the Expository Writing Program section of this Bulletin.20 COLLEGE CORE CURRICULUM COLLEGE CORE CURRICULUM COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYThe Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) sequence of the College Core Curriculum is a series of four coordinated courses in the humanities and social sciences. Within each of the four offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes. Overall, the structure of the FCC ensures that every student in the College gains a common core of skills and experiences in the liberal arts. In addition to the information on the FCC sequence provided in this Bulletin, detailed descriptions of each year's course offerings may be found on the Core Curriculum website. Texts and Ideas Texts and Ideas introduces students to the ideals of liberal education and the central role of humanistic study in the liberal arts and fosters appreciation of the importance of humanistic learning for society at large. Students become acquainted with some of the literary and philosophical works that have been most influential in shaping the contemporary world and with significant instances in which the ideas in these works have been debated, developed, appropriated, or rejected. Texts and Ideas is not a survey but, rather, an examination of how texts influence subsequent thinking, create traditions, and reflect societal ideals. Texts and Ideas thus aims to provide a richer understanding of how cultures are constructed, modified, and represented. Cultures and Contexts Cultures and Contexts prepares students for life in a globalized world by introducing them to the ways in which humans come to understand themselves as members of social, religious, national, and regional collectives and by fostering their appreciation of the dynamics of cultural interaction and influence. Individual sections focus on specific social or cultural groups different from the dominant traditions of contemporary North America. They share a common concern to examine the ways cultures have interacted, for example, through trade, colonization, immigration, religious dispersion, and media representation; how such groups define themselves against internal and external difference; and how the dominant perspective of Western modernity affects comprehension of the ways in which people outside that position understand, experience, and imagine their lives. Offerings include emergent traditions, diaspora formations, and societies understood as nationally, geographically, or culturally distinct from the domi-nant traditions of contemporary North America. Courses focusing on ancient civilizations are also included, as are courses that address contemporary challenges to traditional European conceptions of national identity. Societies and the Social Sciences Over the past several centuries, enormous social transformations have taken place around the world. To understand the complexity of these phenomena, new methods have been developed to study societal structures and human behavior. Each of the courses under Societies and the Social Sciences begins from a particular disciplinary approach, social concern, or topic, in order to orient students to the characteristic methods of these social sciences. Students learn how issues are objectified for study, how data are collected and analyzed, and how new understanding is thereby achieved. Whether through an interdis-ciplinary approach, consideration of their historical development, or reflection on critical and positivistic debates, the courses help students both to appreciate the unique insights afforded by these methods and to recognize the limits of such inquiry. In this way, students move beyond the particular focus of the class to a broader understanding of methods and problems in the social sciences generally. Expressive Culture In Expressive Culture, students explore the complexities of artistic expression in various media: sounds, images, words, performance, or film. Each course introduces requisite historical, formal, and critical vocabularies; examines fundamental issues associated with interpretation of the arts making use of these media; and investigates the complex relations between artistic activity and other facets of social organization. The courses also make use, whenever possible, of the rich cultural resources of New York City. FOUNDATIONS OF CONTEMPORARY CULTURE21 COLLEGE CORE CURRICULUM COLLEGE CORE CURRICULUM COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYThe Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) component of the College Core Curriculum is a series of three coordinated courses in quantitative reasoning and the natural sciences. Together, these courses ensure that every student in the College gains a fundamental understanding of how mathematics and laboratory experimentation advance scientific investigation. While some students acquire this background through course work offered in the science majors and the prehealth track, FSI courses are especially designed to meet the needs of nonscience students. Within each of the three offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes. In addition to the information on the FSI provided in this Bulletin, detailed descriptions of each year's course offerings may be found on the Core Curriculum website. Quantitative Reasoning Students in Quantitative Reasoning engage mathematical concepts in a variety of contexts in the natural or social sciences. All courses include a substantial amount of problem solving that requires both conceptual and computational work. Physical Science (Formerly Natural Science I.) Scientific knowledge has its basis in our natural curiosity about the world around us and our place in it. These courses approach the physical sciences with the intent of asking and trying to answer interesting questions, dealing with topics ranging from the origin of our universe and planet to how human activity affects our environment. Students consider the important roles played by laws of physics and chemistry in biology, earth and environmental sciences, astro-physics, and cosmology; they also develop an understanding of how the physical sciences inform the natural sciences generally. Mathematics is introduced in each course with frequent applica-tions to the subject matter. Predictions that can be made only with the use of mathematics are clearly delineated, showing the powerful role it plays in our understanding of the universe. Wherever possible, the courses relate science to societal problems and develop a historical perspective. Life Science (Formerly Natural Science II.) The complexity of the biological realm continues to fascinate and challenge modern scientists, who are currently engaged in such diverse pursuits as exploring the organization and function of the brain, reconstructing the origin of the human species, linking the multiplicity of interactions in ecosystems, and deciphering the influence of heredity on complex traits. The courses in Life Science take a nontraditional approach to the life sciences, with an emphasis on approaching science as a dynamic process of investigation and discovery. Each course selects a broad theme that is at the forefront of contemporary research, then uses specific questions and examples to introduce students to the methodology of scientific inquiry, the critical evaluation of results, and the mathematical tools used to quantify scientific information. FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY22 CAS SEMINARS COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYwww.cas.nyu.edu/page/ug.honorsprograms Silver Center 100 Washington Square East, Room 908, New York, NY 10003-6688 Phone: 212-998-8110 Director of College Honors Programs Professor Suzuki (Neural Science) Freshman Seminars The freshman seminars (FS), required of all entering CAS freshmen (and open only to them), aim to put first-year students into contact with leading thinkers (both distinguished faculty members and eminent visitors), to introduce them to important subjects, to challenge them intellectually through rigorous standards of analysis and oral and written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct their own research. To that end, the freshman seminars stress demanding readings and writing assignments that introduce students to an essential research skill\u2014such as a literature review, quantitative reasoning, critical use of primary sources, the identification of a research problem, critical analysis of texts, or confrontations with works of art. In addition to participating actively in class discussions, students are often expected to give oral presentations in class. A final paper will typically, though not always, have gone through one or more revisions, perhaps revised with the benefit of in-class comments. In other freshman seminars, the focus may be on individual or group projects. Any CAS student who does not complete this graduation requirement as a freshman is still responsible for it, and must either (1) take an advanced honors seminar upon completion of at least 32 credits at NYU (see below) or (2) choose a reading- and writing-intensive course in any CAS department (ideally a small class designated as a seminar; it cannot be a course in the College Core Curriculum or in one's major or minor). Either way, the student must file a petition with the Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards requesting the substitution; petition forms are available at cas.nyu.edu/page/petitions or in the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140. Advanced Honors Seminars The advanced honors seminar (AHS) program extends the principles and approach of the freshman seminars to upper-level courses. These courses aim to put undergraduates into contact with leading thinkers (drawn not only from the College's faculty but also from NYU's professional schools and from among New York's professional, cultural, and governmental leaders), to introduce them to important subjects, to challenge them intellectually through demanding standards of analysis and oral and written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct their own research (for example, a Dean's Undergraduate Research Fund grant or a senior honors thesis). In some instances, students may count an advanced honors seminar toward their major or minor, if the department considers this appropriate; in other cases, these seminars count as electives. Sophomores and juniors typically have priority in registering for advanced honors seminars; seniors may register if space permits. Students must have completed at least 32 credits at NYU to register for an AHS.College of Arts and Science Seminars The College of Arts and Science is one of the most diverse communities anywhere\u2014an exciting, sophisticated center in one of the most dynamic and cosmopolitan cities in the world. Our mission is to prepare students to be thought leaders and successful global citizens. We do this by creating unique academic opportunities for student and faculty engagement that emphasize research and scholarly communication. The College's freshman seminars (required of all first-year students) and advanced honors seminars (electives for sophomores, juniors, and\u2014if space permits\u2014seniors) place students in small classes with first-rate instructors to study topics that have the potential to change how we think and how we work. As such, they are ideal gateways for the intellectually stimulating discussions we aim to foster. They challenge students and faculty to engage intensively within and beyond their fields of study, and they inspire intellectual responsibility toward the scholarly community and the wider world. PROGRAM23 CAS SEMINARS COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYCOLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE SEMINARS This is a sampling of recent seminars in the program. Except where noted, the seminars do not assume any specific course or background on the student's part. Language and Reality in 20th-Century Science and Literature FRSEM-UA 210 Ulfers. 4 points. Posits a common ground between the two cultures of science and the humanities and proposes a correlation between postclassical science (e.g., quantum theory) and \"postmodern\" literature and philosophy. Examines Heisenberg's \"uncertainty principle\" and the \"undecidability\" of deconstruc-tive theory. The discussion of these notions and their implications in literary works focuses on their effect on classical logic, the referential function of language, and the traditional goal of a complete explanation/description of reality. Literary Theory and Its Applications FRSEM-UA 355 Maynard. 4 points. Students read a selection of critical essays, mainly from the latter half of the 20th century, to learn to consider different approaches to literature. Their final project discusses a work of literature using one or more of the conceptual approaches they have studied. Emphasis is placed on learning how to analyze theoretical problems and improvise in applying them to new situations. Recommended for students interested in any area of the humanities. The Writer in New York FRSEM-UA 367 Passaro. 4 points. We approach the city as a kind of super-literary event, a vivid aesthetic and social organism that enlarges and tunes the artistic imagination and the writer's crucial powers of observation. We read primary sources and secondary commentary to examine how a number of writers have negotiated\u2014and how the city has powerfully influenced\u2014the fragile construction of their literary art and their personal identities. Readings from Whitman to James, from Crane to Millay to Fitzgerald, from the Beats to the Downtown writers to recent web postings. Welcome to College: The Novel FRSEM-UA 371 Sternhell. 4 points. Starting college can be exhilarating\u2014and terrifying. A chance for intellectual enlightenment\u2014or intense loneliness. We read a selection of college novels from different historical periods, ranging from F . Scott Fitzgerald's This Side of Paradise to Tom Wolfe's I Am Charlotte Simmons. We discuss these novels from a variety of perspectives: literary, historical, and journalistic. In addition to presenting reports on the readings, students write about their own experiences as first-year students at NYU in several genres, including fiction and nonfiction. The Doctor's Dilemma: Being Both Correct and Right FRSEM-UA 379 Makover. 4 points. Dr. Saul Farber, former Dean of the NYU School of Medicine, frequently cautioned that an action or a conclusion might be correct, but would it be right? Ethics, laws, and religious and cultural beliefs intersect in every medical encounter and healthcare issue and affect patients' options and care. Topics: Should doctors help terminal patients die to relieve intractable suffering? Should doctors participate in executions or in the interrogation of terrorists? How much do we want to know about our genetic makeup? Who should pay for your healthcare? Students submit weekly essays and a long final paper. America's Role in International Affairs since World War II FRSEM-UA 405 Sitrick. 4 points. Begins with George F . Kennan's classic book American Diplomacy, 1900-1950. Topics include the creation of the UN during the late 1940s and some of its more recent activities; the activities of the CIA; the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962; American FRESHMAN SEMINARSGeneral Information Freshman and advanced honors seminars are offered in both the fall and spring terms, although most FS offerings are in the fall and most AHS offerings are in the spring. Seminars are capped at 16 to 18 students. The students from two freshman seminars are grouped together into an advising \"cohort\" of 32 to 36 students, who meet as a group with their CAS adviser several times during the freshman year. The selection of seminars changes from year to year. Students may find the most up-to-date offerings and descriptions at cas.nyu.edu/page/honorsprograms.24 CAS SEMINARS COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYCOLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE SEMINARS involvement in Vietnam in the 1960s and early 1970s; America's long involvement in the Middle East (including recent wars and the current relationship with Iran); the imperial presidency (comparing Arthur Schlesinger Jr.'s 1973 book on the subject with the actions of the Bush 43 administration); and the foreign policy challenges of the Obama administration. Branding: People, Places, Things FRSEM-UA 422 Lewis. 4 points. Brands can be magical, prosaic, living, or dead. And while companies manicure them it's up to us, the audience, to determine if they are successful. They live, breathe, grow, and sometimes (deservedly) die. Brands use a variety of rational and emotional tools to connect with us. Even the brand owners sometimes don't really know what the glue is that cements the relationships with their audiences. We analyze what makes brands tick: how they're created, and how time, technology, distribution, competitors, and consumers force them to change. We examine how branding has impacted politics and presidents. Finally, poses the question: how do we create, change, and live up to our own brands? Wiseguys, Spies, and Private Eyes: Heroes and Villains in American Culture, Film, and Literature FRSEM-UA 449 Friedfeld. 4 points. Explores the ways in which specific American archetypes and themes are perceived and articu-lated\u2014from the rugged Old West individualist, to the persevering underdog who becomes a boxing champ, to the evolving perceptions of government, to the Cold War-era uncertainty that spawned a generation of literary and celluloid superspies. Examines representations of heroes and villains in modern American popular culture and how great films and novels in three particular genres\u2014detec-tive, gangster, spy\u2014influenced our understanding of these archetypes. Features Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe, Mario Puzo's (and Francis Ford Coppola's) The Godfather, James Bond, and Batman. Political Cinema and Representation of the \"Other\" FRSEM-UA 463 Dotan. 4 points. In contemporary war, the \"other\" is viewed not only as an enemy to be fought but, often, as one to be eliminated. How do filmmakers fight against or, alternatively, reinforce such deadly representations? We focus primarily on one of the world's most conflict-ridden regions\u2014the Middle East\u2014but also explore films from Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, France and the United States. Examines how the \"other\" is constructed politically, aesthetically, and ethically. Designed for anyone interested in filmmaking and film criticism and/or in contempo-rary politics and history. What is College For? FRSEM-UA 474 Jordan. 4 points. Why did you decide to attend college? To broaden your intellectual horizons and become open-minded? To gain specialized knowledge in a specific subject? To achieve a financially rewarding career? To satisfy your parents? At the beginning of the twenty-first century, current models and practices of higher education are receiving increased scrutiny. Topics for discussion: Does higher education need to redefine its academic mission? Should everyone attend college? What is the impact of new technologies? How can students, professors, and administrators all contribute to creating a successful college environment? Gender, Sexuality, and the Law FRSEM-UA 480 Fischel. 4 points. In the family, the impact of sex/gender law is felt in marriage, divorce, and family planning. In the workplace, the Civil Rights Act and its progeny have broadened opportunities for women, but not unequivocally. Similarly, Title IX has contained discriminatory practices in education, but courts have checked its substantive reach. Criminal law treats crimes associated with sexuality, rape, domestic abuse, and prostitution in unique and perhaps troubling ways. Finally, in all these spheres, gender identity and sexual orientation have a complicated relationship to sex. Analyzes contemporary doctrinal, judicial, and legislative developments. In Search of Lost Time FRSEM-UA 503 Clements. 4 points. We will read Proust (in translation) as he should be read: hedonistically\u2014with respect and admiration but also with delectation. A prodigious novel of more than 4,000 pages, In Search of Lost Time is still unparalleled in how it combines finesse and wit with raw emotion, self-examination with social history, profound psychological acuity with a dazzling portrait of the French beau monde at the outset of modernity, and how it merges an audacious explosion of literary form with explorations of memory, desire, attachment, deception, lust, jealousy, ambition, and disappointment. We move at a brisk pace through the entire work (reading assignments average 350 pages per week).25 CAS SEMINARS COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYCOLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE SEMINARS Facing Fascism: The Spanish Civil War and U.S. Culture FRSEM-UA 539 Prerequisites: AP credit in Spanish, or in U.S. or world history. Fern\u00e1ndez. 4 points. The West is in the grip of the Great Depression, and liberal democracy is in crisis. On the rise: a spectrum of ideologies ranging from anarchism to fascism. July 1936: a right-wing military coup attempts to overthrow a democratically elected left-wing coalition government, and all eyes turn toward Spain. We conduct research in NYU's Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives (ALBA), a vast collection of materials that chronicles the lives of the 2,800 Americans who, between 1936 and 1939, volun-teered to fight fascism in Spain. We explore the place occupied by Spain and the Spanish Civil War in American culture from the 1930s forward and how journalists, writers, artists, and citizens reacted to the war in Spain. This is a sampling of recent seminars in the program. Except where noted, the seminars do not assume any specific course or background on the student's part. The History of Disbelief AHSEM-UA 113 Stephens. 4 points. Takes up an extended history of atheism and doubt (in the context of a history of religion). Moves from Greece, to the Hebrews and Rome, to India and Baghdad, and then back to Europe during the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the romantic period. Time is spent in England and America in the 19th century, when disbelief was being tied to radical politics, before moving on to the connection between disbe-lief and realism, modernism and postmodernism. Metapatterns from Quarks to Culture AHSEM-UA 154 Identical to ENVST-UA 254; counts toward the major in environmental studies. Volk. 4 points. Metapatterns are structural/functional patterns in systems, which occur across the levels of the universe as it built in a series of steps of \"combigenesis\" (about 12 main-path steps, including the emergence of atoms, simplest cells, animal societies, agriculture, the state). We explore themes such as binaries, borders, centers, alphabetic holarchies, complexity theory, networks, and positive and negative feed-backs. Topics for student projects may include the environment, music, language, biological or cultural evolution, or levels in politics. The NYU Mediation Lab AHSEM-UA 176 Identical to ENGL-UA 252; fulfills the pre-1800 requirement for the English major. Siskin. 4 points. In your other classes this fall, you'll learn what's already in CAS majors. Our goal in this lab is to figure out what's not in them\u2014yet. MIT has its famous Media Lab to ask \"the questions not yet asked-questions whose answers could radically improve the way people live, learn, work, and play.\" At NYU, we go beyond the \"media\" to \"mediations\" of every kind\u2014to every strategy for turning the present into a better future. Narrating Poverty in Brazilian Literature and Film AHSEM-UA 186 Identical to PORT-UA 704. Conducted in English. Peixoto. 4 points. Films include Barren Lives, The Scavengers, The Hour of the Star, Pixote, Bus 174, City of God, Babil\u00f4nia 2000, and Black Orpheus. Topics: the nature of representation and the investments of author and reader in images of deprivation; connections of poverty with violence, stigmatization, and citizen-ship rights; and the ethical responsibilities of the artist, reader, and spectator. Making History: Culture and Politics in the Caribbean AHSEM-UA 204 Identical to SPAN-UA 551 and HIST-UA 760. Fischer. 4 points. Key moments of Caribbean history: \"Discovery;\" slavery and the struggles against it; colonialism and independence movements; U.S. occupations; dictatorships and revolutions; the Caribbean diaspora; and the transformation of the Caribbean islands into so many tourist destinations. Focuses on the Spanish-speaking islands (Cuba, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic) without neglecting the French- and English-speaking Caribbean or questions that concern the Caribbean as a as a whole.

The curriculum comprises interdisciplinary and cross-cultural teaching and research in the histories, cultures, economies, politics, and languages and cultural practices of Africans in Africa, the Americas (North and South), the Caribbean, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East. The program is administered from within the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis, and it maintains close relationships with community programming and research activities at NYU's Institute of African American Affairs and Africa House. Africana studies offers programs leading to B.A., B.A./M.A., and M.A. degrees, as well as a suite of joint M.A. programs with journalism, economics, and museum studies.Director of Africana Studies Associate Professor Blakewww.africanastudies.as.nyu.edu 20 Cooper Square, 4th Floor New York, NY 10003-7112 212-992-9650MAJOR/MINOR IN Africana Studies27 AFRICANA STUDIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYMAJOR/MINOR IN AFRICANA STUDIES Major for 2016-2017 Academic Year and Thereafter (Approved April 2016. Final details pending. Consult online CAS Bulletin 2016-2018 and departmental webpage for updated information. Students who entered CAS before fall 2016 may follow the new version of the major with departmental approval and advisement.) The new Africana studies major requires nine 4-point courses (36 points) completed with a grade of C or better, comprised of: Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA-UA TBD, replacing Concepts in Social and Cultural Analysis, SCA-UA 1); one course in Africana Studies designated as a Field Colloquium; one course in Africana studies designated as a Research Seminar; and six approved electives, four of which must be taught by SCA faculty. One of the following may be substituted for the Field Colloquium requirement: Approaches to Africana Studies (SCA-UA 101; offered periodically), or Cultures and Contexts: Africa (CORE-UA 505; offered every year), or Cultures and Contexts: The African Diaspora (CORE-UA 532; offered every year), or Cultures and Contexts: The Black Atlantic (CORE-UA 534; offered every year) Minor Five 4-point courses (20 points) are required for the minor in Africana studies. Students must take one of the following introductory courses: Approaches to Africana Studies (SCA-UA 101; offered periodically), or Cultures and Contexts: Africa (CORE-UA 505; offered every year), or Cultures and Contexts: The African Diaspora (CORE-UA 532; offered every year), or Cultures and Contexts: The Black Atlantic (CORE-UA 534; offered every year), plus four designated Africana studies elective courses. One Africana language course can count as an elective if taught by SCA faculty. Language and Linguistic Competency The type of rigorous intercultural study promoted within the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis requires students to recognize the complex modes of communication at work both within and across different social groups. Studying the modern incarnation of these languages also reveals the cross-cultural and historical forces that have shaped them. The department therefore strongly encourages its students to develop advanced skills in Swahili, T wi, Yoruba, and/or any of the indigenous languages spoken in Africa, or creole languages (e.g., Haitian Creole) spoken throughout the African Diaspora. This can be achieved by any of the following means: taking elective courses in sociolinguistics; studying these languages beyond the minimum level required by the College of Arts and Science; pursuing community-based internship fieldwork necessitating the development and use of specific language skills; or undertaking study or research away, especially at the NYU Accra site, in contexts entailing the exercise of key language or linguistic capabilities. Honors Program Majors who have completed 48 points of graded work in CAS and have a 3.65 GPA or higher (both overall and in the major) are encouraged to register for Senior Honors Seminar (SCA-UA 92) in the fall semester of their senior year. Upon successful completion of the seminar requirements, students will be eligible to register for Senior Honors Thesis (SCA-UA 93) in the spring.

Approaches to Africana Studies SCA-UA 101 Cultures and Contexts: Africa (CORE-UA 505) or Cultures and Contexts: The African Diaspora (CORE-UA 532) or Cultures and Contexts: The Black Atlantic (CORE-UA 534) can 28 AFRICANA STUDIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYMAJOR/MINOR IN AFRICANA STUDIES substitute for this course. SCA-UA 101 is offered periodically; the Core courses are offered every year. 4 points. Topics may include African retention in the Americas, the comparative study of slavery, the concept of creolization, an understanding of the black Atlantic, and the meaning of diasporic studies, as well as the use of history, sociology, linguistics, anthropology, literature, music, and the arts as ways in which the experiences of black peoples have been documented and transmitted. Research Core Strategies in Social and Cultural Analysis SCA-UA 20 Offered every spring. 4 points. Introduces an array of social scientific research methods, both qualitative and quantitative. Topics range from ethnography to survey research to social statistics. Includes practical, hands-on application of the research methods. Majors must complete by end of junior year. Senior Research Seminar SCA-UA 90 Prerequisites: Concepts in Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA-UA 1); either Approaches to Africana Studies (SCA-UA 101), or Cultures and Contexts: Africa (CORE-UA 505), or Cultures and Contexts: The African Diaspora (CORE-UA 532), or Cultures and Contexts: The Black Atlantic (CORE- UA 534); and Strategies in Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA-UA 20).

Offered every spring. 4 points. Internship Program The 4-point internship program complements and enhances the formal course work of the Africana studies major. Students intern at agencies dealing with a range of issues pertaining to Africana studies and take a corequisite seminar that enables them to focus the work experience in meaningful academic terms. The goals of the internship are threefold: (1) to allow students to apply the theory they have gained through course work, (2) to provide students with analytical tools, and (3) to assist students in exploring professional career paths. The internship is open to juniors and seniors and requires an interview and permission of the director of internships. Internship Fieldwork SCA-UA 40 Corequisite: Internship Seminar (SCA-UA 42). T en hours of fieldwork are required. Offered every spring. 2 points. Internship Seminar SCA-UA 42 Corequisite: Internship Fieldwork (SCA-UA 40). 2 points. Elective Courses Black Urban Studies SCA-UA 115 Identical to HIST-UA 90. 4 points.Introduces students to the tools of cultural criticism and theory, with particular emphasis on black culture, urban environment, and black people's relationships to a variety of social and cultural institutions and practices. The latter may include the mass media, class and poverty, the police, urban development, education, music, art, and sports. The Black Body and the Lens SCA-UA 155 4 points. Explores the range of ideas and methods used by crit-ical thinkers in addressing the body in photography, video, music, and film. Considers the construction of beauty, gendered images, race, and hip-hop culture. The historical gaze and the interplay between the historical and the contemporary, between self-presen-tation and imposed representation, are fundamental to our discussions. Final projects include an imaging project and/or a written essay.29 AFRICANA STUDIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYMAJOR/MINOR IN AFRICANA STUDIES Black Feminism SCA-UA 156 4 points. Explores the production and practice of black feminist theory in 20th-century America. We examine the written work and the activism of African American women and look at the way that theory and practice historically intersect around questions of race and gender. We also interrogate power and think about the ways in which systems of oppression both produce and block a black feminist consciousness. Hip Hop and Politics SCA-UA 157 4 points. Besides realizing the worst fears of a previous generation who placed its hopes in the aspirations of 60s-era social movements, this new generation's fashion sensibilities, technological savvy, and strategies for commodifying blackness suggest a demographic now more concerned with the economics of globalization than the political economy of race. We interrogate the specific generational tensions that structure popular and intellectual discourses concerning the \"hip-hop generation\" and the perceived demise of contempo-rary black politics. Race and Reproduction SCA-UA 158 4 points. Examines the connections between gender, racial ideology, and history of medicine to consider the range of ways that reproduction\u2014medically, culturally, and experientially\u2014produces and troubles racial ideology. Cross-cultural breadth will help us to consider the relationship between biological experi-ences (which are often portrayed as universal) and socio-cultural context. We locate biology within a wider set of issues around social reproduction and the practices of motherhood, and both illuminate and problematize the connections between technologies and politics of biology and difference. Language and Liberation: At Home in the Caribbean and Abroad SCA-UA 163 Identical to LING-UA 26. 4 points. Explores the linguistic and cultural transformations that took place in the Commonwealth Caribbean from 17th-century slavery and bond servitude to the present day. Examines how Caribbean people were given or demanded the freedom to create and maintain a postcolonial Caribbean identity. Discusses the sociohistorical conditions that led to the creation of new Caribbean languages called \"pidgins\" and \"creoles\" as the English language was transplanted from Britain to the Third World.The Postcolonial City SCA-UA 166 4 points. Uses ethnographic, sociological, historical, and literary texts to theorize the Afrodiasporic city and urban experience. Explores the contours of these urban matrices through special attention to histori-cal categories that prepare us to theorize the way Afrodiasporic populations have experienced and lived history (e.g., the precolonial, the colonial, and the postcolonial). Considers the historical emergence of the Third World as not simply a broad rubric for African and Asian postcolonies, but instead, a project to reverse the course of European exploitation. T opics in Africana Studies SCA-UA 180 4 points. Explores specific issues dealing with the black urban experience, focusing on social and cultural institu-tions. Possible themes, which vary from semester to semester, include class and poverty, the police, urban development, education, sports, music, and art. T opics in Pan-Africanism SCA-UA 181 4 points. Possible themes, which vary from semester to semester, include African unity, black rebellion, colonialism and racism, the African diaspora and culture, and relationships between Pan-Africanism and movements such as nationalism, Marxism, and Afrocentricity. Independent Study SCA-UA 197, 198 Prerequisite: permission of the program director. Offered every semester. 1 to 4 points per term. Language Courses Elementary Swahili I SCA-UA 121 4 points. Provides students with an elementary understanding of Swahili, a Bantu language with a rich oral and written tradition that is spoken by about 100 million people from Somalia to Mozambique and Zanzibar. After a short presentation of Swahili's history, codification, and relation to other languages, students are drilled in phonetics and grammar. They are also introduced to poems, songs, and oral narratives. Elementary Swahili II SCA-UA 122 Prerequisite: Elementary Swahili I (SCA-UA 121) or permission of the instructor. 4 points. Expands on the basic knowledge of the pronunciation, vocabulary, useful expressions, and fundamental grammatical features acquired in Swahili I. Allows essential communication skills to develop into MAJOR/MINOR IN AFRICANA STUDIES 30 AFRICANA STUDIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYconversational ability using simple and familiar situations. Students expand their understanding of grammatical concepts associated with this agglutina-tive language. Intermediate Swahili I SCA-UA 123 Prerequisite: Elementary Swahili II (SCA-UA 122) or permission of the instructor. 4 points. Builds on the basic knowledge of pronunciation, vocabulary, useful expressions, and fundamental grammatical features attained at the introductory level. Aims to strengthen reading, writing, and conversation skills by accessing a wide range of grammatical and literary knowledge of the language, its cultural context, and literary genre. Students read a novel and a play written in Kiswahili. Intermediate Swahili II SCA-UA 124 Prerequisite: Intermediate Swahili I (SCA-UA 123) or permission of the instructor. Offered every year. 4 points. Aims to enable students to communicate entirely in Kiswahili, to carry out bidirectional translation from Swahili to English and from English to Swahili, and to negotiate technical language. At this level, students master the intricacies of Kiswahili grammar; acquire a wide range of Kiswahili fluently; understand Kiswahili poetry, idioms, and proverbs; and use idiomatic Kiswahili in creative writing and translation.

The adviser for the minor is responsible for ensuring that each student's program of study remains coherent and logical, although there is considerable flexibility within the bounds of the requirements. Courses may be selected that deal with different periods and methodological approaches, as well as a variety of geographical areas that the requirements demand. Each student's course of study is designed on an individual basis, in accordance with his or her needs and interests. A number of CAS departments and programs, as well as institutes and centers, are directly involved in this program: anthropology, art history, classics, comparative literature, East Asian studies, English, Hebrew and Judaic studies, history, Irish studies, linguistics, Middle Eastern and Islamic studies, and the Alexander S. Onassis Program in Hellenic Studies. The minor consists of five 4-point courses, which are normally selected from the appropriate offerings of these departments and programs. All five of the courses selected must be offered by departments other than the student's major department, and no more than two may be taken in any one department. Students are furthermore expected to examine at least three different civilizations or cultures in completing this minor. Language courses may not be used to fulfill the requirements of this minor. If desired, students who choose this minor may complete, as a capstone experience, an independent study course, which is normally the fifth course taken for the minor. The adviser for the ancient studies minor may assist students in designing a project and in finding an appropriate faculty member to direct this independent study.Adviser Clinical Associate Professor Roth (Art History/Hebrew and Judaic Studies)PROGRAM IN Ancient Studies39 ANIMAL STUDIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYMinor To complete a minor in animal studies, students must receive a grade of C (2.0) or better in four of the following 4-point courses (16 points): Animals and S Animal M inds (ANST-UA 410) F ood, Animals, and the Environment (ANST-UA 440/ENVST-UA 440) Animals and P ublic Policy (ANST-UA 500/ENVST-UA 630) T opics in Animal Studies (ANST-UA 600) P rimate Behavioral Ecology (ANTH-UA 54) Comparativ e Biology of Living Primates (ANTH-UA 56) P rehistoric Art and Symbolic Evolution (ANTH-UA 212) T exts and Ideas: Topics\u2014Animal Humans or Of Beasts and Books (CORE-UA 400) T opics in Performance Studies: Animal Rites (DRLIT-UA 301) I ntroduction to Marine Ecology and Conservation (ENVST-UA 323) Animals, P eople, and Those in Between (ITPG-UT 2746) To declare a minor in animal studies, contact the adviser for animal studies at animal.studies.advising@nyu.edu.PROGRAMFACULTYCollegiate Professor; Professor of English And Drama Chaudhuri Professor Jamieson (Environmental Studies/ Philosophy/Law)Associate Professor Jerolmack (Sociology/Environmental Studies) Professor Jacquet (Environmental Studies)Clinical Associate Professor Schlottmann (Environmental Studies/Bioethics)The Animal Studies Initiative (ASI) offers NYU undergraduate students the opportunity to graduate with a minor in animal studies.

Sociocultural anthropology is interdisciplinary in orientation, analyzing and synthesizing religious, artistic, economic, and political practices through the common medium of culture. T raditionally, cultural anthropology emphasized the study of small-scale societies in non-Western settings. Contemporary sociocultural anthropology maintains such interests but increasingly applies its insights and methods to urban and industrialized societies and attends more closely to the production of culture. An emphasis of the department is the ethnographic study of cultural, social, and political processes that shape our lives and those of other people, especially as we are drawn together and influence one another in increasingly transnational and global interactions.Professors Emeriti Jolly, Rosaldo David B. Kriser Professor of Anthropology GinsburgSilver Professors; Professors of Anthropology Harrison, Merry, Myers Professors Ant\u00f3n, D\u00e1vila, Disotell, Gilsenan, Crabtree, Ganti, Khan, Rogers, Zito Professors Anderson, Das, Hansen, Higham, Oliphant, Stout, Williams PROGRAMFACULTYChair of the Department Professor Harrison Associate Chair of the Department Professor RappDirector of Undergraduate Studies Associate Professor KhanThe Department of Anthropology is one of the country's leading graduate and undergraduate centers for cultural anthropology, archaeology, linguistic anthropology, and biological anthropology\u2014the four principal subfields studied in the undergraduate curriculum. The department considers its greatest assets to be the various individual areas of faculty expertise: archaeological specialties such as medieval archaeology and European, Near Eastern, and South Asian prehistory; biological anthropology areas such as molecular primatology, primate behavioral ecology, and paleoanthropology; linguistic anthropology foci such as discourse analysis and language socialization; and sociocultural anthropology specialties such as the ethnography of North America, Africa, India, China, the Near and Middle East, the Caribbean, Latin America, Europe, Australia, and the South Pacific. Major theoretical emphasis is on the systems of thought and symbolic representation of the self and society; the relation between female and male domains of interaction; changing patterns of social organization and hierarchy within small-scale societies, urban settings, and bureaucratic institutions; medical anthropology; evolutionary approaches to the study of primate and human origins; religion; art; science studies; race and ethnicity; and the problem of ethno-graphic representation in film and other media. Departmental resources include an extensive film and video collection as well as teaching and research labs for archaeology, linguistic anthropology, and biological anthropology, which can be used for research by advanced undergraduates. A departmental colloquium series and an undergraduate student association welcome undergraduate participation. The department participates in the University's Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, the Center for Religion and Media, the Center for the Study of Human Origins, the Institute for Study of the Ancient World, the Program in Museum Studies, and the Center for Media, Culture, and History. Formal and informal cooperative arrangements with museums, zoos, and other academic institutions in the greater New York area place at students' disposal a group of anthropological scholars, materials, and resources unparalleled in the country.42 DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY ANTHROPOLOGY COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYLinguistic anthropology focuses on how language is interpreted and used in cultural contexts. Language use is socially organized, and it is a key to understanding the ways in which speakers create and change social realities. Studied within historical as well as cultural frameworks and in relation to other social institutions (e.g., politics, education, law, medicine), variation in ways of speaking language(s) adds to our understanding of how social categories such as ethnicity, race, and gender are interactionally constituted across contexts, cultures, and societies. Archaeological anthropology uses artifacts and other material remains to understand human culture. It attempts to breathe life into a material record that at first glance appears static and fragmentary. The research interests of anthropological archaeologists range from the earliest production of durable tools 3.3 million years ago to the refuse currently being generated by modern cities. All aspects of past human existence, including art, technology, religion, gender, economic and social organization, and food-getting strategies, are addressed by researchers in anthropological archaeology. Biological anthropology encompasses the study of human and nonhuman primate biological diversity and includes the anatomy, genetics, behavior, ecology, and evolution of humans and other primates. It is linked to the other subfields of anthropology by its commitment to the study of human biology, behavior, and evolution within the context of culture, society, and ecology. Close ties with the American Museum of Natural History and the Wildlife Conservation Society at the Bronx Zoo facilitate the department's diverse research interests in biological anthropology. Departmental Objectives Anthropology courses contribute to undergraduate education in two ways. First, the scope of the discipline's interests bridges the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural sciences. Anthropology asks basic questions concerning the origins and development of humans and their cultures and divergent systems of thought, belief, and social order. By systematically analyzing various cultural traditions\u2014contemporary as well as historically known\u2014anthropology raises critical questions concerning the foundations of world civilizations. An under-standing of the distinctive way anthropology formulates and attempts to answer its basic questions is a necessary component of a comprehensive liberal arts education. Second, the department offers concentrated programs of study for the minor, major, or honors student. A minor usually emphasizes one of the four subdisciplines, although students are free to select courses from across the sub-fields. For the major, the department encourages study in all of the subdisciplines, because each supplements and complements the others in presenting humans as both biological and social beings. The honors program includes in-depth research and writing in an aspect of sociocultural, linguistic, archaeological, or biological anthropology, as well as the pursuit of additional advanced course work at the senior undergraduate and graduate level. The director of undergraduate studies (DUS) works closely with anthropology majors and minors in designing programs of study that integrate their individual goals with the offerings and intellectual goals of the department and complementary disciplines. Majors should meet with the DUS at least once per semester, typically just prior to registration for the next semester, to discuss their progress through the program, decide on future course work, and discuss post-graduation plans. The department prides itself on its graduate and undergraduate programs' integrated nature, which enables major, minor, and honors students to participate in a variety of challenging graduate courses and seminars. Additionally, an active Anthropology Undergraduate Student Association (AUSA) connects students to one another through special events and an e-mail forum. Major in Anthropology The major in anthropology consists of nine 4-point courses (36 points), which include the following four required courses (16 points): H uman Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) H uman Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) Ar chaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3) Anthr opology of Language (ANTH-UA 17; offered only in the spring semester)43 DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY ANTHROPOLOGY COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYThe remaining elective courses for the major (five courses/20 points) may be selected from any subfield of anthropology. Students must take at least five courses from the Department of Anthropology at New York University in order to receive a major in anthropology from NYU, and a grade of C or better is required in every course to be counted toward the major. Students are not required to focus on any one of the subfields of anthropology represented in the department, but rather are free to choose elective courses that accommodate their interests as narrowly or broadly as they see fit, in consultation with the DUS. Internships approved by the DUS are encouraged, but internship credits may not be applied toward the major. Independent study courses, conducted under the supervision of a departmental faculty member, are also encouraged and can be applied toward the major, up to a limit of 8 credits. Majors should consult regularly with the DUS in order to take full advantage of the seminars and research opportunities open to them. Joint Majors with Classical Civilization and Linguistics In collaboration with the Department of Classics and the Department of Linguistics, the Department of Anthropology also offers two joint majors. Joint majors consist of 20 points (five 4-point courses) in anthropology and 20 points in the joint department. A grade of at least C is required in every course to be counted toward the joint major. Joint majors should consult regularly with the DUS in anthropology and the DUS in the joint department in order to take full advantage of the seminars and research opportunities open to them. Joint major with the Department of Classics: The joint major in anthropology and classical civilization emphasizes the importance of anthropological approaches to understanding the social orders and institutions of the classical world. One anthropology course, Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1), is required, along with four other anthropology electives chosen in consultation with the DUS of each department. T wenty points are required in classics. See classics section in this Bulletin for additional information. Joint anthropology-classics majors should also consult with Professor Rita Wright in the Department of Anthropology and the DUS in the Department of Classics for aid in developing their program of study. Joint major with the Department of Linguistics: The joint major in anthropology and linguistics emphasizes the complementary nature of anthropological and sociolinguistic approaches to language. Students are required to take five 4-point courses (20 points) each from the Department of Anthropology and the Department of Linguistics, and a grade of at least C is required in every course to be counted toward the joint major. R equired courses in anthropology are Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1), Anthropology of Language (ANTH-UA 17), either Cultural Symbols (ANTH-UA 48) or Language, Power, and Identity (ANTH-UA 16), and two other cultural or linguistic anthropology courses approved by the Department of Anthropology's DUS. R equired courses in linguistics are Language (LING-UA 1), Language and Society (LING-UA 15), and at least two of the following: Bilingualism (LING-UA 18); Language, Literacy, and Society (LING-UA 20); Gender, and Language (LING-UA 21); African American Vernacular English: Language and Culture (LING-UA 23); Language and Liberation at Home in the Caribbean and Abroad (LING-UA 26); and Language in Latin America (LING-UA 30). The fifth course in linguistics may be an additional course from the above list or another course that the department offers, chosen in consultation with the DUS in the Department of Linguistics. See linguistics section in this Bulletin for additional information. Joint anthropology-linguistics majors should also consult with Professor Bambi Schieffelin in the Department of Anthropology and the DUS in the Department of Linguistics for aid in developing their program of study. Global Public Health/Anthropology Major The College of Arts and Science (CAS) and the Department of Anthropology offer students the opportunity to pursue a major that combines anthropology and global public health. Students pursuing this combined program will complete core and elective courses in both areas. The major provides interdisciplinary training that embraces the natural convergence of society, culture and health, and draws on the Department of Anthropology's strength in bridging the social sciences, natural sciences, and humanities. A major in global public health/anthropology prepares students to analyze various DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY 44 ANTHROPOLOGY COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYcultural traditions through the lens of health; to examine complex relationships within economic, political, cultural, physical, and biological environments; and to apply anthropological approaches to public health problems. The major is designed to prepare students for multidisciplinary careers in a variety of settings and/or for advanced academic training in public health, anthropology, or other related fields. Students in this combined major must talk to the DUS or departmental liaison with GPH in the Department of Anthropology to work out a course plan. The following are the fifteen courses (60 points) required for the major: Global public health requirements (seven courses/28 points): H ealth and Society in a Global Context (UGPH-GU 10) B iostatistics (UGPH-GU 20) E pidemiology (UGPH-GU 30) H ealth Policy in a Global World (UGPH-GU 40) E nvironmental Health in a Global World (UGPH-GU 50) GP H Internship (UGPH-GU 60) O ne semester of advanced foreign language (above intermediate II level). Students who present AP or other advanced standing credit that is equivalent to completion of at least one course above intermediate two have satisfied the requirement. Students who take an NYU language placement exam and demonstrate proficiency equivalent to completion of at least one course above the intermediate two level (i.e., they at least place into the second course above intermediate two) have also met this requirement. O ne semester of study away Anthropology core courses (three courses/12 points): H uman Society and Culture (ANTH-UA Anthropology (ANTH-UA 35) G lobal Biocultures (ANTH-UA 320) Anthropology elective courses (three courses/12 points), chosen from: H uman Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) H ealth and Disease in Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 55) E merging Diseases (ANTH-UA 80) H uman Ecology (ANTH-UA 90) Anthr opology of Gender and Sexuality (ANTH-UA 112) Race, D ifference, and Social Inequality (ANTH-UA 323) I ntroduction to Forensic Anthropology (ANTH-UA 326) H uman Rights and Culture (ANTH-UA 331) C ulture through Food (ANTH-UA 410) Major electives (two courses/8 points): T wo additional electives must be completed in the GPH program or anthropology, by advisement. For descriptions of GPH (UGPH-GU) courses, and for all policies applying to the major (including those for transfer students), please see the global public health section of this Bulletin. Minor in Anthropology The minor in anthropology consists of 16 points (any four 4-point courses) in the department. The \"principles\" courses Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1), Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2), and Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3) are recommended as overviews of the discipline and as prerequisites for more advanced courses. Minors consult with the DUS to design a program that best accommodates their interests. A grade of C or better is required in every course to be counted toward the minor. Students must take at least two courses from the Department of Anthropology at New York University in order to receive a minor in anthropology from NYU. Internship credits cannot be counted toward the minor, but independent study credits (no more than 4) are acceptable. 45 DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY ANTHROPOLOGY COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYHonors Program A degree in anthropology is awarded with honors to selected anthropology majors who apply for admission to the program through the DUS during their junior year. Honors program candidates are expected to meet all the requirements for the program and to maintain an overall grade point average of 3.65 and an average of 3.65 in the major. Candidates for the honors program must complete a total of ten 4-point courses (40 points) in anthropology, including the two-semester research/thesis writing sequence, Honors Research I (ANTH-UA 950) and Honors Research II (ANTH-UA 951) taken in the senior year, plus at least one graduate course, typically taken in the junior or senior year. All of these courses count toward the major. In the spring semester of the junior year, students will secure a faculty supervisor for their honors thesis. (In January of the senior year, the student will choose a second faculty reader in consultation with the thesis supervisor). In the fall semester of the senior year, all thesis writers from across departmental subdisciplines enroll in Honors Research I (ANTH-UA 950), a seminar course in which research methods are taught and indi-vidualized to fit each student's topic\u2014e.g., assembling a bibliography; constructing hypotheses; using secondary, primary, and occasionally original sources to generate data; and analyzing data. In the spring semester, all thesis writers enroll in Honors Research II (ANTH-UA 951), a seminar course in which students share their develop-ing theses with the group. Honors candidates are strongly encouraged to formally present posters/papers at the Dean's Undergraduate Research Conference and within the department. Feedback will be offered at different stages by both faculty and student peers in the seminar. In both semesters, it is the responsibility of the thesis writer to consult with his or her departmental faculty mentor who is supervising the honors project and who will serve as the primary thesis reader. Independent Study Students must obtain permission from the director of undergraduate studies to register for the independent study courses ANTH-UA 997 or 998 (2 or 4 points per term; 6 or 8 points may be appropriate in exceptional cases). Independent study is an opportunity for students to work closely with a faculty advisor on a project related to their area of study. Students must choose a member of the faculty in their area of study with whom they have taken at least one anthropology course. After securing approval from a faculty member in writing, the student should see the director of undergraduate studies (DUS) in order to register for independent study course. It is imperative that students meet on a regular basis with their faculty advisor throughout the semester in which they are doing the independent study. Upon completion of the independent study, the faculty advisor must present written proof that the student has completed all course work for study to the DUS, along with the student's final grade. Independent study units can be applied towards the major and minor in anthropology and can fulfill one of the student's elective requirements, provided that the student earns a grade of at least C. A maximum of 8 units of independent study can be applied to the 36 units required for the major in Anthropology, and a maximum of 4 units of independent study can be applied to the 16 units required for the minor. Internships Only anthropology majors who have the permission of the director of undergraduate studies may register for the internship courses ANTH-UA 980 or 981 (2 or 4 points per term). Internship credits cannot be applied toward the major. Internships are opportunities for students to gain practical work experience relevant to anthropology and are sponsored by selected institutions, agencies, and research laboratories. Internships are negotiated between the student, the internship sponsor, and a faculty member in anthropology who will supervise the internship. The expected time commitment for internships is 8 hours per week for 4 credits. On the internship form, which is available in the department office, the student will describe the intended internship, indicating how it is relevant to their academic training in anthropology. The statement should also include an outline of the professional and educational duties and responsibilities of the student intern. The student, the department faculty, and the internship site sponsor will each sign the form, which the student will return to the department.46 The student will submit weekly or other periodic reports to her/his anthropology faculty supervisor describing the internship's activities and what she/he has learned. These reports will serve as self-assessments of the professional and educational component of the internship, and will contribute to the student's final grade. At the end of the internship period, the internship site sponsor will provide the anthropology faculty supervisor with a written account of the student's activities, responsibilities, number of hours per week spent on the internship, and a brief report describing and assessing the student intern's work, which will contribute to the student's final grade. The student's final grade will be determined and submitted by the department faculty supervisor.

Students become familiar with global art from antiquity to the present. The department offers courses in ancient, medieval, Renaissance, baroque, modern, contemporary, East Asian, South Asian, Islamic, Latin American, African, Oceanic, Pre-Columbian, and Native American art, treating not only painting, sculpture, architecture, and photography but also graphic media, manus cript illumination, the decorative arts, and aspects of urban design. The department is one of the few undergraduate programs in the country with extensive offerings in conservation and museology. A myriad of museums, galleries, and local architectural sites make New York City the ideal place in which to study the visual arts on site and in the flesh. Beyond New York, art history courses are offered at NYU's study away sites, such as Berlin, Buenos Aires, Florence, London, Madrid, Paris, and Prague. The department offers majors and minors in both art history and urban design and architecture studies. Since an education in the history of art can be enhanced by a firsthand understanding of its making, our majors are encouraged to minor in studio art through the Steinhardt School. The department publishes its own student journal (Ink & Image), and has an honors program which culminates in the writing and oral defense of a senior honors thesis. Art history graduates have proven exceptionally successful in securing positions in museums, commercial galleries, auction houses, and nonprofit organizations. Those who go on to undertake graduate study typically pursue careers as curators, conservators, and academic art historians at the university and college level. Students majoring in urban design and architecture are well prepared for graduate study in architec-ture, urban planning, and historic preservation.DEPARTMENT OF Art History57 ART HISTORY COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF ART HISTORY 3.

Art history courses taken in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development may not be double-counted for credit toward an art history minor. However, for Steinhardt students taking a minor in art history, the two-semester Steinhardt survey Art and Contemporary Culture is the prerequisite for advanced Renaissance, baroque, and modern courses. Art and Contemporary Culture II may only serve as the prerequisite for advanced modern courses. Courses in the College Core Curriculum Students majoring or minoring in art history or urban design and architecture studies are exempt from the College Core Curriculum's Expressive Culture requirement. Students who wish to have a Core Expressive Culture course (CORE-UA 720, CORE-UA 721, or CORE-UA 722) count for credit toward either major must secure the permission of the director of undergraduate studies for art history or the director of the urban design and architecture studies program. Graduation with Departmental Honors Students may graduate with departmental honors in art history or in urban design and architecture studies by successfully researching and writing a senior thesis. This represents the culmination of the work for the major and provides excellent preparation for graduate school. To be eligible for the honors program, students must have a GPA of 3.65 or higher at the conclusion of the junior year, both overall and in art history or in urban design and architecture studies. A student wishing to write an honors thesis must apply for admission to the program via the department NYU Classes site in early March of the junior year. For a complete description of all the honors thesis requirements, please visit our departmental NYU Classes site for honors-track students. Work toward the senior thesis consists of two 4-point honors courses (ARTH-UA 801 and ARTH-UA 804) focusing on research methods and writing, accompanied by regular meetings with the supervising professor. The completed thesis, at least 30 to 40 pages in length, is read by a committee of three faculty members, including the supervising professor. The committee meets with the student for a thesis defense at the end of the academic year. Satisfactory completion of the thesis, in the committee's judgment, earns an honors degree. These two honors courses may replace the two electives required for the major. Internship Policy Under exceptional circumstances, the Department of Art History awards academic credit (2 points) for an internship accompanied by an independent study. Students must find a professor willing to supervise this study. Course work may include a written diary recording the student's work experience and will include a term paper relevant to the internship, to be approved by the supervising professor.

Final details pending. Consult online CAS Bulletin 2016-2018 and departmental webpage for updated information. Students who entered CAS before fall 2016 may follow the new version of the major with departmental approval and advisement.) The new Asian/Pacific/American studies major Professor SandhuAsian/Pacific/American (A/P/A) studies examines the movements of people, goods, and ideas across the Atlantic and Pacific worlds. One of six programs in the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA), it provides an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the history and contemporary experiences of Asian/Pacific Americans in the Americas. The category of Asian/Pacific American includes people of East Asia, South Asia, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands living in the United States, as well as in other parts of the Americas. The two main areas of concentration are urban studies and diaspora studies. Urban studies examines the formation of Asian/Pacific American communities in relation to the various cultural, social, and political institutions in urban settings, with special emphasis on the New York metropolitan area. Diaspora studies investigates the processes that enable Asian/Pacific American communities in the United States and the Americas to sustain ties with communities throughout the world. The analysis of cultural production\u2014social, political, and economical processes\u2014is a central theme, as is cross-cultural conflict and collaboration. In coordination with A/P/A studies, the A/P/A Institute engages important artists, scholars, writers, and activists to campus. This provides the opportunity for discussion, performance, and reflection with students, faculty, and community members.www.apa.as.nyu.edu 20 Cooper Square, 4th Floor New York, NY 10003-7112 212-992-9650 MAJOR/MINOR IN Asian/Pacific/American Studies74 ASIAN/PACIFIC/AMERICAN STUDIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYMAJOR/MINOR IN ASIAN/PACIFIC/AMERICAN STUDIES nine 4-point courses (36 points) completed with a grade of C or better, comprised of: Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA-UA TBD, replacing Concepts in Social and Cultural Analysis, SCA-UA 1); one course in Asian/Pacific/American studies designated as a Field Colloquium; one course in Asian/Pacific/American studies designated as a Research Seminar; and six approved electives, four of which must be taught by SCA faculty.

The major in biology is an integrated yet diverse program that builds a solid foundation in modern biology through coursework in molecular biology, cell biology, evolution, genetics, developmental biology, physiology, 79 BIOLOGY COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY immunology, genomics, systems biology, computational biology, ecology, and environmental biology. From the very outset of their studies, students are exposed to modern concepts and state-of-the-art experimental and analytical methods. Upper-level courses emphasize foundational knowledge as well as laboratory skills, reasoning skills and quantitative skills. Advanced students may register for graduate-level courses, which are most often given in the specialized areas of faculty research. The department also offers a set of discrete minors in the life sciences, specifically in the areas of molecular and cell biology, genetics, genomics and bioinformatics, and environmental biology. Each minor is designed to hone skills in a particular contemporary area of biology and requires a laboratory experience. The minors permit students to create a course of study that will meet their unique academic and career goals. This program provides outstanding preparation for careers in research, academia, medicine, dentistry, and related fields. Graduates of the department have a remarkable record of success in acceptance into professional schools and in establishing notable careers in the biomedical sciences. Other courses offered by the department are designed to acquaint non-science majors with contemporary issues in biology. Such courses are often topical, addressing problems such as environmental pollution, limits of the earth, and human physiology. Outstanding and highly motivated students are offered special opportunities for honors work, independent study, summer laboratory research, internships, and other enhancements. Upper-level students may become involved in research projects in faculty laboratories through the many formal and informal opportunities afforded by the department. The department has a tradition of important research accomplishment and contains several specialized research and laboratory facilities that are integrated into the educational programs. These include undergraduate labs in molecular biology, cell biology, experimental physiology, genomics, bioinformat-ics, and ecological analysis. Field studies are carried out at a variety of regional sites. Department faculty are also affiliated with the NYU Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, the NYU Center for Developmental Genetics, NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, the NYU School of Medicine, the NYU College of Dentistry, the American Museum of Natural History, the New York Botanical Garden, and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Students with questions about majoring in biology or minoring in a specific area of biology should visit the office of the Department of Biology. Those declaring a major in biology are assigned a faculty adviser from the department; students meet with that professor to design a program of study, determine course selections, and discuss career goals. The faculty adviser is also available to provide guidance concerning the many options and opportunities afforded by the department for curricular enhancement, including research experiences. Major in Biology (Bachelor of Arts): General Information The department offers two tracks within the major. The standar d biology track provides students with a broad background in biology and the laboratory, quantitative, and reasoning skills needed for modern biology. The ecology track also provides students with a broad background in modern biology, but with a focus on ecological concepts, approaches, and analytical methods. In addition to these two tracks, students may pursue a major in global public health/science, with a concentration in biology (see below). In each of the two tracks, sixteen courses (typically 70 points) completed with grades of C or higher (and a minimum GPA of 2.0 for all courses required by and taken as electives in the major) are required for the major. To permit the maximal choice of appropriate upper-level courses, we strongly recommend that students take Principles of Biology I and II (BIOL-UA 11, 12), General Chemistry I and II and Laboratories (CHEM-UA 125, 126), and mathematics in their freshman year. Then, as sophomores, students in the standard track should take Molecular and Cell Biology I, II (BIOL-UA 21, 22), whereas students in the ecology track should take Molecular and Cell Biology I (BIOL-UA 21) and Fundamentals of Ecology (BIOL-UA 63). Programs of majors must be approved each term by a department adviser.80 BIOLOGY COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY Biology Standard Track Biology core courses (four courses/16 points): P rinciples of Biology I and II (BIOL-UA 11, 12) NOTE: Biology majors are not required to register for the 1-credit Principles of Biology Lab (BIOL-UA 123).

The skills and perspectives of the liberal arts are practical as well as personally enriching. Liberal arts students can enhance their preparedness for business by also completing a small number of relevant courses. In consultation with the Undergraduate College of the Leonard N. Stern School of Business, the College of Arts and Science has identified a set of such courses, some offered by CAS and some offered by Stern. By completing the business studies minor, students acquire the core knowledge and quantitative skills that are invaluable assets for success in the business professions. Intended especially for students interested in the humanities, the minor in business studies is administered by the College of Arts and Science and is available to all students in the University. Students considering the minor should consult with the business studies adviser in the College Preprofessional Advising Office in the Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 901; 212-998-8160; cas.business@nyu.edu. www.business.cas.nyu.edu Silver Center 100 Washington Square East, Room 901, New York, NY 10003-6688 212-998-8160 MINOR IN Business Studies Two Tracks of the Business Studies Minor Students who matriculate in NYU in and after fall 2016 choose one of two tracks in this minor: T rack A is for students in any division of NYU who are not pursuing or planning any major or minor in the CAS Department of Economics. T rack B is for students in any division of NYU who are pursuing or planning any economics major or minor in CAS. Students cannot choose freely between the two tracks; they must select their track in the minor based on whether or not they are pursuing or intending to pursue any major or minor in the CAS Department of Economics. T rack A for non-economics students consists of six to seven courses, four to five in economics and mathematics plus two in business through Stern. T rack B for economics students consists of four business courses in Stern. In each track, certain courses are always required. Track A: For Students Not Majoring or Minoring in CAS Economics T rack A of the business studies minor consists of six to seven courses (four to five courses in economics and mathematics, plus two in business through Stern). At least four 4-point courses must be unique to this minor and not overlap with any other major or minor; therefore, no more than two of the required 4-point courses for the business studies minor can also be used to satisfy requirements for a major or another minor. Students who go over this two-course overlap must take one or more additional 4-point courses in Stern. T rack A students may choose to take three or four Stern courses in total (beyond the minimum minor requirement of two Stern courses), but CAS students must ensure they can accommodate the extra Stern courses within the College's 16-point limit on non-CAS courses. Otherwise, they must file a petition to raise their limit through CAS Academic Standards (Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140; www.cas.nyu.edu/page/petitions). Note that CAS students cannot pursue two cross-school minors, as this would greatly exceed the 16-point limit. T rack A of the business studies minor requires the following six to seven courses. Students may use AP or equivalent international credit to satisfy two out of these three requirements: macroeconomics, microeconomics, and calculus. Courses are 4 points unless noted otherwise. (Please consult departmental websites and sections in this Bulletin for course prerequisites, which are enforced.)95 BUSINESS STUDIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYMINOR IN BUSINESS STUDIES I ntroduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1), or AP/equivalent international advanced standing Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2), or AP/equivalent international advanced standing O ne course in calculus chosen from: M athematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) Calculus I (MA TH-UA 121) AP (or equiv alent international advanced standing) credit in calculus Calculus II (NYU Tandon School of Engineering, MA 1124) O ne course in statistics chosen from (AP or equivalent international credit is not accepted): S tatistics (ECON-UA 18; MATH-UA 212) M athematical Statistics (MATH-UA 234).

S tatistics for Business Control (STAT-UB 1). S tatistics for Business Control and Regression and Forecasting Models (STAT-UB 103; 6 points). R egression and forecasting requirement: S tudents who take Statistics for Business Control and Regression and Forecasting Models (STAT-UB 103; prerequisite: 6 points) satisfy both the statistics and the regression requirement with this one course. All other students must take R egression and Forecasting Models (STAT-UB 3; prerequisite: ECON-UA 18 or or STAT-UB 234, POL-UA 800, PSYCH-UA 10, or SOC-UA 302; 2 points) P rinciples of Financial Accounting (ACCT-UB 1) is required of all minors.

Prerequisites: (1) completion of the statistics requirement, chosen only from Statistics (ECON-UA 18) or Analytical Statistics (ECON-UA 20) or Statistics for Business Control (STAT-UB 1) or Statistics for Business Control and Regression and Forecasting Models (STAT-UB 103), and (2) completion of the regression and forecasting requirement, chosen only from Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266) or Regression and Forecasting Models (STAT-UB 3) or Statistics for Business Control and Regression and Forecasting Models (STAT-UB 103). Notes on Track A (Non-Economics Track) Notes on Advanced Placement (AP) and equivalent advanced standing credit: Students may use AP or equivalent international credit to satisfy any two out of these three minor requirements: Introduction to Macroeconomics, Introduction to Microeconomics, and calculus. When students have advanced standing credit in all three areas, they are advised to place out of the macroeconomics and microeconomics courses and take a calculus course at NYU. No more than two courses of the six to seven required for the minor can be satisfied with advanced standing credit, and this AP or other credit can never be used for statistics, regression and forecasting, or any Stern courses. Notes on the economics requirement: If students have Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, etc. credit in macroeconomics and/or microeconomics that they choose not to apply toward the minor, they are advised to take Introduction to Macroeconomics and/or Introduction to Microeconomics and forfeit their AP/MINOR IN BUSINESS STUDIES IB/etc. credit. Otherwise, they must take one or both of the second-year courses Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) and Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12). The prerequisites for these intermediate-level courses (found in the economics section of this Bulletin) are strictly enforced. Only students who transition from LSP may satisfy this requirement with Economics I (ECI-UF 1001, 4 points) and Economics II (ECI-UF 1002, 4 points) Note on the statistics requirement: The substitute courses MATH-UA 234, POL-UA 800, PSYCH-UA 10, and SOC-UA 302 are acceptable prerequisites for Regression and Forecasting Models (STAT-UB 3; 2 points), but are not acceptable prerequisites for the optional minor courses Foundations of Finance (FINC-UB 2) and Operations Management (OPMG-UB 1). Note on overlap courses: If more than two of the required 4-point courses (or advanced standing credit substitutions) for T rack A of the business studies minor are also used to satisfy requirements for a major or another minor, then students must take one or more additional courses in Stern, over and above the minimum requirement of two courses in Stern (this minor must always consist of at least four unique, non-overlapping, 4-point courses). See section \"Stern courses,\" below. Track B: For Students Majoring or Minoring in CAS Economics T rack B of the business studies minor always consists of four 4-point business courses (16 points) in Stern. No CAS courses can count toward this track of the minor. Four 4-point courses must be unique to this minor and not overlap with any other major or minor; therefore, no more than two of the required 4-point courses for the business studies minor can also be used to satisfy requirements for a major or another minor. Students who go over this two-course overlap must take one or more additional 4-point courses in Stern. As this will put CAS students over the College's 16-point limit on non-CAS courses, they must file a petition in CAS Academic Standards to raise their limit above 16 to accommodate the extra coursework (Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140; www.cas.nyu.edu/page/petitions). Note that CAS students cannot pursue two cross-school minors, as this would greatly exceed the 16-point limit. T rack B of the business studies minor requires the following four 4-point Stern courses: P rinciples of Financial Accounting (ACCT-UB 1) is required of all minors. O ne of the following Stern core courses: M anagement and Organizations (MGMT-UB 1) or I ntroduction to Marketing (MKTG-UB 1) or I nformation Technology in Business and Society (INFO-UB 1) or O perations Management (OPMG-UB 1). Prerequisites: (1) a course in statistics, chosen only from Statistics (ECON-UA 18) or Analytical Statistics (ECON-UA 20) or Statistics for Business Control (STAT-UB 1) or Statistics for Business Control and Regression and Forecasting Models (STAT-UB 103); and (2) a course in regression and forecasting, chosen only from Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266) or Regression and Forecasting Models (STAT-UB 3) or Statistics for Business Control and Regression and Forecasting Models (STAT-UB 103). T wo more 4-point courses in Stern, to be chosen from the core courses above and/or from: M anagerial Accounting (ACCT-UB 4). Prerequisite: Principles of Financial Accounting (ACCT-UB 1). F oundations of Finance (FINC-UB 2).

Corequisite: Principles of Financial Accounting (ACCT-UB 1). 96 BUSINESS STUDIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYMINOR IN BUSINESS STUDIES 97 BUSINESS STUDIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYNote on Track B (Economics Track) Note on regression and forecasting: Economics majors who wish to take Foundations of Finance (FINC-UB 2) and/or Operations Management (OPMG-UB 1) for their track of the business studies minor should note that these two courses have as their prerequisite a course in regression and forecasting. Therefore, they may only be taken after Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266). Economics majors may, if they wish, take the 2-point regression course STAT-UB 3. This course is not required for the economics major, but it allows economics students to take FINC-UB 2 and/or OPMG-UB 1 earlier in their undergraduate careers. Grading and Credit Policies Applying to Both Tracks of the Minor A minimum grade of C is required for all courses intended to count toward the minor, and the minimum overall GPA required in the minor is 2.0. No credit toward the minor can be granted for internships. CAS students should note that all courses taken in Stern for this minor will count toward their 16-point limit on course work in the other divisions of NYU. Students seeking additional non-CAS, non-liberal arts credits beyond the 16-point limit must file a petition with the Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards in the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140; www.as.nyu.edu/page/petitions. In addition, no Stern courses can count toward the 64 credits that internal or external transfer students to CAS are required to complete in CAS (-UA) courses. Courses from the NYU School of Engineering are not acceptable, except for calculus two. Transfer Student Policies Applying to Both Tracks of the Minor All transfer credit must be evaluated by the Preprofessional Advising Center (Silver Center, Room 901; 212-998-8160) in order to determine its applicability toward the minor; submit course syllabi and transcripts to cas.business@nyu.edu. T ransfer students on T rack A cannot transfer in more than half of the required courses in economics and mathematics (i.e., two) and half of the Stern courses in business (i.e., one) to count towards the minor; for transfer students, AP and other advanced standing credit is treated exactly as transfer credit. T ransfer students on T rack B cannot transfer in more than half of the Stern courses in business (i.e., two) to count towards the minor; AP and other advanced standing credit is not acceptable for Stern requirements.

The atomic and molecular structure and properties of matter are fundamental to the investigation of the physical world and to the understanding of living systems. Modern chemistry spans chemical physics, materials science, and molecular biology, merging the traditional divisions of analytical, organic, inorganic, and physical chemistry. Recently, the department has focused its growth on physical, biophysical, and bioorganic chemistry, exploiting interdisci-plinary areas of theory, nanoscience and materials, and biological and biomedical chemistry. The department has a large and active theoretical group in the areas of chemical physics and biomolecular modeling. Graduates of the department find rewarding careers and achieve distinction in all phases of scientific life, from basic research to commercial product development. The late Gertrude Elion, a 1941 M.S. in Chemistry from New York University, shared the 1988 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology for her research in pharmaceutical chemistry. Phil Baran (B.S. 1997), a professor at the Scripps Research Institute, was named a MacArthur Fellow for 2013. The department offers majors in chemistry, biochemistry, and global public health/science with a concentration in chemistry. Students have the opportunity to earn either a B.A. or B.S. in the chemistry major.

Professor John W. Draper, the first president of the society and chair of the department, was a remarkable polymath: chemist, physician, philosopher, historian, and pioneering photographer. The department has undertaken a major development plan, strengthening its faculty, instructional laborato- ries, course offerings, and research facilities in the areas of physical, biophysical, bioorganic, and biomedical chemistry, as well as in chemical biology, nanoscience, and materials sciences. Qualified undergraduates are strongly encouraged to participate in research as early as their sophomore year of study. The department houses state-of-the-art laboratory facilities for its undergraduate chemistry courses. Majoring in chemistry at NYU provides strong preparation for graduate study in chemistry and biochemistry; professional education in medicine, dentistry, or patent law; and careers in industrial or pharmaceutical chemistry and biotechnology.Chair of the Department Professor Canary Director of Undergraduate Studies Professor Jerschowwww.chemistry.as.nyu.edu Silver Center 100 Washington Square East, Room 1001, New York, NY 10003-6688 212-998-8400 DEPARTMENT OF Chemistry100 CHEMISTRY COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY undergraduate studies) to provide a broad, varied program of study in chemistry or an undergraduate specializa- tion in organic, biochemical, physical, or theoretical chemistry. The department also offers a number of courses for non-science students and service courses for students in the other schools of NYU. The programs of study in chemistry and biochemistry prepare students for graduate study leading to careers in research, development, and teaching and/or for further study in areas such as medicine, dentistry, basic medical sciences, and allied health fields (including forensic science). In addition, the chemistry and biochemistry majors both prepare students for alternative careers, especially when paired with a minor in economics or business studies: for example, patent law, technology investment, or management in the chemical industry. The department offers advanced versions of the general and organic chemistry courses that are required for several science majors and for the pre-health curriculum (leading to professional and graduate study in medicine, dentistry, and basic medical sciences). Students need permission from the department to register for these advanced courses. Permission for the first-year Advanced General Chemistry sequence is based on several factors, including performance in Advanced Placement (or equivalent) chemistry, physics, and calculus. Majors in Chemistry and Biochemistry: General Information Students considering a major in chemistry or biochemistry are strongly urged to seek course advisement from the director of undergraduate studies as early in their academic careers as possible. Chemistry is a sequential subject with courses building on earlier courses. Delay in taking certain key prerequisite courses can make it impossible to complete a major in four years without summer attendance. A grade of C or better in chemistry and the other required courses is required for the fulfillment of the chemistry or biochemistry major in the department. Students who do not have an average of 2.0 in departmentally required courses by the time they have completed 64 points in all courses will be asked to change their major. The Department of Chemistry strictly enforces all prerequisites and de-enrolls students from courses for which they do meet the prerequisites. Prerequisite courses must be completed with a grade of C (not C minus) or better. AP , IB, and A Level credit by examination in chemistry is not accepted toward any departmental majors or minors. Core Courses for the Majors in Chemistry and Biochemistry The majors in chemistry and biochemistry build on a core of required courses in chemistry, physics, and mathematics. (Note that biology is not required for any major or minor offered by the Department of Chemistry, only by the prehealth program.) The six required core courses (28 points) in this department are: G eneral Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 125) G eneral Chemistry II and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 126) O rganic Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 225) O rganic Chemistry II and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 226) P hysical Chemistry: Quantum Mechanics and Thermodynamics and Kinetics (CHEM-UA 652) The advanced and/or majors versions of the general and organic sequences\u2014CHEM-UA 127, CHEM-UA 128, CHEM-UA 227, and CHEM-UA 228 (see course descriptions)\u2014substitute for CHEM-UA 125, CHEM-UA 126, CHEM-UA 225, and CHEM-UA 226, respectively. In addition to these chemistry courses, the chemistry and biochemistry majors require four courses (18 points) in mathematics and physics: Calculus I (MA TH-UA 121) Calculus II (MA TH-UA 122). Advanced Placement credit is not accepted for this major requirement, unless students presenting the credit (a score of 5 on BC Calculus) go on to take Linear Algebra or Calculus III at NYU. G eneral Physics I (PHYS-UA 11). AP or other advanced standing credits are not accepted. G eneral Physics II (PHYS-UA 12). AP or other advanced standing credits are not accepted.101 CHEMISTRY COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 140) is strongly recommended as preparation for both Physical Chemistry: Quantum Mechanics and Spectroscopy (CHEM-UA 651) and Physical Chemistry: Thermodynamics and Kinetics (CHEM-UA 652), as well as for students interested in pursuing chemistry on the graduate level or who have an interest in theoretical chemistry. Freshmen who intend to pursue a major in chemistry or biochemistry and are strong in mathematics and the physical sciences are encouraged to take General Physics I and II as their second science sequence (concurrently with freshman chemistry) in the first year. This allows the physical chemistry courses to be taken as early as sophomore year if the mathematics prerequisites are completed, but should be balanced against the desire or need to take biology with chemistry in the freshman year and defer physics (e.g., for students who are undecided, are considering a major in biology or neural science, and/or are on the pre-health track). The core, described above, provides a basic background in chemistry. Students normally are required to complete the courses in general chemistry, organic chemistry, physics, and calculus prior to entry into CHEM-UA 651, 652 (physical chemistry) in the third year. Alternative programs are also possible. It is strongly advised, however, that an advanced-level chemistry course be taken in the third year of study, allowing at least three more semesters to complete all major requirements. Students interested in careers in medicine, dentistry, or basic medical sciences may wish to consider the major in biochemistry. Coursework in biology is required for such students for admission to schools of the health professions. The appropriate preprofessional adviser should be consulted for details. Major in Chemistry, B.A. For students entering CAS in and after fall 2013: The minimum major requirements, in addition to the core courses cited above, are completion of the Physical Chemistry Laboratory course (CHEM-UA 661), Inorganic Chemistry (CHEM-UA 711), and two advanced chemistry elective courses for the B.A. degree. Please note that Advanced Independent Study and Research (CHEM-UA 997, 998) and Senior Honors in Chemistry (CHEM-UA 995, 996) do not count as advanced electives for the major. For students who entered CAS prior to fall 2013: The minimum major requirements, in addition to the core courses cited above, are completion of the Physical Chemistry Laboratory course (CHEM-UA 661), Inorganic Chemistry (CHEM-UA 711), and one advanced chemistry elective course for the B.A. degree. Please note that Advanced Independent Study and Research (CHEM-UA 997, 998) and Senior Honors in Chemistry (CHEM-UA 995, 996) do not count as advanced electives for the major. Major in Biochemistry, B.A. For students entering CAS in and after fall 2013: The minimum requirements, in addition to the core courses cited above, are Biochemistry I and II (CHEM-UA 881, 882), Experimental Biochemistry and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 885), Advanced Biochemistry (CHEM-UA 890), and one advanced chemistry elective. Please note that Advanced Independent Study and Research (CHEM-UA 997, 998) and Senior Honors in Chemistry (CHEM-UA 995, 996) do not count as advanced electives for the major. Students in this major are reminded that these courses must be taken in the proper order. Careful course planning is required to ensure that this can be done within a normal four-year program. For students who entered CAS prior to fall 2013: The minimum requirements, in addition to the core courses cited above, are Biochemistry I and II (CHEM-UA 881, 882), Experimental Biochemistry and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 885), and Advanced Biochemistry (CHEM-UA 890). Please note that Advanced Independent Study and Research (CHEM-UA 997, 998) and Senior Honors in Chemistry (CHEM-UA 995, 996) do not count as advanced electives for the major. Biochemistry majors are strongly encouraged to take Cellular and Molecular Biology I and II (BIOL-UA 21, 22). This is especially important for those students wishing to enter graduate programs in biochemistry.102 CHEMISTRY COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY Major in Chemistry, B.S. Students who complete the required core courses as outlined above, plus the Physical Chemistry Laboratory course (CHEM-UA 661); Inorganic Chemistry (CHEM-UA 711); three advanced electives in chemistry; one course in computer science at or above the level of CSCI-UA 2 (CSCI-UA 101 preferred); and at least two semesters of Advanced Independent Study and Research (CHEM-UA 997, 998) or Senior Honors in Chemistry (CHEM-UA 995, 996) will graduate with the degree of Bachelor of Science (B.S.) instead of the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.). Please note that CHEM-UA 997, 998 and CHEM-UA 995, 996 do not count as advanced electives for the major. Students should also note that the B.S. program is very difficult to complete within a normal four-year academic program and that it confers no particular advantage to students in premedical or predental programs. Major in Global Public Health/Science with a Concentration in Chemistry, B.S. Students pursuing this combined program concentrate in chemistry\u2014the central natural science that interfaces physics and mathematics with the life sciences. For students entering CAS in and after fall 2015, the major in GPH/science with a concentration in chemistry requires twenty-one courses (90 points) with a grade of C or better, as follows. Students must plan and schedule carefully for their College Core Curriculum requirements (foreign language, expository writing, and Foundations of Contemporary Culture), and if they are prehealth, they must also take Principles of Biology I, II (BIOL-UA 11, 12) in addition to their Core requirements and the 90 points for the major outlined below.

Program in Chemistry and Engineering The College of Arts and Science offers a joint B.S/B.S. program with the NYU Tandon School of Engineering. For students interested in chemistry, the program leads to the B.S. degree from CAS and the B.S. degree in chemical and biomolecular engineering from the NYU School of Engineering. Further information is available from the College Advising Center, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905; 212-998-8130. Policy on School of Engineering courses: No CAS student (whether majoring or minoring in this department or not) is allowed to take Tandon substitute courses for CHEM-UA 125, 126, 127, 128 (general chemistry); 225, 226, 227, 228 (organic chemistry); 651, 652, 661 (physical chemistry); 711 (inorganic chemistry); or 881, 882, 885, 890 (biochemistry). However, students pursuing a major in the Department of Chemistry may seek prior permission of the director of undergraduate studies to take advanced electives in the School of Engineering and apply them to the major. This is reviewed on a case-by-case basis. These courses count against each student's 16-point allowance in the other divisions of NYU and cannot be applied to the 64 point UA residency requirement. Minor in Chemistry Completion of the following four 5-point courses (20 points) constitutes a minor in chemistry: CHEM-UA 125 or 127, 126 or 128, 225 or 227, and 226 or 228. Only three of the four courses may also be used to satisfy the requirements of another department's major. No grade lower than C will count toward the minor, and an average of 2.0 or better in all chemistry courses is required. Honors Program While the Department of Chemistry has several accelerated courses\u2014for example, Advanced General Chemistry and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 127 and 128) and Majors Organic Chemistry and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 227 and 228)\u2014these offerings need not be taken to earn a chemistry or biochemistry degree with departmental honors. The main requirement for earning an honors degree is the completion of an honors thesis based upon independent experimental or theoretical research. Students interested in research and an honors degree must enroll in Senior Honors in Chemistry (CHEM-UA 995 and 996). Students must first become involved in research, CHEM-UA 997 or 998, for at least one semester or one summer prior to the senior year, as two semes-ters of research is arguably not enough time to execute a successful research project. Depending on the number of credits the student is registered for in a given semester, the initial exposure to research may or may not be for credit. Students seeking entry into the honors program must obtain the approval of the director of undergradu-ate studies prior to the end of their junior year. Candidates for a degree with honors in chemistry must have an overall GPA of 3.65 and a GPA of 3.65 in required courses for the chemistry or biochemistry major. A senior thesis based on this work must be prepared, approved by the adviser, and presented in a seminar format during the spring term of the senior year. Please contact Carol Hollingsworth, academic program administrator, or Professor Alexej Jerschow, director of undergraduate studies, for more detailed information. Research Opportunities The department endeavors to make research opportunities available during the summer and the academic year to well-qualified students at all levels. We strongly urge students who are interested in research to begin as early as freshman year. Students are encouraged to apply for the FAST and DURF grants awarded by the College. To participate in research in the department, students must both meet the prerequisites and register for the research courses Advanced Independent Study and Research (CHEM-UA 997, 998) or, if eligible, Senior Honors in Chemistry (CHEM-UA 995, 996). In either case, permission of the director of undergraduate studies is required before registering for these courses. Laboratory Policy Due to the potential hazard of any chemical experimentation, safety goggles, laboratory coats, and other protective gear must be worn at all times in the laboratories (but cannot be worn outside the laboratory). Laboratory equipment loaned to students must be replaced if damaged or broken. Students who do not return borrowed laboratory equipment at the end of a course are charged an additional fee, and their grade may be recorded as incomplete and not released until \"checkout\" is completed.104 CHEMISTRY COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY The Department of Chemistry strictly enforces all prerequisites and de-enrolls students from courses for which they do meet the prerequisites.

Offered in the spring. Evans, Henderson. 4 points. For most of the past century, treatments for children and adolescents suffering from mental illness relied primarily on open-ended psychotherapies. Over the past 25 years new evidence-based treatments have emerged, including behavioral psychotherapies such as cognitive behavior therapy for anxiety and depression and dialectical behavior therapy for personality disorders. In addition, strong evidence supports the use of various pharmacological inter-ventions for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), mood and anxiety disorders, and autism. Students investigate each of these treatments by reading and analyzing much of the original research that established their efficacy. COURSES The CAMS minor requires five courses (18-20 points) as follows: Child and A dolescent Psychopathology (CAMS-UA 101) is required of all minors and is a prerequisite for some advanced courses in CAMS. A t least two more CAMS-UA courses. The r emaining two courses can either be CAMS-UA courses or approved non-departmental courses. Courses taken for the CAMS minor cannot also be used for another major or minor. The only exceptions are made for majors in psychology and social work, who may use one course toward both this minor and their major.

Its approach to cinema focuses on the processes of understanding film and the moving image in its multiple cultural and interdisciplinary contexts. The undergraduate program treats the study of cinema both as an art form and as a form of mass culture. The study of film, as an art, is concerned with the relationships among film style, narrative form, and the material practices that shape the medium. The study of film as mass culture explores how film reflects societal values and processes of social change. The department offers courses in the history, theory, aesthetics, and criticism of film, as well as film genres and techniques. Certain film courses given in the College of Arts and Science (CAS) may also be approved for the major or minor. Most of the Tisch courses include extensive film screenings and are supplemented by weekly academic departmental events open to all students. Students have access to certain Moving Image Archiving and Preservation (MIAP) courses and the Orphans Symposium. Students also have access to extensive film and film-related resources in the department's George Amberg Study Center. The video collection in the Bobst Library's Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media provides additional resources. Finally, various New York City institutions make this an extraordinary environment for cinema studies.

Greek Thinkers CLASS-UA 700 Identical to PHIL-UA 122. Offered periodically. 4 points. The origins of nonmythical speculation among the Greeks and the main patterns of philosophical thought, from Thales and other early speculators about the physical nature of the world through Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, the Epicureans, and the Neoplatonists. Socrates and His Critics CLASS-UA 701 Offered every other year. 4 points. Despite having written nothing himself, Socrates gave his name to a distinctive form of philosophical literature, the Socratic discourse, and an approach to philosophical inquiry and instruction, the so-called Socratic method. In antiquity, he inspired Plato, Xenophon, the Stoics, the Skeptics, and the Cynics and drew criticism from Aristophanes; in modernity, his life both fascinated and repelled Nietzsche. We search for the \"historical Socrates\" and also consider how philosophy, in its move from its origins to eth-ics and political philosophy, essentially created him. Special Courses Special T opics in Classical Studies I, II, III CLASS-UA 291, 293, 294 Usually assigns readings in English translation. Offered periodically. 2 or 4 points per term. Seminar topics vary from semester to semester, although the focus is always on a limited aspect of life, history, literature, art, or archaeology of Greco-Roman antiquity. Topics from past semesters include the T rojan War, archaeology and pottery, Alexander the Great, the Etruscans, and crime and violence in the ancient world. Future topics may include Plato and Aristotle, ancient medicine, the Age of Pericles, the Age of Augustus, and Latin love poetry.Senior Honors Seminar and Senior Honors Thesis CLASS-UA 295, 297 Prerequisite: permission of the department. 2 or 4 points per term.

Graduate Courses Open to Undergraduates Courses in classics offered in the Graduate School of Arts and Science are open to all undergraduates who have reached the required advanced level of Greek or Latin language instruction.128 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYGeneral Information The guidelines of our program allow students great flexibility in shaping a course of study suited to their own intellectual goals. While all majors in comparative literature must take four courses originating in the Department of Comparative Literature, our commitment to a global and interdisciplinary outlook means that the remaining six courses required for the major can be taken in other departments or even, by taking advantage of NYU study away opportunities, on other continents. All students planning to major in comparative literature register with the director of undergraduate studies, who works closely with them to develop a coherent sequence of courses suited to their individual interests. Periodical advising sessions with the director of undergraduate studies and a remarkably low student-faculty ratio help our students make the most of the wide range of possibilities that define the major.PROGRAMFACULTYChair of the Department Professor Apter Director of Undergraduate Studies Associate Professor Garcia Professors Emeriti Braithwaite, Chioles, Javitch, Reiss University Professor; Professor of Comparative Literature and Africana Studies Diawara University Professor; Professor of Comparative Literature and German RonellProfessors Apter, Baer, Iampolski, Lezra, K.

We offer many seminar-format courses with intensive faculty interaction and discussion. Our faculty specializations cover European, Anglo-American, African, Slavic, Latin American, Caribbean, Chinese, South Asian, and Middle Eastern literatures. Departmental courses immerse students in ancient, early modern, and modern global literatures, often with an emphasis on Continental philosophy and literary and critical theory more generally. Students are given flexibility in the design of the major (which has two tracks, one in literature and one in literary and cultural studies) and can integrate into their course of study coursework in anthropology, philoso-phy, psychoanalysis, gender and race studies, history, political theory, religion, art, music, and film and media studies, among other fields. Qualified students are encouraged to take part in the department's honors program, which culminates in the writing of a senior honors thesis under the supervision of a faculty member. A minor in comparative literature is available for students majoring in a different discipline or field. We also strongly encourage prospective double majors who may seek to combine this humanities major with another, non-humanities specialty. The department's rigorous teaching and rich curriculum have proved to be excellent preparation for our majors, many of whom have gone on for advanced study of literature at the graduate level or for professional education in law or medicine. Others have pursued successful careers in academia, human rights, translation, international relations, education, publishing, journalism, arts, media, film, performance, and all kinds of creative career options that do not fit into any pre-given professional category.129 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF COMPARATIVE LITERATURE To take full advantage of the opportunities provided by comparative literature, students are encouraged to declare the major as early in their academic career as possible. In addition, please note that students planning to study away should consult and declare with the director of undergraduate studies well before their departure. Major Track 1: Literature This track of the comparative literature major requires ten 4-point courses (40 points) organized as follows: F our courses (16 points) originating in the Department of Comparative Literature. These four courses must be taught by a faculty member of the Department of Comparative Literature on the Washington Square campus; they cannot be cross-listed courses originating in another department. These four courses must include both of the following: I ntroduction to Comparative Literature (COLIT-UA 116) J unior Theory Seminar (COLIT-UA 200) F our courses (16 points) in a national literature department at the 100 level or above, conducted in the language of that literature. T wo courses (8 points) in a related cultural field or discipline. Fields could include history, art history, religion, philosophy, classics, politics, cinema studies, and so on, and could also be another foreign language or literary area. If the national literature department selected for specialization is English, these two courses must be in a foreign language. The choice of these courses will be made in consultation with the adviser to form a coherent intellectual field and a defined objective in the major. Major Track 2: Literary and Cultural Studies This track of the comparative literature major requires ten 4-point courses (40 points) organized as follows: F our courses (16 points) originating in the Department of Comparative Literature.

Policy on School of Engineering courses: CAS students (whether majoring or minoring in this department or not) should take their computer science courses in CAS and not at Tandon School of Engineering. Note that CAS students are allowed to declare Tandon's cross-school minors in (1) computer engineering and (2) game engineering, as those areas of study are not available in CAS and do not duplicate CSCI-UA offerings. However, CAS students cannot declare Tandon's cross-school minor in computer science. Students pursuing any major or minor in the College's Department of Computer Science may seek prior permission of the director of undergraduate studies to take advanced electives in the School of Engineering and apply them to their CAS course of study, but such exceptions will be rare. Any Tandon courses approved in this way will still count against each student's 16-point allowance in the other divisions of NYU and cannot be applied to the 64 point UA residency requirement. Honors Program A degree in computer science is awarded with honors to selected majors who successfully complete the requirements of the honors program. The requirements (fifteen courses/60 points) include the following computer science courses: CSCI-UA 101, 102, CSCI-UA two semesters of Independent Research (CSCI-UA 520 and 521); two advanced computer science electives at the 400 level; and the following mathematics courses: MATH-UA 120, MATH-UA 121 or 211, MATH-UA 122 or 212 (students must choose one calculus track or the other to follow and cannot mix courses from the two tracks), and MATH-UA 140. Note that students who have taken Numerical Analysis (MATH-UA 252) must contact the director of undergraduate studies before registering for Numerical Computing (CSCI-UA 421). As of fall 2015, students are no longer required to take the designated honors version of two of the above computer science courses. Research work must culminate in a thesis (typically 40 to 60 pages in length) to be presented at the College's Undergraduate Research Conference, held every April. An overall and major GPA of 3.65 is required. Information on honors programs in the joint computer science/mathematics and economics/computer science majors can be found on the department's website.

No credit toward the minor is granted for grades of C-minus or lower, although such grades will be computed into the grade point average of the minor, as well as into the overall grade point average. No course to be counted toward the minor may be taken on a pass/fail basis. The introductory workshop and summer intensives may be taken only once for credit. All other workshops may be taken up to three times for credit. T o declare the minor: Students in the College of Arts and Science may declare a creative writing minor by completing the minor declaration form on the program's website. Students in other NYU schools may declare their minors on Albert or as directed by their home schools. The program recommends that all creative writing minors contact the undergraduate programs manager in the semester prior to graduation to verify that their minor declaration is on record and that they have fulfilled (or have enrolled in) all of the appropriate courses for the minor. Policy on Course Substitutions Students may petition to apply a maximum of one outside course toward the minor, either as the introductory prerequisite (equivalent to CRWRI-UA 815) or as an elective. An outside course is any NYU creative writing course without a CRWRI-UA rubric. To petition to substitute an outside course, students must complete the course substitution petition form (available on the program's website) and provide the course syllabus (as described on the petition form). The undergraduate programs manager will review the submitted syllabus to verify course level and determine substitution eligibility. Students must petition for course substitution prior to registration. If the program pre-approves a non-NYU course for substitution, it can only be counted toward the minor if 1. the Office of the Associate Dean for Students in CAS has also approved the course credit for transfer, and 2. the student receives a grade of C or better. Study Away Students wishing to begin the creative writing minor while studying away at an NYU site should register for Creative Writing (CRWRI-UA 9815) or, if studying away in the summer, for one of the 8-point intensives offered in Paris and Florence (CRWRI-UA 9818, 9819, 9828, or 9829). These courses are not considered outside courses and will automatically be counted toward the creative writing minor. All other creative writing courses taken away require a petition for substitution and are subject to approval by the program. COURSES The minor in creative writing offers an introductory course in poetry and fiction, as well as upper-level courses that focus on specific elements of formal and experimental poetry, fiction, and creative nonfic-tion.

Students with permission from the director of undergraduate studies may change from one concentration to the other, but certain rules apply. In either case, no course may be taken for which the student does not have the appropriate prerequisites; this includes mathematics prerequisites. Students should review the Department of Economics website for more information about the major and meet with an adviser in the department to plan their course of study. Advisers are located at 19 West Fourth Street, Rooms 836 and 837. Students are strongly advised to begin this sequential major as early as possible. Ideally, six full semesters are required to complete the major. It is impossible to complete the major in fewer than five semesters. Students considering honors in the major should speak to an economics adviser and complete the statistics requirement as soon as possible.PROGRAMFACULTYChairman of the Department Professor Lizzeri Director of Undergraduate Studies Professor FlinnDEPARTMENT OF Economics www.econ.as.nyu.edu 19 West Fourth Street, 6th Floor New York, NY 10012-1119 Phone: 212-998-8900 Professors Emeriti Gately, Kirzner, Ordover, Ramsey Chair of Economics And Business Ludvigson Paulette Goddard Professor of Political Economy BenhabibJay Gould Professor of Economics NadiriHenry and Lucy Moses Professor of Economics GertlerSilver Professors; Professors of Economics Gale, Storchmann Clinical Associate Professors Paizis, ThomClinical Assistant Professor FanGlobal Distinguished Professor LjungqvistThe Department of Economics prepares students to understand individual and group decision making, the structure of markets and economies, and the relationship between regions within the global economy. Although the department is large, its students enjoy an excellent student-faculty rapport. Many of the faculty members are associated with distinguished research institutions. By being able to study with faculty who are actively engaged in research, students learn not only about the fundamentals of economic theory but also how such theory is utilized. They have the opportunity to conduct research on their own. Honors students are required to write an honors thesis under direct faculty supervision. Students majoring in economics have many options open to them after graduation. The major prepares them for graduate school in economics, business management, or public administration. Preprofessional students will find that an economics major not only fosters the discipline medical or law school demands, but provides a solid foundation for these and other careers. Employers and professional schools appreciate the skills acquired by economics students and hire economics majors because they can think quantitatively, qualitatively, and analytically. Studying economics at New York University is especially rewarding because of its urban environment. Students often find career opportunities on Wall Street, at the United Nations, or in various corporate, financial, governmental, agency, and nonprofit institutional settings.163 ECONOMICS COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS A grade of C or better is required for a course to be counted toward the major, as well as to satisfy the mathematics prerequisites. No course for the major may be taken pass/fail. If a student fails a course required for the major, the course must be retaken in the department; a course taken outside the University cannot be substituted for a failed course. Students must pay close attention to the prerequisites for each course, as they are strictly enforced. Students who do not meet the minimum C requirement in a prerequisite course(s) will be de-enrolled at the beginning of each semester. A grade of P , I, or W does not satisfy the minimum grade requirement. T ransfer credit toward the major will be awarded on a case by case basis. T ransfer students must consult the department's website for details. The department requires that all economics majors take an exit exam before graduation. No preparation is necessary, and the grade has no impact on a student's academic record. The exam takes only one hour. Students are contacted by the department in their senior year with logistical details. The results are used by the department to evaluate the major. Advanced Standing Credit Advanced Placement (AP), A Level, International Baccalaureate (IB), or equivalent credits place students out of one or both of Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) and Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2) and also count towards the total number of courses required for the major or minor. For AP , a score of 4 or 5 is acceptable. For IB, the College accepts only High Level (HL) exams with a score of 6 or 7; for A Level examinations, CAS accepts a score of B or higher. However, AP , A Level, IB, or equivalent credit in statistics is not acceptable for the economics major. In addition, advanced standing credit in calculus does not substitute for either or both semesters of Mathematics for Economics I, II (MATH-UA 211, 212). Policy Concentration The policy concentration of the major in economics is intended for the student who is primarily interested in applying economic analysis to an understanding of economic problems and policies. The elective courses allow students to focus on specific problems and topics that match their interests and career plans. This concentration corresponds most closely to the economics major that is offered by other leading colleges and universities. It is particularly well suited for students planning careers in law, public policy, business, or any other field in which a thorough understanding of economics is beneficial. Students in the policy concentration can pursue a Ph.D. in economics or finance if they supplement their course work with additional courses in mathematics. The policy concentration requires at least ten courses (40 points) in the Department of Economics.Seven core courses are required: I ntroduction to Macroeconomics 12) or Macroeconomic Analysis (ECON-UA 13) S tatistics (ECON-UA 18) or Analytical Statistics (ECON-UA 20) O ne course chosen from International Economics (ECON-UA 238), Urban Economics (ECON-UA 227), or Money and Banking (ECON-UA 231) I ntroduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266) Policy concentration majors must also take three electives in the department. Of these three electives, at most one can be numbered ECON-UA 200-299 and at least two must be numbered ECON-UA 300-399. With permission, students in the policy track will be allowed to take courses from the theory track. A student may choose to take two out of the three courses International Economics (ECON-UA 238), Urban Economics (ECON-UA 227), or Money and Banking (ECON-UA 231). One of them will count towards the core course requirement (above), and the other will count towards the 200-level elective requirement.164 ECONOMICS COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS Mathematics requirement: In addition to the ten ECON-UA courses noted above, policy concentration students must complete Mathematics for Economics I and Mathematics for Economics II (MATH-UA 211, 212) with a C or better. Advanced Placement (or equivalent) credit in calculus cannot substitute for them and does not allow a student to place ahead in the two-semester sequence. We strongly recommend that students take Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2) and Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) in the same semester. Note that Mathematics for Economics I is a prerequisite for Mathematics for Economics II. Prerequisites: Algebra and Calculus (MATH-UA 9), or its equivalent, is required for both Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) and Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2). Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2), Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211), and Mathematics for Economics II (MATH-UA 212) are all required for Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10). Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) and Intermediate Microeconomics are the prerequisites for Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12). Theory Concentration The theory concentration of the major in economics is intended for the student who wishes to begin the formal study of economic reasoning and master the analytical tools. This concentration relies on a higher level of abstraction and focuses on techniques of economic analysis rather than on the understanding of specific economic problems or institutions. It is particularly well suited for students who intend to pursue a Ph.D. degree in economics or higher degrees in quantitative fields such as finance. The theory concentration requires at least ten courses (40 points) in the Department of Economics.Six core courses are required: I ntroduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA (ECON-UA icroeconomic (ECON-UA 11) M acroeconomic Analysis (ECON-UA 13) I ntroduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266) Theory concentration majors must also take four electives in the department. Of these four electives, at most two can be numbered ECON-UA 200-299 and at least two must be numbered ECON-UA 300-399. Mathematics requirement: In addition to the ten ECON-UA courses noted above, theory concentration students must complete Mathematics for Economics I and Mathematics for Economics II (MATH-UA 211, 212) with a C or better. Advanced Placement (or equivalent) credit in calculus cannot substitute for them and does not allow a student to place ahead in the two-semester sequence. We strongly recommend that students take Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2) and Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) in the same semester. Note that Mathematics for Economics I is a prerequisite for Mathematics for Economics II.

Students who rank near the top of their class and who have done well on standardized tests, particularly in mathematics, are especially well suited. Students should have completed a rigorous college preparation program, including mathematics (at least through trigonometry), chemistry, and physics. Students are usually admitted to the program as freshmen and must be prepared to begin with Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) in the first semester of college. Given the highly structured curricula, transfer into the program after the first year is very difficult. Students must maintain satisfactory performance and must complete the required courses in a timely fashion to remain in the program. Their records are reviewed yearly by a faculty committee.DUAL-DEGREE PROGRAM IN Engineering (with the NYU Tandon School of Engineering) www.engineering.cas.nyu.edu Silver Center 100 Washington Square East, Room 905, New York, NY 10003-6688 212-998-8130 Director of the Program in the College of Arts and Science Clinical Professor Halpin Director of the Program in the NYU Tandon School of Engineering Associate Dean Kalkhoran Associate Director of the Program in the College of Arts and Science Mr. Tyrell DavisAdministrator of the Program in the NYU Tandon School of Engineering Ms. Jen PiroSince the fall of 2010, the College's dual degree program with the NYU Tandon School of Engineering, formerly known as Polytechnic School of Engineering, has offered highly qualified and motivated students who are technically oriented the opportunity to pursue both a liberal arts program with a major in science and a traditional engineering program. Upon completion of this five-year program, students receive both a B.S. degree from the College of Arts and Science and a B.S. degree from the NYU Tandon School of Engineering. Students with this combination of degrees are likely to find excellent employment opportunities. The available dual degree combinations are as follows: B.S. in Biology/B.S. in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering B.S. in Chemistry/B.S. in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering B.S. in Computer Science/B.S. in Computer Engineering B.S. in Computer Science/B.S. in Electrical Engineering B.S. in Mathematics/B.S. in Civil Engineering B.S. in Mathematics/B.S. in Computer Engineering B.S. in Mathematics/B.S. in Electrical Engineering B.S. in Mathematics/B.S. in Mechanical Engineering B.S. in Physics/B.S. in Civil Engineering B.S. in Physics/B.S. in Computer Engineering B.S. in Physics/B.S. in Electrical Engineering B.S. in Physics/B.S. in Mechanical Engineering Students in the program complete all of the College Core Curriculum requirements, with the exception of the foreign language requirement, from which they are exempted. (Their required mathematics and science courses automatically satisfy the Core's Foundations of Scientific Inquiry requirements.) There is usually some flexibility concerning the semester in which a given course can be taken, and students with Advanced Placement credit may be able to lighten some of their semester course loads and/or have room for more electives. Detailed programs of study for each of the degree combinations are available on the program website for reference. 175 ENGINEERING COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDUAL-DEGREE PROGRAM IN ENGINEERING The Program Students accepted into the program spend their first three years of study in the College of Arts and Science. In the first year at the College, the different curricula require many of the same foundational courses. This gives students time to consult with faculty in both CAS and the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering before committing themselves to a particular science/engineering major combination. In the first three years of the program, students satisfy their College Core Curriculum requirements (except foreign language) and also take some of the engineering courses in their field of interest. This is also when students select a major area from the CAS disciplines of biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and physics. After an orientation program in the spring of the third year, the final two years of study are undertaken at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering in downtown Brooklyn, across the East River and a short subway ride from NYU's Greenwich Village campus. Here, students complete the remaining technical courses required for their engineering major. Programs in engineering available to students in the dual degree program include chemical and biomolecular engineering, civil engineering, computer engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. Students may elect to withdraw from the dual degree program in engineering and complete only the College of Arts and Science Core and major requirements, thus earning one undergraduate degree from CAS. Restrictions on Taking Courses in NYU Tandon School of Engineering Several CAS departments have policies and restrictions on CAS students taking courses in Tandon, as follows. This list may be expanded in the future. In all cases, note that Tandon courses count against each student's 16-point allowance in the other divisions of NYU and cannot be applied to the 64 point UA residency requirement. Department of Chemistry: No CAS student (whether majoring or minoring in this department or not) is allowed to take Tandon substitute courses for CHEM-UA 125, 126, 127, 128 (general chemistry); 225, 226, 227, 228 (organic chemistry); 651, 652, 661 (physical chemistry); 711 (inorganic chemistry); or 881, 882, 885, 890 (biochemistry). However, students pursuing a major in the Department of Chemistry may seek prior permission of the director of undergraduate studies to take advanced electives in the School of Engineering and apply them to the major. This is reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Department of Computer Science: CAS students should take their computer science courses in the College. Students majoring or minoring in this department may seek prior permission of the director of undergraduate studies to take advanced electives in computer science in the School of Engineering and apply them to their major or minor, but such exceptions will be rare. In addition, no CAS student is permitted to minor in computer science at Tandon, as it duplicates a field of study offered in the College. However, CAS students are allowed to declare Tandon's cross-school minors in (1) computer engineering and (2) game engineering, as those areas of study are not available in CAS176 ENGLISH COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYEnglish Major, Track in Literary Studies A minimum of ten 4-point courses (40 points), completed with a grade of C or better and distributed as follows: F our required core courses.

By learning to read critically and write with analytical precision, students who major in English prepare themselves to participate actively in their culture while forging a lifelong, enriching relationship with literature. The department offers courses in a variety of historical periods from the Middle Ages through modernism and the contemporary era, as well as in a variety of topics and areas (such as literary history, critical theory, dramatic literature, theatre history, and literary culture). It also provides opportunities for specialized research through seminars, independent study, and an honors program that culminates in the writing of a scholarly thesis during the senior year under the supervision of a faculty member. In the major's new creative writing track, select seniors can also produce a special creative project in poetry, prose, or a hybrid genre. The department's Contemporary Literature Series brings noted authors to campus and into the classroom and includes an undergraduate CLS Fellows program that provides students with training in literary arts management. The department also offers its majors and minors a credit-bearing Internship Seminar for internships at magazines, publishers, literary agencies, and other organizations.

Although there are no formal tracks, courses are normally organized around the interests of a student in one of two ways: an emphasis on contemporar y European and Mediterranean societies\u2014their problems and policies; or an emphasis on contemporar y European and Mediterranean cultures\u2014their ideas, values, and artistic and literary trends. The program enables students to organize their courses around a practical or theoretical problem in contemporary European society or culture that is applicable to one or several countries. Examples of such problems are: the changing impact of politics on culture and social cleavages; changing patterns of religious expression in Europe; literary expression and social change in Europe; the European approach to urban problems; migration and ethnicity in Europe; equality and inequality in Europe; and democratic transition in Europe. The problem, for which the tools of several academic disciplines should be applicable, will be the basis for the senior research thesis. Ten 4-point courses (40 points) beyond the introductory level that deal with Europe and the Mediterranean must be completed with a C or better, as follows: T wo courses in history T wo courses in culture (literature, philosophy, art history, or cinema) T wo courses in the social sciences (politics, anthropology, sociology, or economics) T wo additional courses in any of the three preceding categories O ne senior honors seminar in European studies (EURO-UA 300) O ne independent study during the final semester, in which students complete and earn a grade for the senior thesis The interdisciplinary senior honors seminar should be taken during the first semester of the senior year.CENTER FOR European and Mediterranean Studies The Center for European and Mediterranean Studies offers an interdisciplinary major and minor in European and Mediterranean studies focusing on contemporary patterns of politics, culture, and society, as well as on historical developments in Europe. Both the major and minor are designed for students seeking preprofessional training for careers in international business and finance, diplomacy, international law, and cultural organizations dealing with Europe. Although open to all students, the minor is especially suited to majors in European languages, history, or the social sciences. The center offers and supports a wide array of activities, including lectures, workshops, and conferences dealing with both Western and Eastern Europe. New York City, which is an international focus for diplomacy, finance, media, and cultural exchange, is an ideal setting for the center and enriches its programs.196 EUROPEAN AND MEDITERRANEAN STUDIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYCENTER FOR EUROPEAN AND MEDITERRANEAN STUDIES Majors are also required to complete at least one semester of study away. Students may petition the director of the center for exemption from this requirement. Majors in European and Mediterranean studies must demonstrate advanced-level knowledge of a major European language other than English (such as French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, German, Greek, or Russian). To demonstrate this knowledge, students must successfully complete an advanced-level language course. The alternative is to take a College of Arts and Science (CAS) placement exam and score above the intermediate level. Minor All students minoring in European and Mediterranean studies must demonstrate proficiency in at least one European language above the intermediate level (such as French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, or Greek). They must also complete four 4-point courses (16 points) with a C or better as follows: one course in European history; one course in European culture (literature, philosophy, art history, or cinema); one course in social sciences (politics, anthropology, sociology, or economics); and one additional course in any of the three preceding categories. All course programs must be designed in consultation with the center's undergraduate program adviser. B.A./M.A. Program This program offers qualifying majors in European and Mediterranean studies the opportunity to earn both the B.A. and the M.A. degrees at reduced tuition cost. By completing some of their graduate requirements while still undergraduates, students can finish the program in five years. Majors may apply for admission to the program after they have completed at least 48 points in the College, but not more than 96 credits or six semesters. Applications are reviewed by the Graduate Admission Committee of the Center for European and Mediterranean Studies, using the normal criteria for the M.A. program, except that applicants are not required to take the GRE. The committee bases its decision on students' undergraduate records and recommendations of NYU instructors. Eight graduate courses are required, and students choose from three tracks\u2014European politics and policy, European culture and society, and Mediterranean studies. The master's thesis may be a revision of the senior thesis project. COURSES European and Mediterranean studies is an interdis-ciplinary major. Students are encouraged to choose courses from across the College and University as they plan their program of study. However, they must always consult with a major adviser to confirm that a course or courses will count towards this major.

This practice reflects the University's longstanding commitment to the centrality of written inquiry to undergraduate education. In the twenty-first century, this centrality is more evident than ever before. Expository writing courses at NYU teach students to move from answering teachers' question to identifying and responding to questions and problems that they themselves identify. To this end, students learn to use writing as a flexible tool for: exploring ideas; taking intellectual and creative risks; analyzing data (sources, text, visual material, or empirical data); making and rethinking observations; and investigating questions and curiosities. Students also learn to think of writing as a process of consciously crafting a text that purposefully communicates an idea, finding, result, insight, or interpretation to a specific imagined audience. In addition to required writing courses for students in the College of Arts and Science, College of Nursing, Silver School of Social Work, Tisch School of the Arts, Stern School of Business, and Tandon School of Engineering, the Expository Writing Program offers elective courses for students seeking to continue their exploration of the essay genre or to develop their understanding of how to communicate their ideas effectively to a broad and diverse audience.Expository Writing Program PROGRAM All College of Arts and Science students must satisfy the expository writing requirement by taking: W riting the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1); or I nternational Writing Workshop I and II (EXPOS-UA 4 and 9), for qualifying English as a second language (ESL) students; or W riting I and II (WRI-UF 1001 and 2002 in the Liberal Studies Program), for HEOP/C-STEP students. Special sections of EXPOS-UA 1 are offered and vary by semester. Some are focused on the theme of science, health, and technology. Others are linked to topical \"streams\" (e.g., \"Writing New York\") that are available as part of the Residential College at Goddard, a by-application-only residence hall. Writing T utorial (EXPOS-UA 13) provides additional work in writing for undergraduates and is required for transfer students who do not successfully complete the University's writing proficiency exam requirement. International and English as a Second Language Students Students with non-U.S. visas who have not attended English-language high schools for four years will be placed into the appropriate writing course on the basis of a combination of standardized test scores. Some students will be placed into the International Writing Workshop I/II sequence (EXPOS-UA 4/9), successful completion of which satisfies the College Core Curriculum expository writing requirement (as well as the Core foreign language requirement). Other students will test into courses offered by the American Language Institute (ALI). All placement results must be honored. The ALI Level 7 and 8 courses are cross-listed with the Expository Writing Program and offer CAS credit. These courses are Reading and Writing Workshop I (EXPOS-UA 20/ALI Level 7) and Reading and Writing Workshop II (EXPOS-UA 21/ALI Level 8). These courses are prerequisites to the International Writing Workshop I/II course sequences for students placed into them. Students with an ALI placement below EXPOS-UA 20 (Reading and Writing Workshop I/ALI Level 7) will be required to take a more intensive program with the ALI that will affect full-time status with CAS. 199 EXPOSITORY WRITING PROGRAM COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYEXPOSITORY WRITING PROGRAM Writing the Essay EXPOS-UA 1 Required of all College of Arts and Science freshmen, and transfer students who have not completed an acceptable, equivalent course at another college.

In the sophomore year, students choose an approved departmental offering for Societies and the Social Sciences and take Expressive Culture (CORE-UA 7XX), again in either order. Students should complete the first-year FCC classes and the expository writing requirement before proceeding to the sophomore-level classes. Students in the International Writing Workshop sequence should not start their course work in the FCC until they have completed International Writing Workshop I (EXPOS-UA 4). Exemptions and Substitutions Because of the importance the faculty places on assuring every student a core experience in the Foundations of Contemporary Culture, there are no exemptions or substitutions for Texts and Ideas or Cultures and Contexts. Students who complete a designated major or minor program in the social sciences are exempt from Societies and the Social Sciences. Those who complete a designated major or minor program in the humanities are exempt from Expressive Culture. Students who complete majors in each area, who complete a joint major designated in both areas, or who complete a major in one area and a minor in the other, may satisfy both components. A list of the area designations of major and minor programs in the College of Arts and Science (CAS) may be found on the Core Curriculum website. CAS students can also satisfy Societies and the Social Sciences by completing an approved departmental course. For a current list of approved courses, consult the Core Curriculum website.The Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) sequence of the College Core Curriculum seeks to provide students with perspective and intellectual methods to comprehend the development of our human cultures. The four FCC courses introduce students to the modes of inquiry by which societies may be studied, social issues analyzed, and artistic activity explored. Together, they give undergraduates a broad methodological background on which to draw when later engaged in the more focused work of their major courses of study. As a result, students receive a richer education than any single major could provide. Through this core experience in humanistic and social-scientific inquiry the FCC framework allows students to enter into dialogue with one another despite differences in their course schedules, and in this way also encourages lifelong habits of intellectual curiosity and engagement. As they learn the sound employment of the academic approaches at the center of their FCC classes, students develop their abilities to read critically, think rigorously, and write effectively. By building these skills and an appreciation of the diversity of human experience, the FCC seeks to prepare students for their continued learning in and beyond college, for active participation in their communities, and for lives in a rapidly changing world. All FCC courses are taught by regular faculty, including some of the University's most distinguished professors. In addition to two lectures a week, every FCC course includes weekly recitation sections, allowing for small-group discussion of the readings, close attention to students' written work, and personal concern for students' progress.202 FOUNDATIONS OF CONTEMPORARY CULTURE COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYFOUNDATIONS OF CONTEMPORARY CULTURE In addition to the information below, detailed descriptions of each year's course offerings may be found on the Core Curriculum website.

It also imparts strong analytical and interpretative skills and an enhanced understanding of cross-cultural change and contrasts. The major is highly structured, but also flexible, so as to be adaptable to the skills, knowledge, and interests of individual students. Students design a coherent yet personalized sequence of courses in consultation with their departmental adviser (appointed upon declaring the major). A semester- or year-long stay in the NYU Paris program is an integral dimension of the major. If this proves impossible, summer study is highly advised. The director of undergraduate studies assigns each major a permanent faculty adviser within the department. The adviser helps the student plan a course of study in line with his or her interests (literature, culture, Francophone). Majors must meet with their adviser at least once per semester to obtain clearance for the following semester. When students are abroad, the process takes place via email. The prerequisite for admission to the program is a satisfactory knowledge of the French language. This is normally interpreted as the completion of Conversation and Composition (FREN-UA 30) with the grade Sorkin, of French and Comparative Literature; Director, Center for French Civilization and Culture T.

Students who have equivalent language training or proficiency may satisfy the prerequisite with the CAS placement examination. Students who wish to major or minor in German must register with the department and have their programs approved by the director of undergraduate studies or the director of language programs. Majors and minors will be assigned a departmental adviser, usually the director of undergraduate studies, with whom they should consult before registering each semester. The major in German literature and culture consists of eight 4-point courses (32 points) at the 100 level or higher, three of which may be in English and represent a coherent area of concentration (such as history, politics, or philosophy); courses in English outside of the department must have approval of the program adviser. No courses may be counted toward the requirements of another major or minor. All courses must be completed with a grade of C or better. The eight courses are to be distributed as follows: T wo required courses at the 100 level: G erman Conversation and Composition (GERM-UA 111) I ntroduction to German Literature (GERM-UA 152)DEPARTMENT OF German The department's undergraduate program offers a broad range of courses in the language, cultures, and literatures of German-speaking countries. The department offers a major in German literature and culture, a joint major in German and linguistics, and a minor in German language. Along with its German language program, the department offers interdisciplinary courses taught in English that address issues of German culture, history, philosophy, art, and literature for students not yet proficient in the German language. The department sponsors the activities of the German club, Goethes Tisch, as well as a series of annual awards in recognition of outstanding achievement by undergraduate students in the study of German language and literature. Deutsches Haus, the German cultural center at NYU, provides a varied program of films, concerts, lectures, and exhibitions. The Department of German places high priority on fostering personal contact between faculty and students, maintains small class sizes (15 or fewer students, on average), and offers comfortable spaces for socializing, studying, and holding informal meetings. Advanced courses and some basic language courses are taught by full-time faculty members, all of whom are also involved in student advising.226 GERMAN COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF GERMAN O ne optional third course at the 100 level, chosen from the following: A dvanced Composition and Grammar (GERM-UA 114) G erman 1890-1989 (GERM-UA 133) T echniques of T ranslation (GERM-UA 153) F ive or six courses above the 100 level (three of which may be in English) Students are strongly encouraged to fulfill some of the program requirements through a semester or year of study away.

Honors Program in German Majors in German can be admitted to the program on the basis of superior work after at least two semesters of study in German at the advanced level. The minimum eligibility requirements are a cumulative and major GPA of 3.65. Both the director of undergraduate studies and the director of the honors program review all applications, which are due no later than spring of junior year and must include an unmarked copy of a paper submitted for a German major course. In the senior year, students accepted to the honors program complete a two-course, 8-credit sequence, consisting of Senior Honors Seminar (GERM-UA 999) in the fall semester and Honors Thesis (GERM-UA 500) in the spring semester. 227 GERMAN COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF GERMAN The Senior Honors Seminar is a small workshop with a primary focus on research, methodology, and academic writing. Students also learn strategies for grant writing and presentation. Honors majors define a thesis topic, develop a bibliography, read broadly in their area, and begin their research and writing. A substantial portion of the research, usually including a rough draft of one-third to one-half of the thesis, should be completed by semester's end. During the spring semester of the senior year, students enroll in Honors Thesis (GERM-UA 500). In close consultation with the thesis advisor, students work on completing research, a final draft, and revisions of the thesis. Students also choose a second reader, typically another faculty member from the department. In cases of an interdisciplinary thesis, the second reader may be from another department. The finished thesis must be a work of scholarship and/or criticism in the field of German studies and should be from 40 to 60 double-spaced pages in length. If it is written in English, the student must also write an abstract of approximately five pages in German. There will also be a presentation and oral defense of the senior thesis with a minimum of the student's two readers. In consultation with the second reader, the student's advisor determines whether or not to recommend him or her for honors. A grade of at least A-minus is required for the award of honors in German. Students receiving a lower grade will simply be awarded 8 credits of coursework towards the major. Departmental Awards The Department of German sponsors a series of annual awards in recognition of excellence and achievement in the study of German: the Auguste Ulfers Memorial Prize, the Donald Parker Prize, and the Ernst Rose-G. C. L. Schuchard Anniversary Prize. For further information, see the honors and awards section of this bulletin. Combined B.A./M.A. Program in German The B.A./M.A. program in German is designed to prepare students for career choices requiring advanced knowledge of German language, literature, and culture or a sophisticated understanding of the German intellectual and critical traditions. The four-year undergraduate component of the program includes one semester of study away. Students majoring in German may apply after completion of 48 points of undergraduate work, with at least 16 of these points completed at NYU, but not more than 96 points. They must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies for application to the combined degree program. Students must meet the following minimum requirements for admission: a GPA of at least 3.5 overall and at least 3.6 in German; satisfactory completion at NYU (by the start of the first semester in the program) of at least two 4-point courses in German at the advanced level; and evidence of overall language competency in German sufficient for successful advanced undergraduate and graduate study Undergraduates accepted into the B.A./M.A. program are required to spend at least one semester studying away in one of the NYU exchange programs in a German-speaking country. The study away requirement may be waived by the department in consideration of special circumstances. Summer study in an approved program may be used to satisfy the study away requirement. Students are required at the end of the fifth year of the program to submit a master's thesis, which should represent the culmination of a longer-term research effort. Facilities and Activities Deutsches Haus at NYU: Located directly across the street from the department at 42 Washington Mews, Deutsches Haus provides a broad program of cultural and intellectual enrichment for students of German through lectures, concerts, films, exhibitions, and readings. Deutsches Haus offers students many opportunities to meet, practice their German, and learn from prominent artistic, literary, business, and political figures of German-speaking countries. German Club (Goethes Tisch): This student-run group is open to interested undergraduates at all levels of German language ability. Goethes Tisch sponsors several activities each month during the academic year, including conversation hours, films, restaurant visits, and parties.228 GERMAN COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF GERMAN Study Away Students pursuing the major in German are strongly encouraged to complete some of the requirements by spending a semester or year away.

T races basic themes and examines narrative, dramatic, and lyric structures in poetry.T opics in 19th-Century Literature GERM-UA 397 Offered periodically. 4 points. Emanines various intersections between cultural, social, and scientific discourse. Study of German novellas and drama from romanticism to realism and naturalism with a focus on form, genre, and narrativity. Advanced Seminars Conducted in German (400 Level) These courses examine authors, groups of works, and intellectual, aesthetic, and social movements of particular significance in the development of German literature and culture. These courses have a narrower focus than do those at the 300 level; the emphasis is on in-depth examination rather than on overview. Readings are longer and more linguistically demanding than those used at the previous level. Language work focuses on conjecture and the expression of abstract concepts, in both written and spoken German. Goethe GERM-UA 455 Offered periodically. 4 points. Examines Goethe as the pivotal literary figure of his time. Considers Goethe's prose, poetry, and drama from the late Enlightenment through storm and stress to classicism and beyond. The Age of Goethe GERM-UA 456 Offered periodically. 4 points. Examines German reaction to the Enlightenment in the literature of storm and stress and of classi-cism. Considers irrationalism, social protest, and Humanit\u00e4tsdichtung as successive stages of the expansion of consciousness in an age in which Goethe was the central, but not the only significant, literary figure. Readings include Herder, Von der Urpoesie der V\u00f6lker poems; and H\u00f6lderlin, selected poems. Faust GERM-UA 457 Offered periodically. 4 points. Examines the figure of Faust in legend and literature, beginning with its first appearance in the 16th cen-tury. Discussion of the influence of Faust in German and other European literary traditions. Readings include excerpts from the 1587 Historia von D. Johann Fausten; Goethe's Urfaust and his later dramatic versions (Faust, Ein Fragment; Faust I and II); and Thomas Mann's Doktor Faustus.232 GERMAN COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF GERMAN Literature of the Weimar Period GERM-UA 468 Offered periodically. 4 points. The chaotic Weimar period (1918-33) began with revolution and ended with the Nazi takeover. German modernism evolved from expression-ism to the aesthetics of \"new sobriety\" (Neue Sachlichkeit). From the more traditional (Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse) to the experimental and revolutionary (Bertolt Brecht, Anna Seghers), the works of this period problematize its subsequent glorification as the golden '20s. Readings include works by Brecht, Hesse, Roth, Seghers, Klaus Mann, and Thomas Mann. Seminar on 19th-Century Authors GERM-UA 487 Offered periodically. 4 points. Seminar on 20th-Century Authors GERM-UA 488 Offered periodically. 4 points. Each of these seminars provides advanced students of German with an in-depth knowledge of one major author of either the 19th or 20th century. Works by the chosen author are examined in terms of how he or she contributes to, and possibly challenges, prevailing aesthetic, political, and cultural trends of his or her time.Honors, Internship, and Independent Study Honors Thesis GERM-UA 500 Prerequisite: permission of the department.

This unique structure responds to the ever-increasing demand for interdisciplinary public health practitioners both in the U.S. and abroad. The coursework is integrated with experiential learning and study away requirements to ensure that students are broadly trained and uniquely prepared for a variety of careers. The majors' global public health courses are offered by the NYU College of Global Public Health (CGPH; 41 East 11th Street, 7th floor; www.publichealth.nyu.edu). The CGPH delivers truly interdisciplinary public health education at the undergraduate, master's, and doctoral level. It builds on the global reach of NYU's unique Global Network University; draws strength from the entrepreneurial spirit of NYU's many talented faculty and students; and serves as a conduit for groundbreaking research and education that advances and promotes equitable health for all. COMBINED MAJORS IN Global Public Health PROGRAM Overview and Global Public Health Core Courses Students in CAS may choose one of the following combinations for a GPH major: G lobal public health/anthropology (B.A.) G lobal (B.A.) G lobal public health/sociology (B.A.) G lobal public health and science (B.S., with a choice of three concentrations): B iology concentration Chemistr y concentration P rehealth concentration (open only to CAS students who entered CAS before summer 2015) In all of these majors, students must take six 4-point courses (24 points) in the core public health areas: H ealth and Society in a Global Context (UGPH-GU 10) B iostatistics for Public Health (UGPH-GU 20) E pidemiology for Global Health (UGPH-GU 30) H ealth Policy in a Global World (UGPH-GU 40) E nvironmental Health in a Global World (UGPH-GU 50) U ndergraduate Experiential Learning in Global Public Health (UGPH-GU 60) In the GPH/biology concentration, students substitute BIOL-UA courses in biostatistics and epidemiology for UGPH-GU 20 and 30 (see details below). Besides these six required GPH courses, students also take courses in their chosen field within CAS, with the exact number of courses varying by major and concentration (see below for the exact requirements for each track). Students fill out their coursework with two relevant electives in global public health and/or the CAS COMBINED MAJORS IN GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH 234 GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYdisciplinary field (chosen in consultation with a CAS departmental adviser to compliment individual interests and career paths). Every combined GPH major must take one course in a foreign language past the intermediate level and study away for one semester at an NYU global academic center. The language requirement is set by CAS, not by the College of Global Public Health (CGPH). To satisfy the requirement, students may also use AP or other advanced standing credit that is equivalent to completion of one course above intermediate two. Alternatively, they may take an NYU language placement exam and place into the second course above intermediate two. Programs of study are planned with the director of undergraduate studies in the chosen CAS department. The e-mail address for general inquiries from CAS students is cas.gph@nyu.edu. General Policies Applying to the Combined Global Public Health Majors CAS students are allowed to count 16 points from the other schools of the University toward the baccalaureate degree. Four of the six core UGPH-GU courses required for the combined GPH majors are treated as liberal arts courses and therefore do not count against the 16-point allowance: UGPH-GU 10, 20, 30, and 50. (These four courses are exempt from the 16-point rule both for declared GPH majors and also for CAS students who simply take one or more of them as electives.) The two required GPH core courses UGPH-GU 40 and 60 are not exempt from the 16-point rule, and together use up 8 points of each student's 16-point allowance. Any other UGPH-GU courses besides 10, 20, 30, and 50 will also count against the 16 points. Students may petition for additional non-CAS, non-liberal arts credits beyond the 16-point limit through the Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards in the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140; www.cas.nyu.edu/page/petitions. No UGPH-GU courses can count toward the 64 credits that internal or external transfer students are required to complete in CAS (-UA) courses. Students must earn a C or better in all courses for their combined major and maintain a 2.0 major GPA. Courses graded pass/fail cannot be counted toward the major. The GPH tracks with anthropology, history, and sociology all satisfy the College Core Curriculum require- ment in Societies and the Social Sciences. However, the GPH concentrations in science do not satisfy this requirement. None of the UGPH-GU courses can exempt students from any part of the Core's Foundations of Contemporary Culture. Transfer Student Policies Applying to the Combined Global Public Health Majors T ransfer students to CAS must complete at least half of their entire combined GPH major at NYU, with at least half of the CAS coursework required for the major completed at NYU. In addition, the CGPH requires that transfer credit cannot be used for more than one of the six core GPH requirements (the other five must always be completed at NYU). The internship course (UGPH-GU 60) can never be satisfied with transfer credit. Applicants to schools of the health professions who are pursuing one of the science GPH majors must complete at least five of the required prehealth science courses at NYU in order to be eligible for a committee interview and letter from the CAS Preprofessional Advising Center. Some transfer students may therefore be required to complete more than half of their GPH major at NYU to satisfy these policies, regardless of transfer coursework presented. Global Public Health/Anthropology The major provides interdisciplinary training that embraces the natural convergence of society, culture, and health, and draws on the Department of Anthropology's strength in bridging the social sciences, natural sciences, and humanities. A major in global public health/anthropology prepares students to analyze various cultural traditions through the lens of health; to examine complex relationships within economic, political, cultural, physical, and biological environments; and to apply anthropological approaches to public health problems. The major is designed to prepare students for multidisciplinary careers in a variety of settings and/or for advanced academic training in public health, anthropology or other related fields.COMBINED MAJORS IN GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH 235 GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYThis major requires fifteen 4-point courses (60 points) completed with a C or better, as follows. S ix required 4-point UGPH-GU courses (24 points; as outlined above) O ne foreign language course past the intermediate two level (4 points).

Global Public Health/History The global public health/history major provides a unique opportunity to unite the study of human experience in relation to particular times and places with the study of the health of populations around the world. The COMBINED MAJORS IN GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH 237 GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYmajor draws on the expertise of the CAS Department of History in providing students with the tools needed to analyze and interpret many different kinds of evidence\u2014cultural, social, economic, and political\u2014and to organize them into a coherent whole, presented clearly in written or oral form. Students will study a variety of topics such as environmental history, ethnicity, sexuality, gender, and social movements. NYU's global public health/history major provides a unique set of skills that may be applied in a variety of careers including law, teaching, public health, business, film, international affairs, and medicine and science. This major requires fifteen 4-point courses (60 points) with a grade of C or better, as follows. Six required 4-point UGPH-GU courses (24 points; as outlined above) O ne foreign language course past the intermediate two level (4 points). This requirement is set by CAS, not by the College of Global Public Health (CGPH).

Global Public Health/Prehealth Note: this major cannot be declared by students who matriculate in CAS in or after summer 2015. Students pursuing this combined program will complete courses to fulfill the global public health/science major with a concentration in prehealth. The major prepares them to pursue professional studies in medicine, dentistry, public health, and nutrition, and encourages them to view the healthcare professions within a larger context. Students should contact gph.prehealth@nyu.edu or Dean Julie Avina (julie.avina@nyu.edu) for all advising matters.T ransfer students to CAS must complete at least half of this combined GPH major at NYU, with at least half of the CAS coursework required for the major completed at NYU. In addition, the CGPH requires that transfer credit cannot be used for more than one of the six core GPH requirements (the other five must be completed at NYU). Applicants to schools of the health professions must complete at least five of the required prehealth science courses at NYU in order to be eligible for a committee interview and letter from the CAS Preprofessional Advising Center. Therefore, some transfer students may be required to complete more than half of the global public health/prehealth major at NYU to satisfy both of these rules, regardless of transfer coursework presented. The major in GPH/science with a concentration in prehealth requires twenty courses (87 points) with a grade of C or better, as follows.

Courses taken in NYU's Arts and Science summer program in Athens count toward the major as regular courses. A solid foundation in the modern Greek language is a requirement for all majors. Upon declaring the major, a student is expected to enroll in Elementary Modern Greek I (HEL-UA 103) or take a placement examination. By the end of their program, all students must demonstrate competence in modern Greek at the intermediate level through successful completion of two semesters of Intermediate Modern Greek (HEL-UA 105, 106) or performance on a placement examination. Major: Programs of Study Qualified students may choose from three areas of concentration (tracks) within the major: Track A: Language, Literature, and Culture This track provides students with a solid foundation in the modern Greek language and provides a comprehensive introduction to medieval and modern Greek literature and culture.PROGRAMFACULTYProfessors Fleming, Mitsis Associate Professor SmyrlisClinical Professor Kowalzig, New York, NY 10003-6653 Phone: 212-998-3990 Director of the Program Clinical Professor Theodoratou Director of Language Programs Clinical Professor TheodoratouDirector of Arts and Science Summer in Athens Clinical Professor TheodoratouThe Alexander S. Onassis Program in Hellenic Studies provides students with a comprehensive and interdisciplinary understanding of the language, literature, history, and politics of Greece. Through a wide range of courses, students are exposed to a polyphony of viewpoints that help elucidate the historical and political experiences of Byzantine, Ottoman, and modern Greece; the ways in which Greece has borne its several pasts and translated them into the modern era; Greece and its relations to Western Europe, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Mediterranean cultures; and the distinguished literary and artistic traditions of a country that many regard as the birthplace of Western civilization, even as these traditions exhibit their multicultural contexts. NYU's Arts and Science summer program in Athens combines classroom study of the language, history, and culture of Greece with extracurricular activities and excursions that introduce students to all aspects of Greek life. The program offers a wide range of courses on such subjects as the Greek language, Greek literature and photography, Greek drama, Greek political history, the city of Athens, and the archaeology of Greece. Classes are held at the Al Andar Center, a three-story Bauhaus building located in the historical center of Athens. Activities include walking tours of Athens, visits to monuments and museums, and evening outings to dramatic and musical performances. Weekend excursions include trips to several Greek islands and to important historical and archaeological sites. Relevant courses taken in this summer program count toward the major or minor as regular courses.ALEXANDER S. ONASSIS PROGRAM IN Hellenic Studies252 HELLENIC STUDIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYALEXANDER S. ONASSIS PROGRAM IN HELLENIC STUDIES Track B: Politics and History This track provides students with an interdisciplinary social science perspective on the medieval and modern Greek experience. Students may choose to concentrate their studies in history or politics, or create their own combination in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. Track C: The Classical Legacy This track provides students with an interdisciplinary perspective on the reception of classical Greek thought in postclassical Greece. Students in tracks A and B who have placed out of Intermediate Modern Greek I and II (HEL-UA 105, 106) are encouraged to take Advanced Modern Greek I and II (HEL-UA 107, 108). T rack C students who place out of Intermediate Modern Greek are encouraged to take Advanced Modern Greek I and II (HEL-UA 107, 108), or two semesters of ancient Greek in the Department of Classics. All majors, regardless of their track, must complete: the Seminar on Modern Greek Culture (HEL-UA 130); and two specifically designated survey courses offered within the program. Which two survey courses they choose depends on the disciplinary concentration (track) that they select. Every student must take at least one designated survey course in his or her own track of concentration and one designated survey course from another track. (Students in track A should also take a track B survey; students in track B should also take a track A survey; and students in track C should also take one survey in track A or B.) The following is a list of designated survey courses:Track A Memory, History, and Language in Modern Greek Poetry (HEL-UA 120) Narrative, History, and Fiction in the Modern Greek Novel (HEL-UA 190) Track B Modern Greek History (HEL-UA 159) History of the Byzantine Empire (HEL-UA 283) Modern Greek Politics (HEL-UA 525) Track C Memory, History, and Language in Modern Greek Poetry (HEL-UA 120) Greek T ragedy and Modern Greece (HEL-UA 320) Electives Additional Hellenic studies courses are required to reach the total of ten courses for the major. The exact number of electives varies according to a student's level of language proficiency upon entrance to the major. Subject to the approval of the director of undergraduate studies, cognate offerings in other departments or an approved internship may be counted toward the major. A sample list of cognate courses is available from the program office. Minor A minor in Hellenic studies requires four 4-point courses (16 points) offered by the program and competed with a grade of C or better.

It is also a method of thinking characterized by its attention to the contexts in which people have lived and worked. By mastering this method of thinking, students of history gain invaluable skills and knowledge. They learn to analyze and interpret many different kinds of evidence (cultural, social, economic, and political) as well as to organize it into a coherent whole and present it clearly and with style in written or oral form. In doing so, students also learn to justify and question their own and others' conclusions, for history is always an argument about what actually happened. Indeed, rethinking and revising accepted historical conclusions is one of the most important\u2014and most interesting\u2014tasks of the historian. Notable among the department's areas of strength are American urban, social, labor, and ethnic history; medieval, early modern, and modern European history; Latin American history; sub-Saharan African history; early and modern Asian History; and American and European women's history. The department also pays particular attention to the transnational and global aspects of the discipline. At the core of the undergraduate experience are Historical Interpretation (HIST-UA 101) and the capstone seminar. In Historical Interpretation, students learn about the practice of history through both lectures and the recitation experience. In the capstone seminar, usually taken in the senior year, students research and write an original paper (typically 20-25 pages). Through independent study and the honors program, students may find challenging opportunities for special concentrations and individual research. The internship program enables students to engage in supervised historical projects for credit. Many of the projects are at cultural institutions in New York and at the United Nations. The University's Elmer Holmes Bobst Library is rich in works of history, and students also utilize the collections of the New York Public Library, the historical societies and museums in New York City, and neighboring universities.DEPARTMENT OF History256 HISTORY COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF HISTORY Clinical Associate Professors Naftali, TruxesAssociated Faculty Abercrombie, Lerner, Nelson, Robin, Stasavage Major in History The major in history requires a minimum of nine 4-point courses (36 points), with a grade of C or better in each course. All majors must take H istorical Interpretation (HIST-UA 101). The r emaining eight courses are to be distributed among three fields of history\u2014U.S., European, and non-Western (Latin American, Near Eastern, African, and Asian)\u2014so that the student will complete at least two courses in each field. S tudents must also take one capstone seminar (HIST-UA 400-499; prerequisite: HIST-UA 101). O ne course must be in a period before 1800. N o student may take more than three introductory courses (numbered below HIST-UA 100). Note that transfer students must take at least five history courses (20 points) in this department. Certain courses in the College Core Curriculum may also count toward the history major as introductory courses. These are Texts and Ideas and Cultures and Contexts, if they are taught by professors in the Department of History. Also, majoring in history exempts students from taking the Societies and the Social Sciences component of the Core Curriculum. T wo Liberal Studies courses, Social Foundations I and II, may count toward the major and fulfill the pre-1800 and a European requirement. No other LS courses may count toward the major. These courses count as introductory. Global Public Health/History Major The global public health/history major provides a unique opportunity to unite the study of human experience in relation to particular times and places with the study of health of populations around the world. The major draws on the expertise of the CAS Department of History in providing students with the tools needed to analyze and interpret many different kinds of evidence\u2014cultural, social, economic, and political\u2014and to organize them into a coherent whole, presented clearly in written or oral form. Students will study a variety of topics, such as environmental history, ethnicity, sexuality, epidemiology, health policy, gender, and social movements. NYU's global public health/history major provides a unique set of skills that may be applied in a variety of careers including law, teaching, public health, business, film, international affairs, and medicine and science. This major requires fifteen 4-point courses (60 points) with a grade of C or better, as follows.Global public health requirements (seven courses/28 points): H ealth and Society in a Global Context (UGPH-GU 10) B iostatistics for Public Health (UGPH-GU 20) E pidemiology for Global Health (UGPH-GU 30) H ealth Policy in a Global World (UGPH-GU 40) E nvironmental Health in a Global World (UGPH-GU 50) GP H Internship (UGPH-GU 60) O ne semester of advanced foreign language (above intermediate II level). Students who present AP or other advanced standing credit that is equivalent to completion of at least one course above intermediate two have satisfied the requirement. Students who take an NYU language placement exam and PROGRAM257 HISTORY COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF HISTORY demonstrate proficiency equivalent to completion of at least one course above the intermediate two level (i.e., they at least place into the second course above intermediate two) have also met this requirement. O ne semester of study away is also required. History requirements (two courses/8 points): H istorical Interpretation (HIST-UA 101) 400-499) History electives (four courses/16 points): F our courses numbered above HIST-UA 101. Students must take at least one pre-1800 course and at least one course in each of these three regions: U.S., non-Western, and European. Combined major: T wo courses chosen from history and/or GPH. For descriptions of GPH (UGPH-GU) courses and for all policies applying to the major (including those for transfer students), please see the global public health section of this Bulletin. Minor in History The minor in history requires at least four 4-point courses (16 points) completed with a grade of C or better, of which three courses (12 points) must be taken in the Department of History. No more than 4 points may be taken in introductory-level courses. Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and other advanced standing credit does not count toward the minor. Note: Students should consult the director of undergraduate studies for possible minor programs, course offerings, and course descriptions. A complete listing of history courses currently offered may be found in the current class schedule available on the department website. Honors Program Students with strong academic records (a GPA of 3.65 in history and 3.65 overall) may apply to the director of undergraduate studies for admission to the history honors program. Students must be declared history majors or have already taken Historical Interpretation (HIST-UA 101) to apply for the two-course, 8-point program. The honors program is completed in two consecutive semesters and consists of a small Honors Seminar (HIST-UA 994) followed by an individualized Honors T utorial (HIST-UA 996). In the Honors Seminar (which satisfies the capstone seminar requirement for the major) students define a thesis topic, develop a bibliography, read broadly, and begin their research. A substantial part of the research, usually including a rough draft of the thesis, should be completed by the semester's end. In the Honors T utorial, students work one-on-one with a faculty director to complete the thesis. The honors thesis varies in length from 40 to 70 pages, depending on the nature and scope of the subject. The completed thesis, approved for defense by the director, is defended before a committee consisting of a primary faculty advisor and at least one additional faculty reader. A grade of at least A-minus on the thesis is required for the award of honors in history. Students who receive a lower passing grade are simply awarded 8 points toward the major. Study Away The department encourages history majors and minors to study away during the fall or spring semester of their junior year. Studying away at one of New York University's many global academic centers can help open doors to the discovery of unexpected areas of interest, as well as provide new insight about already established historical perspectives and research topics. Some courses offered by NYU for study away, as well as other approved programs outside NYU, may be eligible for inclusion into the history major. History majors should consult the director of undergraduate studies before making plans to study away.258 HISTORY COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF HISTORY Some courses originate in other departments and are cross-listed with the Department of History, as indicated below.

The number of students who can be admitted is limited to 25 to 30 per year. Criteria for admission include: a strong academic record at NYU (GPA of 3.65 or better), completion of International Politics (POL-UA 700) and either Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) or Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2), and a solid one page senior thesis proposal. A briefing session on the IR honors major is held every September; freshmen and sophomores should attend the briefing session to learn more about the application process and requirements. Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and A Level Credits Students with advanced standing credits for macroeconomics and/or microeconomics may use them for application to the IR major. However, if accepted to the program, these credits will not count toward the IR major; students in IR must take both Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) and Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2). Alternatively, these students may take additional economics courses for the IR major (if they meet prerequisites). Please note that statistics credit from AP , IB, or A Levels does not satisfy the IR major's statistics requirement. Transfer Students Both external and internal transfer students should meet with the IR undergraduate student adviser (in the Department of Politics) to have their records reviewed and to receive a preliminary assessment of their prospects of being admitted to this major. Internal transfers still apply in their sophomore year.

The program recognizes the changing nature of the contemporary political and economic environment and seeks to lay an interdisciplinary basis for understanding these changes. It provides students with an opportunity to study the complex web of transnational politics in an in-depth, interdisciplinary fashion. The breadth of courses is designed to match the breadth of knowledge and skills that the field requires. Fluency in a foreign language and a semester of study away are required of all majors to help ensure that they acquire a deeper understanding of a country's culture and institutions. In their junior or senior year, majors are also encouraged, though not required, to take advantage of the many internship opportunities that are available in New York City to students of international relations.270 INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYMAJOR IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS Major: General Information As this is an honors major, students must maintain both a major and overall GPA of 3.65 or better and complete an honors thesis in their senior year. All majors must complete a total of fourteen 4-point courses (56 points). They complete four core courses, four courses in the international relations environment, and two courses in a regional specialization. Students must also demonstrate proficiency in a foreign language (two courses past the intermediate level) and complete a full semester (not a summer session) in a study away program. Finally, students must complete the two-course senior honors sequence. Core Courses for the Major All international relations majors must take the following four courses (advanced standing credits are not accepted): I ntroduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) I nternational Politics (POL-UA 700) Q uantitative Methods in Political Science (POL-UA 800) Students who matriculated in CAS before fall 2015 may substitute one of the following courses for Quantitative Methods in Political Science, but are strongly advised to take POL-UA 800 (students matriculating in CAS in and after fall 2015 may not substitute any of the courses below for POL-UA 800): S tatistics (ECON-UA 18) S tatistics for the Behavioral Sciences (PSYCH-UA 10) S tatistics for Social Research (SOC-UA 302) International Relations Environment Requirement Majors must complete four courses under this heading. See under course offerings. Regional Specialization Requirement Majors must complete two courses focusing on a particular world region in a variety of disciplines, including economics, history, politics, sociology, and area studies. These courses are normally taken during the term away. Whether taken at Washington Square or away, both courses must be approved in advance by the program director or the undergraduate advisor for IR. We do not accept courses in art, art history, film, etc. for this requirement. Foreign Language Requirement Students satisfy this requirement by completing two courses beyond the intermediate level. It is recommended but not required that the language be related to the regional specialization and/or the study away site. If a student considers himself or herself fluent in a foreign language, he or she can 1) complete the requirement with a third language or 2) take two advanced courses (literature or advanced translation) in the foreign language of the student's fluency. In either case, the student must take two courses past the intermediate level; we do not waive this requirement for the IR major. Senior Honors Requirement The IR major is an honors track with emphasis on quantitative methods and techniques. All majors must complete the requirements for departmental honors by taking the two semester Senior Seminar sequence (INTRL-UA 990, 991) and researching and writing a thesis. Study Away Requirement All majors in IR must spend a semester (not a summer session) at an NYU global academic center or at one of the universities with which NYU has an exchange agreement.

The study of Irish society and culture provides students with an understanding of Ireland's historical experience: its colonial past; its contribution to literature, both medieval and modern; its far-reaching effect in the modern world through its diaspora; and its dual language tradition and rival national narratives. The Irish studies minor at NYU offers an interdisciplinary program providing students with the opportunity to study and pursue directed research in the history and culture of Ireland and Irish America, exploring such areas as literature, history, drama, politics, art, cinema studies, music, and the Irish language. A faculty of internationally renowned scholars is supplemented by the regular presence of prominent visiting professors. In addition to the program at Washington Square, the Arts and Science summer program in Dublin gives students the opportunity to study in Ireland. Through the generosity of Lewis L. and Loretta Brennan Glucksman, two landmark houses in Washington Mews were renovated to serve as the home for Ireland House. Since its official opening in 1993, Glucksman Ireland House has become one of the most vibrant centers of Irish and Irish American arts and learning in North America. It offers a lively array of programs that are free to students, including evening courses, public lectures, conferences, films, exhibits, and readings.

It is housed in the historic Casa Italiana Zerilli-Marim\u00f2, the center for Italian cultural and social activities at NYU and in lower Manhattan. The faculty has tremendous breadth in all areas of Italian literature, language, and culture. Students in the Italian studies program can take courses on such topics as women writers, literature and cinema, science and the arts, Dante and medieval culture, translation, Italian American studies, and immigration. Many students choose to write senior honor theses and benefit enormously from one-on-one work with our faculty as well as from an end-of-the-year research symposium. Classes are conducted in both Italian and English. Majors and minors are encouraged to spend at least one semester at Villa La Pietra at NYU Florence to enrich their study of Italian language, literature, and culture. They are also able to study in New York with eminent visiting professors from Italy. Graduates of the Italian Studies program are well-prepared to overcome the barriers of monolingualism that frequently inhibit participation in an increasingly multicultural society. An Italian studies major or minor is also excellent preparation for a variety of careers, including international business, journalism, fashion, teaching, the culinary arts, and the entertainment field. Alumni have pursued Italian studies in graduate schools around the world, and have gone on to both law and medical school. DEPARTMENT OF Italian Studies277 ITALIAN STUDIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF ITALIAN STUDIES Capstone Project Option for Non-Honors Majors Majors in the department who do not choose or qualify to write a senior honors thesis (see below) may pursue this option, which is not a requirement for the major. Developed in conjunction with a faculty member in the junior or senior year, the capstone consists of a research paper or research project, as well as a final oral defense/discussion of the project in Italian. The capstone does not require a separate course or independent study, but rather is developed within a class in which the student is already enrolled. The project is completed in addition to the existing course requirements (whether a final paper written in the Italian language, extra pages added to a research paper, a creative project such as a film or film script, etc.). The department's spring undergraduate conference offers an ideal venue for the presentation of outstanding capstone projects. Policies Applying to the Major All courses for the major must be completed with a grade of C or better and cannot be taken on a pass/fail basis.

We want to educate those who agree. Opportunities abound in the media world, but the opportunity to do compelling work that informs, engages\u2014and matters\u2014is what drives our faculty, motivates our students, and informs our entire approach. Great journalism has always come from the great cities of the globe, and there is no better place to learn the craft than the city of New York\u2014where power and wealth concentrate, news and culture originate, and daily events fascinate. The institute immerses students in the richness and vitality of the city, while attracting to campus many of the leaders and thinkers in the journalism profession. New York City is our laboratory\u2014and our inspiration. The very first lesson we offer students is this: tap into it, with our help. Every day, students move outward from the classroom to the city, on assignments that take them all over town. The full-time faculty is itself of national stature in the journalism world. As writers, reporters, producers, and critics, NYU professors continue to practice the journalism they teach and preach, holding the profession to its highest standards of public service. Course work begins with the basic skills of reporting, writing, and research, but simultaneously students are taught what journalism at its best can be\u2014and what it should accomplish in a free and democratic society. They are also encouraged to publish their work, with assignments, internships, and online projects geared to this end. Housed within the arts and sciences core of a leading university, the institute sees journalism as an essential strand in the liberal arts tradition and a critical factor in public culture. But we also recognize that news these days is a business. When our skilled graduates enter that business, they are prepared to improve and enliven it. Institute facilities include seven state-of-the-art newsrooms, broadcast production facilities, and an array of multimedia equipment, including video cameras, still cameras, digital recorders, and all that is necessary in a rapidly changing news environment.Arthur L.

The category Latino includes people of Latin American descent in the United States. The most numerous Latino populations are of Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Cuban ancestry, but groups of other national origins are an increasing presence. Latinos are studied in comparative perspective (comparisons within Latino groupings and with other ethnic groups), as well as in transnational perspective in the Americas. Among central issues in Latino studies are the following: race and racialization across the spectrum of African American, white, and indigenous; sexuality and gender formation; immigration and migration in a climate of increased policing of international borders; electoral politics as the Latino vote has increased numerically; social movements for labor, education, and language rights; Latino/a presence in media and film; expressive and popular culture in music and the arts; language retention and invention in the United States in relation to English, Spanish, indigenous languages, and their combinations; and the failures and successes of schooling for Latinos, including bilingual education and levels of educational attainment.MAJOR/MINOR IN Latino Studies296 LATINO STUDIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYMAJOR/MINOR IN LATINO STUDIES as a Field Colloquium; one course in Latino studies designated as a Research Seminar; and six approved electives, four of which must be taught by SCA faculty. Approaches to Latino Studies (SCA-UA 501; offered periodically) or Cultures and Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures (CORE-UA 529; offered every year) may be substituted for the Field Colloquium requirement.

Language and Linguistic Competency The type of rigorous intercultural study promoted within the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis requires students to recognize the complex modes of communication at work both within and across different social groups. Latino studies therefore strongly encourages its students to develop advanced skills in Spanish, Portuguese, and/or any indigenous languages spoken in the Americas by any of the following means: taking elective courses in sociolinguistics; studying these languages beyond the minimum level required by the College of Arts and Science; pursuing community-based internship fieldwork necessitating the development and use of specific language skills; or undertaking study or research abroad in contexts entailing the exercise of key language or linguistic capabilities.

The law and society minor, administered by the Department of Sociology, offers undergraduates a meaningful concentration of these courses. The minor is designed to give students an interdisciplinary perspective on law as a social institution and on how law shapes, and is shaped by, a variety of political, religious, cultural, economic, and social forces. The minor in law and society consists of five courses, which allows it to be substantial. The requirement of a core course enhances its coherence. In addition, the minor gives capable and ambitious students opportunities to pursue advanced or specialized study. While prelaw students may well wish to take it, this minor is not aimed specifically at them. Students wishing to declare this minor should speak with the academic administrator for the Department of Sociology, 295 Lafayette Street, Room 4168; 212-998-8340. PROGRAM IN Law and Society Minor The minor in law and society consists of five 4-point courses (20 points) completed with a grade of C or better.

Students may petition the director to have other courses count toward the elective requirement. Students majoring in sociology must take Research Methods for their major; they should take a fourth elective for the law and society minor. With special permission, exceptional students may be allowed, in their senior year and in consultation with the director, to substitute one of the following for one of the elective courses: (1) an independent study culminating in a research paper or project, (2) an apprenticeship with a faculty member doing relevant research (with permission of faculty), or (3) a relevant graduate course (with permission of faculty). Courses applied to this minor cannot be double-counted toward a major or another minor.

It seeks to determine that which is necessary in human language, that which is possible, and that which is impossible. While linguists work to determine the unique qualities of individual languages, they are constantly searching for linguistic universals\u2014properties whose explanatory power reaches across languages. The discipline of linguistics is organized around syntax (the principles by which sentences are organized), morphology (the principles by which words are constructed), semantics (the study of meaning), phonetics (the study of speech sounds), phonology (the sound patterns of language), historical linguistics (the ways in which languages change over time), sociolinguistics (the interaction of language with society), psycholinguistics, and neurolinguistics (the representation of language in the brain). Current research by faculty members extends across the field, including topics in the interaction of syntax and semantics, phonetics and phonology, languages in contact, pidgin and creole languages, urban sociolinguistics, and computer analogies of syntactic processes.DEPARTMENT OF Linguistics304 LINGUISTICS COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF LINGUISTICS All linguistics majors, joint majors, and combined majors must select and register for linguistics courses with the advice of the director of undergraduate studies in the linguistics department.

Joint majors should consult with the respective directors of undergraduate studies of the participating departments. Minor in Linguistics Four courses (16 points) in linguistics with a grade of C or better in each course. Courses taken pass/fail do not count. If any course is used to fulfill the major or minor requirements in any other department or program at NYU, it may not be used simultaneously to fulfill the requirements for the linguistics minor. Recommended Work outside the Department To meet standards currently set in the linguistics field, as well as graduate school admission requirements, students majoring in linguistics are advised to gain competence in the following areas during their under-graduate studies: (1) one or more foreign languages, (2) psychology, for issues of language and the mind, and anthropology, for issues of language and culture, (3) mathematics or logic, for an understanding of modern algebra and mathematical logic, (4) philosophy of language, and (5) one or more computer languages. Majors and minors should avail themselves of the NYU study away programs. Note that any course substitution or transfer credit toward a required course for the major must be confirmed by a letter from the director of undergraduate studies.307 LINGUISTICS COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF LINGUISTICS Honors in Linguistics The Department of Linguistics offers an honors track. The requirement for graduation with honors in linguistics is an honors thesis of 40 to 50 pages, typically the culmination of a year's work, and two advanced courses chosen with the honors thesis adviser. Students who are excelling in the linguistics major are highly encouraged to develop an honors project as early as the second semester of their sophomore year. It is expected that students who pursue honors work in the Department of Linguistics have sufficient preparation and background (i.e., high-level coursework) in a field of linguistics, which is not always the case for students in the joint majors with French, German, Italian, and Spanish. Admission to the honors program is by application in the second semester of junior year. To be eligible, a student must have a GPA of 3.65 overall as well as in linguistics. Applications are due to the director of undergraduate studies by April 15 and must include a one- to two-page description of the topic that the student wishes to investigate in the senior thesis. The student must identify a faculty member in the Department of Linguistics who has agreed to supervise the project, and the description of the thesis is written in consultation with this faculty adviser. Joint Honors The Department of Linguistics offers joint honors in all programs for which it offers joint majors: language and mind, anthropology and linguistics, French and linguistics, German and linguistics, Italian and linguistics, and Spanish and linguistics. For the requirements of joint honors in anthropology and linguistics, students should see Professor Ren\u00e9e Blake.For the requirements of joint honors in language and mind, students should follow the same procedure for honors in linguistics, except that their proposal should identify faculty members from two departments in the language and mind major (linguistics, philosophy, and psychology) who will be co-advisers. The thesis topic must reflect contributions to both disciplines. Students interested in pursuing joint honors in linguistics and French, German, Italian, or Spanish should consult with the director of undergraduate studies in linguistics, as well as in the language department, in or before the second semester of their junior year.

Advanced Placement with Credit Freshmen seeking advanced placement in the mathematics major or minor may present results of the Advanced Placement (AP) Calculus AB or BC Examination. A student who earns a 4 or 5 on the Calculus AB exam (or AB subscor e) or a 4 on the Calculus BC exam will receive 4 points equivalent to Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) and will be placed into Calculus II (MATH-UA 122). A student who earns a scor e of 5 on the Calculus BC exam will receive 8 points, equivalent to both Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) and Calculus II (MATH-UA 122), and will be placed into Calculus III (MATH-UA 123). For calculus equivalencies and placement for advanced standing credit in mathematics from International Baccalaureate (HL only), A Level, and other approved international examinations, please consult the admission section of this Bulletin or a CAS adviser. Advanced Placement without Credit The department periodically gives its own advanced placement exams for students who know the material covered in Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) and/or Calculus II (MATH-UA 122) and who wish to enter Calculus II (MATH-UA 316 MATHEMATICS COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS 122) or Calculus III (MATH-UA 123). There is also an examination to pass out of Calculus III (MATH-UA 123). If a student passes any of these exams, he or she is placed into the next course of the sequence; however, no college credit is given for the courses that are skipped. Major in Mathematics The major consists of thirteen 4-point courses (52 points) numbered MATH-UA 120 or higher.

Exceptions may be made for students who have already taken Mathematics for Economics for their declared or intended economics major; they must seek the approval of the Department of Mathematics for this substitution. All other students must follow the regular calculus sequence. Students may not register simultaneously for separate courses within the two sequences. T ransformations and Geometries (MATH-UA 270) does not count toward the major. U p to two computer science courses at the level of Introduction to Computer Science (CSCI-UA 101) or higher, or up to two graduate data science (DS-GA) courses, may be counted toward the thirteen courses required for the major. The prerequisites for DS-GA courses are Calculus III (MATH-UA 123), Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 140), and programming experience in Python (preferred) or MATLAB. Probability is a recommended prerequisite. S tudents who complete the prehealth program may substitute at most two MATH-UA courses by any two of the following: General Physics I, II (PHYS-UA 11, 12) or Physics I, II (PHYS-UA 91, 93).317 MATHEMATICS COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS H owever, if these physics courses are used towards the mathematics major, the computer science or data science courses will not apply towards the major. S tudents may double-count no more than two courses toward both the mathematics major and the requirements of another major or minor. Courses taken under the pass/fail option cannot count to ward the major. A grade of C or better is required in all courses used to fulfill major requirements. In addition, majors must maintain a 2.0 mathematics GPA. S tudents may petition to enroll in graduate mathematics courses and apply them to the undergraduate major. Permission is not granted until the student has completed Analysis (MATH-UA 325) and the available undergraduate course(s) on the same topic. All mathematics majors and minors ar e required to see an undergraduate faculty adviser to review their course of study and be advised on appropriate courses for each term.

Minor in Mathematics The requirements are four 4-point courses (16 points) in the department, numbered MATH-UA 120 or higher. Courses from the sequences Calculus I, II, III (MATH-UA 121, 122, 123) and Math for Economics I, II, III (MATH-UA 211, 212, 213) cannot both be applied to the mathematics minor; students must choose one calculus sequence or the other and cannot take courses from both. They also cannot register simultaneously for separate courses within the two sequences. Although courses transferred from other colleges may count towards the minor with departmental approval, at least two courses for the minor must be taken at New York University. Students pursuing majors that require mathematics courses may follow this minor, as long as two of the four courses do not apply simultaneously to the requirements for their major. Courses taken under the pass/fail option are not counted toward the minor. A grade of C or better is required in all courses counting for the minor. Advisers are available for consultation on minor requirements before and during registration; students should consult an adviser if they have any doubt about which courses fulfill their requirements.319 MATHEMATICS COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS Joint Minor in Computer Science and Mathematics The requirements are these four courses (16 points): Calculus I and II (MA TH-UA 121, 122), or Mathematics for Economics I and II (MATH-UA 211, 212).

It focuses on the history, institutions, languages, literatures, thought, faith, art, and music of Europe, the Atlantic, and the Mediterranean world from the collapse of Roman authority to about 1700 C.E. It is during this important period\u2014which shaped and transmitted the classical heritage\u2014that the social, artistic, intellectual, and scientific culture of present-day Europe and the Middle East was formed. The curriculum in medieval and Renaissance studies links undergraduates with NYU's outstanding humani- ties faculty; with the superb libraries, museums, and collections in the New York area; and with musical and theatrical performances of works from this period that are given regularly in the city. It also enriches students' intellectual and artistic experience in College of Arts and Science programs away. Students design their own programs in consultation with the program director and faculty; they thus receive individualized attention from a center of excellence situated within the rich offerings of a great university and a vibrant city. Many majors in the Program in Medieval and Renaissance Studies have gone on to graduate work in medieval studies, early modern studies, Celtic studies, archival and/or museum studies, religious studies, history, art history, English, foreign language literatures and cultures, and music. Other majors have gone on to professional schools (medicine, law, management), as well as to careers in business and education.PROGRAM IN Medieval and Renaissance Studies MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE STUDIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITY329 MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE STUDIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYPROGRAM IN MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE STUDIES Judaic studies, Italian, Middle Eastern and Islamic studies, and Spanish and Portuguese; (2) art history; (3) history; (4) music; and (5) philosophy and religion. Other more specialized programs of study may be designed in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. Available to majors and minors is the Marco Polo T ravel Award (granted to an outstanding student each year to allow her or him to travel abroad for research), as well as a field prize for outstanding work in the major. Major: Requirements The major requires ten courses (40 points) in medieval and Renaissance studies, all completed with a grade of C or better. At least five of the ten courses must be in a single field of concentration; three courses must be in one or more secondary field(s) of concentration; and at least one must be an interdisciplinary seminar. In addition, majors are expected to demonstrate proficiency through course work or examination in a classical language (Latin, ancient Greek, Arabic, or Hebrew) and in another foreign language appropriate to their field of concentration. Students who work in later periods and for whom knowledge of two modern foreign languages is advantageous may petition the director of undergraduate studies to substitute the ancient language requirement with a second modern foreign language. Minor Five courses (20 points) completed with a grade of C or better: two courses in a single field of concentration, one course in each of two other fields of concentration, and an interdisciplinary seminar. Program Approval and Advisement The director meets with students to discuss their general educational and career aims, as well as the specific opportunities provided by the Program in Medieval and Renaissance Studies. All major and minor programs require the approval of the director of the program. Honors Program To qualify for the honors program in the medieval and Renaissance studies major, students must maintain at least a 3.65 cumulative average and a 3.65 major average. The honors track is a yearlong 8-point program, which requires students to write and orally defend a senior honors thesis. During the fall semester of their senior year, students who qualify for honors enroll in the Senior Honors Seminar (MEDI-UA 999); in the spring semester, they enroll in Honors Independent Study (MEDI-UA 998). The Senior Honors Seminar guides students through the research and writing of the thesis. In Honors Independent Study, students complete their honors theses under the supervision of a faculty mentor. Students interested in honors must consult with the director of the program by the end of junior year. Accelerated B.A./M.A. Program Qualifying students may apply to earn an accelerated B.A. in medieval and Renaissance studies and an M.A. in a related department. Interested students must consult with the director of the program. Requirements for the B.A./M.A. program are outlined in the pre-professional, accelerated, and specialized programs section of this Bulletin. Study Away The program prepares and encourages its students to complement their work in medieval and Renaissance studies with a semester at one of NYU's academic centers in Florence, London, Madrid, Paris, and Prague, or at one of the Western European exchange universities. Medieval and Renaissance studies majors should consult the director when making plans to study away.330 MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE STUDIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYPROGRAM IN MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE STUDIES This is a sampling of courses specifically designed for the Program in Medieval and Renaissance Studies.

Students use New York City and other global metropolitan centers as their laboratories for understanding the processes of urban and regional development, the major institutions of urban life, urban social move-ments, urban cultural dynamics, and the socio-environmental consequences of worldwide urbanization. The program draws on the expertise of a wide range of urban scholars within SCA and in complementary departments at NYU. In addition, faculty active in the city's government, community, and nonprofit agencies provide a unique resource for understanding the city. The major provides particularly valuable preparation for students interested in law, health, teaching, journalism, social work, architecture, city and regional planning, public policy, public administration, nonprofit administration, and community organization.

(Courses graded pass/fail cannot count toward the requirements of the major.) The major consists of two components: (1) language study and (2) non-language courses. All MEIS majors must complete at least six non-language courses (24 points); the number of language courses required for the major depends on one's beginning level of proficiency in the language chosen for study, but could be as many as four. Students who take fewer than four language courses must take more than the minimum of six non-language courses, so as to complete a full ten courses in Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies. Language Study Required for the Major To obtain the B.A. degree with a Middle Eastern and Islamic studies (MEIS) major, students must meet the College of Arts and Science (CAS) language requirement in Arabic, Hindi, Persian, T urkish, or Urdu. This means (1) studying one of these languages through at least the intermediate two level (four semesters) at NYU, (2) demonstrating the completion of approved and equivalent course work elsewhere, or (3) satisfying the CAS language requirement by taking the CAS placement exam in one of these languages. Under exceptional circumstances, the director of undergraduate studies may exempt a student from having to fulfill the language requirement, in which case the student will be required to take ten MEIS non-language courses to complete the major. In any event, every student must always complete at least ten MEIS-approved courses to satisfy requirements for the major.Professors Emeriti Chelkowski, McChesney, Mikhail, Peters Professors Ben-Dor Lecturer AggarwalAssociate Research Scholar Kazemi, Mirsepassi, Pearce, Peirce, Tawil-Souriwww.meis.as.nyu.edu 50 Washington Suite 200, New York, NY 10012-1073 Phone: 212-998-8880 Chair of the Department Professor Ben-Dor Benite Director of Undergraduate Studies Clinical Professor ErolDEPARTMENT OF Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies The Department of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies (MEIS) focuses on the past and present of a vast and culturally diverse region of the world that extends from North Africa to Central Asia and from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean. It adopts interdisciplinary and comparative approaches to Middle Eastern societies from antiquity to the present, with particular focus on the period after the emergence of Islam. A Middle Eastern and Islamic studies major offers students the opportunity to master one of the regional languages, including Arabic, Hindi, Persian, T urkish, and Urdu. Students also acquire an interdis-ciplinary understanding of this pivotal area of the world by studying with the department's specialists in history, anthropology, political science, literature, law, religious studies, and language. In addition to the courses listed below, students are encouraged to select cross-listed courses in other departments and programs that complement the department's offerings, such as anthropology, art history, comparative literature, Hebrew and Judaic studies, history, politics, religious studies, and sociology.339 MIDDLE EASTERN AND ISLAMIC STUDIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF MIDDLE EASTERN AND ISLAMIC STUDIES Non-Language Course Requirements for the Major In addition to the language requirement, majors must successfully complete at least six MEIS courses distributed across distinct fields. The six MEIS courses are to be distributed as follows. T wo core courses: To ensure broad knowledge of issues in the discipline, all majors must take two \"core courses\" among their six non-language courses. It is recommended that students take these courses before they take seminars and topics courses. Core courses are as follows: MEIS-U A 690: The Emergence of the Modern Middle East (History) MEIS-U A 697: Palestine, Zionism, and Israel (History) MEIS-U A 711: Literature and Society in the Middle East (Literature) MEIS-U A 728: Women and Gender in Islam (Religion) MEIS-U A 750: Middle East Politics (Elective) The department may choose to designate additional courses as core courses and will announce them accordingly. Core courses must be taken at Washington Square and cannot be taken while studying away at an NYU global academic center. One topics/seminar course: Among the six non-language courses, all majors must also take at least one advanced undergraduate seminar; MEIS often offers these under the \"topics\" rubric (e.g. MEIS-UA 688: Topics in Middle East History).

The major is equally ideal for students seeking careers requiring a solid liberal arts background and strong analytical and critical skills, and for students interested in humanistic fields in which sonic culture is a central element. The music major cultivates the ability to interpret and analyze music as both text and performance. It gives students a broad understanding of the various issues currently being discussed in musical thinking and research, as well as a grounding in theory and the opportunity to engage in creative work. Qualified students can undertake advanced supervised research or composition in their senior year, leading to a thesis and the award of honors in the major. The major program of study and our faculty's specializations offer superb foundations for further advanced studies in music as well as disciplines such as American studies, comparative literature, linguistic and cultural anthropology, Native American studies, popular culture, gender studies, Western and Central European culture and history, Slavic studies, Latin American and Latino studies, media studies, performance studies, and theatre. Major The major in music requires a total of ten 4-point courses (40 points) completed with a grade of C or better. For students matriculating in CAS in or after fall 2016, the ten 4-point courses for the major are as follows: A ural Perception (MUSIC-UA 193) M usic Theory I and II (formerly Harmony and Counterpoint I and II; MUSIC-UA 201 and 202) Professors Emeriti Boorman, Burrows, E.

Both programs give students the opportunity to gain proficiency in the theory, history, and interpretation of music throughout the world, and help them build a solid set of applied critical and listening abilities demanded of musicians and listeners today. The major offers students opportunities for independent research during their final year. The department teaches a wide range of innovative courses in ethnomusicology, popular music, the cultural study of music, and sound studies. Many of these courses are open to non-majors. Some recent courses include: Music in the Post-9/11 World; Introduction to World Music; Music in New York; Music, Global Hip-Hop, and the Politics of Culture; and Music, Sound, and Technology. The department's Waverly Labs provide digital resources for composition and research.

Our students may also take private instrumental instruction and join performance ensembles at the Steinhardt School. We encourage music majors and minors to take advantage of our location in one of the world's major cultural centers by attending concerts and pursuing internships with New York recording companies, music magazines, or major performing arts organizations. DEPARTMENT OF Music346 MUSIC COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF MUSIC T wo courses in the area of \"music, history, and cultures\" T wo courses in the area of \"sonic art\" Thr ee electives, one of which must be designated as an advanced course.

Honors students register for a semester or more of Independent Study (MUSIC-UA 997 or 998) in which they complete a capstone project in musicology or music history, ethno-musicology, analysis, or composition. This might take the form of an analytical or historiographical study of a major work or group of works, the writing of a musical composition of substantial dimensions, or a biographical study of a composer, all under the guidance of a faculty member. A student wishing to pursue departmental honors should apply to the director of undergraduate studies. There are also three departmental prizes that the department awards to exceptional students (listed in the awards and prizes section of this Bulletin). Performance Students pursuing a major or minor in music, and indeed all students in the College of Arts and Science, are encouraged to participate in musical performance, lessons, and ensembles. We believe that the joys of making music, the dedication and study necessary to perform music, and the collective effort required of ensemble participants constitute an inimitable experience that should have a central place in a liberal arts education. Students can participate in the Collegium Musicum early music ensemble, the NYU Orchestra, and many of the lesson programs and ensembles associated with the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development's Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions. Students are also invited to attend concerts of the Washington Square Contemporary Music Society.

Experimental approaches in neural science vary from analyses of molecular and cellular mechanisms in nerve cells and groups of nerve cells to behavioral and psychological studies of whole organisms. Theoretical tools include mathematical and computational modeling approaches that have proved useful in other areas of science. Experimental questions include issues related to biophysical and neurochemical mechanisms within single nerve cells, functional neural circuits consisting of small numbers of neurons, the behavior of large systems of neurons, and the relationship between the activity of elements of the nervous system and the behavior of organisms. The Center for Neural Science confers the B.S. degree in neural science.CENTER FOR Neural Science350 NEURAL SCIENCE COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYCENTER FOR NEURAL SCIENCE A grade of B-minus or better in Introduction to Neural Science (NEURL-UA 100), best taken in fall of sophomore year, is required to declare the major; a grade of C or better is required in all other courses for the major.

The four main branches are metaphysics (What is the ultimate nature of reality? What really exists and what is mere appearance?), epistemology (What, if anything, can be known and how?), logic (What are the principles of correct reasoning?), and ethics (What is moral value? And what moral values should we adopt?). Other, more specific branches of philosophy address questions concerning the nature of art, law, medicine, politics, religion, and the sciences. Everyone tends to have or assume answers to these questions. The aim of the department is to enable students to identify, clarify, and assess these answers, both ancient and modern. Philosophy prepares students for a more reflective life, for advanced studies in the subject, and for professions that emphasize analytic thinking and argumentation, such as law, business, and programming.DEPARTMENT OF Philosophy353 PHILOSOPHY COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY All students should begin with one of the introductory courses.

The Junior Honors Proseminar (PHIL-UA 200) is taken in the spring semester of junior year. It introduces students to core readings in some of the main areas of current philosophy and provides an intensive training in writing philosophy. Admission to this course usually requires a GPA, both overall and in philosophy courses, of at least 3.65, as well as the permission of the director of undergraduate studies. Next, the Senior Honors Seminar (PHIL-UA 201) is taken in the fall semester of senior year. Students develop, present, and discuss their thesis projects; they also select, and begin to meet separately with, their individual thesis advisers. Entry to this seminar requires completion of the Junior Honors Proseminar and usually a GPA of at least 3.65, both overall and in the philosophy major (or permission of the director of undergraduate studies). Finally, Senior Honors Research (PHIL-UA 202) is taken in the spring semester of senior year. Each student continues to meet separately with his or her individual thesis adviser, producing and discussing a series of rough drafts. The final version is submitted in April. It must be approved by the thesis adviser, as well as by a second faculty reader, for honors to be awarded. The student must also finish with a GPA of at least 3.65 both overall and in the major (no exceptions). 355 PHILOSOPHY COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY Course Prerequisites The department treats its course prerequisites seriously.

Available only for study of subjects not cov-ered in regularly offered courses. 2 or 4 points per term. 359 PHILOSOPHY COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITY360 PHYSICS COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDepartmental Objectives The B.A. and B.S. programs for the major provide good preparation for graduate school and develop a range of technical skills relating to building quantitative theoretical models and making precise measurements of physical phenomena. The programs are also designed to satisfy curiosity about the fundamental laws that govern every aspect of the world, from the interactions of subatomic particles to the origin and behavior of the entire universe. They are simultaneously very deep and very broad. Course work includes both theoretical subjects and experimental activity in laboratories. The programs are designed to give students flexibility in years three and four to pursue interdisciplinary activities, spend time abroad, or delve into greater depth in a subject or into original research. The department is a collegial place where faculty and students get to know one another well. There are regular formal and informal seminars, as well as a thriving Society of Physics Students, and students and faculty often collaborate on original research problems. Many majors participate in original research and coauthor scientific publications. Our students are extremely well prepared for a wide range of activities\u2014not just in scientific research, but also in professional and engineering pursuits, or any area where abstract thinking and quantitative modeling of real systems are necessary and rewarded. Non-majors: The department offers non-technical courses that introduce some of the concepts and events that are most important to understanding physics and its impact. For science majors outside of physics, there PROGRAMFACULTYChair of the Department Professor Gabadadze Director of Undergraduate Studies Hogg Professors Emeriti Bederson, Borowitz, Brown, Professors of Zidovska Clinical Professor Adlerwww.physics.as.nyu.edu Andre and Bella Meyer Hall of Physics 4 Washington Place, New York, NY 10003-6621 Phone: 212-998-7700 Physics is the most basic of the natural sciences. It is concerned with understanding the world on all scales of length, time, and energy. The methods of physics are diverse, but they share a common objective to develop and refine fundamental models that quantitatively explain observations and the results of experiments. The discoveries of physics rank among the most important achievements of human inquiry and have had an enormous impact on human culture and civilization. Members of the department conduct research in the fields of astrophysics, biophysics, cosmology, elementary particle physics, gravitation, hard and soft condensed matter physics, and statistical physics, carrying out experimental work in state-of-the art laboratories in the department and at such national and international facilities as the Large Hadron Collider at CERN and large astronomical observatories. The educational programs of the department are aimed at providing a range of courses to meet the needs of different student groups. For undergraduate physics majors, there is a rigorous core program, exposure to current frontiers, and opportunities for research. For science majors outside of physics, there are technical courses that emphasize the fundamental physical laws that underpin other sciences; and for non science majors, nontechnical courses introduce some of the most important concepts of physics and their impact on the contemporary world.DEPARTMENT OF Physics361 PHYSICS COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS are technical courses on the fundamental laws that underpin the other sciences.

We encourage a truly scientific inquiry into politics that informs a critical discussion of political institutions and a rigorous approach to effecting positive political change. We offer courses in political theory, quantitative and formal political analysis, American politics, comparative politics, and international politics. Our curriculum covers a wide range of substantive topics including law, elections, ethnic conflict, justice, economic development, political accountability, war and peacekeeping, public policy, democracy, political economy, strategy, and political attitudes and beliefs. Our faculty specializes in the politics of the United States and countries around the globe. Courses are regularly offered on Latin America, Western and Eastern Europe, Africa, Russia, India, and China. The analytical skills gained by politics majors prepare them for a wide range of careers. Our graduates accept positions with governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), think tanks, international finance groups, multinational corporations, law firms, and other institutions. Many pursue further study in fields such as political science, law, and public and international affairs at highly competitive universities.WILF FAMILY DEPARTMENT OF Politics368 POLITICS COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYWILF FAMILY DEPARTMENT OF POLITICS P olitical Theory American G overnment and Politics Comparativ e Politics I nternational Politics Policies Applying to the Major NYU courses must hav e a POL-UA number to count toward the major. N o more than five courses (20 credits) can be accepted as transfer credit toward the major; NYU study away courses and Advanced Placement (AP) credits are treated as transfer credit for all students.

Cognitive psychologists focus on perception, memory, attention, language, and thinking. Social psychologists determine how social beliefs, attitudes, and decisions are formed and maintained. Cognitive neuroscientists study features and functions in the brain as they relate to certain mental processes. Developmental psychologists seek to understand factors that affect and influence individuals across various ages. These many perspectives are reflected in undergraduate course offerings, all of which emphasize the scientific basis of psychology. In addition to its course offerings, the department encourages advanced undergraduates to become involved in faculty research through the Research Experiences and Methods course and the honors program. Highly qualified students are admitted to the honors program in their sophomore or junior year, take honors seminars, participate in primary research, and write an honors research thesis under close faculty supervision. NYU psychology majors graduate with an excellent academic foundation in psychology and are well prepared for graduate study in the field. Graduates are accepted by top programs throughout the country. Others go on to careers in law, business, medicine, and education.DEPARTMENT OF Psychology379 PSYCHOLOGY COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY S tatistics for the Behavioral Sciences (PSYCH-UA 10) A dvanced Psychological Statistics (PSYCH-UA 11) T wo courses from Core A (psychology as a natural science) T wo courses from Core B (psychology as a social science) O ne laboratory course from Core C T wo advanced electives General Policies Developmental Psychology (PSYCH-UA 34) can be selected by a student to count as either a Core A or Core B requirement (but not both).

Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences (PSYCH-UA 10) should be taken next, as it lays the methodological groundwork for the research discussed in core courses; it must be among the first four psychology courses taken. The department advises students to take the required course Advanced Psychological Statistics (PSYCH-UA 11) right after Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences (PSYCH-UA 10). Core A and B courses of greatest interest to the student should be taken as soon as possible as preparation for the related Core C laboratory course and advanced electives that follow. It is advised that students complete Core C before taking advanced courses, preferably by the spring of the junior year. Students interested in graduate training in psychology should become involved in research. Research Methods and Experience (PSYCH-UA 999) offers the opportunity to participate in faculty research, providing a supervised research experience as well as training in research presentation and criticism. This course can help students in deciding about career directions and can result in a faculty letter of recommendation for graduate school applications. Pursuing an interest in clinical psychology: Students interested in graduate work in clinical psychology should consider some combination of Personality (PSYCH-UA 30), Laboratory in Clinical Research (PSYCH-UA 43) or Laboratory in Psychopathology (PSYCH-UA 48), and Abnormal Psychology (PSYCH-UA 51, formerly PSYCH-UA 35) among their course selections. Developmental Psychology (PSYCH-UA 34) is also an appropriate choice. The department provides special advisement for these students; contact the undergraduate program office for details. Pursuing an interest in experimental psychology or industrial and organizational psychology: If a student plans to pursue a research career (particularly in Core A areas), then in addition to the relevant courses in the major, courses in mathematics, chemistry, biology, physics, and computer science may be beneficial. If a career in business or organizational psychology is the goal, then in addition to Social Psychology (PSYCH-UA 32) and Laboratory in Social and Organizational Psychology (PSYCH-UA 38), courses in economics, sociology, and mathematics may be useful. Joint Major in Language and Mind This major, intended as an introduction to cognitive science, is administered by the Departments of Linguistics, Philosophy, and Psychology. Ten courses (40 points) are required (four in linguistics, one in philosophy, four in psychology, and one additional course). All must be completed with a grade of C or better. For advisement, language and mind majors should consult with the directors of undergraduate studies of the participating departments.

Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, prepares students to play roles in the creation, implementation, and evaluation of policies that address the challenges faced by domestic and global publics in the twenty-first century. Students in the major acquire critical conceptual, analytical, and quantitative skills related to the policy making process and learn how to ethically apply these skills in the assessment of alternative policy responses to a broad range of public issues. Grounded in the principles of social science, the major is particularly appropriate for students who are both passionate about policy problems and dedicated to reaching solutions to these problems through the use of logic and evidence. The public policy major prepares students for careers in government, the non-profit sector, research, and other fields involved in the creation, implementation, and evaluation of public policies. Professors Beck (Politics, CAS), Bertelli (Wagner) , Billings (Wagner), Brams (Politics, CAS), Bueno de Mesquita (Politics, CAS), Gordon (Politics, CAS), Harrington (Politics, CAS), Mead (Politics, CAS), Tucker (Politics and Russian and Slavic Studies, CAS)Associate Professors S. Chan (Wagner), Dickson (Politics, CAS), Egan (Politics, CAS), Pevnick (Politics, CAS) Assistant Professor Dube (Politics, CAS)Clinical Professor Bhiladwall (Economics, CAS)Clinical Assistant Professor Sinclair (Wagner) Major The major in public policy requires two prerequisites and eleven courses (thirteen courses/ 52 points total) as listed below. The two CAS prerequisites must be completed with a grade of C or better before a student can declare the major. T wo prerequisite courses (8 points) that provide students with the strong analytic framework necessary to enter the major: I ntroduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2); advanced standing credit (AP , IB, etc.) in microeconomics is accepted. O ne course in politics chosen from: P ower and Politics in America (POL-UA 300) Comparativ e Politics (POL-UA 500) I nternational Politics (POL-UA 700) Six required core courses (24 points) in economics, ethics, policymaking, and quantitative and qualitative analysis that introduce students to the key questions and tools involved in the study of public policy (note that UPADM-GP 101, 111, and 140 count as 12 of the 16 credits CAS students are allowed to take outside the College, and any additional Wagner courses will also count against the 16 points. In addition, note that no Wagner courses can count toward the 64 credits that internal or external transfer students to the College are required to complete in CAS -UA courses): The P olitics of Public Policy (Wagner, UPADM-GP 101) Q uantitative Analysis for Public Policy (Wagner, UPADM-GP 111); there are no substitutions for or exemptions from this statistics requirement.

Some of these courses expand and deepen students' abilities to analyze public policy questions using logic and evidence, with approaches drawn from a diverse range of fields (including historiography, formal political theory, program evaluation, qualitative methods, and social and cultural analysis). Other courses introduce students to core concepts and approaches in a policy subfield (including public health, the study of the bureaucracy, public finance, or social and cultural analysis). Four electives (16 points). Public policy majors will select four elective courses to deepen their understanding of, and expertise in, a key policy area. The current list of approved electives in the fields of economics, environmental studies, politics, sociology, etc. is available at www.wagner.nyu.edu/undergrad. Although students are not required to focus on any particular field, examples of the kinds of fields into which many elective offerings fall include environmental policy; ethics and policy; finance and economic policy; health policy; international development; law and policy; management and policy; politics and policy; social policy; and urban policy. A senior seminar (PUBPL-UA 800, 4 points) in which students conduct in-depth analysis of a critical and relevant policy issue in a small classroom setting under the guidance of a faculty member from CAS or Wagner. Students apply the analytical methods and substantive knowledge of the policy process they have gained to a current policy problem of their choosing. Each student writes a senior seminar paper that consists of both policy analysis and recommendations for action. Policies Applying to the Major Credit toward the major is not given for courses completed with a grade of less than C, or for courses taken on a pass/fail basis. Students in this major may double-count up to two courses towards this major and another major. However, the department of the second major may allow more limited (or no) double-counting; therefore, students must always check with advisers in their second major. CAS students are allowed to take 16 credits in non-liberal arts courses in the other schools of the University; the three required Wagner courses for this major count as 12 of those 16 credits, and any additional Wagner courses will also count against the 16 points. Students with a good academic reason for going over the 16-point limit must petition the Office of Academic Standards, Silver 909, 212-998-8140, for permission to take additional credits outside of the College. In addition, no Wagner courses can count toward the 64 credits that internal or external transfer students to the College are required to complete in CAS (-UA) courses. Advisement and Declaration To declare the major, students should contact NYU Wagner (295 Lafayette Street, second floor; 212-998-7400; wagner.undergraduate@nyu.edu) to obtain and fill out the major declaration form. Students cannot declare the JOINT MAJOR IN PUBLIC POLICY 388 PUBLIC POLICY COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYmajor until they have completed the two prerequisite courses with a grade of C or better. Once declared as public policy majors, students will be assigned to a faculty adviser for guidance on completion of public policy requirements and clearance for registration.

At the end of the junior year, each honors student meets with a faculty director for initial advisement and approval. A student writes the honors thesis by enrolling in the Senior Seminar (PUBPL-UA 800, described above) and then enrolling in an additional thesis-writing independent study (PUBPL-UA 801, 4 points). This independent study is an additional twelfth course that does not count toward the eleven required for the major proper, and is supervised by a faculty member whose area of academic expertise coincides with the focus of the honors thesis. To be awarded honors, a student must complete this two-course sequence (PUBPL-UA 800, 801) and produce a quality senior thesis. Joint B.A./M.P.A. Program with Wagner Students who complete the undergraduate policy major may be well-positioned to apply for the joint B.A./ Master in Public Administration degree program offered jointly by NYU Wagner and the College of Arts and Science. On this track, students may complete a maximum of 21 of the 45 credits required for the Wagner M.P .A. while they are still undergraduates. Note that students must enroll in the joint degree program while they are still matriculated in the College of Arts and Science, and they must formally apply to the M.P .A. prior to their graduation from CAS. Please see full program requirements for this track at www.wagner.nyu.edu/dualdegrees/ba-mpamup. Study Away Students should discuss with an adviser for the major as early as possible. NYU Washington, D.C. is an excellent choice for many public policy majors.

First, students study the theories and methods through which religion is analyzed today, including psychologi-cal, sociological, anthropological, philosophical, historical, legal, and literary approaches. They also approach the study of \"religion\" as a concept, which has itself been an intellectual object of inquiry and has played a key role in the development of the social and human sciences. Second, students learn empirically about religion in different times and places, either through historical or ethnographic study, using textual, visual, and audio sources. Third, students use religions, approached as lived practices, as a lens for examining other realms in social life, such as gender and sexuality, race, the nation-state, violence, memory, ethics, emotions, politics, economy, power, art, literature, and media. These realms, in turn, have an impact on religions. The Program in Religious Studies is closely affiliated with the Center for Religion and Media. It should be stressed that the program is oriented toward the academic analysis of religious phenomena and does not promote or endorse either religious belief itself or the views and practices of any particular religious tradition.392 RELIGIOUS STUDIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYPROGRAM IN RELIGIOUS STUDIES Required Courses for the Major Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion RELST-UA 1 Offered in the fall. 4 points.

The combinations of primary-secondary languages are: F rench-Italian F rench-Spanish P P ortuguese-Italian P ortuguese-Spanish For declaration of and advisement in the major, students must visit the departments of both languages they intend to study. They must indicate to both departments which language is primary and which is secondary. Advisement for course sequencing takes place in the relevant departments.PROGRAMDirectors of Undergraduate Studies Associate Professor Mendelson (Spanish and Portuguese); Professor Tylus (Italian); Associate Professor Usher (French) Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies Clinical Associate Professor D\u00e1vila (Spanish and Portuguese) Director of French Language Program Clinical Associate Professor Moran Director of Italian Language Program Clinical Assistant Professor Cipani Director of Spanish Language Program Clinical Associate Professor ElorrietaThe Romance languages are the group of related tongues that emerged from spoken Latin after the fall of the Roman Empire in the fifth century. In the High Middle Ages and the Renaissance, they developed and evolved into languages that we recognize as the basis of (among others) modern Italian, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. The great works of literature produced in these centuries became the foundation of the national literatures of their respective cultures. The nine-course major in Romance languages in the College of Arts and Science is administered by the Departments of Italian, French, and Spanish and Portuguese. Students choose a combination of any two of these four languages, taking five courses in one and four in the other. Thus, majors in Romance languages are able to take advantage of the rich course offerings and resources of our world-renowned language departments and to learn from distinguished scholars in two fields. The major stresses competence in speaking and writing before moving into literary and cultural course- work. To improve students' facility with their two languages and promote cross-cultural understanding and exposure, study away at NYU Buenos Aires, Florence, Madrid, and Paris is encouraged. While they are at the Washington Square campus, students can take advantage of talks, exhibitions, films, and other events sponsored by the Departments of French, Italian, and Spanish and Portuguese and NYU's Maison Fran\u00e7aise, Casa Italiana Zerilli-Marim\u00f2, and King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center, as well as by cultural institutions in New York. A major in Romance languages is applicable to careers in international law and business, communications, education, fine arts, tourism, and diplomacy, and also complements majors in such fields as art history, cinema studies, comparative literature, history, international relations, linguistics, medieval and Renaissance studies, and music.

Internship and Independent Study Courses Open only to students majoring in the department.Internship RUSSN-UA 980 1 to 6 points per term. Native speakers of Russian may work with Russian language students and assist language instructors. A maximum of 4 points of internship may be counted toward the major (not toward the minor). Consult the director of undergraduate studies for further details. Internship credit in other settings and organizations requires a description of duties and approval of the director of undergraduate studies, as well as a final paper. Independent Study RUSSN-UA 997, 998 2 to 4 points per term. A maximum of 8 points of independent study may be counted toward the major (not toward the minor). Before registering, students must submit a one-page typed description of the proposed project to the director of undergraduate studies and the proposed faculty sponsor.404 www.nyu.edu/science_and_society SCIENCE AND SOCIETY COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYMinor The minor in science and society requires four 4-point courses (16 points) completed with a grade of C or better (pass/fail does not count). All students must take the core course, Introduction to Science and Society (HIST-UA 94), and then choose three other courses from an approved list posted on the minor website. Many courses in the minor fall into one of the following four clusters: technology, physics, biology/prehealth, and environmental sciences. Students are strongly encouraged, however, to be creative and challenge themselves to think in ways other than those that are strictly categorical. For example, a student interested in understanding the difference between the natural and the artificial might take the following three elective courses in addition to the required Introduction to Science and Society course: Philosophy of Biology; Humans, Machines, and Aesthetics; and Nature and Technology in Modern America. Students are strongly encouraged to take courses in the various NYU schools contributing to the minor. This will expose them to a plethora of diverse pedagogical experiences and greatly enhance co-learning. All CAS students may apply 16 points taken in the other schools of NYU toward their degree. Students seeking to raise this limit so as to accommodate the course work of the minor in science and society must file a petition in the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140; www.cas.nyu.edu/page/petitions. Courses taken in the other schools of NYU do not count toward the 64 point residency requirement in CAS (-UA) courses for internal and external transfers to the College.PROGRAMScience and society is a rich, inherently cross-disciplinary minor, drawing on the course offerings and faculty expertise of the College of Arts and Science, the Gallatin School of Individualized Study, the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, and the NYU Tandon School of Engineering. The minor analyzes how the techniques and methodologies of the humanities and social sciences can be used to illuminate both the context and content of science, technology, and medicine. Drawing upon history, philosophy, anthropology, and sociology, students investigate how culture and society frame\u2014and, indeed, are themselves framed by\u2014science, technology, and medicine. The current influence of scientific, technological, and medical issues on our lives is unprecedented, altering our notions of race, health, responsibility, ownership, ethics, aesthetics, and self. We are therefore obliged to understand these critical interactions with a view to understand, and intervene in, the world. The types of questions this minor poses include: How has gene patenting affected both the content and conduct of molecular biology, as well as intellectual property law? What is the relationship between the mathemati-cal descriptions that physicists employ and the nature of physical phenomena? What are the ethical and political issues involved in human embryonic stem cell research? How do machines shape aesthetics? What, if anything, is the difference between a machine and a human? How does nature have a history? This minor serves as an enlightening complement to pre-health studies, pre-law studies relevant to intellec- tual property, biotechnology, and environmental and healthcare studies. It also provides a potent training to those interested in pursuing advanced degrees in the history, philosophy, sociology, or anthropology of science, technology, or medicine.Director Professor Jackson, Gallatin/ Faculty of Arts and Science Steering Committee Associate Professor Appuhn, Faculty of Arts and ScienceProfessor Jackson, Gallatin/ Faculty of Arts and ScienceAssistant Professor Mills, SteinhardtMINOR IN Science and Society405 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYMINOR IN SCIENCE AND SOCIETY Core Course Introduction to Science and Society HIST-UA 94 Required for the minor.

This major enables a small number of very capable and highly motivated students to pursue a plan of study that brings together courses from more than one CAS department or program. During their sophomore year, students compose their academic plan for the major in consultation with their two faculty advisers for their self-designed program of study as well as with the associate director of interschool programs and the director of college honors, who serves as the director of undergraduate studies. By spring of the sophomore year, the plan of study must be submitted to and approved by the College's honors committee. The self-designed honors major differs from the individualized major that the Gallatin School offers in several ways: These two NYU schools hav e distinct admissions criteria, general education curricula, and other requirements. This CAS major ser ves students who can realize their interdisciplinary goals within CAS (except for the 16 credits of non-CAS courses that CAS already permits), whereas Gallatin students draw heavily on courses from several NYU schools. This CAS major is an honors major , which has prerequisites for entry (e.g., 3.75 GPA; students must maintain a 3.65 GPA to remain in the major) and entails a heavy commitment to honors-level work, including independent research under faculty supervision. Freshmen and sophomores in CAS who are considering the self-designed honors major should contact the College Advising Center (Silver Center, Room 905, 212-998-8130) to schedule an initial advising appointment with the associate director of interschool programs.409 SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ANALYSIS COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYMajor Prior to 2016-2017 Academic Year The major in social and cultural analysis comprises introductory, elective, and research components, which together make up a total of eleven 4-point courses (44 points), as outlined below. Students create a concentration, in consultation with their adviser, from the six program areas within SCA: Africana studies, American studies, Asian/Pacific/American studies, gender and sexuality studies, Latino studies, and Metropolitan studies. T wo introductory courses\u2014may be taken in any order: Concepts in S ocial and Cultural Analysis (SCA-UA 1) O ne of the following: A pproaches to Africana Studies (SCA-UA 101; offered periodically) or Cultures and Contexts: Africa (CORE-UA 505) or Cultures and Contexts: The African Diaspora (CORE-UA 532) or Cultures and Contexts: The Black Atlantic (CORE-UA 534) A pproaches to American Studies (SCA-UA 201) A pproaches to the Asian/Pacific/American Experience (SCA-UA 301; periodically) or Cultures and Contexts: Asian/Pacific/American Cultures (CORE-UA 539; offered every fall) A pproaches to Gender and Sexuality Studies (SCA-UA 401)PROGRAMFACULTYProfessors Emeriti Pratt, Stacey, Walkowitz Erich Maria Remarque Professor of Literature Harper University Professor WillisSilver Professor DinshawProfessors Tu, Zaloom Assistant Professor Saranilliowww.sca.as.nyu.edu 20 Cooper Square, 4th Floor, New York, NY 10003-7112 Phone: 212-992-9650 Chair of the Department Professor MorganDirector of Undergraduate Studies To be announcedDEPARTMENT OF Social and Cultural Analysis The Department of Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA) is transdisciplinary, combining topics and methodologies from the humanities and social sciences. Its faculty and students work in a broad range of fields, analyzing the social and cultural relationships between individuals, groups, institutions, and govern-ments. In the department, a commitment to historical inquiry coexists with applied knowledge about such modern developments as intensified urbanization, transnational trade and exchange, migration of peoples, racial formation, and the nexus of gender and sexuality. SCA houses and integrates the activities of six interdisciplinary programs\u2014Africana studies, American studies, Asian/Pacific/American studies, gender and sexuality studies, Latino studies, and metropolitan studies\u2014along with the range of degrees and concentrations offered in these programs. In their teaching and research, SCA students and faculty are encouraged to make intersectional links between the areas of interest on which the programs focus. New York City is a crucible for the department's work, both in its community orientation and its connections to global networks. Study in SCA provides excellent background for careers in such fields as community organizing, legal advocacy, nonprofit administration, public policy, and urban and regional planning, among many others. SCA students can elect to major or minor in social and cultural analysis, or to major or minor in one of the six interdisciplinary programs listed above. For detailed information, see the entries for these individual programs in this Bulletin.410 SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ANALYSIS COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ANALYSIS A pproaches to Latino Studies (SCA-UA 501; offered periodically) or Cultures and Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures (CORE-UA 529; offered every fall) A pproaches to Metropolitan Studies (SCA-UA 601) Seven elective courses: S ix electives from the designated social and cultural analysis course list (must be taught by SCA faculty); Internship Fieldwork/Seminar (SCA-UA 40/SCA-UA 42) are no longer required but highly recom- mended and together can count as an elective O ne common SCA elective; a list will be available each semester T wo research courses: S trategies in Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA-UA 20) S enior Research Seminar (SCA-UA 90) Major for 2016-2017 Academic Year and Thereafter (Approved April 2016. Final details pending. Consult online CAS Bulletin 2016-2018 and departmental webpage for updated information. Students who entered CAS before fall 2016 may follow the new version of the major with departmental approval and advisement.) The new social and cultural analysis major requires nine 4-point courses (36 points) completed with a grade of C or better, comprised of: Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA-UA TBD, replacing Concepts in Social and Cultural Analysis, SCA-UA 1); one course designated as a Field Colloquium in one of the constituent programs within SCA; one course designated as a Research Seminar in one of the constituent programs within SCA; and six approved electives, four of which must be taught by SCA faculty. An \"Approaches\" course in one of the SCA program areas, or one of the acceptable Core Cultures and Contexts courses noted under the old major (above), may be substituted for the Field Colloquium requirement. Minor The minor in social and cultural analysis requires five courses (20 points): the introductory course Concepts in Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA-UA 1), plus four additional courses selected from the designated SCA course list (must be taught by SCA faculty). Language and Linguistic Competency The type of rigorous intercultural study promoted within the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis requires students to recognize the complex modes of communication at work both within and across different social groups. The department therefore strongly encourages its students to develop advanced skills in language and linguistics by any of the following means: taking elective courses in sociolinguistics; studying a language other than English beyond the minimum level required by the College of Arts and Science (especially one germane to the department's fields of study); pursuing community-based internship fieldwork necessitating the development and use of specific language skills; or undertaking study or research abroad in contexts entailing the exercise of key language or linguistic capabilities. Honors Program Majors who have completed 48 points of graded work in CAS and have a 3.65 GPA or higher (both overall and in the major) are encouraged to register for Senior Honors Seminar (SCA-UA 92) in the fall semester of their senior year. Upon successful completion of the seminar requirements, students will be eligible to register for Senior Honors Thesis (SCA-UA 93) in the spring. Information about the honors program can be found at sca.as.nyu.edu/object/sca.related.honors.411 SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ANALYSIS COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ANALYSIS Introductory Core Concepts in Social and Cultural Analysis SCA-UA 1 Offered every semester. 4 points.

Wright Mills once defined sociology as the intersection of history and biography. That is, sociology studies the ways that social structures and interactions shape human experience. Sociologists seek to understand the full range of social institutions and practices, from the dynamics of couples and small groups to the shape of institutions such as the church, occupations, and the family to the functioning of communities, cities, and whole societies. Sociological methods of research are diverse, ranging from the quantitative analysis of large surveys to qualitative approaches, such as in-depth interviewing, participant observation, and historical investigation. The Department of Sociology at NYU reflects the diversity of the discipline. The faculty includes experts in deviance, law, and crime; organizations, occupations, and work; politics, social protest, and social policy; education, inequality, and social mobility; culture, art, and mass media; urban community and the global city; and sex, gender, and the family. The department encourages students to study issues from a variety of perspectives and to develop a \"sociological imagination\" that enables them to analyze social arrangements and problems. Whether the goal is to become an informed citizen or an expert in a special field, the department offers the tools and knowledge to help students make sense of the world around them.DEPARTMENT OF Sociology415 SOCIOLOGY COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY Major in Global Public Health/Sociology This major draws on the Department of Sociology's strength in theoretical creativity and substantive empirical research on important social issues.

The results are not recommendations; students must register for the course they place into. Only a course coordinator or the director of the language program can override a placement test score. Placement results will be assessed by instructors in the first week of classes. Inappropriately placed students must drop/add into the correct level. Incoming freshmen must not take the NYU online placement exam while they are waiting for AP , IB, A Level, or SAT subject exam results. Standardized exam results take precedence over the online exam. (If the SAT Spanish exam was taken in junior year of high school, however, take the NYU placement exam for a more recent assessment.) If standardized test results arrive and are too low to award credit, students must then take the NYU online placement exam. If more than 18 months have elapsed since a student took a SPAN-UA course, it can no longer serve as an automatic prerequisite for the next course in the sequence. The student must take or retake the placement examination to determine the correct level of study. This may result in repeating SPAN-UA courses and loss of credit. For more information and tables showing appropriate course placement for specific test scores, consult the section on language placement at the department's website, spanish.as.nyu.edu. To contact the director of the language program, call 212-998-8770 or write to spanish.dlp@nyu.edu.

These minors, which are open to all students in the College of Arts and Science, are either partly or wholly composed of courses from participating schools, such as NYU's College of Global Public Health; Silver School of Social Work; Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development; Stern School of Business; Tisch School of the Arts; Tandon School of Engineering; and Wagner School of Public Service. Students interested in pursuing a cross-school minor are encouraged to view minor requirements and to contact a minor representative with any questions. Minor curricula and contact information can be found on the NYU cross-school minors website (www.nyu.edu/cross-school-minors). For additional advising support, CAS students can contact the associate director for interschool programs in the College, or schedule an appointment with the associate director through the College's Preprofessional Advising Center (Silver Center, Room 901, 212-998-8160). With the exception of the cinema studies minor, all courses taken outside the College to complete cross-school minor requirements count toward the 16-point limit on course work in other divisions. Since many of these minors require 16 points of coursework outside the College, students are strongly encouraged to develop their course of study in consultation with a CAS adviser. Courses taken within the College (with a -UA suffix) to complete cross-school minor requirements will not count toward the 16-point limit. Students seeking additional non-CAS credits above the 16-point limit must file a petition in the Office of the Associate Dean for Students (cas.nyu.edu/page/petitions; Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140). No courses taken in the other schools of NYU (whether for a cross-school minor or as electives) may count toward the 64 credits that internal or external transfer students to CAS are required to complete in CAS (-UA) courses. The minors offered by other NYU schools that are available to CAS students are listed on the NYU cross-school minors website (www.nyu.edu/cross-school-minors). For further information about the business studies, child and adolescent mental health studies, cinema studies, law and society, and science and society minors, please consult the relevant sections of this Bulletin.www.cas.nyu.edu/object/crossschoolminors Silver Center 100 Washington Square East, Room 901, New York, NY 10003-6688 Phone: 212-998-8160436 PREPROFESSIONAL, ACCELERATED, AND SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYPreprofessional, Accelerated, and Specialized Programs THE ROBERT AND ELLEN SALANT PREHEALTH PROGRAM The prehealth program in the College of Arts and Science is appropriate for any student who plans to apply to medical, dental, veterinary, osteopathic medical, optometry, podiatry, or other health professional schools. The prehealth program of study minimally requires completion of the following courses: Principles of Biology I and II (BIOL-UA 11, BIOL-UA 12); Principles of Biology Laboratory (BIOL-UA 123), for students not majoring in biology; General Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 125); General Chemistry II and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 126); Organic Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 225); Organic Chemistry II and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 226); General Physics I and II (PHYS-UA 11, 12); Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 100), plus one elective in English or expository writing; Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) or its equivalent; and Biochemistry I (CHEM-UA 881). Preparation for specific entrance exams may warrant the completion of additional coursework in the social sciences, specifically in the areas of psychology and sociology. Some professional schools may recom-mend or require additional courses, such as statistics, genetics, or microbiology. While prehealth students should strive to earn the best grades possible, they must also keep in mind that schools of the health pro-fessions evaluate every aspect of a candidate's background when making admission decisions. Therefore, students are encouraged to pursue a major of heartfelt interest, to par-ticipate in extracurricular activities of their choosing, and to develop intellectual pursuits and hobbies outside their schoolwork. Additionally, all prehealth students are very strongly encouraged to obtain work experience, whether as a paid employee or volunteer, in the area they would like to pursue. This practical experience allows students to make an intelligent and informed decision about whether or not they should pursue a career in the health professions. Admissions committees will see that the applicant is dedicated enough to learn about a particular profession, and has been exposed to both its benefits and its challenges. The College's Preprofessional Advising Center (Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 901; 212-998-8160) has developed an extensive evaluation process that culminates in a letter generated by the Committee on Evaluations to Schools of the Health Professions. Students preparing to apply to schools of the health professions participate in the committee process during the academic year preceding their applica-tion year. Students are encouraged to keep in touch with preprofessional advising through-out their time at NYU so that they are aware of the procedures and deadlines for receiving a committee letter of evaluation. Applicants to schools of the health professions must have completed at least five of the required prehealth science courses within the past ten (10) years at NYU in order to be eligible for a committee interview and letter from the CAS Preprofessional Advising Center. Students considering a career in the health professions are strongly urged to discuss their intentions with an academic adviser as early as possible. There is no \"premed\" major at the College, and the designation will not appear on a student's transcript. Students complete the relevant prehealth courses in tandem with their major, College Core Curriculum, and minor (if any) requirements, and it is this parallel structure that allows students to start or stop their prehealth coursework without impacting the completion of their degree. While the Preprofessional Advising Center is located in the College of Arts and Science, preprofessional advisors frequently work with students from other NYU undergraduate divisions who wish to follow the prehealth curriculum. Very detailed information about the undergraduate experience as a prehealth student, about prerequisites for health professional schools, and about the committee process is avail-able on the Preprofessional Advising Center website, www.prehealth.cas.nyu.edu. B.A./D.D.S. Program The B.A./D.D.S. program is a seven-year joint program between the College of Arts and Science and the College of Dentistry at New York University. It is designed for stu-dents who are certain that they would like to pursue a career in dentistry. Admission requirements include a minimum high school GPA of 3.5 and combined SAT scores of at least 1370. Students are admitted to the program as incoming freshmen and engage in academic studies and cocurricular activities that will prepare them for the dental school cur-riculum. They spend the first three years of the program at the College of Arts and Science, where they complete the College Core Curriculum, the prehealth require-ments, and an abbreviated biology major, for a total of 104 points. Students must maintain a minimum overall GPA of 3.2, as well as a major GPA of at least 3.4; in addi-tion, grades of B or higher must be earned in all courses required for the abbreviated ACCELERATED/JOINT PROGRAM IN PREHEALTH 437biology major. Students are also expected to participate in the program's cocurricular activities, which are designed to enhance their understanding of the dental profes-sion; these activities include special lectures, field trips, and cultural functions. During the fall of the third year, students in the B.A./D.D.S. program take the Dental Admission Test and make formal applica-tion to the College of Dentistry. Students enter the College of Dentistry in fall of the fourth year and must maintain matricula-tion in the College of Arts and Science during their first year of dental school. For the B.A. degree to be awarded, an official copy of the first-year dental school transcript and a statement from the College of Dentistry indicating promotion to the second year of dental studies is forwarded to the associate dean for advising and student services in the College of Arts and Science's Office of the Dean. The NYU postbaccalaureate prehealth studies program is a certificate program that provides support to students inter-ested in pursuing a career in the health professions. The program is designed for career-changer students who have already earned a bachelor's degree, but have not yet taken some or all of the science courses required for admission to graduate study in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, physician assistantship, physical therapy, or other health professions. Our postbaccalaureate students are fully integrated into NYU's community of undergraduates, attending courses alongside other students who are also committed to a prehealth education. They are taught by leading members of the Faculty of Arts and Science, who are known for their accessibil-ity and student-centered teaching. CAS postbaccalaureates have full access to NYU's staff of dedicated advisers located in the College's Preprofessional Advising Center (Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 901; 212-998-8160). In addition to our professional staff, the postbaccalaureate student community provides a supportive environment for academic success. Postbaccalaureates are also encouraged to attend the peer tutoring and group review sessions offered by the University Learning Center, which are free of cost. In addition to the successful completion of prehealth coursework, postbaccalaureate students are expected to build a prehealth \"portfolio\" by pursuing clinical, research, and/or community volunteer opportuni-ties outside the classroom to expand their knowledge of the healthcare industry. Students are encouraged to search for health-related opportunities, both on- and off-campus, through the weekly prehealth email newsletter and the Wasserman Center for Career Development. Prior to submitting applications to graduate health professional programs, postbac-calaureate students will participate in the application and interview process facilitated by the NYU Committee on Evaluations to Schools of the Health Professions. During this process, students will be evaluated on their performance in the postbaccalaureate program in combination with their extra-curricular involvement. The end result is an institutional letter of evaluation, which supplements their application to graduate health professional programs. Students admitted to the postbaccalaureate program must have earned an undergradu-ate GPA of 3.0 or higher. Students are only eligible for the postbaccalaureate certificate program if they plan to complete at least half of the prehealth science curriculum at NYU. The postbaccalaureate curriculum is designed to be completed in two years, including summer courses, but completion time may vary depending on the student's prior academic background and the student's semester of entry into the program (e.g., fall, spring, summer). The minimum time spent in our program is one academic year, and the maximum is three academic years. Students who have successfully completed the NYU postbaccalaureate program have been admitted to a variety of prestigious medical and dental programs, including Yale, Columbia, Cornell, Pittsburgh, SUNY, Mount Sinai, and Albert Einstein. Prospective students are invited to explore our program and review the NYU prehealth science curriculum at www.prehealth.cas.nyu.edu. We hold information sessions about the postbaccalaureate program throughout the year\u2014typically in August, November, February, and May\u2014to give prospective students an opportunity to meet with program staff and current postbaccalaureate students in a group setting. Please contact us at postbacc@nyu.edu or call our office to speak with a staff member should you have questions about the program. POSTBACCALAUREATE PREHEALTH PROGRAM BARBARA AND EVAN CHESLER PRELAW PROGRAM The College endorses the position of the Association of American Law Schools that a single \"best\" preparation for law school cannot be recommended. As such, there is no prescribed prelaw curriculum, so prelaw students are free to choose from the wide variety of courses offered at the College of Arts and Science. Purpose of Prelaw Study While the College does not require prelaw students to follow a specific academic curriculum, it does advise enrolling in courses that require extensive reading, research, and writing. The College Core Curriculum is excellent preparation for prelaw students, as it offers a rigorous and multidisciplinary foundation for advanced PREPROFESSIONAL, ACCELERATED, AND SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITY438 PREPROFESSIONAL, ACCELERATED, AND SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYstudy in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. The honors programs offered by several departments provide opportunities to complete substantial writ-ing projects during the junior and senior years. No matter which major a student chooses, law schools value a well-rounded liberal arts education, so students should select their electives wisely. For example, the precision of methodology and thought required of students in mathematics, com-puter science, logic, and the natural sciences will aid in the development of analytic skills, while a background in the behavioral sciences and the humanities (politics, economics, history, literature, philosophy, anthropology, and sociology) will offer a deeper understanding of human institu-tions and values, as well as opportunities for critical thinking and writing.Advising The staff of the College's Preprofessional Advising Center (Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 901; 212-998-8160) can advise students on general course selection, participation in clubs and organizations, law school applications, and related issues. The office serves as a clearinghouse for dean's certification forms, required by a number of law schools as part of their admissions process. The Lawyer Alumni Mentoring Program (LAMP) offers CAS juniors an opportunity to apply for one-on-one mentoring with experienced attorneys who are alumni of the College, and the Prelaw Advisory Board serves as a focus group for the overall prelaw commu-nity. Students should visit www.prelaw.cas.nyu.edu for more information.Other Prelaw-Related Activities The New York University School of Law, conveniently located across the Square from the College, sponsors many events open to the University community. The school's proximity allows prelaw students to observe first-year law school classes and to meet and speak informally with students actively pursuing legal studies. The College also sponsors talks by guest speakers on law-related topics and arranges for representatives from various law schools to visit the College for information sessions during the fall semester. In addition, the Wasserman Center for Career Development administers sample Law School Admission Tests (LSAT) in the fall and spring of each year and co-hosts events and panels open to the university's prelaw community. ACCELERATED AND JOINT PROGRAMS LEADING TO GRADUATE OR SPECIALIZED DEGREES Joint B.S./B.S. Program in Engineering Since the fall of 2010, the College's dual degree program with the NYU Tandon (formerly Polytechnic) School of Engineering has offered highly qualified and motivated students who are techni-cally oriented the opportunity to pursue both a liberal arts program with a major in science and a traditional engineering program. The program is ideal for the student interested in science and engineer-ing who is also eager for a liberal arts experience before entering an under-graduate engineering environment. Upon completion of this five-year program, students receive both a B.S. degree from the College of Arts and Science and a B.S. degree from the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering. Students are admitted to the program as incoming freshmen. See the section on engineering in this Bulletin for details. For more information, students may consult the academic adviser for the dual B.S./B.S. program in the College Advising Center (Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905; 212-998-8130) and visit www.engineering.cas.nyu.edu. Accelerated Bachelor's/Master's Program (CAS and GSAS) The College of Arts and Science (CAS) and the Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS) offer students in many departments the opportunity to earn both the bachelor's and master's degrees in a shorter period of time and at less cost than is normally the case. Students may even be eligible to complete a master's degree in a department different than that of their undergraduate major. Qualifying students are typically accepted towards the end of the sophomore year or during the junior year. Students in the program must satisfy all requirements of both the bachelor's and master's degrees; there is no double-counting of courses. In order to complete the program in five years, students are required to complete at least a quarter of the graduate credits that are required for the master's degree before earning the bachelor's. This would mean at least eight graduate credits towards a 32-credit master's program, or at least nine towards a 36-credit program. There are a few notable exceptions: as few as eight credits can be earned towards the 40-credit politics M.A. program, while nine and twelve credits are required towards the 32-credit economics M.A. and the 32-credit museum studies M.A., respectively. Students can earn additional graduate credits towards the master's before they complete the bach-elor's, as their schedule permits. Students in CAS and Global Liberal Studies (GLS) may apply to the program once they have completed a minimum of three semesters toward the bachelor's degree (at least one semester in CAS is also required for transfer students), and prior to their final two undergraduate terms. To be eligible, students must have a minimum of two terms remaining in CAS or GLS (excluding January term) during which they are still working towards completion of undergraduate requirements. Students must have a minimum cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 to apply and, if admitted, to transition into GSAS. Students must also satisfy any additional bachelor's/master's application prerequisite that may be set by their graduate program of interest. These may include a certain major GPA, declaration of the department's undergraduate major or minor, comple-tion of specified coursework, a relevant internship experience, or a meeting with the program director prior to application. Students interested in applying should care-fully review the participating departments page of the bachelor's/master's program website (bachmast.cas.nyu.edu) to check for program-specific eligibility requirements. Bachelor's/master's students who satisfy program requirements as undergraduates receive a scholarship covering 50% of master's tuition and registration fees during the graduate school year. The scholarship is provided only after completion of the bach-elor's degree and upon matriculation into the Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS). It remains available for twelve months from the point of matriculation into GSAS, which is up to three consecutive terms. The bachelor's/master's scholarship is available to all students in the program, including international students, and it does not require an additional application. Bachelor's/master's students who make additional tuition payments as undergradu-ates in order to accelerate their program of study receive 50% reimbursement for master's coursework that they took during a summer undergraduate term or in excess of 18 credits in a fall or spring undergraduate semester. This reimbursement is available during the GSAS year and it supplements the 50% reduction of tuition and fees for new master's coursework taken during that year. Beyond the 50% program scholarship, students may be eligible for additional forms of financial aid once they matriculate into GSAS. Application guidelines and a schedule of walk-in advising hours for this program are available on the bachelor's/master's program website (bachmast.cas.nyu.edu). Accelerated Bachelor's/Master's Teacher Education Programs (CAS and Steinhardt) The College of Arts and Science (CAS) and the Steinhardt Department of Teaching and Learning offer dual degree programs that allow CAS students in selected majors to complete both their B.A. and an M.A. in teacher education from the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. Students admitted to one of the B.A./M.A. teacher education programs can, with careful planning, earn both degrees at less cost than is normally the case.These dual degree programs combine the benefits of a broad liberal arts education at the undergraduate level with a professional education at the graduate level. All programs qualify graduates for initial certification as a teacher in grades 7 through 12 in most states around the country. At this time, CAS and Steinhardt offer the following dual degree teacher education programs: B.A. in E nglish/M.A. in teaching English, grades 7-12 B.A. in histor y/M.A. in teaching history, grades 7-12 B.A. in mathematics/M.A. in teaching mathematics, grades 7-12 S tudents admitted to a bachelor's/master's teacher education track complete gradu-ate credits in teacher education as regular electives during their junior or senior years. Students may view required courses for their particular track by visiting Steinhardt's accelerated B.A./M.A. teacher education program website (steinhardt.nyu.edu/teachlearn/dual) and may receive additional guidance from Steinhardt's graduate student advisors (Roberto Martinez, roberto.martinez@nyu.edu, for English and math-ematics; Khanh Le, khanh.le@nyu.edu, for social studies). Designated track courses may count toward both the B.A. and M.A. degrees. After graduation and pending admission to Steinhardt, students who have completed the teacher education track as undergraduates can finish the remaining credits required for the M.A. degree in one additional year of study. The application process for matriculated CAS students consists of two parts. Students first apply to the teacher educa-tion track in their major. To be eligible for consideration and admission to the track, a student must have an approved major (see above) and a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0. Students may apply to the track once they have completed a minimum of three semesters toward the bachelor's degree (at least one semester in CAS is also required for transfer students), and prior to their final two undergraduate semesters. For for-mal admission to Steinhardt, CAS seniors must also submit the Steinhardt graduate application prior to graduating from CAS. Admission to the teacher education track does not guarantee admission to Steinhardt.Application guidelines and a schedule of walk-in advising hours for this program are available on the bachelor's/master's program website (bachmast.cas.nyu.edu). Accelerated B.A./M.P.A. and B.A./M.U.P. Programs (CAS and Wagner) New York University offers students the opportunity to simultaneously pursue a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) from the College of Arts and Science and a Master of Public Administration (M.P .A.) or Master of Urban Planning (M.U.P .) from the Robert F . Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. Students admitted to the B.A./M.P .A. or B.A./M.U.P . program can, with careful planning, earn both degrees in a shortened time and at less cost than is normally the case. This program combines the benefits of a broad liberal arts education at the undergraduate level with a profes-sional education at the graduate level. CAS undergraduates in any major may apply to the B.A./M.P .A. track. Students choose between two pro-grams in Wagner\u2014either public and nonprofit policy and management, or health policy and management\u2014and then further specialize within either program. CAS undergraduates in any one of six appr oved majors are eligible to apply to the B.A./M.U.P . track; the majors are economics, international relations, metropolitan studies, politics, sociology, and urban design and architecture. Students select an area of specialization within the urban planning program. Admission to the B.A./M.P .A. or B.A./M.U.P . track is open to CAS students who have completed at least three semesters in the College with a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher (at least one semester in CAS is required for transfer students). For formal admission to Wagner, CAS seniors must also submit the Wagner graduate application prior to graduating from CAS; admission to the B.A./M.P .A. or B.A./M.U.P . track does not guarantee admission to Wagner. To gain maximal benefit from the combined degree program, participat-ing students should aim to complete, 439 PREPROFESSIONAL, ACCELERATED, AND SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYwhile still undergraduates, 28 of the 60 points required for the M.P .A. or M.U.P . This advanced standing can be earned by enrolling in approved courses at Wagner or by taking equivalent courses in CAS, a list of which may be obtained at the website below. Designated track courses may count towards both the undergraduate and graduate degrees. Courses are selected in consultation with the associate director for interschool programs in CAS or with the director of student services in Wagner. Metropolitan studies majors follow a course of study that allows them to take full advantage of the combined degree program. Interested students should speak with the director of undergraduate studies in metropolitan studies. Application guidelines and a schedule of walk-in advising hours for this program are available on the bachelor's/master's program website (bachmast.cas.nyu.edu). 440 PREPROFESSIONAL, ACCELERATED, AND SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYINTERNSHIPS One defining characteristic of the New York University educational experience is the opportunity students have to apply their classroom learning to real-life experiences in a variety of professional and community-service settings. New York City provides such opportunities in abundance, and the College of Arts and Science and the University take full advantage of our location in the financial, cultural, scientific, and media capital of the world. Our alumni base, for example, encompasses every conceivable profes-sion, and alumni give generously of their time to undergraduate students seeking experiential learning. A recent survey by the University's Wasserman Center for Career Development showed that 83 percent of graduating seniors in the College held a job or internship related to their field of interest during their undergraduate years. Many different types of opportunities are available to students; some are paid, some involve volunteerism on the part of a student, and some carry academic credit\u2014and all of these can be valuable. For the purpose of securing and making the most of such opportunities, students should consider the following criteria as a guide. For further information, contact the Wasserman Center for Career Development (133 East 13th Street, 2nd Floor; 212-998-4730). Career counselors are available by appointment at the Wasserman Center; appointments may also be made through the Wasserman Center to meet with a career counselor in the College offices (100 Washington Square East, 9th Floor).Paid Internships These are the most common form of internship. Jobs related to a student's professional interests provide pay for the work that students are doing for the organization. Many companies and organi-zations provide part-time jobs that allow students to gain experience and to network in the field, while at the same time helping to alleviate the financial burden of being a college student. (Please note: Some for-profit companies ask students to volunteer, but allow it only if the student can earn academic credit. Many of these so-called internships do not relate directly to a student's academic work and might not be worthy of academic credit in a discipline. In these cases, the company should consider providing compensation for the work done by a student, thus making it a paid internship.) Credit-Bearing Internships A few departments offer academic intern- ships that directly advance a student's knowledge in the academic discipline and thus earn course credit. Such academic internships must be sponsored by an appropriate faculty member through an academic department and normally require close faculty supervision, sig-nificant academic research and writing in addition to the practical work experience, a reporting of findings, and a formal assessment of the student's work. All such internships require permission of the department or program, and registration for them must be within the regular dead-lines. Departments offering credit-bearing internships may restrict them to declared majors, since those students have the requisite background. Internship courses can be counted toward some majors but not toward others. Students should check relevant websites (and sections in this Bulletin) to learn more about the specific policies and procedures pertaining to credit-bearing internships in different CAS departments and programs. Whether an internship is paid or unpaid has no bearing on whether or not it can be taken for CAS credit. However, the decision to sponsor and grant credit for an intern-ship, or not, rests solely with each academic department of the College. Academic credit for internships must be based solely on the academic work produced in the internship. No credit should be awarded merely for attending the internship, whether paid or unpaid. The College recommends 2-point internships for academic work of approximately 10 pages of writing plus adequate reading. In rare cases student may earn 4 points; in these cases the academic work must be equivalent to that produced in a regular 4-point course. State Law and Credit-Bearing Internships Owing to recent changes in states' laws governing out-of-state entities and their right to award credit for certain educational experiences, including internships, within state boundaries (known as \"state autho-rization\"), CAS can only award credit for internships that take place in: Alaska Arizona California Connecticut D istrict of Columbia (Washington, D.C.)441 Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Louisiana Maine Michigan Montana Nebraska New Jersey New York North Dakota Pennsylvania South Carolina South Dakota Utah Virginia WyomingThe list above will be updated as NYU obtains authorization in other states. Internships Abroad Whether a CAS student is able to participate in a for-credit internship outside the United States depends on many variables, including the student's country of citizenship and local laws in the host country. Please seek advisement and preapproval from Office of Global Programs staff (global.internships@nyu.edu) and the director of undergraduate studies in your department before undertak-ing a non-US internship.Independent Study In some CAS departments, independent study that draws on the activity or environment of the internship may be a possibility. Like a credit-bearing internship, independent study requires a proposal by the student, careful guidance from a faculty member, and a body of work that can be evaluated for course credit.

STUDY AWAY COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITY451 ADMISSION COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYwww.admissions.nyu.edu Office of Undergraduate Admissions Phone: 212-998-4500 Admission to the College of Arts and Science at New York University is highly selective. Applicants are admitted as fresh-men and as transfer students. Candidates are accepted on the basis of predicted suc-cess in the specific programs in which they are interested. If the applicant meets formal course requirements, his or her capacity for successful undergraduate work is measured through careful consideration of secondary school and/or college records; recommenda-tions from guidance counselors, teachers, and others; scores on standardized tests; and the personal essay.Each applicant is reviewed carefully to identify academic strength, potential for intellectual growth and creativity, and promise of fully utilizing the special offer-ings of the University and the city. Each applicant's record is considered objectively and evaluated for participation in extracur-ricular and community services, in addition to scholarly pursuits. New York University actively seeks students who are varied in interests, talents, and goals, as well as in economic and social backgrounds. Particular attention is paid to the degree to which candidates have made the effective use of opportunities available to them, however great or limited those opportunities may have been. Evidence of character and maturity are regarded as essential in potential students who hope to benefit fully from the unique offerings of the University and its urban environment. Participation in meaningful school and community activities is an important factor. Applicants who are neither U.S. citizens nor permanent residents should refer to this sec-tion's heading \"applicants with international credentials.\" Admission RECOMMENDED HIGH SCHOOL PREPARATION THE ADMISSIONS PROCESSThe quality of an applicant's secondary school record is more important than a pre-scribed pattern of courses. Freshmen who are best prepared to succeed at NYU will have explored the following topics in their high schools: four years of English, with heavy emphasis on writing; three to four years of academic mathematics; three to four years of laboratory science; three to four years of social studies; and two to three years of foreign language. Students most competitive for admission will exceed these minimums. The admissions committee pays particular attention to the number of honors, AP , and IB courses the applicant has completed in high school. It is strongly recommended that all applicants take mathematics and language courses in the senior year of high school. All candidates for admission to the College must complete the Common Application and the NYU Member Questions and Writing Supplement on the Common Application. Applicants must apply online, as there is no paper version of the application available.

PREVIOUS COLLEGE CREDITS FOR FRESHMAN APPLICANTS Credit may be awarded to students who have completed college courses while in high school, provided they received a grade of \"B\" or better in the courses, an official transcript from the college or university is received, and corresponding courses are offered at NYU. These courses must be taken on a college/university campus with other college/university students, and must be taught by a college/university faculty member.NYU does not grant credit for college courses that are used to satisfy high school graduation requirements.SAT SUBJECT EXAMINATIONS AND THE COLLEGE CORE CURRICULUM SAT Subject Examination1 Scor e Cor e Requirement Satisfied Chinese2 700 and up F oreign language French3 650 and up F oreign language German3 650 and up F oreign language Hebrew (Modern)2 700 and up F oreign language Italian3 650 and up F oreign language Japanese2 700 and up F oreign language Korean2 700 and up F oreign language Latin2 650 and up F oreign language Mathematics Level 1 or 24 700 and up Q uantitative Reasoning Spanish3 660 and up F oreign language 1 No credit is awarded for any examination on this table. Some of the foreign language examinations are offered both with and without a listening component; Core exemption (and, if applicable, placement) scores are the same. 2 Scores in these languages may only be used for Core exemption, not for placement. Students who intend to register for any of these languages at NYU must take the CAS placement examination. 3 Scores in these languages may be used either for Core exemption or for placement in the proper level of study. Consult the website of the relevant CAS language department or the CAS Office of Academic Affairs, Silver 908; 212-998-8110. 4 A score of 650 or better on either mathematics subject examination (or on the mathematics section of the SAT general test) places students into Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) or Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) if they intend to register for these courses. ADMISSION COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITY455 ADMISSION COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYEARLY DECISION FOR ENTERING FRESHMEN NYU offers two Early Decision application options for freshman applicants who are certain that NYU is their first-choice university. Students applying as Early Decision candidates will receive their admission decision after December 15th (Early Decision I) or after February 15th (Early Decision II). An Outline of NYU's Early Decision Philosophy and Process NYU's Early Decision programs are, in fact, binding agreements, whereby if an applicant is offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that enables the student to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously submitted applications and accept NYU's admission offer\u2014roughly within two to three weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from filing any new applications and are expected to withdraw any active applications to other schools. Providing that a student has completed the CSS PROFILE online, the student will be provided with a financial aid estimate soon after the student is offered admission. Again, admitted students will have roughly two to three weeks to review their financial aid package before confirming their enrollment at NYU. The FAFSA becomes available on January 1st and should be completed by admitted Early Decision candidates after submitting an enrollment deposit.We believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is indeed to provide an early decision; for that reason, we typically either admit or deny Early Decision candidates and do not waitlist them. Early Decision and Financial Aid NYU uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates. Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply for admission. For Early Decision I candidates, we use information students share with us via the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE online to provide admitted students with an estimated financial aid package after December 15th. For Early Decision II candidates, we use this information to provide admitted students with an estimated financial aid package after February 15th. Students are then provided with their official financial aid award in late April, assuming students have completed their Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by February 15th. Students will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if they believe their estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to apply Early Decision if finances are of concern. Early Decision Application Process 1. Complete the Common A pplication and NYU Supplement online, and check either the Early Decision I or II option. 2. D ownload and sign the Early Decision Agreement from the Common Application website. Secure the signature of your parent or guardian and your college adviser/guidance counselor. When you apply online, the Early Decision Agreement may be submitted along with your high school transcript. Alternatively, it may be faxed to 212-995-4911 or emailed to admissions.docs@nyu.edu by your counselor. 3. S ubmit all supporting materials, such as transcripts and standardized test scores, to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions by the appropriate deadline.After the admissions decision is made and the appropriate financial aid applications are submitted, a request for financial aid is considered. All freshman students applying for financial aid must file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the College Scholarship Service/Financial Aid PROFILE (CSS PROFILE). We recom-mend that students apply electronically; see our NYU website. There is no fee charged to file the FAFSA but a fee is associated with the CSS PROFILE. When completing the CSS PROFILE, students will be made aware by the form whether they qualify for a fee waiver. Students must include the NYU federal school code number 002785 in the school section of the FAFSA and CSS PROFILE to ensure that their submitted information is transmitted by the processor to New York University. T ransfer students applying for financial aid need only complete the FAFSA. New York State residents should also complete the separate application for the T uition Assistance Program (TAP); for information, visit www.nyu.edu/admissions/undergraduate-admissions/financial-aid. Students from other states may be required to complete separate applications for their state programs if their state grants can be used at New York University. FINANCIAL AID APPLICATION456 ADMISSION COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYTRANSFER APPLICANTS WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY SPECIAL (VISITING) STUDENTS (UNDERGRADUATE)Students who wish to transfer from one school to another within the University must file an Internal T ransfer Application available online prior to the application deadline (November 1 for the spring term and March 1 for the summer or fall term). Undergraduate matriculated students who are currently attending other regionally accredited four-year colleges and maintaining good standing, both academic and disciplinary, may be admitted on certification from their own schools. Such students must be eligible to receive degree credit at their own schools for courses taken at the University. The approval as a special undergraduate student is for two terms only and cannot be extended. The Special Student Application Form for undergraduate students may be obtained online. A $70 application fee is required. Deadlines for applications are as follows: Fall: August 1 Spring: December 1 Summer: April 1All special students must meet the regulations of the Faculty Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards regarding grades and program.ADVANCED STANDING FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS Credit may be awarded for satisfactory work completed at another accredited college or university. When a transfer applicant is admitted to the College, the applicant's official college transcript(s) is (are) examined carefully to determine how much, if any, advanced standing will be granted. Each individual course completed elsewhere is evaluated. In granting advanced standing, the following are considered: the content, complexity, and grading standards of courses taken elsewhere; individual grades and grade averages attained by the applicant; the suitability of courses taken elsewhere for the program of study chosen here; and the degree of preparation that completed courses provide for more advanced study here. Point credit toward the degree is given only for a grade of C or better and provided that the credit fits into the selected program of study and courses were completed within the past 10 years. Quarter hours will be converted to semester hours to determine the number of credits transferable to NYU. Credits based on semester hours will be transferred at face value to NYU. As with all other students, transfer students are required to fulfill the residency requirement. All degree candidates are subject to the following residency requirement: They must complete at least 64 consecutive points of course work in residence at the College immediately preceding the date of graduation and are permitted to transfer a maximum of 64 credits to NYU. A tentative statement of advanced standing is provided to each transfer student upon notification of admission to the College. A final statement of advanced standing is provided during the student's first semester of matriculation. Requests for reevaluation of transfer credit must be made within the semester during which the final statement of advanced standing is received. Thereafter, a student's advanced standing credits may be changed only with the written permission of the Office of the Dean. TRANSFER APPLICANTS A student may be admitted by transfer from another college or university in September, January, or May. (See \"the admission process,\" above.) Credit will be granted for most collegiate work completed with a grade of C or better within the last 10 years that satisfies degree requirements and that falls within the residency requirement, with the exception of certain courses of a vocational nature or courses not consistent with the educational objectives of the College. Within these provisions, applicants from regionally accredited colleges are eligible for admission. Except when specifically noted, the general procedures described for entering freshmen apply to all applicants seeking to transfer from other two-year or four-year regionally accredited institutions. T ransfer applicants must submit official credentials and transcripts from all institutions attended, including secondary school transcripts. T ransfer applicants who took the SAT or ACT exams while in high school should submit their test results as part of their application. T ransfer applicants who did not take these exams while in high school and have been in college less than one year must follow the testing requirements listed on the admissions website. 457 ADMISSION COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYAPPLICANTS WITH INTERNATIONAL CREDENTIALS Applicants to New York University who are neither U.S. citizens nor permanent residents of the United States must complete the Common Application available online.

SPECIAL (POSTGRADUATE) STUDENTS458 ADMISSION COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYNYU SPRING IN NEW YORK NYU JANUARY TERMNYU Spring in New York offers college students from other institutions an opportunity to earn college credit and to experience academic life at New York University. Spring in New York participants enroll in one of eight areas of study, in courses with NYU students and taught by NYU faculty.In addition to classroom learning, NYU Spring in New York students have access to the same opportunities and benefits as NYU students: library access, sports center access, and program office events, including ticket discounts for Broadway shows, concerts, and sporting events. They are also encouraged to participate in planned excursions around the city.The program is offered to students currently matriculated and in good standing at an accredited college or university (within the United States) with a competitive grade point average. Students must have at least sophomore standing in the academic year of participation. Further information is available at www.nyu.edu/spring.in.ny. New York University's January Term allows students more flexibility and new scheduling options. NYU students, visiting students, and international students have the opportunity to earn major/minor credit or explore a new interest. During this time, students can take advantage of intensive study at one of the foremost research and teaching universities in the United States, as well as have a chance to enjoy New York City during a bustling and exciting time of year. Oftentimes, the fall and spring semesters can be overly hectic for students, considering a full-time course load, student club responsibilities, work, and internship commitments. This busy time doesn't always allow the freedom to explore a new academic interest or take advantage of the many cultural resources that originally drew them to New York City. January Term provides an array of courses enabling students to earn academic credit (major, minor, or elective) in courses that are in high demand, to accelerate degree completion, and to concentrate on personal interests. Further information is available at www.nyu.edu/winter.

Part one (always a test of written Italian) can yield four credits of ITAL-UA elective (satisfies Core foreign language requirement), so long as grades in this subject over the last two years of secondary education were always 7 or higher. Part two (one subject tested in depth, which rotates from year to year) can also can yield four credits (and possible Core Curriculum exemption), so long as grades in this subject over the last two years of secondary education were also always 7 or higher. The third part of the written test (a quiz of all secondary school subjects, except for the one tested in part two) and the oral portion are not awarded any advanced standing credit.460 ADMISSION COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYThe College participates in the Advanced Placement (AP) Program of the College Entrance Examination Board. In accordance with New York University policy, students may receive college credit toward their degree for test results of 5 or 4, depending on the subject examination. Students receiving credit toward their degree may not take the corresponding college-level course for credit. If they do, they will lose the AP credit. See the chart below concerning those AP test scores for which credit is given. The chart also lists those tests for which College Core Curriculum equivalencies are granted. For additional information, students should consult the Office of Undergraduate Admissions online or by telephone at 212-998-4500. ADVANCED PLACEMENT PROGRAM Note: a 4 or 5 on any foreign language AP satisfies the Core language requirement. Note: the College accepts a score of 5 (not 4) on the Russian Language and Culture Prototype AP examination for exemption from the foreign language requirement, but no credit is awarded and the score cannot be used for placement; scores of 4 or lower award no credit and have no bearing on exemption or placement.

This section provides information on both of these distinct but related topics. Tuition, Fees, and Financial Aid TUITION AND FEES: 2015-2016 Following is the schedule of fees established by the Board of T rustees of New York University for the year 2015-2016. The Board of T rustees reserves the right to alter this schedule without notice. T uition, fees, and expenses may be expected to increase in subsequent years and will be listed in online updates to this Bulletin at bulletin.cas.nyu.edu. Students should also consult www.nyu.edu/bursar for this updated information. Note that the registration and services fee covers membership, dues, etc., to the student's class organization and entitles the student to membership in such University activities as are supported by this allocation and to receive regularly those University and College publi-cations that are supported in whole or in part by the student activities fund. It also includes the University's health services, emergency and accident coverage, and technology fees. Note: Deposits may be required for labora- tory courses. Students should consult the respective departments for information. All fees are payable at the time of registration. The Office of the Bursar is located at 25 West Fourth Street. Checks and drafts are to be drawn to the order of New York University for the exact amount of the tuition and fees required. In the case of overpayment, the bal-ance is refunded on request by filing a refund application in the Office of the Bursar. A fee will be charged if payment is not made by the due date indicated on the student's statement. The unpaid balance of a student's account is also subject to an interest charge of 12 percent per annum from the first day of class until payment is received.Holders of New York State T uition Assistance Program (TAP) awards will be allowed credit toward their tuition fees in the amount of their entitlement, provided they are New York State residents, are enrolled on a full-time basis, and present the award certificate with their schedule/bill for the applicable term. Students who receive TAP awards after registration will receive a check from the University after the New York State pay-ment has been received by the Office of the Bursar and the Office of the Registrar has confirmed eligibility.

Deferred Payment Plan The deferred payment plan allows students to pay 50 percent of their net balance due for the current term on the payment due date and defer the remaining 50 percent until later in the semester. This plan is available to students who meet the following eligibility requirements: M atriculated and registered for 6 or more points W ithout a previously unsatisfactory University credit record N ot in arrears (past due) for any University charge or loan The plan includes a nonrefundable application fee of $50, which is to be included with the initial payment on the payment due date. Interest at a rate of 1 percent per month on the unpaid balance will be assessed if payment is not made in full by the final installment due date. A late payment fee will be assessed on any late payments. A separate deferred payment plan applica- tion and agreement is required for each semester this plan is used. The deferred payment plan will be available at www.nyu.edu/bursar/forms in July for the fall semester and in December for the spring semester. For additional information, please visit the website of the Office of the Bursar or call 212-998-2806.TuitionPay Plan T uitionPay is a payment plan administered by Sallie Mae. The plan is open to all NYU students with the exception of the SPS noncredit division. This interest-free plan allows for all or a portion of a student's educational expenses (including tuition, fees, room, and board) to be paid in monthly installments. The traditional University billing cycle consists of one large lump-sum payment due at the beginning of each semester. T uitionPay is a budget plan that enables a family to spread payments over the course of the academic year. By enrolling in this plan, you spread your fall semester tuition payments over a four-month period (June through September) and your spring semester tuition payment over another four-month period (November through February). With this plan, you budget the cost of your tuition and/or housing, after deducting any financial aid you will be receiving and/or any payments you have made directly to NYU. A nonrefundable enrollment fee of $50 is required when applying for the fall/spring T uitionPay plan. You must enroll in both the fall and spring plans. Monthly statements will be mailed by T uitionPay, and all payments should be made directly to them. For additional information, contact T uitionPay at 800-635-0120 or visit www.nyu.edu/bursar. Arrears Policy The University reserves the right to deny registration and withhold all information regarding the record of any student who is in arrears in the payment of tuition, fees, loans, or other charges (including charges for housing, dining, or other activities or services) for as long as any arrears remain. Diploma Arrears Policy Diplomas of students in arrears will be held until their financial obligations to the University are fulfilled and they have been cleared by the Bursar. Graduates with a diploma hold may contact the Office of the Bursar at 212-998-2806 to clear arrears or to discuss their financial status at the University.466 TUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AID COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYA student who, for any reason, finds it impossible to complete one or more courses for which he or she has registered should consult with an academic adviser. An official withdrawal must be filed either on Albert (through the first two weeks of the term only) or in writing on a completed change of program (drop/add) form with the Office of the University Registrar. (Note: An official withdrawal must be filed if a course has been canceled, and, in this case, the student is entitled to a refund of tuition and registration fees paid.) Withdrawal does not necessarily entitle the student to a refund of tuition paid or a cancellation of tuition still due. A refund of tuition will be made provided such withdrawal is filed within the scheduled refund period for the term. (See the following schedules.) Merely ceasing to attend a class does not constitute official withdrawal, nor does notification to the instructor. A stop payment of a check presented for tuition does not constitute withdrawal, nor does it reduce the indebtedness to the University. The nonreturnable registration fee and a penalty fee of $20 for a stopped payment must be charged in addition to any tuition not canceled. The date on which the change of program form is filed, not the last date of attendance in class, is considered the official date of the student's withdrawal. It is this date that serves as the basis for computing any refund granted the student. The processing of refunds takes approximately two weeks. There are two distinct refund schedules (see below): 1. F or students withdrawing from some courses, but not all; and 2. F or students withdrawing from all courses. Undergraduate Refund Schedule, Withdrawing from Some Courses (Fall and Spring Only) Courses dropped during the first two weeks of the term: 100% (100% of tuition and fees)*Courses dropped after the first two weeks of the term: NONE The above refund schedule is not applicable to students whose registration remains within the flat-fee range of 12 to 18 points per term. * Note: All fees (including school-related fees) are nonreturnable after the second calendar week of the semester. Undergraduate Refund Schedule, Withdrawing from All Courses (Fall and Spring Only) This schedule is based on the total applicable charge for tuition, excluding nonreturnable fees and deposits. Withdrawal on or before the official opening date of the term: 100% (100% of tuition and fees) Withdrawal on the second day after the official opening date of the term through the end of the first calendar week: 100% (100% of tuition only) Note: The first calendar week consists of the first seven (7) calendar days beginning with the official opening date of the term (not the first day of the class meeting). Withdrawal within the second calendar week of the term: 70% (tuition only) Withdrawal within the third calendar week of the term: 55% (tuition only) Withdrawal within the fourth calendar week of the term: 25% (tuition only) Withdrawal after completion of the fourth calendar week of the term: NONE Note: All fees (including school-related fees) are nonreturnable after the official first day of the semester. Note: A student may not withdraw from a class after the ninth week of the fall or spring semester or in the last two weeks of each six-week summer session. Exceptions to the published refund schedule may be appealed in writing to the refund committee in the College Advising Center (Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905; 212-998-8130) and should be supported by appropriate documentation regarding the circumstances that warrant consideration of an exception. Exceptions are rarely granted. Students who withdraw should review the \"refunds\" page on the Office of the Bursar's website. Federal regulations require adjustments reducing financial aid if a student with-draws even after the NYU refund period. Financial aid amounts will be adjusted for students who withdraw through the ninth week of the semester and have received any federal grants or loans. This adjustment may result in the student's bill not being fully paid. NYU will bill the student for this difference. The student will be responsible for payment of this bill before returning to NYU and will remain responsible for payment even if he or she does not return to NYU. For any semester a student receives any aid, that semester will be counted in the satisfactory academic progress standard. This may require the student to make up credits before receiving any further aid. Please review the \"satisfactory academic progress\" standard on the Office of Financial Aid website, so as not to jeopardize future semesters of aid. Tuition Insurance The College strongly advises students to purchase tuition insurance to protect their investment in the event of withdrawal from courses beyond the published refund schedule. This insurance can be very helpful when unexpected situations cause a student to withdraw. Exceptions to the University's refund policy are rarely granted for withdrawals after the fourth week of the semester. Please contact A. W. G. Dewar, Inc. (Four Batterymarch Park, Quincy, MA 02169-7468; 617-774-1555) or visit www.tuitionrefundplan.com for more information.WITHDRAWAL AND REFUND OF TUITION467 TUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AID COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYNew York University awards financial aid in an effort to help students meet the difference between their own resources and the cost of education.

Any student with a question or problem is invited to come to the office or to call 212-998-8130 and ask for assistance. Office hours are weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Thursdays until 6 p.m.). Students complete their initial registration through Albert, the University's web regis-tration system, at home.nyu.edu. Students also use Albert to make later adjustments to their schedule. Continuing Students Students currently enrolled in the College register early for the following semester\u2014in November for the spring term and in April for the fall term. Students who are currently enrolled or on an official leave of absence receive notifica-tion of the date and time when they can register. Before registering, students plan a provisional schedule and put it in the \"shopping cart\" function of Albert. They also discuss their program and courses with their adviser, who then clears them for registration. At the appointed time or thereafter, students access Albert to register. Students must complete registra-tion by paying their tuition and fees. Online tuition statements and payment options are available through the Office of the Bursar.New Students Newly admitted students receive detailed instructions about orientation and registration, as well as the name and contact information of an adviser in the College Advising Center who assists them in academic planning, course selection, and registration. T ransfer students with a declared major also have an opportunity to discuss their program with a faculty member in their chosen major department. For preregistration immunization requirements, please see \"immunization requirements\" in the academic policies section of this Bulletin. College Advising Center The College Advising Center (Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905; 212-998-8130; advising.cas.nyu.edu) offers a wide range of services and programs designed to meet the needs of a diverse student body. The advisers serve as a basic source of information about the degree requirements, policies, and procedures of the College. Academic and career development workshops are sponsored or cosponsored to assist students in planning academic programs, choosing a major, and negotiating registration. In addition, vari-ous cocurricular educational opportunities, from informal faculty talks to seminars and lectures, are arranged through the center. Support programs are available for African American and Latino students; interna-tional students; undecided students; and freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors. Advisers also meet individually with students who want to discuss concerns or questions they may be having about the University. The advisers serve as a liaison with other offices and can make referrals when appropriate. The College Advising Center is thus the best place for students to visit when they are unsure of where to go for help. It is open weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Thursdays until 6 p.m.). Questions about cross-registration in other schools of the University, combined degree programs, and the College Core Curriculum may be brought to the College Advising Center and Academic Resource Center or ARC (18 Washington Place). Please also see the sections on the College Core Curriculum and preprofessional, accelerated, and specialized programs in this Bulletin. First-Year Students All first-year students participate in the College Cohort Program (CCP). The CCP begins with a virtual advising and registration process during the early summer, including selection of a Freshman Seminar, which is required for all CAS first-year students. The Freshman Seminar determines placement in a small advising cohort. There is also an extensive academic orientation and introduction to the CCP during Welcome Week. During fall of the first year, cohorts come together every other week for a \"cohort meeting,\" where they work closely with their academic adviser and a college leader (an upperclass mentor) exploring topics which form a foundation for exploring and engaging in the variety of academic and cultural offerings at NYU, through NYC, and within the Global Network University. Students can meet as often as they would like with their advisers individually outside the context of the cohort meeting and are required to meet for individual advising appointments prior to registration for the following semester. Cohorts continue 470 REGISTRATION, ADVISEMENT, AND COUNSELING COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYVarious Department of Veterans Affairs programs provide educational benefits for spouses, sons, and daughters of deceased or permanently disabled veterans, as well as for veterans and in-service personnel, subject to certain restrictions. Under most programs, the student pays tuition and fees at the time of registration but will receive a monthly allowance from Veterans Affairs. (This applies to Chapters 30, 35, and 106 only.)Veterans with service-connected disabilities may qualify for educational benefits under Chapter 31. Applicants for this program are required to submit to the Department of Veterans Affairs a letter of acceptance meeting on a monthly basis through the spring semester of the first year. The assigned CAS adviser remains available to students throughout their undergraduate experience, and serves as the primary source for academic advising until the student declares a major. Transfer Students Advising for students who are transferring to CAS from another college or university begins once the College is notified that they have accepted admission. Students begin with a virtual advising and registration process which includes direct contact with an academic advisor who can interpret the transfer credit report, assist with course selection, and answer all questions about degree requirements and registration. T ransfer students are also invited to a special orientation session which provides additional information needed to make a smooth transition into the College. CAS advisers lead these sessions along with current upperclassmen who serve as student resources throughout the orientation and transition. T ransfer students participate in the College Cohort Program (CCP) and are assigned an academic advisor within the College Advising Center. T ransfer students approaching junior standing must also declare a major and meet with an assigned adviser in the major department in order to ensure that appropriate course selections for the following semester are being made. Departmental Advisement Students who have declared a major go to their major's department for their primary advisement. All declared majors must have their registration approved by a departmental adviser. Departmental advisers can also be consulted throughout the academic year about graduate study and career opportunities. Office hours for departmental advisers are maintained in the departmental offices. THE UNIVERSITY LEARNING CENTER VETERANS' BENEFITSCOUNSELING AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AT THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCEThe College of Arts and Science operates Learning Centers in the Academic Resource Center or ARC (18 Washington Place) and University Hall (110 East 14th Street, UHall Commons). The Learning Centers provide extensive academic support services, free of charge, to students in all divisions of the University who take courses in the College. With their highly visible and acces-sible settings, they serve to link academics with students' residential and campus lives. Services offered by the centers include the following: I ndividual and group tutoring sessions Examination review sessions S tudy skills assessment and academic skills workshops For further information on services, offerings, and schedules at the ULC, please visit www.nyu.edu/ulc.

Applications and further information may be obtained from the student's regional office of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Additional inquiries can be directed to the certifying official in the Office of the Registrar. Since interpreta-tion of regulations governing veterans' benefits is subject to change, veterans should keep in touch with the Department of Veterans Affairs. Yellow Ribbon GI Education Enhancement Program NYU is pleased to participate in the Yellow Ribbon GI Education Enhancement Program (Yellow Ribbon Program), a provision of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008. The program is designed to help students finance, through scholarship assistance, up to 100 percent of their out-of-pocket tuition and fees associated with education programs that may exceed the Post-9/11 GI Bill tuition benefit, which will only pay up to the highest public in-state undergraduate tuition. Beginning in the 2009-2010 academic year, NYU has provided funds toward the tuition of each qualifying veteran who was admitted as a full-time undergraduate, with the VA matching NYU's tuition contribution for each student. To be eligible for the Yellow Ribbon benefits, an individual must be entitled to the maximum post-9/11 benefit. An individual may be eligible for the Yellow Ribbon Enhancement if: H e/she served an aggregate period of active duty after September 10, 2001, of at least 36 months. H e/she was honorably discharged from active duty for a service-connected disability and had served 30 continuous days after September 10, 2001. H e/she is a dependent eligible for transfer of entitlement under the Post-9/11 GI Bill based on a veteran's service under the eligibility criteria, as described on the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs website.The Department of Veterans Affairs is currently accepting applications for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. To qualify for the Yellow Ribbon Enhancement, you must apply directly to the VA. The VA will then deter-mine your eligibility for the Post-9/11 GI Bill and issue you a Certificate of Eligibility. Note: You can apply using the VA Form 22-1990. The form includes the instruc-tions needed to begin the process. After you are issued your Certificate of Eligibility from the Department of Veterans Affairs indicating that you qualify for the Yellow Ribbon Program, please contact Ms. Clara Fonteboa at clf1@nyu.edu or 212-998-4823. The Office of the University Registrar must certify to the Department of Veterans Affairs that the eligible person is enrolled as a full-time undergraduate student for the funds to be paid under the Yellow Ribbon Program.

Bachelor of Science (B.S.) B.S. programs are offered by the following departments of the College: chemistry, neural science (no B.A. option), and physics. They are also offered for the combined major in global public health and science, with a concentration in biology or chemistry (no B.A. option). For details, see the sections on these individual departments and majors in this Bulletin. The College also offers jointly with the NYU Tandon School of Engineering a dual-degree, Bachelor of Science/Bachelor of Science (B.S./B.S.) program; see the engineering section in this Bulletin. Further information on engineering is available in the College Advising Center, Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130. The general degree requirements are the same for the B.A. and the B.S., with the exception of the engineering B.S./B.S. To be eligible for the bachelor's degree, students must complete 128 points with a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0. Within these points, students must fulfill the requirements of both a major (also completed with a 2.0) and the College Core Curriculum.The degree requirements to be fulfilled are those in effect during the term of the student's first registration in the College. Registration in another division of New York University does not constitute a regis-tration in the College of Arts and Science. Readmitted students must fulfill the requirements as listed in the College of Arts and Science Bulletin published during the year of their readmission, unless their readmission letter states otherwise. In very exceptional cases, a student may petition the Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards for approval of a change in the requirements as stated in the Bulletin. The petition form may be obtained from the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140; www.cas.nyu.edu/page/petitions. Degrees are conferred in September, January, and May. The formal conferring of degrees by the president of the University takes place annually at Commencement in May. Major requirements, varying from depart-ment to department, are specified in the sections of this Bulletin devoted to the course listings of individual departments and programs. Generally, a little more than one-third of the total points are earned in the major concentration.Every student must complete a major with a cumulative grade point average in the major of at least 2.0. At least one-half of the courses (and in some departments, at least one-half of the points) used to complete the major must be taken in the College of Arts and Science. A student may not register for courses in the major outside of NYU. The student must be accepted as a major in the department and must review his or her program with a department adviser each term. Students go to the office of the department or program to declare a major and have it posted in the Student Information System (Albert). Students who have earned 64 or more points must declare a major. Those with fewer than 64 points are strongly encouraged to declare a major as early in their academic career as possible.473 DEGREE REQUIREMENTS COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYTHE MINOR REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO BOTH MAJOR AND MINOR TIME LIMIT RESIDENCE REQUIREMENTStudents may take a double (second) major. The same requirements, including the maintenance of a minimum grade point average of 2.0, apply to the second major as to the first. The second major is declared in the same way as the first (see above).In some cases, courses may be applicable to both majors if the academic departments consider this appropriate. Students must then obtain written approval for the shared course(s) from the directors of undergradu-ate studies of both departments. No student may double count more than two courses between two majors (or between a major and a minor, or between two minors); some departments have set more restrictive sharing rules (a limit of one shared course, or none at all) as indicated in their sections of this Bulletin. The minor requirements are found in the departmental sections of the Bulletin. The (optional) minor must be completed with a minimum grade point average of 2.0. The minor is declared at the office of the sponsoring department or program. No more than one minor can be completed outside of the College in the other divisions of NYU, as the limit on non-CAS credits is set at 16 points. The major and minor requirements to be followed are those stated in the departmental sections of the Bulletin in effect during the semester of the student's first registration in the College. No credit toward the major or minor is granted for grades of C-minus or lower, although such grades will be computed into the grade point average of the major or the minor, as well as into the overall grade point average. No course to be counted toward the major or minor may be taken on a pass/fail basis. (See \"pass/fail option\" under academic policies in this Bulletin.) T ransfer students from other colleges and universities must have the written approval of the director of undergraduate studies to count transfer courses toward the major or the minor. Once a student transfers to the College, all course work must be completed at NYU. (See also \"transfer students,\" below.) All requirements for a degree in the College must be met within a period of eight years from the date of matriculation. For transfer students and for students who are readmitted to the College, the length of time is proportionately reduced. T ransfer credit is not granted for courses taken more than 10 years before the student's matriculation in the College. Once a student enrolls in the College of Arts and Science (first year and/or transfer), all course work used to satisfy the 128-credit degree requirement must be completed at NYU. All students must complete their last 32 points while registered in the College of Arts and Science. In addition, students must be registered in the College during the semester immediately prior to graduation, unless officially approved for a leave of absence in that semester. One-half of the courses used to complete the major or the minor must be taken in the College. Any transfer courses to be applied toward major or minor requirements must be approved by the department. DOUBLE MAJOR474 DEGREE REQUIREMENTS COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYT ransfer students, whether external or internal, must complete 64 points in College of Arts and Science coursework (-UA suffix) and must earn a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 overall, in the required major, and in the optional minor. Courses taken in other NYU schools (i.e., without a -UA suffix) do not count toward the 64 credit minimum. Neither do NYU Abu Dhabi (-AD) or NYU Shanghai (-SH) courses. (However, -UA study away courses do count toward the 64 points.) At least one-half of the courses used to complete the major and any minor must be courses offered by the College (-UA suffix). Any transfer courses to be applied toward major or minor requirements must be approved by the department and may not exceed one-half of the required coursework for the major or minor.Courses in which a grade of C-minus or lower was obtained are not transferable. Grades earned from external transfer courses are not calculated in the NYU grade point average. TRANSFER STUDENTS475 ACADEMIC POLICIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYAcademic Policies ACADEMIC PROGRAM The programs and courses offered at the College of Arts and Science are designed for students who attend classes offered during the day on a full-time basis. A full-time schedule normally consists of 16 points per term, or 32 points per year, which enables a student to complete the entire program of 128 points in four years. Minimal full-time status entails completing at least 12 points per term, or 24 points per year. Students who wish to attend part time should obtain permission from the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140. Such status will be granted only when there is good and sufficient reason for part-time study. Failure to complete a minimum of 24 points per year jeopardizes a student's full-time status. Failure to complete 32 points per year may jeopardize a student's eligibility to receive financial aid; students should discuss their situation with the Office of Financial Aid in the Student Services Center, 25 West Fourth Street. Students in good academic standing may register for more than 18 points per term with the approval and clearance of their academic adviser. Students on academic probation, however, who wish to register for more than 18 points per term must obtain the prior approval of the Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards, as must any other student wishing to register for more than 20 points. Change of Program To make any changes in their program, including dropping or adding courses given in other divisions of the University, students must access Albert via NYUHome at home.nyu.edu or file a change of program (\"drop/add\") form with the Office of the Registrar in the Student Services Center, 25 West Fourth Street. Adding Courses The deadline for the adding of a course or a section is the end of the second week of the semester. The deadline applies to any course added by a College of Arts and Science student and to any College of Arts and Science course added by students from other divisions. The adding of any course or section after the end of the second week is generally allowed only when the student is changing levels within a discipline\u2014for example, from a French or mathematics course to a higher- or lower-level course in the same discipline. The addition is permit-ted only with the written approval of both the instructor and a CAS dean. Dropping and Withdrawing from Courses Students are expected to maintain a full-time program as described above. Occasionally, they may withdraw from a course if, because of reasons beyond their control, they cannot continue. Courses dropped during the first two weeks of the term will not appear on the transcript. Those dropped from the beginning of the third week through the end of the ninth week of the term will be recorded with a grade of W. After the ninth week, no one may withdraw from a course. Students who are ill or have a serious personal problem should see, call, or write to an adviser in the College Advising Center, College of Arts and Science, New York University, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905, New York, NY 10003-6688; 212-998-8130. Complete Withdrawals Students who wish to withdraw from all their courses must make an appointment for an interview with an adviser in the College Advising Center. A student who withdraws officially from all courses in a term may register for the following term. If the student is unable to attend the College during the term following the withdrawal, he or she should discuss a leave of absence from an adviser in the College Advising Center. For more information, see \"attendance,\" below. Auditing Matriculated students in the College or in any division of the University (undergradu-ate or graduate) may audit (i.e., attend lectures without intending to receive credit) any course in the College with the consent of, and under the conditions established by, the instructor and the department. Auditors may not preempt space required for regis-tered students. Courses cannot be audited as a means of satisfying requirements for an incomplete grade or as a means of changing a previous grade. A student cannot register as an auditor, and audited courses will not appear on the student's official transcript. Special (visiting, nondegree) students may not audit courses.Although the administration of the College does not supervise attendance of classes, it supports the standards imposed by instructors. Students who, in the judgment of the instructor, have not substantially met the requirements of the course or who have been excessively absent may be considered to have withdrawn unofficially and may be given the final grade of F . See \"withdrawing from courses,\" above. Religious Holidays and Attendance New York University, as a nonsectarian institution, adheres to the general policy of including in its official calendar only certain legal holidays. However, it has also long been University policy that members of any religious group may, without penalty, absent themselves from classes when compliance with their religious obligations requires it. In 1988, the University Senate affirmed this policy and passed a resolution that elaborated on it as follows: 1. S tudents who anticipate being absent because of any religious observance should, whenever possible, notify faculty in advance of such anticipated absence. 2. Whenev er feasible, examinations and assignment deadlines should not be scheduled on religious holi-days. Any student absent from class because of religious beliefs shall not be penalized for any class, examina-tion, or assignment deadline missed on that day or days. 3. I f examinations or assignment deadlines are scheduled, any student who is unable to attend class because of religious beliefs shall be given the opportunity to make up that day or days. 4. N o adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to any student who avails himself or herself of the above provisions. 476 ACADEMIC POLICIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYLEAVE OF ABSENCE General Leave If a student and an adviser agree that a leave of absence is the best way to proceed given the student's situation, the adviser will assist in the withdrawal from the semester and extended time for a leave of absence. A student needs to make an appointment with an adviser to discuss his or her par-ticular situation and review the terms of the leave of absence; please contact the College Advising Center, Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130. A student may request a leave of absence for the fall or spring semester, and must make his or her request prior to the end of the second week of the semester he or she wishes to be on leave. A student who requests a leave after that deadline or who has been out of attendance without first being granted a leave must apply for readmission. Also note that leaves are not granted retroactively for past semesters. There are no leaves of absence for the summer and January terms, as enrollment during these terms is not required to maintain matriculation in the College. A student granted a leave does not have to make a formal application for readmission as long as he or she returns to the College within the agreed-upon time (a maximum of two semesters during a student's academic career). Students who attend another college during the leave must petition to have the credits transferred after they have been approved to return to the College. Petitions may be obtained at the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140; www.cas.nyu.edu/page/petitions. Students are advised to inquire how the leave of absence may affect their scholarship and financial aid award and should contact the Office of Financial Aid at 25 West Fourth Street. If students are on probation when the leave is granted, they will return on probation. Students out of attendance who did not apply for a leave and who wish to return to the College must apply for readmission. (See the admission section of this Bulletin.) Psychological and Medical Leave If a student and a counselor or a physician agree that a psychological or medical leave of absence is the best way to proceed given the situation, the counselor or physician should make a recommendation to the associate dean for students at the College for the withdrawal from the semester and extended time for a leave of absence. A stu-dent needs to complete the leave of absence petition form, which can be obtained at the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140; www.cas.nyu.edu/page/petitions. Leave of absence petitions are accepted and reviewed on a rolling basis throughout the academic year. A certification of readiness to return to school from a leave of absence form should be completed by the counselor/therapist or physician, who needs to state clearly that the student is ready to return and that NYU is a suitable environment in which to continue his or her academic work. The student must also schedule an appointment with a counselor/therapist or physician at the NYU Student Health Center prior to receiving approval from the College to return. A student granted a leave does not have to make a formal application for readmission as long as he or she returns to the College within the agreed-upon time (a maximum of two semesters during a student's academic career). Students who attend another college during the leave must petition to have the credits transferred after they have been approved to return to the College. Petitions may be obtained at the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140; www.cas.nyu.edu/page/petitions. Students are advised to inquire how the leave of absence may affect their scholarship and financial aid award and should contact ATTENDANCE477 ACADEMIC POLICIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYCREDIT Credit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, A Level, and Other Examinations The College participates in the Advanced Placement Program of the College Entrance Examination Board. Students who have taken Advanced Placement exams while in high school should have the Educational Testing Service in Princeton, N.J., forward their official scores to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, 665 Broadway, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10012-2339. No credit is given for AP tests taken after the completion of high school. In most sub- jects, if the score received is 4 or 5, credit will be granted. The AP credit will be lost, however, if a student takes the equivalent course for credit in the College. For more information, see the \"advanced placement equivalencies\" chart in the admission sec- tion of this Bulletin. For information on IB, A Level, and the other international examinations for which CAS awards credit (minimum scores, course equivalencies, etc.), please see \"credit by examination\" and charts in the admis- sion section of this Bulletin. The maximum number of credits allowed toward the degree requirements of the College that are a result of any possible combination of nonresident special exami-nation programs (plus previous coursework, if applicable and approved) shall not exceed a total of 32. College Credit Taken While in High School Credit may be awarded to students who have completed college courses while in high school, provided they received a grade of \"B\" or better in the courses, an official transcript from the college or university is received, and corresponding courses are offered at NYU. These courses should be taken on a college/university campus, with other college/university students, and taught by a college/university faculty member. NYU does not grant credit for college courses that are used to satisfy high school graduation requirements. Students who enter CAS as freshmen can be awarded a maximum of 32 advanced standing credits; this limit includes both credit from AP and other exams and previ-ous college credit. Credit for Courses in the College To receive credit for a course, the student must register before attending, meet the requirements for attendance, and creditably complete all examinations and assignments prescribed by the instructor. For exceptional students, most departments also offer independent study. The College does not permit students to register as auditors. Restrictions on Receiving Credit (Including Course Repeat Policy) For students who matriculate in or are re-admitted to the College of Arts and Science in fall 2012 and thereafter: A student who has taken a course for credit or who has obtained a W in a course is permitted to repeat that course once. Students may not repeat more than two courses during their undergraduate careers. Students may not repeat courses in a designated sequence after taking more advanced courses. The departments deter-mine the sequencing of courses. Students with questions regarding the repetition of courses or course sequences must consult with the particular department offering the course. When a student repeats a course, no additional credit will be awarded. Both grades will be recorded and computed in the grade point average. Courses that a student repeated before internally or externally transferring or transitioning into CAS do not count against the two-course limit. (Students who entered CAS before fall 2012 should consult this section of the CAS Bulletin for the year they matriculated in the College to find the course repeat policy applicable to them). A limited number of credits may be earned by those in the military services who take correspondence courses in colleges approved by the United States Armed Forces Institute. Students may not be registered at another university at the same time that they are registered in the College of Arts and Science. Credit for Courses at Other Schools and Divisions of New York University Courses may be taken in the New York University Graduate School of Arts and Science. 1000-level graduate courses may be taken as described in the departmental sections of this bulletin, and 2000-level graduate courses may be taken with written approval of the instructor. If graduate courses are applied toward the comple- tion of requirements for the baccalaureate degree, no advanced credit is allowed for them in the Graduate School of Arts and Science. It is also possible for students to take courses in other undergraduate divisions of New York University and to have credits for these courses applied to the degree in the College. Students may take a total of 16 points in other divisions, including any courses for particular minors approved by the College. T ransfer students should note that credits for non-liberal-arts courses (e.g., business, applied art, speech) taken at another institution count as part of the 16 points. Students seeking additional non-liberal-arts the Office of Financial Aid at 25 West Fourth Street. If students are on probation when the leave is granted, they will return on probation. Students out of attendance who did not apply for a leave and who wish to return to the College must apply for readmission. (See the admission section of this Bulletin.)478 ACADEMIC POLICIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYcredits beyond the 16-point limit must file a petition with the Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards in the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140; www.cas.nyu.edu/page/petitions. Some study away courses bearing the suffixes -AD (NYU Abu Dhabi) and -SHU (NYU Shanghai) are approved not to count against each CAS student's 16-point allowance in the other schools of NYU. Please note that restrictions apply. Courses in other divisions that duplicate the contents of a College of Arts and Science course do not count toward the College degree. For details, students must check with an adviser in the College Advising Center before registering for any courses in other divisions. If a course is not approved, students will not receive credit for it. Independent study or internship courses taken in other divisions of the University do not count toward the College degree. If such courses are taken at schools outside the University, the credit will not transfer to the College. Also excluded from credit toward the degree are any courses taken in the School of Professional Studies, and/or in the Liberal Studies Program, once a student is registered in the College. Credit for online courses will not be counted toward the baccalaureate degree. Internal and external transfer students to the College must complete 64 credits in CAS (-UA) courses; courses taken in the other divisions and schools of NYU (including NYU Abu Dhabi and Shanghai) cannot count toward this 64 credit requirement. Summer Credits Once admitted to the College, students must take all courses here, including those they need or wish to take during the sum- mer. Exceptions are granted only rarely and only for good academic reasons. Requests for a waiver should be made by submitting a petition to the Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards in the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140; www.cas.nyu.edu/page/petitions. Information about NYU summer course offerings is available during the preceding fall and spring terms, as is information about dormitory facilities available to students who usually commute. Credit for Independent Study Most departments offer independent study courses for students with exceptional qualifications. In these courses, the work is planned specifically for each student. Independent study courses allow the student to work independently with faculty supervision and counsel. The courses typically carry variable credit of 2 or 4 points each term. They are normally limited to upper-class majors but may be open to other well-qualified students. To register for independent study, a student must have written approval of the director of undergraduate studies of the department in which the course is offered. The result of the independent study course should be a paper or objective, tangible evidence of completion of the work. The individual departments may grant credit for not more than 8 points of independent study for work approved in advance. In general, students are not permitted to take more than 12 points of independent study and/ or internship, and no more than 8 points may be taken in any one department. Internships and/or independent study courses taken in other divisions of the University or at other universities do not count toward the College degree. More specific information can be found under the individual departmental sections.Credit for Transfer Students Students are allowed to transfer up to 64 credits to the College and must present official college transcripts. Credits based on semester hours are accepted from other institutions at face value and are not altered when they are transferred into the College. Quarter hours will be converted to semester hours to determine the number of credits transferable to the College of Arts and Science. Non-liberal-arts credits are not always transferable, and transfer credit is never awarded for independent study or internship courses. Only credits for course work taken with a grade of C or better will be transferred. Courses taken for a pass/fail grade will not transfer to the College. Internal and external transfer students to the College must complete 64 credits in CAS (-UA) courses; courses taken in the other divisions and schools of NYU (including NYU Abu Dhabi and Shanghai) cannot count toward this 64 credit requirement. Credit for Non-NYU Study Abroad Credits based on semester hours (similar to schools in the United States) are accepted from institutions abroad at face value and are not altered when the credits transfer into the College. Often credits from institu- tions abroad must be adjusted or converted to correspond to the College's requirements for awarding credits. Approval to partici- pate in a non-NYU study abroad is only obtained by completing an academic pro- posal. The packet of information required to complete the proposal is available at the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140; www.cas.nyu.edu/page/petitions. When students receive approval to partici- pate in a non-NYU program abroad, the specific courses they will take are approved and the number of transfer credits they will receive are specified.479 ACADEMIC POLICIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYMissed and Makeup Examinations As noted under \"grades,\" below, a student who cannot take the final examination in a course at the regularly scheduled time may be given the grade of Incomplete. The student must discuss the reasons for missing the examination with the instructor and, in the case of illness, must submit a doctor's note to the instructor. The student must ask the instructor to give a grade of Incomplete. Incompletes are not awarded automatically. The time and place of any makeup examina-tions are set by the instructor or the department. Incomplete grades received because of a missed final examination must be removed within the semester following the one in which the Incomplete was received. In the case of students who are out of attendance, such grades must be removed within one year after the end of the course concerned. A grade of Incomplete that is not removed within this time limit becomes an F and is computed in the grade point average. (Regarding the removal of Incompletes received for missed work other than final examinations, see under \"grades\" and \"incompletes,\" below.) Grades Students may obtain their final grades for each semester on Albert via NYUHome at home.nyu.edu. The parents or guardian of a student who is a minor (under 18 years of age) may, on a written request to the Office of the University Registrar, obtain the student's grades at any time. The following symbols indicating grades are used: A, B, C, D, P , F , NR, and W. The fol-lowing symbol indicates incomplete work: I. Only grades of A, B, C, D, or F earned in any New York University course while matriculated in the College, or earned in any of the College's courses (courses suffixed by \"-UA\") while matriculated in another division of the University, are computed in the average. The following grades may be awarded: A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, F . In general, A indicates excellent work, B indicates good work, C indicates satisfac-tory work, and D indicates passable work and is the lowest passing grade. F indicates failure. The weights assigned in computing the grade point average are as follows: A = 4.0 A- = 3.7 B+ = 3.3 B = 3.0 B- = 2.7 C+ = 2.3 C = 2.0 C- = 1.7 D+ = 1.3 D = 1.0 F = 0.0 Computing the G rade Point Average The grade point average can be obtained by determining the total of all grade points earned (quality points) and dividing that figure by the total number of credit hours completed (quality hours). For example: A student who has completed 8 points of A (4.0), 4 points of B (3.0), and 4 points of C (2.0) has a grade point average of 3.25. This is obtained by adding 8 (points of A) x 4.0 (point value of A), 4 (points of B) x 3.0 (point value of B), and 4 (points of C) x 2.0 (point value of C), which totals 52 (the total of all grade points earned), and then by dividing 52 by 16 (the total number of credit hours completed). This gives the grade point average of 3.25. Policies on Assigned Grades Once a final grade has been submitted by the instructor and recorded on the tran-script, the final grade cannot be changed by turning in additional course work. Courses cannot be audited as a means of satisfying requirements for an incomplete grade or as a means of changing a previous grade. To appeal an assigned grade, the student should first consult with the instructor who assigned the grade to discuss the grading requirements for the course and how the grade was determined. If the student is not satisfied with the outcome of the discussion and wishes to appeal the grade further, a formal written appeal should be submitted to the chair and/or director of undergradu-ate studies in the particular department. An independent review of the grade will be undertaken by the department. All of the student's work will be reviewed to clarify how the grade was determined and to ensure the grade is consistent with the academic guidelines and policies of the department. The decision of the depart-ment in matters related to a course grade is final. In the case of a course that has been repeated, for students who matriculated in CAS before fall 2012: only the second grade, whether higher or lower, is computed into the grade point average. The initial grade, however, remains on the transcript. In the case of a course that has been repeated, for students who matriculate in or are re-admitted to CAS in fall 2012 and thereafter: both grades will be recorded on the transcript and both grades will be computed in the grade point average. The grades for courses taken abroad in one of New York University's programs or at one of the exchange sites are recorded on the transcript and are also included in the grade point average. The grades for graduate and professional courses taken at other divisions in the University are included in the grade point average, provided that permission to enroll is obtained prior to registration for the courses. Not included in the undergraduate grade point average are grades for the first year of professional courses taken by those students in the three-year accelerated dental program and grades for work done at institutions other than New York University (except for exchange sites abroad). Grade of P The grade of P (Pass) indicates a passing grade (A, B, C, or D) in a course taken under the pass/fail option. It is also used to indicate nongraded courses. The grade of P is not computed in the average. The grade of F under the pass/fail option is computed in the average. For more information and procedures to obtain the pass/fail option, see the section \"pass/fail option,\" below. Grade of W The grade of W indicates an official with-drawal of the student from a course in good academic standing. Please see \"change of program\" and \"withdrawing from courses,\" above, for information on the regulations and procedures for withdrawing officially from courses. EXAMINATIONS AND GRADES480 ACADEMIC POLICIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYPLACEMENT EXAMINATIONS, DEGREE PROGRESS, AND TRANSCRIPTS Placement Examinations in Foreign Languages Most entering students take a placement test prior to their first registration in the College. Students who took a foreign-lan-guage SAT Subject test while in high school are encouraged to present the score instead of or in addition to taking the College's test. (Please consult the table on SAT subject exams and the College Core Curriculum in the admission section of this Bulletin.) Placement exams for the following languages are accessible online: Cantonese, French, German, Greek (modern), Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latin, Mandarin (traditional and simplified), Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Tagalog (Filipino). To take an exam, go to www.cas.nyu.edu/page/placementexams and follow the appropriate links.Online exams in these languages are for placement only, not exemption. Eligibility to take an in-person, paper exam for exemption from the CAS foreign language requirement is determined by a student's score on the online placement exam. Some languages do not have online placement exams and are only tested on paper: Gaelic (Irish), arranged through Ireland House; and Arabic, T urkish, Persian, Hindi, and Urdu, all arranged through the Department of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies. These written exams result either in an exemption from the foreign language requirement (see \"foreign language\" under College Core Curriculum in this Bulletin) or in placement into the appropriate-level course. Whether online or written, these are read- ing examinations; students should choose to be tested in the language in which they have good reading skills.Placement into a lower-level course means that the student must continue his or her studies of that language (or begin a new language) until completion of the intermediate two level of that language. In some cases, adjustments in placement may be made during the first weeks of class. Students who place at a level below that which they have completed at another college will lose transfer credit if they repeat foreign language course work at the College of Arts and Science. A foreign language examination is required of all entering students with the follow-ing exceptions: students who will begin a language they have not previously studied; students whose entire secondary schooling was in a language other than English and other than those languages taught in the College; and foreign students who complete the sequence of required Expository Grade of I The grade of I (Incomplete) is a temporary grade that indicates that the student has, for good reason, not completed all of the course work but that there is the possibil-ity that the student will eventually pass the course when all of the requirements have been completed. A student must ask the instructor for a grade of I, present documented evidence of illness or the equivalent, and clarify the remaining course requirements with the instructor. The incomplete grade is not awarded auto- matically. It is not used when there is no possibility that the student will eventually pass the course. Courses cannot be audited as a means of satisfying requirements for an incomplete grade. If the course work is not completed after the statutory time for making up incompletes has elapsed, the temporary grade of I shall become an F and will be computed in the student's grade point average. Grade of NR Grades not entered by the course instructor or authorized school administrator within 60 days from the grade due deadline will lapse to NR (No Record). Courses with NR grades will not count toward earned credit and will not factor into the GPA, but will count as credits attempted and will impact academic progress evaluations used for financial aid eligibility. Students may not graduate with NR grades on their transcript without a formal documented exception approved by the CAS Office of the Dean. Incompletes All work missed in the fall term must be made up by the end of the following spring term. All work missed in the spring term or in a summer session must be made up by the end of the following fall term. Students who are out of attendance in the semester following the one in which the course was taken have one year to complete the work. Students should contact the College Advising Center (Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130) for an extension of incomplete form, which must be approved by the instructor. Extensions of these time limits are rarely granted. Pass/Fail Option Students may elect one pass/fail option each term, including the summer sessions, for a total of not more than 32 points during their college career. The pass/fail option is not acceptable for courses completed at other institutions.The choice must be made before the completion of the ninth week of the term (second week of a six-week summer session); after that time, the decision cannot be initiated or changed. No grade other than P or F will be recorded for those students choosing this option. P includes the grades of A, B, C, and D and is not counted in the average. F is counted in the average. The pass/fail option is not acceptable in the major, the minor, or any of the courses taken in fulfillment of the College Core Curriculum requirements. Students considering the pass/fail option in their area of study or in required preprofessional courses should consult with their advisers about the effect of such grades on admis-sion to graduate and professional schools. Students who change their majors may not be able to use courses taken under the pass/fail option to satisfy the requirements of their new majors. To declare the pass/fail option before the end of the ninth week of the semester or the end of the second week of a six-week summer session, students must consult with an adviser in the College Advising Center, Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130. Advisers submit the request on students' behalf.481 ACADEMIC POLICIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYWriting courses for international students. Students in these categories should contact the College Advising Center to verify that they have satisfied the foreign language requirement. Information on foreign language placement and exemption testing can be obtained from the Office of Academic Affairs, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 908; 212-998-8110; www.cas.nyu.edu/page/placementexams. Placement Examination in Calculus Students who intend to register for Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) or Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) and do not meet any of the prerequisites listed in the mathematics section of this Bulletin must take a placement exam to determine their readiness to enter calculus. Contact the Department of Mathematics, 251 Mercer Street; 212-998-3005; www.math.nyu.edu. Placement into Writing Courses for English as a Second Language Students Students with non-U.S. visas who have not attended English-language high schools for four years will be placed into the appropriate writing course on the basis of a combination of standardized test scores. Some students will be placed into the International Writing Workshop I/II sequence (EXPOS-UA 4/9), successful completion of which satisfies the College Core Curriculum expository writing requirement (as well as the Core foreign language requirement). Other students will test into courses offered by the American Language Institute (ALI). All placement results must be honored. The ALI Level 7 and 8 courses are cross- listed with the Expository Writing Program and offer CAS credit. These courses are Reading and Writing Workshop I (EXPOS-UA 20/ALI Level 7) and Reading and Writing Workshop II (EXPOS-UA 21/ALI Level 8). These courses are prerequisites to the International Writing Workshop I/II course sequences for students placed into them. Students with an ALI placement below EXPOS-UA 20 (Reading and Writing Workshop I/ALI Level 7) will be required to take a more intensive program with the ALI that will affect full-time status with CAS. Degree Progress All students have access to their degree progress report, as generated by the Office of the University Registrar, on Albert via NYUHome at home.nyu.edu. It is called \"academic requirements\" and is accessed through the Student Center. The degree progress report is a Student Information System (SIS) accounting of completed and remaining degree requirements. Transcripts of Record Unofficial transcripts are available on Albert, NYU's Web-based registration and information system. Albert can be accessed via NYUHome. Students requiring a stamped and sealed copy of their New York University records should request an official copy of their University transcript from the Office of the University Registrar. Requests for official transcripts require the signature of the student/alumnus requesting the transcript, unless the student/alumnus has a valid NetID. Current students and graduates with a valid NYU NetID (able to access NYUHome/Albert) who attended NYU in or after 1990 can request an official transcript from the Albert Student Center. The Official T ranscript form can be found under the My Academics section of the Student Center. Alumni who attended NYU prior to 1990 and have a valid NetID can go to the secure online transcript request form and log in with their NetID and password. A signed consent form is not required. Before completing their transcript request, current students should check to ensure that all their grades have been posted. Recent graduates should check to ensure that their degree has been recorded. Any transcript request that requires any special handling must go through the secure online transcript request form (see above) and cannot be requested on Albert. Special handling includes: (1) sending transcripts by express mail; (2) transcripts sent to the student or alumnus in separate sealed envelopes addressed to admissions offices of other universities; (3) including addi-tional documents to be sent along with the NYU transcript.Former students who no longer have a valid NetID (unable to access NYUHome/Albert) or who attended New York University prior to 1990 must complete the secure online transcript request form (see above) and mail/fax the signature page to the Office of the University Registrar. Alternatively, they may write a letter to request transcripts and send this to the registrar. A signed consent form is required. The request letter must include all of the following information: U niversity ID number C urrent name and any other name under which the graduate attended NYU C urrent address D ate of birth School of the U niversity attended D ates of attendance D ate of graduation The full name and addr ess of the person or institution to which the transcript is to be sent The request may be faxed to 212-995-4154 or mailed to New York University, Office of the University Registrar, Academic Records, P .O. Box 910, New York, NY 10276-0910. There is never any charge for academic tran- scripts. T ranscripts cannot be produced for anyone whose record has been put on hold for an outstanding University obligation. Requesting Enrollment Verification Students can view/print their own enrollment certification directly from Albert using the integrated National Student Clearinghouse student portal. This feature can be accessed from the \"request enrollment verification\" link in the \"my academics\" section of the Student Center. Eligible students are also able to view/print a good student discount certificate, which can be mailed to an auto insurer or any other company that requests proof of status as a good student (based on the cumulative GPA). Verification of enrollment or graduation may also be requested by submitting a signed letter with the following information: U niversity ID number C urrent name and any name under which the student or graduate attended NYU482 ACADEMIC POLICIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITY C urrent address D ate of birth School of the U niversity attended D ates attended D ate of graduation The full name and addr ess of the person or institution to which the verification is to be sent The request may be mailed to New York University, Office of the University Registrar, Enrollment Verification and Graduation, P .O. Box 910, New York, NY 10276-0910. Alternatively, signed requests may be faxed to 212-995-4154. The registrar does not accept requests for certification by e-mail. Arrears Policy The University reserves the right to deny registration and withhold all information regarding the record of any student who is in arrears in the payment of tuition, fees, loans, or other charges (including charges for housing, dining, or other activities or services) for as long as any arrears remain. Diploma Arrears Policy Diplomas of students in arrears will be held until their financial obligations to the University are fulfilled and they have been cleared by the bursar. Graduates with a diploma hold may contact the Office of the Bursar at 212-998-2806 to clear arrears or to discuss their financial status at the University. Diploma Application Students may officially graduate in September, January, or May. The all-University Commencement ceremony is held in May. The College holds a baccalaureate ceremony in May. Students must apply for graduation on Albert, and they must be enrolled for either course work, leave of absence, or maintenance of matriculation during their final semester. To graduate in a specific semester, students must apply for graduation within the application deadline period indicated on the calendar available at the Office of the University Registrar's web page. It is recom-mended that students apply for graduation no later than the beginning of the semester in which they plan to complete all program requirements. Students who do not success-fully complete all academic requirements by the end of that semester must reapply for graduation for the following cycle. ACADEMIC STANDARDS AND DISCIPLINE Academic Standards The Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards reviews student records throughout the academic year. All of its actions are based on the grades to date at the end of the term. Academic Alert Students with cumulative grade point averages of 2.0 to 2.25 will receive an academic alert letter reflecting the committee's specific recommendations for achieving an appropriate standard for academic performance. Academic Probation Any student whose record is deemed unsatisfactory will be placed on academic probation and will be so informed by letter. A record will be deemed unsatisfactory if, in any semester, the cumulative or semester grade point average falls below 2.0 or if it fails to show steady and substantial progress toward the degree. Steady and substantial progress toward the degree entails the completion, with satisfactory grades, of more than half of the courses (and points) for which a student registers in any semester. In addition, it entails satisfactory progress in the student's major.Failure to satisfy the conditions of probation will result in further academic sanctions and possibly dismissal from the College. The conditions usually require that the student (a) achieve a grade point aver-age of at least 2.0 during the term he or she is on probation, (b) not receive any grade below a C or any grade of I, and (c) not withdraw from any course without securing the permission of the Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards prior to the withdrawal. Students on academic probation are also required to have a special probation interview with an adviser in the College Advising Center to receive registra-tion clearance for the next semester. More specific requirements may be imposed. The Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards may summon students with unsatisfactory records to discuss their problems and to determine whether and under what conditions they may continue in the College. In special circumstances, the committee may recommend to the dean that students may be granted or placed on leave for a period not to exceed two semesters. Students on academic probation may not engage in any extracurricular activities (except for departmental clubs) and may not hold office in these clubs without the approval of the Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards. Students on academic probation should be aware that they are usually ineligible for financial aid. Academic Dismissal Students who are dismissed from the College for poor academic performance will be informed via e-mail two to three weeks after their most recent grades are posted for the enrolled semester. Students who have paid tuition for the next term at the time of dismissal will receive a full refund of tuition and fees. Academic Integrity Community of the Mind The College is a \"community of the mind.\" Its students, faculty, and staff all share the goal of pursuing truth through free and open inquiry, and we support one another's endeavors in this regard. As in any commu-nity, membership comes with certain rights and responsibilities. Foremost among these is academic integrity. Cheating on an exam, falsifying data, or having someone else write a paper undermines others who are \"doing it on their own\"; it makes it difficult or impossible to assess fairly a student's 483 ACADEMIC POLICIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYinterest, aptitude, and achievement; and it diminishes the cheater, depriving him or her of an education. Most important, academic dishonesty is a violation of the very principles upon which the academy is founded. For this reason, violations of these principles are treated with the utmost seriousness. College of Arts and Science Honor Code As a student in the College of Arts and Science at New York University, you belong to a community of scholars who value free and open inquiry. Honest assessment of ideas and their sources is the foundation of what we do. Our University is a community of mutual trust and respect in which personal preju-dice has no part in the critical evaluation of ideas. It is a place where differences of opinion can be subjected to deliberate and reasonable examination without animus. As scholars, it is therefore as a matter of honor and good repute that we each commit ourselves to assuring the integrity of our academic community and of the educational pursuits we undertake together. As a student in the College, I pledge that: I shall per form honestly all my academic obligations. I will not represent the words, works, or ideas of others as my own; will not cheat; and will not seek to mislead faculty or other academic officers in their evaluation of my course work or in any other academic affairs. I shall behav e with decorum and civility, and with respectful regard for all members of the University\u2014fac-ulty, staff, and fellow students\u2014our guests, and members of our wider communities. I shall abide b y the College and by the University rules of conduct and policies on academic integrity and by the special requirements of any individual course of study or other academic activity. I shall endeav or earnestly to uphold the values, standards, and ideals on which our University community depends and call on others to do so.Discipline: College of Arts and Science Rules and Procedures on Student Misconduct Approved by the Faculty of Arts and Science, April 30, 2015 New York University is a community of scholars who value free and open inquiry. Our work depends on honest assessment of ideas and their sources; and we expect all members of our community to maintain the highest integrity in their academic work. As scholars committed to the critical evaluation of ideas, free of personal prejudice, we also have an obligation to one another to create an educational atmosphere of mutual trust and respect in which differences of opinion can be subjected to deliberate and reasonable examination without animus. Because of the central importance of these values to our intellectual life together, students who fail to maintain them will be subject to disciplinary sanction, which may include dismissal from the University. Disciplinary offenses include but are not limited to: cheating, plagiarism, falsification of data or sources, forgery of academic documents in attempt to defraud; destr uction, theft, or unauthor- ized use of laboratory data, library or research materials, computer resources, or university property; disr uption of academic events or interference with access to classrooms, laboratories, or academic offices; actual or thr eatened violence against, or assault or harassment of a student, instructor, staff member, or administrator. The following penalties may be imposed by the faculty for disciplinary infractions: W arning D isciplinary Probation S uspension D ismissal Complete statements of the rules and procedures for adjudicating disciplinary complaints concerning students in the College are available from the Office of the Associate Dean for Students and on the website of the College of Arts and Science.Rules and Procedures 1. General Principles a) S tudent conduct that violates the College of Arts and Science Honor Code, University-wide student conduct policies, and/or student conduct policies established by portal cam-puses, global academic sites, or administrative offices of the University may be subject to disciplinary action in accor-dance with established CAS and University procedures. b) S tudent misconduct includes academic misconduct, such as plagiarism, cheating, and possession of or use of any prohibited notes, reference resources, or data processing or other devices in any class or examination; and behavioral misconduct, such as forgery of academic documents in attempt to defraud; destruction, misuse, or theft of University resources; disruption of classes or other academic events, or University administrative operations; acts of violence; and assault and harassment. c) I n cases of academic miscon- duct, evaluation of the student's academic performance is distinguished from disciplinary adjudication of the offense. The question of what grade the student's work should earn is distinct from that about whether a disciplinary sanction should also be imposed. When a student is found to have engaged in academic misconduct, the instructor may reduce the stu-dent's grade for the assignment or for the course as a whole; however, such a determination is an academic judgment made by the instructor in accord with the expectations of the department or program offering the course and is not a form of disciplin-ary sanction. The question of whether a disciplinary sanction should also be imposed is 484 ACADEMIC POLICIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYseparate from this academic determination, as specified in the procedures described herein. 2. A cademic Misconduct\u2014Academic Review a) When it is believ ed that viola- tions of academic integrity may have occurred it is within the discretion of the faculty member to address the matter informally with the student should the infraction be judged insubstantial or should the evidence be inconclusive. In such cases the faculty mem-ber may determine that no grade reduction is warranted. b) S hould the faculty member judge the violation substantial and well supported by the evidence, he or she may, with the assent of the Director of Undergraduate Studies (or, if the Director of Undergraduate Studies is the instructor, with the chair or another academic director in the department or program, or if the depart-ment or program should be too small, in an ad hoc consultation with a chair or academic director of another department or program from the same academic division) reduce the student's grade or assign the student a failing grade for the assignment in question or for the course as a whole. This grade r eduction only reflects the student's failure creditably to complete the academic requirements in question and is not a disciplinary sanction. The grade reduction should be proportional to the size and weight of the incident of academic misconduct among all requirements for the course and appropriate to the level at which the course is offered. c) I n order to better educate the student about the CAS stan-dards for academic integrity, the faculty member and/or the Director of Undergraduate Studies should meet with the student to discuss the nature of the offense and the action taken. This responsibility of the faculty should not be delegated to recitation or laboratory instructors or other course assistants. d) F or incidents of academic misconduct, the student's appeal of the grade reduction is limited to departmental review conducted by the Director of Undergraduate Studies and/or the Department Chair, as speci-fied in the CAS policy for grade appeals. The review will be limited to the question of whether the reduction in grade was made fairly and in keeping with the expecta-tions of the department or program. e) The decision of the depar t- ment or program on the student's appeal is final. 3. A cademic Misconduct\u2014Reporting and Disciplinary Referral a) I n all instances in which there has been a finding that a CAS student committed a sub-stantial violation of academic integrity standards of CAS or of any of its departments or programs, the Director of Undergraduate Studies will inform the student within seven (7) calendar days in writing and/or via email of any action taken and send copies of this letter to the CAS Associate Dean for Students, the faculty member, and the Department Chair or Program Director. The letter will include the nature of the viola-tion, any resulting reduction in grade, and notice of the stu-dent's right to appeal. A copy of the correspondence and the evidence of the violation shall be kept in a confidential file maintained by the Director of Undergraduate Studies.b) The D irector of Undergraduate Studies will also within seven (7) calendar days inform the CAS Associate Dean for Students in writing and/or via email of the student's violation, forward to the dean the evidence of the violation, and send a copy of the correspondence to the faculty member and to the Department Chair or Program Director. c) I f this is the student's first incident of academic miscon-duct, the Associate Dean for Students will send the student a warning letter indicating that a suspension or a more severe penalty may result from a second academic integrity offense of any kind. d) I f this is the student's second or further incident of academic misconduct, the Associate Dean for Students will meet with the student, discuss the evidence of academic misconduct, and provide the student an opportunity to respond. The student will be informed of his or her right to accept or reject a resolution by the Associate Dean. After considering all relevant information, the Associate Dean may offer the student terms upon which CAS is willing to resolve the matter, which may include imposition of a disciplinary sanction. Where the student and the Associate Dean agree to terms in writing, a binding consensual resolution will exist between the student and CAS. Where the Associate Dean is unable to resolve the complaint by consensual resolution, the matter will be referred to the Committee on Student Discipline. e) I n all instances in which there has been a finding that a non-CAS student commit-ted a substantial violation of academic integrity standards of CAS or of any of its departments or programs, the Director of Undergraduate Studies will proceed in accord with the procedures under (a) and (b), except that notice will be made instead to the Dean of Students of the student's school. 4. B ehavioral Misconduct a) Complaints of student behavioral misconduct should be made in writing to the CAS Associate D ean for Students. When such a complaint is received, the Associate Dean will notify the student of the complaint and investigate the matter. In cases of students who have transferred internally among divisions of the University, the dean will query the student's prior school(s) concerning their disciplinary records for the student, if any. b) The Associate D ean of Students will meet with the student against whom the complaint has been filed, describe the complaint, and offer the student an opportu-nity to respond. The student will be informed of his or her right to accept or reject a resolution by the Associate Dean. After considering all relevant information, the Associate Dean may offer the student terms upon which CAS is willing to resolve the matter, which may include imposition of a disciplinary sanction. Where the student and the Associate Dean agree to terms in writing, a binding consensual resolution will exist between the student and CAS. Where the Associate Dean is unable to resolve the complaint by consensual resolution, the matter will be referred to the Committee on Student Discipline. c) O rdinarily, if the misconduct is a student's first offense at the University and does not warrant further disciplinary sanction, the student will be offered the opportunity to continue in CAS under written warning that a one-semester suspension or a more severe penalty may result from a second disciplinary offense of any kind. Discipline: Definitions of Sanctions Approved by the Faculty of Arts and Science, April 21, 2014Warning: Written reprimand, including notice that a one-semester suspension or a more severe penalty may result from a second disciplinary offense within the period of the censure specified in the letter of reprimand. Disciplinary Probation: Suspension of privileges or exclusion from participation in extracurricular University activities as set forth in the notice of disciplinary probation for a specified period of time. Suspension: Exclusion from classes as well as suspension of privileges and exclusion from other activities as set forth in the notice of suspension for a definite period of time. A student who has been suspended and against whom charges are dismissed or not sustained will be allowed full opportu-nity to make up whatever work was missed due to the suspension. Dismissal: Termination of student status for an indefinite period. The conditions for readmission, if any are permitted, will be stated in the order of dismissal. Student Grievance Students in the College of Arts and Science are referred to the \"student grievance procedure\" applicable to all the schools of New York University as found in the NYU Student's Guide. The College adheres to all articles of the \"student grievance procedure\" as set forth in the \"University Policies and Procedures\" section of the NYU Student's Guide. 485 ACADEMIC POLICIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYUNIVERSITY POLICIES AND CAMPUS SAFETY University Policy on Patents Students offered research opportunities are reminded that inventions arising from participation in such research are governed by the University's \"statement of policy on patents,\" a copy of which may be found in the Faculty Handbook or obtained from the dean's office. Immunization Requirements New York State Public Health Law (NYS PHL) 2165 requires all students registering for 6 or more credits in a degree-granting program to provide immunization docu-mentation for measles (rubeola), mumps, and rubella (German measles) prior to registration. Students born before January 1, 1957, are exempt. New students should PETITIONS The Faculty Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards will consider petitions from students to waive requirements or modify policies and regulations of the College. Students should be aware that only very exceptional cases, supported by valid and documented reasons, will be considered. After deliberation, the committee's decisions on such matters are final. Petition forms may be obtained in the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140; www.cas.nyu.edu/page/petitions.486 ACADEMIC POLICIES COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYcomplete the MMR section of the student health history form. Continuing students should complete and submit a student immunization record form. New York State Public Health Law (NYS PHL) 2167 requires that all students registered for 6 or more credits submit a meningitis response form as formal confir-mation of their decision as to whether or not to be immunized with the meningococcal (meningitis) vaccine. New students should complete the meningitis response section of the student health history form. Continuing students should complete and submit a meningitis response form. Failure to comply with state immuniza- tion laws will prevent NYU students from registering for classes. In addition to these requirements, the NYU Student Health Center recommends that students also consider hepatitis B and varicella immunizations. Students should discuss immunization options with their primary care provider. Campus Safety The Department of Public Safety is located at 7 Washington Place; telephone: 212-998-2222; 212-998-2220 (TTY). New York University's annual campus security report includes statistics for the previous three years concerning reported crimes that occurred on campus, in certain off-campus buildings or property owned or controlled by NYU, and on public property within or immediately adjacent to the campus. The report also includes institu-tional policies concerning campus security, such as policies concerning sexual assault, drugs, and alcohol. Students may obtain a copy of the current report by contact-ing Thomas Grace, Director of Judicial Affairs and Compliance, Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs (601 Kimmel Center: 212-998-4403), or Jay Zwicker, Crime Prevention Manager, Department of Public Safety (7 Washington Place: 212-998-1451), or by visiting the following website: www.nyu.edu/public.safety/policies. New York University Weapons Policy New York University strictly prohibits the possession of all weapons, as described in local, state, and federal statutes, including, but not limited to, firearms, knives, and explosives, in and/or around any and all University facilities\u2014academic, residential, or others. This prohibition extends to all buildings\u2014whether owned, leased, or controlled by the University, regardless of whether the bearer or possessor is licensed to carry that weapon. The possession of any weapon has the potential of creating a dan-gerous situation for the bearer and others. The only exceptions to this policy are duly authorized law enforcement personnel who are performing official federal, state, or local business and instances in which the bearer of the weapon is licensed by an appropri-ate licensing authority and has received written permission from the executive vice president of the University.New York University Simulated Firearm Policy New York University strictly prohibits simulated firearms in and/or around any and all University facilities\u2014academic, residential, or other. This prohibition extends to all buildings\u2014whether owned, leased, or controlled by the University. The possession of a simulated firearm has the potential of creating a dangerous situation for the bearer and others. The only exceptions to this policy are instances in which (1) the bearer is in possession of written permission from a dean, associate dean, assistant dean, or department head and (2) such possession or use of simulated firearms is directly connected to a University- or school-related event (e.g., play, film production). Whenever an approved simulated firearm is transported from one location to another, it must be placed in a secure container in such a manner that it cannot be observed. Storage of approved simulated firearms shall be the responsibility of the Department of Public Safety in a location designated by the vice president for public safety. Under no circumstances, other than at a Public Safety storage area, may approved simulated firearms be stored in any University-owned, -leased, or -controlled facilities.487 HONORS AND AWARDS COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYHonors and Awards Dean's Honors List A Dean's Honors List is compiled at the end of each academic year, in June. This is an honors roll of matriculated students who have achieved an average of 3.65 or higher for that academic year (September to May) in at least 28 graded points. To be listed, a student must not have any grades of Incomplete or N at the time the list is compiled. Note that grade point averages are carried to two decimal places (but are not rounded off). Honorary Societies in Arts and Science Any student seeking to join a departmental scholastic honorary society is required to maintain, as a minimum scholastic requirement for election to membership, a general average of 3.50, as well as an average in the major subject of 3.50. Students should consult with departmental advisers in regard to the specific requirements for the various departmental honor societies. Phi Beta Kappa Phi Beta Kappa celebrates and advocates excellence in the liberal arts and sciences, and the Phi Beta Kappa Society invites for induction the most outstanding arts and science students in America's leading colleges and universities. NYU's College of Arts and Science chapter, the Beta of New York, was established in 1858. In terms of seniority, it ranks as the 15th oldest chapter of the Society. Each April, the faculty members of the Beta chapter automatically review the academic performance of all students in the College for eligibility for election to Phi Beta Kappa. Eligibility for Graduation With Latin Honors To be graduated with honors, a student must have at least 64 points earned in courses from CAS, GSAS, and selected Tisch departments. All graded courses taken while enrolled either in the College or in another school of NYU will be used in computing the grade point average on which Latin honors are based, as long as the 64 point residency requirement is met. Pass (P) grades are not counted; grades received in courses taken at other institutions are also not counted. The student must also have a clean record of conduct. Effective with the September 2008 graduating class, the GPA cutoffs for each category are determined by the combined GPA distribution from the preceding academic year, all graduation moments included. The cutoff for summa cum laude is the GPA included within the top 5 percent of the previous year's graduating class. The cutoff for magna cum laude is the GPA included within the next 10 percent of the previous year's class. The cutoff for cum laude is the GPA included within the next 15 percent of the previous year's class. For example, the necessary GPA level for summa cum laude for students graduating in September 2008 will be based on the GPA cutoff for the top 5 percent of the combined graduates from September 2007, January 2008, and May 2008.Departmental Honors Students who have completed at least 64 points of graded work in the College may be awarded degrees with departmental honors if they complete the designated honors sequence in a department and maintain the requisite grade point average. There are two levels: honors and high honors. Students seeking admission to and gradua- tion with departmental honors are expected to have a minimum grade point average of 3.65, both overall and in the major. Departments may exercise some flexibility: in rare cases where a candidate for admis-sion to a departmental honors program falls short of the expected minimum GPA, the director of undergraduate studies or the director of departmental honors may petition the director of college honors for an exception. In all cases, once admitted, students are expected to maintain the GPA at the stipulated level in order to graduate with departmental honors. Should there be an exceptional circumstance in which the stipulated GPA is not maintained, the director of college honors may be petitioned for an exception. If the case is compelling, the latter will inform the registrar's office of the waiver. Honors programs must, minimally, be a two-term (8-point) experience that includes a capstone research project. The capstone project, which typically culminates in a thesis, should reflect sustained original research over two semesters. The scope and length of a thesis will vary by discipline, but the thesis is typically 40 to 60 pages in length. HONORSMatriculated students with superior academic records are honored in various ways, such as by placement on the Dean's Honors List, election to honor societies, and admission to departmental honors programs. Additional information may be obtained from departmental advisers and from the College Advising Center, Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130.488 HONORS AND AWARDS COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYAll students completing departmental honors must make public presentations of their work, preferably at the CAS Undergraduate Research Conference (URC) held at the end of the academic year, or in a departmental forum (e.g., oral defenses or presentations) held in conjunction with the URC. Students with double majors in discrete, unrelated disciplines must complete honors programs in each major for which they seek honors. Students with double majors in interdisciplinary or related fields may, if the two departments concur, convene a joint honors committee to establish an interdis-ciplinary research program of course work that culminates in a single thesis. Similarly, in the case of joint majors, the relevant departments must work out an agreement on the requirements for honors and on the supervision and evaluation of students' theses or projects. Presidential Honors Scholars Membership in the Presidential Honors Scholars at the College of Arts and Science offers outstanding students the opportunity to receive special advising from College faculty and staff, to challenge themselves in honors courses and through independent research, to study away, to take advantage of New York City's cultural resources, and to develop leadership skills through community service. Scholars comprise a distinguished group of undergraduates; only the top 10 percent of the entering class are chosen, and students who apply for entry after they have matriculated must demonstrate not only superlative academic achievements but also a consistent record of leadership and service to the community. Freshmen appointed on the basis of their high school records participate in a Scholars Seminar. They meet regularly for lectures and discussions and participate in a wide variety of cocurricular activities. These include the Scholars Lecture Series, cultural events in the city, social events, and community service projects. Scholars also register for a Freshman Honors Seminar. During the January intersession, freshman scholars travel with faculty mentors to Villa La Pietra in Florence, Italy. Sophomore scholars also participate in a trip abroad, choosing a destination that most closely relates to their academic or personal interests. During their junior or senior year, scholars spend an entire semester (or year) studying at one of NYU's programs or exchanges away. In their junior and senior years, they also enroll in the honors track of their chosen major. In addition, Presidential Honors Scholars are committed to volunteering and serving in the community. Membership in the Scholars Program is renewable annually, depending on the quality of the scholar's academic records and his or her level of participation in the program. All scholars are expected to be full-time students and maintain a grade point average of at least 3.65. Students who are not designated as Presidential Honors Scholars for the freshman year are invited to apply for membership at the end of the spring semester. Further information is available from the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909 (212-998-8140) or from the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, 665 Broadway, 11th Floor (212-998-4540). Martin Luther King, Jr., Scholars Program Since its inception in 1987, the Martin Luther King, Jr., Scholars Program has awarded over 400 need-based and merit scholarships to incoming freshmen at NYU. These students present records of outstanding academic achievement, leadership, and commitment to the principles of community service, humanitarianism, and social progress. MLK Scholars help to plan and participate in academic and cultural events that draw on the vast resources of New York University and New York City. They explore cultural diversity through domestic and international travel and take the lead in helping others through community service. Women in Science Program The Women in Science (WINS) Program selects and supports a core group of talented, motivated women from each entering class who are interested in a career path focused on science and math research. These women, WINS Scholars, will have the opportunity to participate in a program of study, research, and mentoring specifically tailored to their chosen academic path. WINS Scholars are offered certain specialized courses and invitations to events with notable women in the science and math professions, as well as both a financial scholarship and a research stipend. Information is available from the College's Preprofessional Center (Silver Center, Room 901; 212-998-8160). Lewis Rudin City Scholars Rudin Scholars are outstanding entering freshmen selected from public and parochial high schools in all five boroughs of New York City. In addition to their scholarship, the scholars participate in academic and cultural activities in New York City. The program is named in honor of the late real estate developer Lewis Rudin, former president of the Association for a Better New York and an NYU alumnus and trustee.

Students participate in faculty meetings and departmental committees and sit as voting members of the University Senate. The vigor of intellectual life at college after hours is found in curriculum-related clubs that embrace all academic disciplines. For example, the Classics Club is noted for guest lecturers, Greek and Latin reading groups, discussion groups on classical civili-zation, and productions of ancient tragedy and comedy in the original language and in English. Bus trips are organized by various clubs (such as the Art History, History, and Classics Clubs) to museums and private collections in other cities. Clubs associated with the sciences visit research laboratories, hospitals, and industrial plants. Students may become members of the Choral Arts Society, the NYU Concert Band, the NYU Jazz Ensembles, the NYU Orchestra, the NYU Woodwind Ensembles, the NYU Chamber Music Society, and Collegium Musicum. The CAS Student Council sponsors other cocurricular activities. Students serve the community in various ways, volunteering time to settlement houses or tutoring high school students. In addition, a variety of activities is open to all students at Washington Square: student councils representing all undergraduate and graduate students; science and professional societies; political, religious, and cultural groups; fraternities; sororities; student publications, including the Washington Square News; and the radio station, WNYU-FM.

In addition to the satisfaction they receive in helping their neighbors, they also gain valuable work experience. Through NYU's Office of Civic Engagement, students volunteer with dozens of nonprofit organizations through-out New York City. Community service provides an opportu- nity to address major social, health, hunger, and environmental issues. Through service, students enhance their leadership skills, find fulfillment in giving back something to the community, and build new relationships while learning more about themselves. There are many ways to become involved in activities on and off campus. Students in the College collect canned goods, conduct toy drives, and distribute bag lunches to the homeless. They work in dropout-prevention programs that encourage high school students to stay in school. They renovate houses and make them livable again. Students in the Presidential Scholars Program participate in ongoing service projects such as the Dean's Service Honor Corps, the University Settlement House, the Door, and the Beacon House. Whether their involvement is with the sick, the poor, or those who simply need a helping hand, student volunteers give of themselves freely. And they all agree that they get back much more than they give.496 STUDENT ACTIVITIES, UNIVERSITY SERVICES, AND COMMUNITY SERVICE COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYTo strengthen and further support community-service initiatives, the University sponsors a central Office of Civic Engagement. In addition, the President's Office sponsors a special C-Team for Service, involving over 250 students work-ing as tutors and mentors for young people at sites in Greenwich Village and the Lower East Side. Regular meetings and social events are sponsored by the Office of the President. Members are invited to submit proposals for special projects where they can call on their own skills and talents. For more information, contact 212-998-2329. Students selected for the Scholars Program in the College of Arts and Science have the opportunity to apply for the Dean's Service Honor Corps. The Honor Corps makes a special commitment to community service and assumes a leadership role in promot-ing service in the College. This group of qualified scholars works with the dean on a weekly community-service project. Many student clubs and organizations, such as Asian Initiative and Fraternity and Sorority Life, sponsor special service proj-ects and philanthropic events throughout the year. To find out more about becom-ing involved, contact the Office of Civic Engagement (212-998-2329) or Fraternity and Sorority Life (212-998-4710). In addition to clubs and organizations, the Center for Student Activities, Leadership, and Service sponsors Alternative Breaks, nontraditional winter or spring vacations in which students participate in a weeklong community service project. Another option available to students is OutReach, a volunteer corps that introduces freshmen to service in New York City (212-998-4700). The NYU Office of Civic Engagement (212-998-2329) provides students with information about service opportunities. Hundreds of volunteer positions are on file in this office. Personnel are available to provide advice and support, Monday to Friday, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The office also sponsors special events and welcomes organizations to post volunteer positions.497 FACULTY COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW YORK UNIVERSITYFaculty of Arts and Science Gabriel Abend, Associate Professor of Sociology; Licenciado 2000, Universidad de la Rep\u00fablica (Uruguay); M.A. 2004, 2008, Northwestern Abercrombie, Associate Professor of Anthropology; B.G.S. 1973, Michigan; Ph.D. 1986, Chicago Gerard Aching, Professor of Spanish and Portuguese; B.A. 1982, California (Berkeley); Ph.D. 1991, Cornell Andr\u00e9 Adler, Clinical Associate Professor of Physics; B.A. 1985, M.S. 1988, Ph.D. 1995, M.A.T. 2004, New York Karen Adolph, Professor of Psychology; B.A. 1986, Sarah Lawrence; M.A. 1989, Ph.D. 1993, Emory Bindehswari Aggarwal, Language Lecturer on Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies; B.A. 1969, M.A. 1973, Kanpur University; B.Lib.Sc.

For more information, see the cross-school minors section of this Bulletin. This Bulletin contains descriptions of the College's departments, programs, and courses. The first part of every course number identifies the department or program offering or cross-listing the course (for example, ARTH for art history). This is always followed by a two-letter suffix. The suffix \"UA\" indicates undergraduate courses offered in the College; \"GA\" indicates a graduate course offered by the Graduate School of Arts and Science. The numeric identifier comes last (for example, a complete course rubric would be ARTH-UA 677). Graduate courses open to qualified undergraduates are designated by the departments. The departmental policy in this matter may be indicated either in this Bulletin or in the Graduate School of Arts and Science Bulletin; interested students are also advised to check directly with the relevant departments. *HEGIS: Higher Education General Information Survey Degree and Certificate Programs as registered by the New York State Education Department.
