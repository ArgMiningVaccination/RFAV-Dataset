There are statistics that prove there is a rise in abuse in opiates within communities. However, at what point does the nurse or provider get to decide what is an adequate pain threshold and how much they should endure? When does the ethical duty to relieve pain and suffering subside to personal biases? Patients deserve to be treated with dignity and respect as they entrust medical providers to relief their pain and suffering. Religion plays an integral role in the healthcare setting. As such, healthcare givers are required to respect patients' faith diversity while giving treatment and care. This paper thus seeks to discuss the differences between the Christian and Muslim religions as well as healthcare practices that are fundamental to both belief systems. The paper will also address the worldview questions outlined in Called to Care and thus provide a spiritual perspective on healing. Native American spirituality includes a strong reverence for animal life, the environment, and each other. Native American spirituality is not the same as the religion of most people. Organized religious meetings are not a part of native American spirituality. History shows that originally, native American spirituality was more of a way of daily life. Native American spirituality is not the same for every tribe. Native American spirituality includes rituals that represent hunting and growing of earth's produce, which was such a prevalent way of life for native Americans. History shows that native American spirituality included many ceremonies and rituals that were practiced before, and even after hunting expeditions. It was thought that native American spirituality in this way would insure continued success in hunting. Michael Burgan's non-fiction work, Voices from Colonial America: New York (1609-1776), provided with me a plethora of information regarding both the New York landscape, Native American Iroquois, and European settlers. This book contains eight different chapters that explore different concepts, such as Colonial Beginnings, Building a Dutch Colony, Years of Conflict, Colonial Life of the Dutch, and et cetera. These chapters build onto each other as the reader digs deeper into the text to find more about New York State's history. In the introduction, Timothy J. Shannon, Ph.D., states, \"It may be hard to believe now, but there was a The Native American Plain Indians are a nomadic group in the vast lands of plains America. You may think, who exactly are these people, chances are if you have watched any cowboys versus India people you would know exactly who they are. The Plains Indians are characterised by hunting buffalo, wearing feathery headdresses and riding horses. The plains region spreads across to the east of the Rocky Mountains and up 643.738kms across the vast land of central America. It covers ten states including North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Minnesota, Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Texas. As these people are nomadic there is not one specific religion they follow but more of a spiritual journey throughout there life. There is no Over this past summer, I was given the chance to read the book Against Medical Advice. I was not very interested in reading the book at first, but it proved me wrong and turned out to be a phenomenal read. This novel tells the story of a boy named Cory who suffered from tourettes syndrome and obsessive compulsive disorder, or OCD. He faced hell for years, but came out on top in the end. \"He has been to the bottom of the abyss, but he has been to the top of the mountain as well\" (Patterson and Friedman pg.269). He had a battle with his brain and was triumphant in the end, thanks to his fearless courage. In this read, I have strengthened my knowledge about people like Cory and also learned a lot from Cory 's journey. Three things I learned about myself from the book are how fortunate I am, that anything is possible, and that there is always room for improvement when it comes to tolerance for kids with special needs.

Example would be that more women get breast cancer than men or that most Like any other structured system, colonial medicine left quite a number of legacies in the world today. Medicine was a very important tool used during colonization and as Keller, in his article Geographies or power, legacies of mistrust: Colonial medicine in the global present, argues: \"biomedicine is a peculiarly western idiom despite its Universalist claims\" (Keller, 2006). This essay will explore two of the many legacies of colonial medicine in the world today namely undermining traditional healers and mistrust of the health systems in place. Dogmatic medicine, following the teachings of Hippocrates, consisted of hands-on study of the human body and the belief that there were hidden causes for illnesses. Dogmatists would speculate about the nature of diseases and their causes. It was a more philosophical form of medicine.
