We often times think of our herbs as the Pharmaceuticals of Chinese Medicine. Over the centuries, the practice of herbal medicine therapy has become sophisticated and accepted mainstream. Recently, large amounts of Western medical research had been published of TCM confirming the efficacy of TCM herbs. Chinese Herbal formulas work best when they are customized to the needs of each individual patient. This takes a trained and experienced herbalist to create a safe and effective herbal formula. At Sage Wellness Center, we are one of the few TCM offices in our area to have a full custom herbal pharmacy and licensed herbalists to create custom blends. These herbal formulas are made in a powder form, that is added to hot water, and consumed as a tea. For those seeking a more \"on the go\" way of taking Chinese Medical Herbs, we also offer pre-made herbal tinctures and pills. "}
