Melissa A. Crosby, M.D. Jayne Coleman, M.D. Rod J. Rohrich, M.D. Dallas, TexasLearning Objectives: After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Explain what governmental regulations control the labeling and distri-bution of herbal supplements. 2. List the more commonly used supplements andtheir reported benefits. 3. List the possible postoperative complications fromconsumption of the more commonly used herbal supplements. 4. Explain thepreoperative management of patients using herbal supplements. 5. Know ad-ditional resources to consult when unanswered questions arise.Background: The American public spends over $5 billion per year on herbal supplements, and approximately 20 percent of all Americans use prescriptionmedications concurrently with herbal supplements. As the number of peoplewho take alternative medicines rises, there is growing awareness among healthcare providers of the need to become educated and to educate their patientson the effects that such supplementation may have on their health. As plasticsurgeons, we have an added responsibility to become informed because ofpotential adverse interactions with other medications and anesthesia in theelective surgical patient.Methods: Literature regarding commonly encountered herbal supplements and vitamins was reviewed and summarized to include reported indications foruse and potential adverse effects and interactions specific to the perioperativepatient.Results: Abundant literature exists regarding herbal supplementation, but very little scientific evidence exists to advocate the use of the majority of supplementsavailable on the market. In addition, little is known about the positive andnegative interactions that these supplements are capable of producing, andthose interactions that are known are based on case reports.Conclusions: With the lack of quality scientific studies to support the efficacy of most herbal products available and the limited regulation of these productsby the government, health care providers are faced with a significant publichealth dilemma. This article provides a brief overview of information publishedon commonly encountered herbal supplements and vitamins taken by plasticsurgery patients. ( Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 119: 48e, 2007.) Widely used today, herbal medicine dates back thousands of years and started in India and China. Chinese medicine dates back approximately 4000 years and is ho-listic. It is based on the complementary forces yin and yang. When yin and yang are in balance, the person is healthy; illness occurs when there isimbalance between the two forces. The Chinese evaluate the interactions between the environ-ment (food, air, and drink) and the body(waste). The cause (and treatment) of the im-balance is determined by examining the tongue,iris, and pulse. Treatment is usually a mixture ofherbs, massage, and acupuncture. 1 In India, Ayurvedic medicine dates back to 3000 BC. Ayurvedic medicine combines physio-logic and holistic philosophies. It is based on theconcept that the human body, like the universe,is composed of five energy elements: earth, wa-ter, fire, air, and space.

All diseases are attributed to an im-balance among the three doshas . Diagnosis is made by an elaborate system of examinations ofphysical and mental findings. Treatment is thenpersonalized to these findings. 2,3 In the United States, herbal therapy began in the colonial days as folk medicine. Womenwould brew botanicals in the home. Europeans,Chinese, and Native Americans had a significantimpact on botanical remedies in the UnitedStates. In the nineteenth century, a group ofphysicians known as Eclectics adopted the holis-tic practice of herbal medicine. 4 THE PROBLEM Complementary and alternative medicine is rarely taught in U.S. medical schools and generallynot practiced in U.S. hospitals. Complementaryand alternative medicine includes herbal reme-dies, massage, self-help groups, folk remedies, chi-ropractic manipulation, relaxation techniques,megavitamins, and others. Astonishingly, the ma-jority of published information about herbalremedies can be located in the nursing and nu-tritional literature, with a minority in the med-ical literature. 5 There are more than 20,000 herbal medicines on the market. Herbal medicine use has increased380 percent from 1990 to 1997. 5A recent survey of 163 health food retail stores in the United Statesrevealed that the top 10 selling herbs likely soon to be listed among the top 10 herbal agents.7It is estimated that up to 32 to 97 percent of the U.S. population takes herbalremedies on a regular basis. 8,9One in seven pa- tients report taking at least one herbal supplementon a weekly basis, and one in five patients reporttaking one or more herbal medications along withtheir prescription medicine. 10Unbelievably, 70 percent of patients do not reveal the use of thesesupplements to their health care providers. 8 Among surgical patients, female patients morecommonly take herbs (23.6 percent versus 19.2percent), 11and there is no difference in botan- ical use between age groups.12Herbal use is more prevalent among white, educated, andwealthy individuals. 11,12The American Society of Anesthesiologists recommends that all surgical pa-tients stop herbal medications 2 weeks beforesurgery. 13 The Government's Responsibility The U.S. Congress recognized that alternative medicine was becoming more common and in1992 established the Office of Alternative Medi-cine through the National Institutes of Health. In1998, Congress expanded the government's inter-est by establishing the National Center of Com-plementary and Alternative Medicine to deter-mine the effectiveness of these therapies andsupport research in alternative medicine. Thereare several important differences regarding themanufacturing, health claims, potency, and purityof compounding herbal preparations when com-pared with other medications. Herbal remediesare not held to the same standards and regulationsthat the U.S. Food and Drug Administration main-tains for the pharmaceutical industry. Phased tri-als are not required, although the U.S. Food andDrug Administration can \"suggest\" provision ofscientific data to consumers. Individual herbs can-not be patented, although combinations of herbsmay be. Although the Dietary Supplement Healthand Education Act of 1994 places the burden ofproduct safety assurance on the manufacturer, theU.S. Food and Drug Administration assumes theresponsibility of proving that a product is unsafe.Therefore, if the U.S. Food and Drug Adminis-tration has reason to believe that an herb is unsafe,it can remove the drug from the market. Safety and health claim practices continued to be of concern, and the U.S. Food and Drug Ad-ministration put forth the \"Regulations on State-ments Made for Dietary Supplements Concerningthe Effects of the Product on the Structure orFunction of the Body\" to address these concerns.Concerning these regulations, Sabar et al. 6ex- plain how herbal manufacturers can sidestep U.S.Food and Drug Administration drug regulations: under the proposal, dietary supplements thatexpressly or implicitly claim to diagnose, treat,prevent, or cure a disease continue \" to be re- garded as drugs and have to meet the safety andeffectiveness standards for drugs under the Food,Drug, and Cosmetic Act .\" The definition of dis- ease is \"any deviation from, impairment of, orinterruption of the normal structure or func-Volume 119, Number 3 Herbal Supplements and Vitamins 49etion of any part, organ, or syste m...o ft h e body that is manifested by a characteristic set of oneor more signs or symptom s . . ..\" This definition allows the claim \" promotes vascular health \" while disallowing the statement \" decreases blood pres- sure.\" In response to the regulations, herbal manufacturers now add information that theirproduct \" is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease \" and thus is not subject to the FDA drug regulations. Why Should You Care? It has been shown that herbal use is more prevalent among white, educated, and wealthyindividuals. 11,12This description epitomizes the majority of aesthetic patients and, although thereare no comprehensive reports in the literature onherbal supplement use among plastic surgery pa-tients, it is a concern that plastic surgeons cannotignore. A general survey 14of adults on herbal medi- cine use obtained from three grocery store inter-cepts in northwest Ohio showed that 40 percent ofrespondents have used an herbal supplement dur-ing the past 12 months. The average number ofherbs used was 2.3 per person. The most commonreason given for taking herbal supplements is toimprove general health (16 percent). Herbal userscited \"herbals are natural\" as the most commonbenefit. Magazines (17 percent), health foodstores (16 percent), and friends (14 percent) werethe most common sources of herbal remedy in-formation. Only 50 percent of the population in-formed their physician of such use. Forty-one per-cent used an herbal remedy \"sometimes\" to\"always\" to self-treat before seeking medical carefrom a physician. Fifteen percent of adults treatedtheir children with herbs. Nearly all (86 percent)respondents believed the herb was helpful or veryhelpful. 14 Although there is no clear evidence that the preoperative use of herbal supplements will causeharmful effects, there are many potential compli-cations that the surgeon should know. 13A survey of surgical patients revealed that patients admittedto taking herbal medicines that had coagulationeffects (40.5 percent), blood pressure effects (32.7percent), cardiovascular effects (20 percent), sed-ative effects (16.7 percent), and effects on elec-trolytes or diuresis (8.9 percent), and 22.8 percentof patients reported using herbs that are known tocause adverse effects when combined with pre-scription medications. 15Another survey of surgery patients found that during the 2 weeks beforesurgery, 42.7 percent consumed complementary and alternative medicines: 19.8 percent that in-hibit coagulation, 14.4 percent that affect bloodpressure, 7.4 percent with cardiac effects, and 8percent with sedative effects. 16These concerns have prompted some anesthesiologists and sur-geons to postpone elective surgical procedures. 17 A recent survey assessing the knowledge of herbalsupplements by anesthesiologists found that only32 percent answered all questions correctly. 18 Clearly, all physicians need additional and con-tinued training on herbal medicine. Until thattime comes, at least one person in the operatingroom should have practical knowledge of herbalmedicine and its effects. HERBAL SUPPLEMENTS With over 20,000 herbal medicines available on the market today, discussing only 1 percent ofthem would be beyond the scope of this article.Eighteen common herbs used frequently by sur-gery patients are discussed. The 18 herbs are listedin alphabetical order. Arnica ( Arnica montana ) Overview been used topically for centuries for its antiinflammatory, analgesic, and antisepticproperties. It is the classic homeopathic remedyfor trauma of various kinds and was often used bymountain climbers to relieve sore muscles andminimize bruising from falls. It has also been usedfor myocarditis, cardiac insufficiency, arterioscle-rosis, angina pectoris, and many other unprovenapplications. There have been multiple clinicalstudies exploring the efficacy of arnica in reducingpostoperative complications. Two randomized,prospective, placebo-controlled trials evaluatingliposuction and demonstrated sta-tistically significant decreases in postoperativeswelling and bruising. 19,20 Use among Surgical PatientsNo data are available. Synonyms for and Arniflora Gel. 21 Adverse EffectsArnica is thought 22to be either worthless or dangerous, depending on which form of it wasingested (homeopathic or nonhomeopathic dos-ages, respectively). Arnica has Reconstructive Surgery March 2007 50efatal poisonings, cardiotoxicity, large increases in blood pressure, serious gastrointestinal distur-bances, and muscle paralysis. 23Arnica demon- strates the paradox of homeopathic medicine\u2014the lessconcentrated the drug, the stronger or more efficacious it is. Each time the drug is dilutedby a factor of 10 or 100 or more it becomes morepotent. That is why the common potencies areavailable over the counter in the United States andthe very highest potencies (most dilute formula-tions) are reserved for professionals. 24,25 Presurgical Precautions and Recommendations Arnica available in manufactured prepara- tions for the prevention of bruising and swellingcan probably be safely taken by patients under a physician's supervision. Unsupervised ingestion ofarnica should be stopped 2 weeks before surgeryand topical arnica (all types) should not be usedon broken skin or during the postoperative perioduntil the wound is completely healed. 24,25 Bromelain Overview Bromelain is an extract derived from the pine- apple plant. Proteinases found in bromelain aresaid to reduce inflammation and swelling aftersurgery. In addition, bromelain has been shown toact as a potential immunomodulator of tumorcells and as an inhibitor of platelet aggregation. 26 Bromelain acts as an immunomodulator by rais-ing the impaired immunocytotoxicity of mono-cytes against tumor cells and by inducing theproduction EffectsIn theory, bromelain may increase the risk of bleeding. Caution is advised in people who havebleeding disorders or who are taking anticoagu-lants. Bromelain may enhance the antithromboticactivity of such drugs as aspirin. Concomitant useof bromelain and amoxicillin or tetracycline hasbeen reported to increase the serum levels of theseantibiotics. 21Bromelain may increase heart rate at higher doses and should be used cautiously inpeople with heart disease. There are animal data to suggest that bromelain should not be used bypatients with liver disease. 28 Presurgical Precautions and Recommendations A randomized, placebo-controlled, double- arm crossover study out of our institution oral supplementation with a nutritionalsupplement containing bromelain, vitamin C,grape seed extract, calcium, and rutin resultedin a 17 percent decrease in wound-healing time,with less inflammation, as compared with theplacebo group, without documented bleedingcomplications. 29Bromelain should be stopped 2 weeks before surgery in a select group of patientstaking this supplement with anticoagulants or witha history of bleeding disorder or liver disease. Dong Quai ( Angelica sinensis ) Overview Known as Chinese angelica, dong quai has been used for thousands of years in traditionalChinese, Korean, and Japanese medicine. It re-mains one of the most popular plants in Chinesemedicine, and is used primarily for women's\"health conditions.\" Dong quai has been called\"female ginseng,\" based on its use for gynecologicdisorders such as painful dysmenorrhea, postpar-tum weakness, and general fatigue/low vitality. Itis also given for strengthening xue (loosely trans-lated as \"the blood\"), for cardiovascular condi-tions/high inflammation, infections, neuropathic (nerve) pain.Dong quai has multiple coumarin derivatives. 13,21 Use among Surgical PatientsDong quai is taken by 0.9 percent of patients in the perioperative period. 12 Synonyms for and Products Containing Dong Quai American angelica, Chinese Danggui, Danggui, Dang angelica, European Tang Kwei, TangQuai, Tanggwi (Korean), Toki(Japanese), wild angelica, wild Quai, wom-en's ginseng, Yuan Nan wild Dong Quai, andYungui. 27 Adverse EffectsDong quai has been known to prolong pro- thrombin time/international normalized ratioand activated partial thromboplastin time, andmay interact with the effects of Coumadin. 30In- creased sun sensitivity with a risk of severe pho-tosensitivity may occur because of chemicals inVolume 119, Number 3 Herbal Supplements psoralen, ber- gapten). dong quai, maybe carcinogenic (cancer-causing). Long-term useshould therefore be avoided, and suntan lotionsthat contain dong quai often limit the amount ofdong quai to less than 1 percent. Dong quai (par-ticularly with prolonged use) is associated withlaxative effects/diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, vom-iting, anorexia, burping, or bloating. Dong quaipreparations may contain high levels of sucroseand should be used cautiously by patients withdiabetes or glucose intolerance. 27 Presurgical Precautions and Recommendations Patients should stop taking the drug 2 weeks before a natural antibiotic for its immunostimulating properties.31In the United States and Europe, it is taken to prevent and treatupper respiratory tract infections. In the UnitedStates, sales of echinacea are believed to representapproximately 10 percent of the dietary supple-ment market. Echinacea is also purchased to treatgenital herpes and radiation-associated toxicity.Topical echinacea juice has been suggested forquicker healing for skin and oral wounds andoral/injectable echinacea for vaginal Candida al- bicans infections. 32-35 Use among Surgical Patients Echinacea is taken by 12.7 percent of surgical patients.11 Synonyms for and Products Containing Echinacea hat. 27 Adverse EffectsLong-term use (8 weeks) is associated with immunosuppression. 36There is a theoretical risk for poor wound healing in chronic users. Echina-cea may decrease the effects of cyclosporine andsteroids. Echinacea can the of echi- nacea to inhibit cytochrome CYP3A438(Table 1). Presurgical Precautions and Recommendations Because of the risk of significant drug-herb interactions, patients should stop taking the drug2 weeks before surgery. Ephedra ( Ephedra sinica , Ma Huang) Overview Ephedra, a potent stimulant, is the herbal pre- cursor to epinephrine and pseudoepinephrine.Components of the herb are known to inhibit thecomplement pathway in vitro, 39raising a concern for prolonged bleeding. In contrast, ephedra hasbeen suspected of creating a hypercoagulablestate. Other uses for ephedra include treatment ofrespiratory illnesses, weight loss, body building en-hancer, and as a stimulant. A recent case report 40 described a weightlifter using an ephedra-contain-ing supplement who had experienced an acutemyocardial infarction secondary to thrombosis insitu. All other possible causes of myocardial in-farction (including a hypercoagulable state) wereruled out. Use among Surgical Patients Ephedra-containing concoctions are con- sumed by 18 percent of patients preoperatively. 41 The herb is commonly used by the young, theoverweight, and female patients. 42 Synonyms for and Products Containing Ephedra Acceleration, AllerClear, AllerPlus, Andro Heat, Better Body Energy Virtue,Metabolife 356, Affect Cytochrome CYP3A4* Herb and Its EffectCommon Medications Metabolized by CYP3A4 Induces activity Coumadin St. Cyclosporine NifedipineLicorice Oral contraceptives TestosteroneTheophylline *CYP3A4 is the most abundant of all the P450s in human liver and is involved in the metabolism of many environmental toxicants anddrugs.Data derived from Miller, L. G. (Herbal medicinals: Selected clinicalconsiderations focusing on known or potential drug-herb interac-tions. Arch. Intern. Med. 158: 2200, 1998), and Hu et al. (Herb-drug interactions: A literature review. Drugs 65: 1239, 2005).Plastic and Surgery March Pep, and XenadrineRFA-1. 27 Adverse EffectsAccording to a recent study based on data from the U.S. Poison Control Centers and salesinformation, ephedra accounted for 64 percent ofall reported adverse effects from herbs. 43Adverse side effects 44As of December 30, 2003, the U.S. Food and Drug Administrationmade a statement that ephedra may present \"anunreasonable risk of illness or injury\" and man-dated the removal of all substances containingephedra from store shelves. 45 Presurgical Precautions and Recommendations Possible intraoperative complications in- clude interactions anesthetic told to im-mediately stop using them; patients should beephedra-free at least 2 weeks before surgery. Feverfew ( Tanacetum parthenium ) Overview Several clinical trials 46-48have shown that fe- verfew reduces the frequency and severity of mi-graine headaches when taken in small amountsdaily. However, analysis 49of five double-blind, ran- domized, controlled trials failed to show any ben-eficial effect of feverfew over placebo. Feverfewhas also been used for arthritis, allergies, cramps,indigestion, postnatal bleeding, painful menstru-ation, other gynecologic disorders, and intestinalparasites, but its effectiveness for these ailmentshas never been verified. 21Feverfew is regarded as a general tonic, tranquilizer, and \"blood purifier.\"As a wash or rinse, it is used to prevent infectionand reduce swelling from wounds and tooth ex-traction. Use among Surgical Patients No data are available. Synonyms for and Products Containing Feverfew Featherfoil, featherfew, flirtwort, bachelor's buttons, and midsummer daisy. 21Adverse Effects Adverse effects occur most when patients stop taking feverfew. People who abruptly discontinuethis herb have a 10 percent chance of developinga postfeverfew syndrome\u2014symptoms include re- bound headaches, insomnia, muscle stiffness,joint pain, fatigue, nervousness, and tension. 21 Presurgical Precautions and Recommendations Feverfew has the potential to interact with Coumadin, has antiplatelet activity,50and has been shown to inhibit lipoxygenase andcycloxygenase 51-53(possibly explaining the bene- ficial effect this herb may have). There are no published recommendations for stopping thisdrug. Our recommendation is that patientsshould wean off their feverfew over 2 weeks andthen be off it completely for 2 weeks to minimizethe risk of developing a postfeverfew syndromeand bleeding. Garlic ( Allium sativum ) Overview Commonly used for cooking, garlic is also used as an antibiotic, diuretic, antihypertensive, lipid-lowering agent, and antitussive. activity, and re-lieves diarrhea. 31,54-56Garlic comes in a raw form and as an herbal tablet. Use among Surgical Patients Garlic is used in up to 7.9 percent of surgical patients.12 Synonyms for and Products Containing Garlic Ajoene, Allicor, camphor of the poor, clove garlic, garlic clove, garlic corns, garlic extract, gar-lic oil, Kwai, and Kyolic. 27 Adverse EffectsBad breath, body odor, and allergic reactions are the most common reported side effects ofgarlic. Fresh garlic has caused rash or skin burns,both in people taking garlic therapy and in foodpreparers handling garlic. Other side effects in-clude hypotension, headache, and bloating. Themost common serious complication from garlicuse is increased bleeding secondary to its anti-platelet and antithrombotic effects. 57-59Garlic may also prolong the effects of Coumadin. Drug-herbinteractions that may occur with garlic includehypoglycemics, cardiovascular medications, andmonoamine oxidase inhibitors.Volume 119, Number 3 Herbal Supplements and Vitamins 53ePresurgical Precautions and Recommendations Patients taking garlic supplements should dis- continue its use 7 days before surgery to preventpossible bleeding complications. 60 Ginger ( Zingiber officinale ) Overview Typical uses of ginger include food prepara- tion, relief of respiratory ailments, sore throats,motion sickness, rheumatoid arthritis, postop-erative nausea and vomiting, and to dispel evilspirits. 61,62 Use among Surgical PatientsGinger is consumed by 2.6 percent of surgical patients preoperatively. 63 Synonyms for and Products Containing Ginger African ginger, black ginger, chayenne ginger, cochin ginger, gan jiang, gegibre, gingembre, gin-gerall, ginger power BP, ginger root, ginger trips,ingwer, Jamaica ginger, kankyo, and race ginger. 27 Adverse EffectsPossible perioperative complications include prolonged bleeding (because of inhibition ofthromboxane synthetase), 64hyperglycemia, and prolonged prothrombin time if taken withCoumadin. 65 Presurgical Precautions and Recommendations It is recommended that patients discontinue its use 1 week before and its leaf ex- tracts are commonly used to improve circulation,66 memory, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia31; there- fore, it is typically used in the elderly population. Patients also take ginkgo to treat asthma, angina,colds, peripheral vascular disease, cerebral insuffi-ciency, and eye a constit- uent of Ginkgo biloba , was found to inhibit platelet- activating factor and presumably is the cause of theherb's antiplatelet activities. 68The physiologic ef- vasodilation, prevention of arterialspasm, increase surgi-cal bleeding. 70Use among Surgical PatientsGinkgo is taken by 8.6 percent of surgical patients. 11 Synonyms for and Products Containing Ginkgo Arbre aux quarante e \u00b4cus, Japanbaum, Japanese sun shu, LI 1370, maid-enhair tree, yin-hsing. 27 Adverse EffectsSmall clinical trials have not demonstrated bleeding complications with the consumption ofginkgo; however, five cases of spontaneous hemor-rhage (four cerebral, one hyphema) and one case ofpostoperative bleeding after a laparoscopic chole-cystectomy have been reported. 60,71-75Ginkgo also lowers a patient's seizure threshold and decreasesthe anticonvulsants 13and with anesthetics, causing pro-longed sedation. 41 Presurgical Precautions and Recommendations Patients should be advised to cease taking this supplement at least 36 hours before surgery.60 Ginseng ( Panax quinquefolius ,Panax Ginseng, Zingiber officinale ) Overview Ginseng, most commonly of the Asian or American species, has gained popularity for itsalleged ability to protect the body from stress,leading to vitality and longevity. The pharmaco-logic effects and properties of ginseng are heter-ogenous and related to the active constituentsknown as ginsenosides. Ginsenosides have beenshown to decrease blood glucose levels in bothtype II diabetics and nondiabetics. 77Ginsenosides have also been found to inhibit platelet aggrega-tion and enhance fibrinolysis. 78 Use among Surgical PatientsGinseng is consumed by 7.4 percent of surgical patients preoperatively. 63 Synonyms for and Products Containing Ginseng Allheilkraut, Araliaceae (family), chikusetsu ginseng, chosen ninjin, and zhuzishen.27 Adverse EffectsGinseng may cause hypoglycemia, hypertension, tachycardia, epistaxis, cerebral ar-teritis, and headaches. 79Ginseng is known to de- crease the effect of paradoxically inhibits platelet adhesiveness andantagonizes platelet-activating factor. 81 Presurgical Precautions and Recommendations Ginseng has been studied to determine whether it improves postoperative nausea and vomiting, withmixed results. 82There is a case report of a patient undergoing reoperation for postoperative bleedingafter a mastectomy, and she had been taking ginsengalong with other herbs and medications. 83Other medications taking ginseng 2 weeksbefore surgery. Glucosamine Sulfate Overview Glucosamine is an amino monosaccharide found in chitin, glycoproteins, and glycosamino-glycans. Available evidence from randomized con-trolled trials supports the use of glucosamine sul-fate in the treatment of osteoarthritis, particularlyof the knee. Glucosamine is commonly taken withchondroitin sulfate (a glycosaminoglycan derivedfrom articular cartilage). 85 Use among Surgical PatientsNo data are available.Synonyms for and Products Containing Glucosamine Sulfate Aflexa, Nature's Blend Glucosamine, GS-500, Glucosamine Complex, Maxi GS, and NAG. 21 Adverse EffectsGlucosamine may increase insulin resistance and consequently affect glucose tolerance. Dia-betics should use glucosamine supplements undermedical advisement. In theory, glucosamine mayincrease the risk of bleeding. Caution is advised inpatients with bleeding disorders and in those tak-ing drugs that may increase the risk of bleeding. 27 Presurgical Precautions and Recommendations Glucosamine at a dose of 500 mg three times daily (tablets or capsules) has been well toleratedfor 30 to 90 days. In a 3-year study and severalshort-term trials, the number of adverse events inpatients taking glucosamine was no different fromplacebo. 86It appears that glucosamine does notneed to be stopped evening ( Hydrastis canadensis ) Overview Goldenseal is a Native American medicinal plant introduced to early settlers by Cherokee In-dians who used the plant to improve digestion asa bitter tonic and to treat ulcers. An infusion of theroot was used as a soothing rinse for eye and skininfections. Goldenseal root has acquired a con-siderable reputation as a natural antibiotic and asa remedy for various gastric and genitourinarydisorders. Use among Surgical Patients Goldenseal is consumed by 1.4 percent of sur- gical patients. 11 Synonyms for and Products balm, ground raspberry,and Indian paint. 21 Adverse EffectsGoldenseal is known to cause sodium deple- tion and may potentiate the effects of otherdiuretics. 37It is also known to inhibit cytochrome CYP3A438and affects drugs metabolized by the enzyme system (Table 1). Other side effects in-clude gastrointestinal upset, nervousness, and re-spiratory failure. 87 Presurgical Precautions and Recommendations Because goldenseal inhibits cytochrome CYP3A4,38patients should stop taking this drug 2 weeks before surgery. Grape Seed Overview Grape seed is extracted from red and purple grapes and purported as having health benefitsbased on its antioxidant action found in its activeproanthocyanidin content. Proanthocyanidin is abioflavonoid that acts as a strong antioxidant, pro-tecting DNA from harmful free radicals. In addi-tion, grape seed extract has been reported to re-duce inflammation, stabilize collagen and elastin,act as a natural antihistamine, and protect andheal connective tissue, and has chemopreventiveeffects in patients with cancer. 88Reportedly, grape seed extract provides two to five times better pro-tection against oxidative tissue damage as com-pared with vitamins C and E singly and incombination. 89Volume 119, Number 3 Herbal Supplements and Vitamins 55eUse among Surgical Patients No data are available. Synonyms for and Products Containing Grape Seed Opc 85, and seed extract appears safe overall; how- ever, as with any supplement, adequate scientificstudies have not been performed to delineate thebeneficial and adverse effects associated with thissupplement. Presurgical Precautions and among Surgical PatientsKava kava is taken by 1.2 percent of surgical patients. 31,63 Synonyms for and Products Containing Kava Kava the anesthetic effects of barbiturate anesthetics 13and has been shown in vitro to cause platelet dysfunction through in-hibition of thromboxane synthesis. with liver-related injuries\u2014including hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver failure\u2014inover 25 reports of adverse events in other coun-tries. Four patients required liver transplants. Inthe United States, the U.S. Food and Drug Ad-ministration has received a report of a previouslyhealthy young woman who required liver transplan-tation, in addition to several reports of liver-relatedinjuries. 90Kava kava also has an antagonistic effect on dopamine. Patients taking levodopa-based med-ication for Parkinson's disease should not take thisdrug. 93,94 Presurgical Precautions and Recommendations Patients should stop root has long been known for its abil- ity to soothe respiratory inflammation. Licoriceextract is a proven treatment for stomach ulcers.The extract also seems to have a beneficial effecton viral infections of the liver. In Asian medicine,the root has also been used for boils, dehydration,diarrhea, eye diseases, headache, sore throat, andswelling from infections. Licorice contains glycyr-rhetic acid, which is known glycyr-rhizin, and appears to be ef-fective against viruses such as hepatitis B, influ-enza, and human immunodeficiency virus by en-hancing the immune system's T-cell count andstimulating interferon. 21 Use among Surgical PatientsLicorice is taken by 0.8 percent of surgical patients. 11 Synonyms for and Products Containing Licorice Black sugar, licorice root, liquorice, sweetroot, and sweetwood.21 Adverse EffectsLicorice is known to cause hypertension, ar- rhythmias, and sodium retention. In addition, lic-orice causes hypokalemia, which may be magni-fied by diuretic use, and has resulted in cardiacarrest. 95Licorice inhibits CYP3A4 in vitro and may affect the metabolism of drugs (Table 1) metab-olized through this cytochrome. 38It is sometimes accompanied by fatigue, headaches, and myalgias.Licorice inhibits platelet aggregation and containscoumarin. Because of the possibility of these sideeffects, licorice preparations should not be usedlonger than 6 weeks. The side effects disappearafter the drug is discontinued. 21 Presurgical Precautions and Recommendations At recommended dosage levels, licorice is un- likely to produce any side effects. However, whentaken in high dosages ( /H1102220 g of licorice extract or 50 g of licorice root daily) for an \"extended periodof time,\" it will lead to adverse effects listed above.Patients should stop taking licorice 2 weeks beforesurgery. Omega-3 Fatty Acids Overview Omega-3 fatty acids are found in various fish, canola oil, flaxseed oil, walnuts, and green leafyvegetables. The first discovery of the health ben-Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery March 2007 56eefits of omega-3 fatty acids was made in the 1970s, when scientists discovered that the Eskimos livingin Greenland had fewer occurrences of cardiovas-cular disease, rheumatoid mel-litus, and psoriasis. 96Reported of omega-3 fatty acids reduction of cho-lesterol, reduction of blood clots, decreased in-flammation and pain, alleviation of fatigue anddepression, and prevention of breast cancer. 96,97 Use among Surgical PatientsNo data are available. Synonyms for and Products Containing Omega-3 Fatty Acids #945;-linolenic acid (ALA, C18:3n-3), alpha- linolenic acid, cod liver oil, cold water fish, doco-sahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6n-3), eicosapenta-enoic acid (EPA, C20:5n-3), fish oil fatty acids, fishbody oil, fish liver oil, fish extract, halibut oil, andlong chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. 27 Adverse EffectsIntake of 3 g/day or greater of omega-3 fatty acids may increase the risk of bleeding, althoughthere is little evidence of significant bleeding riskat lower doses. 98-100Very large intakes of fish oil/ risk of (bleeding)stroke. 101High doses have also been associated with nosebleed and blood in the urine.102Fish oils appear to decrease platelet aggregation and pro-long bleeding time and increase fibrinolysis(breaking down of blood clots), and may reducevon Willebrand factor. 103 Presurgical Precautions and Recommendations Because of the ability of omega-3 fatty acids to reduce blood clot formation, patients should usecaution taking supplements containing omega-3fatty acids before surgical intervention. Patientstakin g3go rm o r ep e rd a y should stop taking omega-3 fatty acid supplements ,Sabal serrulata ) Overview Popular in Europe, it is used for symptoms associated with benign prostatic hypertrophy. Al-though not considered the standard of care in theUnited States, it is the most popular herbal treat-ment for this condition. 13 Use among Surgical PatientsApproximately 2.3 percent of surgical patients use saw palmetto. 12The majority of patients using saw palmetto are male.Synonyms for and Products Containing Saw Palmetto American dwarf palm tree, Arecaceae (fam- ily), cabbage tachycardia, and angina. 13The active ingre- dients or the mechanism by which they act are notwell defined. There has been one report of severeintraoperative bleeding in a patient taking sawpalmetto. 104In addition, there are theoretical drug-herb interactions propanolol, amiloride, and actino-mycin D. 87 Presurgical Precautions and Recommendations Because of the risk of postoperative bleeding, patients should stop taking the drug 2 weeks be-fore surgery. St. John's Wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) Overview St. John's wort is used to treat depression and anxiety by inhibiting serotonin, norepinephrine,and dopamine reuptake by neurons 105and has been found to be as efficacious as monoamineoxidase inhibitors. 106St. Johns wort has also been shown to induce the cytochrome P450 pathway,altering the metabolism of many drugs metabo-lized through this pathway. Use among Surgical Patients St. John's wort is taken by up to 4.5 percent of surgical patients. 12 Synonyms for and Products Containing St. John's EffectsPotential side effects include prolonged post- operative sedation. This tranquilizing effect maybe more severe when combined with narcotics;however, there have been no reports of this todate. 15Long-term use of the herb has been as- sociated with cardiovascular collapse on induc-tion of anesthesia. 107St. John's wort is known to induce the activity of hepatic cytochromeCYP3A4 108and reduce the efficacy of cyclospor- ine, digitalis, Coumadin, oral contraceptives,Volume 119, Number and Vitamins 57eindinavir, theophylline,109-111midazolam, and lidocaine.37 Precautions and Recommendations St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum )i su s e d by many patients to treat depression and anxietyby exerting its effects by inhibiting serotonin,norepinephrine, and dopamine reuptake byneurons. 105Caution should be exercised by serotoninand by those taking monoamine oxidase inhibi-tors. St. Johns wort has also been shown to inducethe cytochrome P450 pathway, altering the me-tabolism of many drugs (most notably in our pa-tients, midazolam and lidocaine) metabolizedthrough this pathway (Table 1). In addition, re-ported photosensitivity related to the compoundhypericin has been described. 112Patients taking other photosensitizing agents such as tetracycline,doxycycline, and specifically retinoids such astretinoin used by many plastic surgery patientsshould be avoided. It has been recommended thatpatients discontinue all use of St. John's wort commonly for its sedative and hypnotic properties in patients with insomnia,and less commonly as an anxiolytic. 113Multiple preparations are available (a dried herb, an aque-ous extract, or an ethanol extract 13), and the herb is commonly combined with other herbal medi-cations. Use among Surgical Patients Valerian root is taken by 2.5 percent of surgical patients. 12 Synonyms for and Products Containing Valerian herb may cause excessive sedation and muscle relaxation through interactions with /H9253-aminobutyric acid receptors. Concomitant use with barbiturates is contraindicated.13Additional side effects include gastric distress, blurred vision,excitability, restlessness, and acute hepatitis. 114 Long-term consumption of valerian root by onepatient resulted in delirium and cardiac failureduring emergence from general anesthesia, pre-sumably secondary to withdrawal. 115Administra-tion of benzodiazepines will reverse the patient's symptoms. Presurgical Precautions and Recommendations Because valerian root may sedative effects of barbiturates, anesthetics, and centralnervous system depressants, patients should stoptaking the drug 2 weeks before surgery. Many commonly encountered supplements have the potential to interact with prescriptionmedications and anesthetics used during surgery.Few studies exist examining these interactions,and the majority of this information has beenidentified through case-by-case reporting. Be-cause 16 percent of adults in the United Statesreport the use of herbal supplements with one ormore prescription medications, it is prudent thatplastic surgeons be aware of some of the mostcommon supplement-drug interactions. 116Be- cause of the lack of consensus on the interactionbetween herbal supplements and anesthetics, theAmerican Society of Anesthesiologists recom-mends that all herbal medications be stopped 2 to3 weeks before an elective operative procedure.Many supplements and vitamins may be stoppedlater. However, because of the lack of contentconsistency in marketed products, we support thisrecommendation for our patients. Table 2 pro-vides a brief overview of some recently identifiedinteractions. 93,94,117 VITAMINS Only the vitamins that may have a significant impact on surgical patient care are discussed. Vi-tamins A, B 12, C, and E are discussed. Vitamin A (Retinoic Acid) Overview Vitamin A is a generic term for a large number of related compounds including retinol, retinal,retinoic acid, and other retinoids. Retinal is con-verted to retinoic acid in the body and plays a rolein gene transcription. Beta-carotene and othercarotenoids are found in various plants that ulti-mately are converted to retinol in the body. Vita-min A plays a role in vision, immunity, gene tran-scription, red blood cell production, growth, andembryologic development. 118Brief, high doses of vitamin A may improve wound healing and coun-teract the negative effects of chronic corticoste-roid use and irradiation. 119-122 Use among Surgical PatientsFrom 15.1 12to erative vitamins.Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery March 2007 58eSynonyms for and Products Containing Vitamin A Antixerophthalmic EffectsRecommended dietary allowance levels for vi- tamin A oral intake have been established by theU.S. Institute for Medicine of the National Acad-emy of Sciences to prevent deficiencies in vitaminA. At recommended doses [900 /H9262g/day /H9262g/day (2300 women],27 vitamin A is generally considered nontoxic. Excessdosing may lead to acute or chronic toxicity. Tox-icity has been shown to result in liver damage,hemorrhage, and coma, and excess amounts canlead to increased risk of congenital disabilities inpregnant women. 118 Presurgical Precautions and Recommendations Patients taking their recommended daily dose of vitamin A do not need to stop taking it beforesurgery. Patients exceeding the recommended di-etary allowance ( /H110225000 IU/day) should be dis- couraged from taking such high doses unless un-der the supervision of a physician. Vitamin B 12(Cyanocobalamin) Overview Vitamin B12is an essential water-soluble vita- min that is commonly found in a variety of foodssuch as fish, shellfish, meats, and dairy products. Vitamin B12is frequently used in combination with other B vitamins in a vitamin B complex formu-lation. The human body stores several years' worthof vitamin B 12, so nutritional deficiency of this vitamin is extremely rare. Vitamin B12is bound to the protein in food. Hydrochloric acid in the stom-ach releases B 12from protein during digestion. Once released, B12complexes with intrinsic factor and is absorbed into the bloodstream. The elderlyare the most at risk for deficiency. 123Vitamin B12deficiency is seen with pernicious anemia (from decreased intrinsic factor production) andin strict vegetarians who do not consume animalproteins. 124The recommended dietary allowances is 2.4 mg/day for adults and adolescents aged 14years and older. Use among Surgical Patients From 15.1 percent 12to 51 percent11of preop- erative patients report taking vitamins. Synonyms for and Products Containing Vitamin B12 B-12, B transitory exanthema, and ur- ticaria have been reported. Vitamin B 12(20/H9262m/Table 2.

Presurgical Precautions and Recommendations Vitamin B 12taken at the recommended dose does not need to be stopped before surgery. Arecent study 126measured vitamin B12, folate, cre- with venous thrombotic diseaseand 101 control subjects, matched for age and sex.Serum vitamin B 12concentrations were signifi- cantly lower in patients with venous thromboticdisease than in the control subjects. It is thoughtthat this may have been caused by an accumula-tion of homocysteine, which is believed to causeintimal thickening and induce a hyperthromboticstate. 127-130Hyperhomocysteinemia is thought to be responsible for accelerated atherosclerosis andvenous thromboembolic disease. 126,131-133Patients deficient of these vitamins might be at increased risk of flap failure for similar reasons (specula-tion). Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) Overview Vitamin C is required for the synthesis of col- lagen and plays an important role in the synthesisof the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. VitaminC is also an effective antioxidant and has beenshown to be able to regenerate other antioxidantssuch as vitamin E. Vitamin C is often taken toprevent the common cold; however, controlled,double-blind, clinical trials have shown minimaleffects on the common cold. 134,135In addition, vi- tamin C has been shown to have no significanteffect on outcome between terminal cancer pa-tients taking vitamin C versus placebo. 136 Use among Surgical PatientsFrom 15.1 percent 12to 51 percent11of preop- erative patients report taking vitamins. Synonyms for and Products Containing Vitamin C Antiscorbutic vitamin, ascorbate, ascorbic acid, ascorbyl palmitate, calcium ascorbate, cevi-tamic acid, iso-ascorbic acid, and sodium ascor-bate. Vitamin C is included in thousands of mul-tivitamin formulations. Vitamin C products in talose C-1000. 27 Adverse EffectsThe recommended daily intake of vitamin C is 60 mg. The tolerable upper intake level is reportedto be 2000 mg/day as reported by the Institute ofMedicine. Upper tolerable intake levels \"repre-sent the maximum intake of a nutrient that is likelyto pose no risk of adverse health effects in almostall individuals in the general population.\" 137High doses of vitamin C have been associated with mul-tiple adverse effects, particularly at doses greaterthan 2000 mg/day. Large doses may precipitatehemolysis (red blood cell destruction) in patientswith glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase defi-ciency. High doses of vitamin C should be avoidedin people with conditions aggravated by acid load-ing, such as cirrhosis, gout, renal tubular acidosis,or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. 138,139 Presurgical Precautions and Recommendations Patients taking vitamin C supplementation do not necessarily have to stop their intake during theperioperative period. Vitamin E (Tocopherol) Overview Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin with antiox- idant properties. Vitamin E exists in eight differ-ent forms, of which /H9251-tocopherol is the most active form in humans. Dosing and daily allowance rec-ommendations for vitamin E are often provided in /H9251-tocopherol equivalents to account for the dif- ferent biological activities of the various forms ofvitamin E, or in international units, which foodand supplement labels may use. For conversion, 1mg of /H9251-tocopherol equivalents /H110051.5 IU. Vitamin E supplements are available in natural or syntheticforms. The natural forms are usually labeled withthe letter \"d\" (for example, d-gamma-tocopherol),whereas synthetic forms are labeled \"dl\" (for ex-ample, dl-alpha-tocopherol). Vitamin E has beenproposed for the prevention or treatment of nu-merous health conditions, often based on its an-tioxidant properties and as a free radical scaven-ger. However, aside from the treatment of vitaminE deficiency (which is rare), there are no clearlyproven medicinal uses of vitamin E supplementa-tion beyond the recommended daily allowance.There is ongoing research in numerous diseases,particularly in cancer and heart disease. 140,141 Use among Surgical PatientsFrom 15.1 percent 12to erative vitamins.Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery March 2007 60eSynonyms for and Products Aquasol Adverse EffectsRecent evidence suggests that regular use of high-dose vitamin E supplements (400 IU/day orgreater) may increase the risk of death (all-causemortality risk difference in high-dosage vitamin Etrials was 39 per 10,000 persons). 142These con- clusions have been criticized by some experts be-cause they are based on recalculations (meta-anal-yses) of the results of prior smaller studies thatwere of mixed quality, with variable results, andoften in patients with chronic illnesses. High dosesof vitamin E ( /H11022400 IU/day) might increase the risk of bleeding because of inhibition of plateletaggregation and antagonism of vitamin K-depen-dent clotting factors (particularly in patients withvitamin K deficiency). 143-145In studies of vitamin E, a small increase in the rate of hemorrhagic strokeand gum bleeding has been observed, particularly when used in humans with aspirin. 146Increased risk of bleeding when used with warfarin (Coumadin)has been noted. 147,148However, others have not ob- served a greater incidence of bleeding.149Caution is advised in patients with bleeding disorders and inthose taking drugs that may increase the risk ofbleeding. Presurgical Precautions and Recommendations Patients should discontinue high doses of vita- m i nE( /H11022400 IU/day) 2 to 3 weeks before surgery. DISCUSSION Herbs, vitamins, and minerals have been used for centuries not only to supplement the diet butalso to treat illness and improve health. Annualsales of dietary supplements in the United Statesare approaching $6 billion, and an average of 1000new products are being developed each year. De-spite the fact that one-quarter of adults reportedusing an herbal product to treat an illness last year,limited evidence from randomized controlled tri-als exists to support the efficacy of the majority ofthe herbal supplements available to the public. Inaddition, Bent and Ko 150report that of the 10 most commonly used herbs in the United States in 2001,statistically significant evidence of efficacy existsonly for garlic, ginkgo biloba, saw palmetto, and St. John's wort. As demonstrated by this systematicreview, additional research is needed to definefurther the benefits and risks of presently availabledietary supplements. The Dietary Supplement Health and Educa- tion Act of 1994 classified herbs as \"dietary sup-plements\" and exempted them from the safetyand efficacy requirements and regulations thatprescription and other over-the-counter medica-tions must fulfill. In addition, the burden wasplaced on the U.S. Food and Drug Administrationto prove a supplement unsafe before its removalfrom store shelves. 151Therefore, manufacturers are not obligated to guarantee the quality or quantity of herbal substance in their products,resulting in the problem of batch-to-batch vari-ability. As with any public market, the buyermust beware. As consumers and health care providers, we have a responsibility to educate ourselves and ourpatients about the risks and potential benefits ofsuch supplements. We must inquire about over-the-counter medications, including vitamin andherbal supplementation, in our preoperative in-terviews. Until more stringent regulations existand further research is performed, we must re-member that because something is \"natural\" doesnot always mean it is safe. Table 3.
