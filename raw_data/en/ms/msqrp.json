Create your own ceremony: Start by finding a quiet space where you can meditate while holding the chosen crystal between your hands. Close your eyes and focus on your breath. - Now, set a positive intention for your crystal: you may want it to provide you with clarity, peace or self love. We include a [Love Note](https://self-ceremony.myshopify.com/pages/love-notes) to encourage you in this practice. You can say this intention quietly to yourself or speak it out loud. You may feel your body sink deeper into the earth, creating a grounding effect. You may feel a lightness surround you. Or you may not feel anything right away. Sometimes, certain crystals don't resonate, and other times they make the hairs on your skin stand up. Each crystal will feel different, so be patient and keep experimenting. Cleaning Use water free from chemicals (natural rain water or sea water would be ideal!). You can simply rinse well with warm water and use a bit of PH balanced or mild soap to rub over the wand and disinfect - especially if cleaning your [Pleasure Wand.](https://selfceremony.com/collections/yoni) Finish by rinsing again with warm water and rub dry with a clean cloth or air dry and you're done! Cleansing Honoring your crystals with energy baths is a way to honor yourself as well. Just like regular crystals, crystal pipes or Pleasure Wands can be cleansed energetically by means of healing music, visualization, or placing them near cleansing stones such as [Selenite](https://selfceremony.com/products/selenite-wand). You may wish to burn our [Incense Blends](https://selfceremony.com/collections/altar) or one of our [Herbal Smoke Blends](https://self-ceremony.myshopify.com/collections/loose-blends) and have the smoke encompass the crystal. Try charging your crystals during the powerful energy of the New Moon to plant the seeds of your intentions. Ceremonies during the Full Moon will help you release and surrender what no longer serves your highest good. [<< Back "}
