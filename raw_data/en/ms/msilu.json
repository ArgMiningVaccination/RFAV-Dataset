hypothermia was induced in rats by the combined technique of hibernation and external cooling The administration of a lytic mixture to rats did not change the content of ammonia, glutamme and amide groups of total proteins in cerebral tissue Cooling of rats to 18-20 deg also did not alter the level of glutamme and amide groups in cerebral tissues However the ammonia level rose slightly When a body temperature of 18-20 deg was maintained for 24 hours the ammonia content decreased more than during the initial period of hypothermia but did not differ from the initial level The glutamme level

four-hour exposure of white mice to atmospheres with an increased content of carbon dioxide (5-7 percent) oxygen (35-40 percent) or both gases brought about a decrease in their rectal temperature Carbon dioxide produced the highest hypothermal effect, whereas oxygen induced the lowest During subsequent exposure to low temperatures (-25 and \u201450 C) the animals preexposed to a hypercapnic atmosphere exhibited the lowest rate of rectal temperature decrease and their death occurred at lower rectal temperatures in comparison with the control animals It is suggested that an increased carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere may increase the tolerance of mice to low temperatures Author N70-21132# Joint Publications Research Service Washington, DC PROLIFERATIVE ACTIVITY OF

rates on the altitude tolerance of animals (white rats) revealed a distinct relationship between them and changes in animal tolerance to acute hypoxia The study revealed that the decompression rate is of independent biological significance in the hypoxia tolerance with an increase in the decompression rate the altitude ceiling increases and the period of sustained activity progressively decreases In the case of a slowly increasing hypoxia the basic effect is on the cardiovascular respiration circulation and heat control systems whereas in the case of a rapidly increasing hypoxia the mam effect is on the central nervous system Author N70-21135# Joint Publications Research Service Washington D C BASIC PRINCIPLES FOR DEVELOPMENT OF ACCELERATION TRAINING SCHEDULES V I Stepantsov et al In its

three schedules was evaluated from variations in the maximum tolerable accelerations as well as on the basis of physiologic morphologic and histochemical changes in the body In human experiments the efficiency of two schedules was evaluated The schedules differed in the number of rotations intervals between rotations and the degree of accomplishment of the main training objectives These studies resulted in formulation of the basic requirements which should serve as the basis for rational schedules for the training ofanimals and humans in order to increase their tolerance to transverse accelerations Author N70-21136# Joint Publications Research Service Washington D C EFFECT OF DIET CONTAINING DESTROYED CELLS OF UNICELLULAR ALGAE ON COMPOSITION OF ENTERIC MICROFLORA V M Shilov et al

containing different protein sources In animals a diet containing casein resulted in a decrease in the concentration of lactobacilli whereas a diet containing proteins of unicellular algae caused an increase in the number of sponferous artaerobic bacteria These changes may be associated with the properties of these proteins In human subjects diets containing proteins of unicellular algae produced a decrease in the concentration of bifidobactena and lactobacilli It is shown that large quantities of biomass obtained using the present-day treatment method cannot be recommended for human nutrition Further studies must be made to develop improved methods for separating the substance of unicellular algae and for producing easily assimilated protein products Author N70-21137# Joint Publications

shift particularly with several resonances superposed and a basic circuit for this purpose is described The basic circuit of a single-frequency measuring bridge with a highly sensitive detector which also allows time changes in the magnitude and phase of individual resonances to be closely followed is also described Both circuits were first developed for the microwave range and can be adapted for the optical and infrared ranges with appropriate components The cis-trans isomenzation of dichlorethylene and the oxidation and reduction of haemoglobin in aqueous solution etc were used to test the devices and the water dispersion attenuation and phase shift in the 3-cm band were recorded These spectroscopic methods can also be used in the frequency range of intra-molecular resonances for

biology as well as in physics and there is a striking correspondence between their properties An organism struggles to maintain the coherence of its individuality throughout its body This is a means whereby it carries out the struggle for survival and is a fundamental law of biology The biological phenomenon of alternation of generation serves as a basis for showing that there are biological analogues of bosons and fermions An organism acts as a boson-analogue in interactions with the environment while the fermion properties of the gametes regulate the organisms internal characteristics ONA acts in the manner of a hologram to modulate the life activity of an organism In the alternation of generations the organism (somaton) acts as a boson analogue It interacts with the environment

stainless steel The methyl methacryiate 17N70-23347 data show the percentage of microbial release to be less than 1% at all four test velocities An exception to this is seen in the epoxy results The percentage of total microbial survival after impact is velocity dependent but independent of initial spore concentration The fact that the total number of organisms surviving impact decreases as the

changes, and supporting the hypothesis that the endogenous C02 shifts and the observed impedance changes may be produced by a common metabolic mechanism It is concluded that at this time it appears highly unlikely that the experimental results regarding impedance changes may be attributed to a single mechanism or functional state There are too many possible pathways for the current to take and too many elements in each of these pathways to allow assignment of sole responsibility for these changes However, there are some known factors which are more likely than others Of these, the

for personnel protection against accidental decompression in transport aircraft that will be operating in the 1970 decade is reviewed Data pertinent to manned and simian tests that were conducted in conjunction with the B 70 program is presented in context with a review of the literature dealing with the effects of rapid decompression to altitudes of 45,000 feet and above The results of these findings indicate a need for additional protection for flights in this region and questions the use of oxygen masks for contingencies above 35,000 feet Potential alternatives which would augment aircrew protection are discussed in terms of feasibility and the physiological characteristics of the existing pilot inventory A recommendation is made to provide flight stations with a capsule which would rapidly achieve a ground level oxygen equivalent upon decompression warning and be equipped for flydown to an altitude where demand oxygen equipment can safely be utilized (Author) A70-23460 g Intraocular pressure and retinal responses of dogs at 45,000 and 80,000 feet Julian P Cooke (USAF, School of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Tex ) Aerospace Medicine vol 41, Mar 1970, p 283-289 41 refs Intraocular pressure changes and retinal observations, along with cardiovascular pressure measurements, were made during and after decompression of both conscious and anesthetized dogs from 10,000-ft altitude, while breathing either air or oxygen to pressures that might be encountered in supersonic or high performance aircraft if cabin pressure were lost Decompressions were made within either 1 mm (slow) or 1 sec (rapid), and exposures lasted 2 mm When air had been breathed, intraocular pressure almost doubled during slow 36A70 23467 decompressions to 45,000 ft, and almost tripled in value at 80,000 ft No increase was measured during the 45,000-ft exposure in which oxygen was breathed, but during the 80,000-ft exposure intraocular pressure doubled when oxygen had been breathed Fast decompressions resulted in slightly higher values Soon after recompression to ground level pressure, intraocular pressure increased to slightly higher values than those measured during the exposure Bubbles were never observed in the aqueous humor Some retinal blanching occurred during exposure when intraocular pressure was elevated A flame-type hemorrhage was seen infrequently Although peripheral vision will likely be reduced, it is reasoned that changes observed during exposures at 45,000 ft are not generally of sufficient magnitudes to prevent the successful completion of a mission before vision is lost with unconsciousness Exposure to 80,000 ft, however, especially with air, may cause temporary visual impairment that lasts for a few minutes after consciousness is regained Safe recovery is contingent, however, on an immediate recompression to a safe pressure (Author) A70-23461 Miniature pig incapacitation and performance decrement after mixed gamma-neutron

relative importance of bending and axial compression The existence of significant bending stresses has been established It is shown that these high bending stresses are caused by the forward rotation of the head and torso Various restraint system and seat back configurations were investigated The results show that bending strains can be reduced by increasing shoulder strap pre-tension and by leaning the seat-back rearwards It is suggested that future models predicting vertebral m|ury of the seated human subjected to caudocephalad acceleration should take into account forward flexion of the head and torso and the effects of external restraints (Author) A70-23463 Analysis of visual search activity in skilled and novice helicopter pilots John A Stern and James A Bynum (Washington

demonstrate changes in visual search activity as a function of time on task These changes include a decrease of searching in the horizontal plane, a decrease in searching in the vertical plane, an increase in the amount of time not engaged in search activity per unit time, and a decrease in blink rate These results are interpreted as suggesting a decrease in visual search activity as a function of time-on task (Author) A70 23464 # Consumption of rehydratable food in zero-gravity environments using conventional eating utensils John E Vanderveen, May J O'Hara, and Donald A Leeber (USAF, School

forces of 2-g in the z axis in the Naval Air Development Center human centrifuge facility Samples of hand eye coordination were examined both during and after exposure While exposed to this acceleration environment, subjects initially reached below, and then, above, a mirror viewed target When the accelerative forces were removed, transient after-effects were observed in which subjects reached still further above the target before they returned to baseline levels of accuracy The after effects resulted only when the subjects had an opportunity to make reaching movements while they were exposed to the increased accelerative forces Where present, the after-effects were observed for both arms The data suggest that the relationship between intended motor outputs and their propnoceptive- kinaesthetic consequences provides adequate information for rapid behavioral compensation and adaptation to altered accelerative forces Further, vestibular and/or sensory-tonic factors are implicated in bringing about changes in the apparent elevation of targets viewed under increased accelerative forces (Author) A70-23467 ;/ Potentials of the Aeromedical Evacuation System in the

essentially no difference in the effect of plasma viscosity on blood viscosity between samples containing normal proteins and those containing abnormal proteins The implications of these findings are discussed It is apparent that the influence of plasma viscosity must be considered in the future investigations relating aggregation to blood viscosity (Author) A70-23468 Wolff-Parkinson-White

axis was accompanied by a relaxation in the longitudinal axis Stimulus-induced relaxation in the longitudinal axis occurred in preparations devoid of longitudinal muscle and in the presence of nerve-blocking drugs A decrease in the circumference of the circular axis, due to contraction of circular muscle, produced a length increase in the longitudinal axis The increase in longitudinal length was proportional to the change in the circumference Relaxation in the longitudinal axis was a mechanical consequence of circular muscle contraction rather than nervous inhibition of the longitudinal muscle The phasic component of the circular response had a low stimulus threshold and fatigued rapidly during repetitive stimulation The tonic response had a higher threshold and was not easily fatigued Both components were unchanged in the presence of local anesthetics and depleted Na(+) but were reduced in lowered Ca(2+) and abolished by depolarization in high concentrations of K(+)

reaction times to the startle stimuli decreased relative to nonstartle reaction times Ss with the greatest increase in tracking error following startle were least proficient prior to startle There was

a dichotomously branched model of the human lung The lengths and cross-sectional areas of the branches were derived from analogical data and the diffusion coefficient was that of O2 diffusing into N2 Finite difference equations for treating diffusion at a branch point were developed If the diffusion front was established at the terminal bronchioles, 02 concentration in the terminal alveoli rose to a plateau value in 2 sec which was maintained for 50 sec A diffusion front in the alveolar ducts led to a plateau in 1 sec Critical examination of the assumptions made in this model (axial diffusion, a square, stationary front, and symmetrical branching) does not affect the conclusion that no significant concentration gradient exists between gas in the terminal bronchioles and gas distal to this point during the normal respiratory cycle Physiological data on the reason for the slope of the alveolar plateau are briefly reviewed (Author) A70-24004 * Effect of body position on vertical

studied, using radioactive microsphere emboli, in dogs without thoracotomy when positioned in prone, supine, head up, head down, right decubitis, and left decubitus positions Simultaneous measurements of aortic, pulmonary artery, left atrial, and airway pressures and nearly simultaneous measurements of cardiac output were obtained at each determination of DPBF This technique requires uniform mixing of microspheres in the blood after injection into the right ventricular outflow tract so that embohzation of the pulmonary vascular bed is in proportion to the fraction of the cardiac output traversing each segment Results indicate this was valid and that in all six positions pulmonary blood flow (ml/mm per ml lung tissue) was least to whatever region of lung was located most superiorly in the thorax Because this relationship pertained regardless of the anatomic orientation of the thorax with respect to gravity, the force of gravity must be an important determinant of DPBF However, DPBF determined by this method is not predicted accurately by the Starling resistor analog Probably, gravity- dependent regional differences in pleural and associated interstitial pressures plus possible changes in vascular tone resulting from deficient aeration of the blood in the most dependent regions of the lung also affect DPBF However, the finding that apical blood flow per milhliter of lung tissue at midlung level in the supine position was less than at the base cannot be readily explained by gravitational effects alone (Author) 41A70-24005 A70-24005 effect of sodium balance on

First-order approximations to the human dynamic response to angular accelerations are derived from four experiments and resulting time constants vary from 4 to 10 sec depending on the observer's task It is demonstrated that a simple static washout concept requiring continuous rotations at subthreshold levels provides essentially useless reductions in simulator travel Another washout scheme based on the dynamics of the vestibular system is considered The variation in the apparent dynamics derived from the psychophysical data suggest that simulator washout characteristics may have to be

p 339-345 23 refs Grant No NGR-09-005-022 The effects of a number of organic substrates on the autotrophic metabolism of Hydrogenomonas eutropha were examined Dual substrate (mixotrophic) cultivation in the presence of hydrogen plus either fructose or alanme allowed autotrophic growth to begin immediately after the exhaustion of the organic substrate On the other hand, the presence of acetate, pyruvate, or glutamate caused a lengthy lag to occur before autotrophic growth commenced With acetate or pyruvate this lag (plateau) in the dicyclic growth curve was due to the repression of ribulose diphosphate carboxylase (RDPC) synthesis during mixotrophic growth During heterotrophic with glutamate, RDPC was partially repressed, however, during mixotrophic growth, RDPC activity was high Thus the delay of autotrophic growth was not due to a repression of RDPC by glutamate The data suggest that glutamate interferes with autotrophic metabolism by repressing the incorporation of inorganic nitrogen The represssion of these vital autotrophic functions by acetate, pyruvate, and glutamate occurred both in the presence and absence of hydrogen, i e, during both heterotrophic and mixotrophic cultivation The derepression of the affected systems during the plateau phase of the dicyclic growth curves was demonstrated Carbon dioxide assimilation by whole cells agreed well with the RDPC

was found that the character of the dependence of the RT on the signal probability remains essentially the same in all the experimental conditions An increase of the number of signals leads only to a change in the quantitative parameters of this dependence From similar results obtained in experiments with one signal and in experiments with a choice from among 2, 4 or 8 signals, it may be concluded that the character of the dependence of the RT on the signal probability is determined by the particular temporal structure of the signal presentation, i e, the 'time morphology' of the set of signals However, an analysis of the 'sequential effects' did not reveal any regular change in the RT to a particular signal with an increase in the interval between two presentations of the signal, or with an increase in the number of its repetitions This fact indicates that the behavior of man in the conditions under investigation is determined not only by the structure of the objective influences which change the level of the physiological reactivity of the sensonmotor system, but also by the strategy developed by man on the basis of a subjective probabilistic model of the situation (Author)

those of the click, but they are observed for all positive intervals and are significant from 70 msec onwards The previous conclusion that a warning signal can be used as a time cue without starting a refractory period was thus not restricted to the particular signal which had been used so far A consequence is that the current tendency to take the situation of a reaction stimulus prefaced by a no

wasconsiderably reduced when the prior one was covert, especially at short intersignal intervals In grouping, response time was not dependent on covert or overt previous reaction Here a relatively strong increase of response time was found when going from a single reaction to two reactions but longer sequences had no sizeable effect on response time This is explained in terms of a difference in readiness to respond between a single and a grouped reaction Less readiness to respond also seems to occur at later signals of the sequence in the successive handling conditions, especially at long

principles of selection and integration considered separately, as well as their combined general implications Perception involves both a selection from, and an integration of, the data conveyed to the brain from the sense organs Selection seems to be made in terms of both simple sensory qualities and more complex semantic aspects of incoming data, and appears to result in unwanted data being in a very real sense attenuated It is achieved at some cost, as is shown by the fact that selection commonly takes a time which increases with the degree of specificity to which it is carried Research results do not fully agree on the extent to which different features of incoming data are selected simultaneously or successively Perceptual integration appears to achieve economy of decision in the sense that it makes it possible for a large quantity of incoming data to be handled as a limited number of units Of the various ways in which this is achieved, the extraction of rates of change and of time-sequences, the imposition of schemata or templates from past experience, and the building of perceptual frameworks in both space and time are considered M M A70-24767 Evidence for an accumulator

Australia Recent theoretical approaches to the problem of psychophysical discrimination have produced what may be classified as 'statistical decision' or 'data accumulation' models While the former have received much attention their application to judgment and choice meets with some difficulties Among the latter, the two types which have received most attention are a 'runs' and a 'recruitment' model, but neither seems able to account for all of the relevant data It is suggested instead that an 'accumulator' model, in which sampled events may vary in magnitude as well as probability, can be developed to give a good account of much of the available data on psychophysical discrimination Two experiments are reported, in which the subject presses one of two keys as soon as he has decided whether the longer of two simultaneously presented lines is on the left or right Results are found to be inconsistent with a runs or recruitment process, but to accord well with predictions from the accumulator model Other evidence consistent with such a mechanism is briefly reviewed (Author) A70-24736 Photogrammetry as a tool of experimental structural mechanics Robert H Brock (New York, State

solved assuming that the total oxygen flux was the sum of the flux by plain diffusion and that by diffusion of oxyhemoglobm After collecting and scrutinizing the pertinent numerical data, particularly for the diffusion coefficients of oxygen and hemoglobin, numerical solutions were obtained by computer for a variety of conditions It appeared that the gradients of oxygen and oxyhemoglobm across the slab were notably different from those stipulated for the condition of chemical equilibrium In particular we found that there must be a minute step in the oxygen gradient at the low pressure side with a slope equal to that at the high pressure side because of the boundary condition that the two surfaces must be impermeable for hemo- globin, and that the saturation is higher at the low pressure side and lower at the high pressureside than at chemical equilibrium When assuming mean values from available data for the diffusion coef-ficients of oxygen and hemoglobin we arrived at excellent agreement between the computed fluxes and those obtained experimentally by other authors It is concluded that the facilitation of oxygen diffusion in the presence of hemoglobin can be described quantita tively

whether the subject began the exercise in a normothermic or hypothermic state Pulmonary ventilation during the tests increased in proportion to the level of carbon dioxide production and was independent of the level of body temperature This suggests that body temperature is not an independent stimulus to ventilation during exercise (Author) A70-24774 Respiration of man during exercise at

similar in the two groups During hypoxic exercise, the slopes of the ventilation vs alveolar carbon dioxide pressure response increased, the increment being greater at higher work rates This interaction between hypoxia and nonchemical work stimuli in HN was, however, a third or less of that in SN Thus, we conclude that in the regulation of ventilation in HN and SN during exercise, the hypercapnic and nonchemical work stimuli played similar roles but that the relatively insensitive peripheral chemoreflex in HN resulted in a diminished interaction between the hypoxic and work stimuli

examining the dynamics of this hormonal action, a seventh order state variable model of this process was developed in terms of current knowledge about the mechanisms of cortisol biosynthesis The

considerable extent While changes in the O2 capacity of the blood have a direct influence on the oxygen transport capacity, an increase in the 02 affinity leads to an improvement in the conditions for

adaptation period Also noted are overextended systoles and diastoles and a sinusoidal bradycardia during the first month of exposure VZ A70-25180 ff Investigation of the mechanisms of spatial orientation mekhamzmov prostranstvennoi onentirovki 1970, p 5760 In Russian Simulation study of the mechanisms of spatial orientation of pilots during a total of 78 experiments on a group of 46 young ^.jlthy subjects with a high vestibular stability The study is carried out in a specially designed apparatus which provides for accurate dosage of angular accelerations and velocities combined with optokmetic stimuli Electroencephalograms, volume, respiration rates and cutaneous electroconductivity are recorded during the experiments A marked efficiency impairment is established in subjects exposed to alternating angular accelerations of 24 deg/sq sec for periods up to 20 mm Operational activity is found to be practically impossible when the vestibular and optokmetic stimuli are compounded, while the tracking ability is improved when the optokmetic stimuli interfere with the angular accelerations V Z A70-25220 Physiological evidence for increased tissue capillarity in rats acclimatized to high altitude. S M Tenney and L C Ou (Dartmouth College, Hanover, N H ) Respiration Physiology, vol 8, Jan 1970, p 137-150 25 refs Research supported by the New Hampshire Heart Association, the United Health Foundations, PHSGrantNo HE-02888(11)Attempt to provide physiological evidence of an increase in tissue capillary density in rats acclimatized to high altitude and by measuring 'tissue diffusing capacity' based on the uptake rate of low concentrations of CO from subcutaneous gas pockets in the animals On this basis it was determined that three weeks of acclimatization to an equivalent altitude of 5600 m resulted in a roughly doubled uptake rate When corrections for the contribution of the secondary polycythemia were made, and using certain simplifying assumptions, it was deduced that acclimatization resulted in a 50% increase of capillary number The effect of this change on oxygen partial pressure in the most distal sites of a diffusion cylinder have been calculated on the assumption that gas pocket oxygen partial pressure represents regional venous oxygen partial pressure The value is more than 10 mm Hg below sea level control at 5600 m, but is still well above zero, which would not be the case without increase of capillarity Experiments to test the effect of acclimatization to lesser altitudes indicated no effect on capillarity in a three-week period when the altitude was below 4100 m (Author) A70-25230 * State space models of remote manipulation tasks Daniel E Whitney (MIT, Cambridge, Mass) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, vol AC-14, Dec 1969, p 617623 19 refs Grant No NsG-107-61 A state variable formulation of the remote manipulation problem is presented, applicable to human supervised or autonomous computer-manipulators A discrete state vector, containing position variables for the manipulator and relevant objects, spans a quantized state space comprising many static configurations of objects and hand A manipulation task is a desired new state State transitions are assigned costs and are accomplished by commands hand motions plus grasp, release, push, twist, etc In control theory terms the problem is to find the cheapest control history (if any) from present to desired state A method similar to dynamic programming is used to determine the optimal history The system is capable of obstacle avoidance, grasp rendezvous, incorporation of new sensor data, remembering results of previous tasks, and so on (Author) A70-25240* Ultraclean technology L B Hall (NASA, Washington, DC) Science Journal, vol 6, Apr 1970, p 41-46 7 refs Survey of the current state of development of ultraclean technology which eliminates traces of pollution that are normally present even in ordinary clean rooms The development of ultraclean rooms is followed from the initial turbulent flow rooms, through the later used horizontal laminar (crossflow) room, and finally to the recent vertical laminar (downflow) rooms Costs of ultraclean operations are analyzed, and different types of facilities are examined in terms of contamination levels T M A70-25306 Analog investigation of the process and the influencing factors of periodical skin temperature variations at the finger tips (Etude analogique du mecamsme et des facteurs 12,Oct 1969, p 313-338 25 refs In French The temperature of the human skin at finger tips undergoes periodical variations, the average values of the period and amplitude of these variations are respectively 1 mm and 1 deg C The author, who has described this observation in an earlier work, investigates in this paper the process and leading factors of these variations by means of infrared thermometry He shows first that the origin of these oscillations are the periodical variations of nerve-impulse frequency in vasoconstrictor orthosympathetic fibers Then, from various physio-pathological observations and with the help of a model consisting of a transistorized relaxation oscillator, he analyses the behavior and effects of the different factors blood flow, blood 61A70-25307 temperature, the vasodilatator and vasoconstrictor agents, age of the subject and the surrounding temperature Finally, a cybernetic model is proposed, which brings to evidence two important phenomena on the one hand, the existence of a negative feedback making spontaneous oscillations possible on the other hand, an influence of the ambient temperature on the feedback loop, which makes the system similar to a servomechamsm contributing to the thermal regulation in fingers between 6 5 deg C and 36 deg C (Author) A70 (Thermographe tmnica,\\io\\ 12, Oct 1969, p 339-351 In French Description of an improved medical thermograph with modified characteristics of the image pick-up device
