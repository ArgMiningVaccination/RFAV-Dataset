However, once a third mass is added to the system (such as that of the Moon or of a co -orbital Lunar Trojan), the equations of motion of the N -body problem become analytically unsolvable. Fortunately, approximations using numerical integration schemes introduce an opportunity to map the trajectory of the masses at each defined time interval. Whether a symplectic, non- symplectic, or hybrid integration architecture is used depends on the dynamical structure of the system. We are particularly interested in the equilibrium solutions of the Earth- Moon -Sun System at Lagrangian points L4 and L5, as these regions, which lie co-orbital with the Moon, could be potential hosts to Lunar Trojans. In this work, we investigate the capture probabilities of Near -Earth Objects (NEOs) using a source population of 802,376 NEOs from realistic orbit and source -specific absolute magnitude distributions derived by Granvik et al 2018. Using IAS15, a non- symplectic high-order algorithm within the N -body integration package REBOUND, we perform various collections of integrations on the orbits of the synthetic population and extract both the probabilities of transformation from NEO to Trojan, as well as gain insight on the mean lifetime of NEOs as a function of their escape route. Previous studies show that objects that move in tadpole orbits about the triangular equilibrium points tend to remain in these stable orbital configurations for millions of years. Therefore, since NEOs act as invaluable dynamical and compositional tracers of both various places and time periods within the planetary system, we hope to better comprehend the origins of the system's dynamical history by quantifying the rate of NEO capture within Earth's sphere of influence. Deep Mutational Scanning to Characterise Differences in Binding Epitopes of IgG1 and IgG2 Antibodies Elicited by Vaccination Yusuf Adia Mentors: Pamela J. Bjorkman and Alexander A. Cohen Vaccine efficacy is limited by viral evolution and the bias of the immune response upon reinfection towards its memory. Therefore, newer SARS -CoV-2 variants, such as Omicron, aren't as affected by vaccination as older variants. Immunisation with a nanoparticle presenting diverse SARS -like viral antigens (\"Mosaic -8b\") generates broader neutralising antibodies compared to single antigen display (\"Homotypic SARS -2\"), and so is a promising development in vaccine design. We performed Deep Mutational Scanning to study binding differences of IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies after vaccination. Antibodies target the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral antigen, which mediates entry into host cells. By generating a library of yeast cells, each expressing a mutant RBD, one can identify which mutants \"escape\" antibody binding, thereby identifying the epitope for the antibody. IgG1 and IgG2a binding appears to be protocol dependent. Following Mosaic -8b immunisation, I gG1 binds to conserved aspects of the antigen while IgG2a is less broad, binding to epitopes known to exhibit antigenic variability. Conversely, IgG2a binding following Homotypic SARS -2 immunisation targets conserved parts of the antigen, while IgG1 appear s less broad compared to those elicited following Mosaic -8b immunisation. Exploiting nuances in antibody binding may prove an effective mechanism for directing host immune responses. Characterization of Thin- Film BaTiO 3 Using Surface Acoustic Waves Nuha Akhtar Mentors: Mohammad Mirhosseini and Hao Tian With the ability to be confined close to the surface, coherently excited and detected with microwave electronics, stored in compact high- quality resonators, and have their properties engineered by choice of material, Surface Acoustic Waves (SAWs) have become the ideal candidate for studying quantum behavior of macroscopic objects. Using piezoelectric materials, which have a unique property of electromechanical coupling, acoustic devices can be used in the quantum regime. Since functionality of a piezoelectric crystal is based on its physical parameters, this property -dependent performance acts as motivation in the search to find materials that will accomplish the task of sensing and actuating SAWs. Having many excellent physical properties, Barium Titanate (BTO) has become the piezoelectric crystal of interest in this lab. With a limited amount of thin- film nanofabrication and analysis of material properties reported, we aim to establish a parameter space that maximizes the effect of BTO's piezoelectric response through finite element analysis and material characterization. In the future, this information will allow for the fabrication of a successful SAW device that can be used to characterize BTO for a variety of quantum applications at the cryogenic level. Spin-lattice Relaxation Mechanisms in Nitroxide Free Radicals Kevin Alexander Mentors: Ryan Hadt, Nathanael Kazmierczak, and Katie Luedecke Spin- lattice (T 1) relaxation constitutes a key limiting factor for scaling up room temperature qubit devices. To better understand the mechanisms leading to T1 relaxation in molecular qubits, we studied the dependence of T1 relaxation on molecular orientation in nitroxide free radicals, a widely used class of paramagnetic spin labels. Our experimental techniques included continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), pulsed and Raman spectroscopy. On the theoretical side, we used quantum chemical calculations to obtain additional information such as spin- phonon coupling coefficients and vibrational frequencies. Taking our experiment and theory together we have ruled out a g -tensor driven T1 anisotropy in nitroxides and have made progress in constructing a model for T1 relaxation that is dependent on hyperfine anisotropy. Propagation and Effects Sterl Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond duration bursts of radio emission that originate from far outside our Milky Way galaxy. While the origin of FRB's is still uncertain, the most widely considered models involve m agnetars. Repeating FRBs tend to have unique phenomena not seen in non- repeating FRBs, such as high amounts of circular polarization, oscillating fractional polarization, and oscillating polarization angle. This can give us an indication into what the surrounding magneto -ionic environment around the FRB looks like. This project aims to identify bursts with significant circular polarization and analyze the distinct phenomena that occur due to this. To help identify the origins of FRB we look at their properties such as their burst polarization, spectrum, dispersion measure, and rotation measure. For this, we graphed 1,062 bursts from FRB20201124A highlighting their Linear and Circular Polarization, their Polarization Angle, and their Fractional Polarization. Bursts with similar occurring events were separated into different subgroups to discuss the required magneto -environment for those events to occur. Finally, we looked into correlations between the various phenomena to better understand what is the nature o f the FRB's immediate environment. Investigating Greenwashing in Energy Industry Communications Using Natural Language Processing Jena Alsup Mentors: R. Michael Alvarez and Danny Ebanks The propagation of misinformation related to climate change through corporate rhetoric constitutes a pressing issue that demands further exploration. Greenwashing involves intentionally misleading consumers about a corporation's own environmental practices , often to appear more eco -friendly or socially responsible than the company actually is. However, there is yet to exist a quantifiable definition of what specifically constitutes greenwashing. We leverage a diverse array of media such as SEC filings, corporate sustainability reports, and tweets from the 15 most influential energy and renewable energy companies. We analyze this cross -sectional time series text data using structural topic modeling \u2014 a modern natural language processing technique based on unsupervised learning \u2014 that tests language distances between renewable energy companies and oil companies. This ultimately allows us to investigate the role of rhetoric in shaping public opinion on climate change. Realizing Photonic Integrated Circuits on T hin Film Mentors: Alireza Marandi and on thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) has been a promising all -optical solution for low - cost and energy -efficient communication, sensing, and comp uting. Due to its strong nonlinearity, TFLN has emerged as a promising foundation for modern systems including photonic computing. However, all computers require a combination of linear and nonlinear operations. While these elements have been demonstrated individually on TFLN, they have yet to be combined on the same chip to implement a full computer. To do so requires further optimization of both components to make them compatible with each other. One vital component of the circuits is optical couplers. This project optimized several types of couplers and performed fabrication sensitivity tests on them. These were done by using commercial software, then the results were verified by using different simulation methods, including MODE, EME, and FDTD. The real devices were then fabricated, and the results were measured. Uncovering Structure in Vision- of multimodal learning rises, vision- language models like CLIP gain wider adoption. CLIP demonstrates remarkable transferability to various computer vision tasks, showing competitive performance even on novel datasets. However, the structure of the model's embeddings remains largely unknown, particularly in terms of how latent representations capture and organize concepts and semantics within the embedding space. To investigate the naturally emerging structure of CLIP's embeddings, we prop ose a method combining dimensionality reduction, spectral clustering, and latent vector similarity analysis. Using this method, we perform a cross -modal, inter- and intra -class examination of captioned ImageNet images. Our results reveal intuitive by -class grouping and uncover previously unknown hierarchical clustering following the semantic structure of the embedded data, both interclass and intraclass. We also uncover that themed or specialized datasets, like ImageNet object -centric natural images, occupy distinct subspaces within the embedding space. This work introduces a novel method to compare vision- language embeddings across models and provides valuable latent structure mapping for future representation learning techniques. Modeling an d Experimentation of Cement -based Products for Enhanced Carbon Capture Mars Arechavala Mentors: Melany Hunt and Ricardo Hernandez Carbon capture can be performed using granules that absorb the CO emitted from point -sources like industrial plants. These granules can then be regenerated by increasing their temperature, providing reusable sources of carbon capture. Similarly, the reactions that occur during CO2 diffusion into cement -based products can act as large sources for carbon capture. This carbon sequestration can be modeled mathematically based on the environmental conditions and formulation of the cement, which can help understand its role in global carbon uptake. The accuracy of carbon sequestration done by cement is crucial to the understanding of the carbon imbalance caused by humans. This understanding can be applied to the granules which use components of cement like calcium hydroxide that can help with the binding of the granules while improving its CO2 absorption ability. The most promising formula for enhanced CO2 capture ability includes a high proportion of KCO which has high absorption capability and some combination of CaCO to improve granule shape, size distribution, and strength. The focus is to improve this formulation by introducing different binders and pore -formers to increase its regeneration and carbon capture capabilities. Factors Regulating DRP1 Independe nt Valeria Arroyo Mentors: Chakrabarty Mitochondria can change their morphology through the processes of fission and fusion. These processes are known as mitochondrial dynamics. The regulation of mitochondrial fission depends on the recruitment of dynamin- related protein 1 (DRP1). Another essential process of mitochondrial dynamics is mitophagy which is the selective degradation of damaged mitochondria through lysosomes. DRP1 is also involved in mitochondrial fission during mitophagy. This protein divides mitochondria which allow autophagosomes to engulf and degrade them. However, recent experimental results suggest that mitophagy can still occur in the absence of DRP1. Yet, the other factors involved in mitochondrial fission during DRP1 -independent mitophagy are not known. Therefore, the focus o f our study is to identify DRP1 -independent mitochondrial fission factors involved in mitophagy. In order to approach our question, we are conducting a dual sgRNA -based whole -genome CRISPRi screen where the library consists of constructs containing two sgRNA cloning slots. One slot contains a sgRNA targeting DRP1 and the other slot is used to input an sgRNA library targeting the whole human genome. It is important to understand mitochondrial dynamics since disruption in these processes has been linked with human diseases. Examining Trends Between Supermassive Black Hole Growth and Star Formation in IllustrisTNG Cosmological Simulation Diana Citlali Piotrowska Black Holes (SBH) surrounded by discs of accreting matter, known as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), have long been suggested as the primary cause for preventing star formation within galaxies. However, due to the variable nature of the AGN and long timescales associated with galactic star formation, the exact nature of long - term black hole impact on host galaxies still remains an open question in the field of galaxy evolution. We address this problem by investigating potential connections between SMBH accretion histories and the present -day star formation state of their host galaxies in IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation. We divide galaxies into two categories based on their star formation activity and analyze statistical properties of their SMB H populations.We also characterize individual growth histories of black holes, searching for statistically significant relationships between time-resolved accretion and star formation in large galaxy samples. By combining conventional analysis techniques with machine learning algorithms, we aim to learn how time -dependent energy deposition from the AGN into its surrounding galaxy bears influence on star formation activity, hence shedding new light on the role of supermassive black holes in galaxy evolution. Connectomics Approach Predicts Muscle Activity in Drosophila Flight Deven Ayambem Mentors: Michael Dickinson and Ivo Ros During locomotion, the brain transforms sensory and internally generated information into a cohesive set of commands that generate motor output.The architectural logic of connections between networks of neurons in the brain and motor neurons that drive behaviors is an important step in understanding fundamental principles that underlie the actions we humans perform on a day -to-day basis. Using an animal model system such as the fruit fly allows for rigorous study of stereotyped behaviors. For example, when searching their environment, flying flies execute a series of straight flight segments interspersed with rapid turns called flight saccades(Collet and Land, 1975). This work will expand on a Dickinson lab discovery of a sparse network consisting of four d escending command neurons that generates these flight saccades. The network consists of two, mirror -symmetric couplets, one for right turns and one for left turns, each containing one excitatory neuron (DNa0X) and one inhibitory (DNb01) that project to the ventral nerve cord. My project maps the downstream connectivity of these descending neurons and predicts how these DNs engage the sparse set of the flies' 12 pairs of steering muscles to saccade. I am developing a principled and robust connectivity analysis to predict functional activation of steering muscles during flight saccades. The overall goal is to develop an analysis framework to characterize the functional organization of premotor circuits that transform descending control commands into concerted movement. Development of Molecular Qubit Systems for Quantum Information Science Miriam Aziz Mentors: Theodor Fernando Guerrero, and Matthew Espinosa Two-level quantum systems (qubits) have emerged on the frontier of quantum information science (QIS) research. Relative to classical components, these qubits offer a substantial increase in information storage capacity and processing speed. Rare- earth meta ls hold promise as light -matter interfaces, facilitating coherence transfer to nearby nuclei. For example, optically addressable lanthanides with narrow optical linewidths have recently been reported. We aim to adjust the described ligand scaffold by known synthetic methods to investigate the impact of nuclear spin, distance, and chemical environment on coherence transfer. Here, we work toward conducting a synthesis of multimetallic macrocycles of graphene -fixed aromatic hydrocarbons doped with nitrogen. We develop methods to generate a high- solubility mesityl- based ligand by tuning existing phenyl -based syntheses. Additionally, we perform the modular synthesis of alternating oligomers, an essential step in generating a multi -nucleating ligand. Ongoing resea rch to grow these systems involves deliberately and systematically harnessing control over the terminating ends of the compounds. This research sheds light on the interactions within these quantum systems and further advances the field of quantum information science. Investigation, Modeling, and Control of Quantum Optoelectronic Circuits and Systems Pablo Backer -Peral Mentors: Ali Hajimiri and Volkan Gurses Optoelectronic circuits leverage the advantages of both photonics and electronics to enhance the pe rformance of sensing, communications, and computing systems. Quantum photonics is an emerging field that leverages the quantum mechanical nature of light to create systems beyond the limit of classical photonics. Quantum optoelectronic circuits expand the scope of quantum photonics by enabling a holistic integration of quantum photonic and electronic functions, offloading some of the functional requirements from optical circuits to radio - frequency circuits. To this end, this project aims to develop quantum optoelectronic circuits and their control systems to demonstrate novel functionalities and improved performance. Some of the contributions of this work will be, but are not limited to, building prototype and printed circuit boards for quantum optoelectronic circuits, developing scripts to automate the readout and control of the experiments, and programming FPGAs for real- time processing of measured quantum signals. Electrochemical and Thermochemical Testing of Cobalt and Copper Oxides is an industrially relevant reaction performed at a scale of 10 million tons/year. It is a reaction where olefins are coupled with high pressure carbon monoxide and hydrogen, in the presence of a catalyst at high temperatures to form aldehydes. Electrifying thermo -HFN (electro -HFN) to use protons and electrons instead of hydrogen gas could mitigate the need for elevated temperature and pressure and the use of H 2 gas as a reactant. Zeng and coworkers proved that electro -HFN is possible using a rhodium catalyst. However, rhodium is rare and expensive, therefore finding catalysts that are more abundant is necessary for making electro - HFN sustainable. Cobalt and copper could be good candidates as they are more abundant and cobalt has literature thermo -HFN precedent while copper catalyzes C -C bond forming reactions. Several Cu and Co were i.e., Cu, the oxides were commercially available except Cu2O/C, it was synthesized and characterized by X -ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and energy - dispersive X -ray spectroscopy. The Cu and Co materials were screened for reactivity by constant current experiments at - 500 \u00b5A for 2 hours, none showed reactivity. Future work should focus on making other rhodium nanoparticles on graphene and phosphorus -based supports. Developing FISH Microscopy Techniques in Methanosarcina t o Visualize Methanotrophic Archaeal Diversity Stella Baldwin Mentors: Victoria Orphan and Daniel Utter The factors controlling microbial diversification remain relatively unknown, particularly in harsh deep sea environments. Anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) pair symbiotically the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) and biologically productive processes. ANME- 2b dominate methane seep sediments off Southern Californian coasts. The Orphan Lab identified three ANME- 2b groups (gI, gII, and gIII) and hypothesized that only gII and gIII contain nifH, a gene that encodes an essential nitrogen fixation protein. However, experimental validation of this hypothesis has proven difficult. Here, we developed fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) techniques to help resolve ANME- 2b lineages. Genome -directed FISH o ffers extreme specificity but low signal, so we chose signal amplification methods like hybridization chain reaction FISH (HCR - FISH). We improved HCR -FISH probe contrast by testing complex samples under different experimental conditions (i.e., temperature). HCR -FISH probe validation requires known positive/negative targets, so we also conducted microscopy in the model archaeon Methanosarcina . Once refined, genomic HCR -FISH could illuminate the intraspecific ecology and evolution of many microbial systems. Using Webcam -based Eye Tracking Technology to Probe Atypical Gaze Behavior in Autism Ava Barbano Mentors: Ralph Adolphs, Na Yeon Kim, and Qianying Wu Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is commonly associated with social and communicative difficulties. The complex and heterogeneous nature of ASD symptoms has placed challenges in establishing an objective and quantifiable behavioral marker that provides a foundation for further research on the genetic and biological basis. Eye tracking has revealed atypical gaze patterns in ASD; however, conventional desktop -based eye trackers require specialized equipment and in- lab testing. This study instead utilizes Webgazer, a webcam -based eye tracking technology, to study gaze behavior in a large -scale subject population recruited from Prolific, an online study platform. The pilot implementation of this study (N = 96) featured ASD and non- ASD groups viewing naturalistic Zoom conversations featuring human actors and physical objects. All participants completed Autism Quotient and Social Responsiveness Score questionnaires, as measures of autistic traits. Preliminary analysis of the pilot data will be used to inform the final experimental design and implementation of the study, with a focus on the comparison of gaze data, self -reported engagement,demographic information, and questionnaire reports between the ASD and non- ASD groups. Improving the Symmetric Group Construction in the Group- Theoretic Approach to Fast Matrix Multiplication Thom as Baxley Mentor: Christopher Umans The Cohn and Umans paper \"A Group -theoretic Approach to Fast Matrix Multiplication\" describes an algebraic and representation- theoretic approach to the matrix multiplication problem. The method reduces the matrix multiplication problem to a problem involving a group G and 3 subsets X,Y,Z which satisfy the triple product property . The paper also introduces a construction in the symmetric group, the improvement of which is the focus of this investigation. This project explores the required properties of g G that are not in subgroups X, Y, or Z, such that adding g to one of the subgroups results in a collection of sets that still satisfy the triple product property. We go on to investigate the properties of a set S of elements not in X,Y,Z satisfying those same requirements. We identify a family of elements in the symmetric group that satisfies this property, thus showing that the construction can be improved. Studying the Effects of CB5339 as a p97 Pathway Inhibitor on Proteins in Foong The p97 gene regulates the ubiquitin pathway, which is responsible for the degradation of waste products and proteins in the cell. This gene pathway is regulated differently in younger cell cultures compared to older cell cultures. In older cells, p97 and the ubiquitin pathway are not expressed as frequently as in younger cells, leading to a buildup of waste products that are harmful to the cell and ultimately leads to apoptosis and cell death. In this project, we determined how the inhibition of p97 with the reagent CB5339 affected the proteins in the p97 pathway in both younger and older generations of the cell line IMR90, a fibroblast cell line, to determine their effects on the aging process. This allowed us to gain a better understanding of the role of p97 in fibroblast aging, and specifically how its inhibition can be used to limit aging in cells. This knowledge can then potentially be used to combat neurological disorders by reprogramming the fibroblast cells into neurons, allowing us to further study potential ways to inhibit rapid aging in brain cells and treat conditions such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. Effect of Bathymetry on the Dynamics of Southern Ocean Subpolar Gyres Emma Beniston Mentors: Andrew Thompson, Scott Conn, and Ruth Moorman The subpolar gyres of the Southern Ocean are large cyclonic ocean circulations which lie between the Antarctic Circumpolar Cur rent (ACC) and the Antarctic coastline. The subpolar gyres are important circulation features playing a role in the transport of heat, sea -ice and carbon within the region. Understanding the governing dynamics of the subpolar gyres is thus crucial to devel oping a comprehensive understanding of the Southern Ocean and its interaction with the global climate. Though gyres in general are well -studied features of the global ocean, traditional theories rely on gyres being bound by continents on both their eastern and western edges. By contrast, the Weddell and Ross gyres of the subpolar Southern Ocean have no eastern land boundaries and have either partially or fully submerged western and northern boundaries. To investigate the governing dynamics in these nonstand ard geometries, we carried out a series of numerical simulations with idealised bathymetry (seafloor depth) constructed to represent the Weddell and Ross gyres. We assess how changes to the bathymetry affect the shape, strength, and extent of the gyres, pa rticularly where the eastern limb of the gyre separates from the ridge and the ACC. We also analyse how a vorticity balance is achieved in each configuration. Correcting Phonon and Quasiparticle Dynamics in Geant4 Simulation of Kinetic Mentors: Sunil Golwala and Karthik Ramanathan Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) can be used to detect low -mass dark matter candidates. When dark matter interacts with KIDs, it creates a pulse of phonons and quasiparticle s, the latter of which can be used to characterize the energy of the dark matter. However, the physics behind phonon propagation and interaction with quasiparticles is not well understood. To gain more insight into these interactions, we modify a previous Geant4 (GEometry ANd Tracking) simulation created by a previous lab member (Erik Lindeman) and compare it to experimental data of a lab wafer of KIDs. We analyze the phonon and quasiparticle physics separately, modifying different parameters affecting prop agation to see if they help the simulated pulse shapes have more similar rise and decay features to the experimental pulses. Parameters such as total internal reflection and absorption parameter were both found to affect quasiparticle decay time; however, more work needs to be done to change the relative rate of decays for KIDs at different distances from the detectors. Understanding what other parameters affect phonon and quasiparticle creation and decay can help aid the development of more sensitive detec tors. Modeling Non -terminal Cloud Droplets in PySDM Brady Bhalla Mentors: Tapio Schneider and Emily de Jong Cloud microphysics, which describes the interaction of microscopic particles in the atmosphere such as water droplets, ice crystals, and aerosol particles, is a major source of uncertainty in current climate models. One simplification made when modeling mi crophysics is treating all droplets as moving at their terminal velocity. However, this is not always true, especially when there is a high frequency of collisions. Immediately after two droplets coalesce, the resulting droplet will be moving slower than i ts terminal velocity, and immediately after a droplet breaks into smaller droplets, the resulting droplets will be moving faster than their terminal velocities. This work explores the importance of non -terminal droplets through a pythonic implementation of the super -droplet method, PySDM, which is a high- fidelity tool for modeling cloud microphysics. We create a new dynamic which allows droplet velocity to relax towards the terminal velocity instead of instantly updating. Simulations using this non-terminal velocity in the context of coalescence and droplet breakup are used to explore the importance of non- terminal droplets, which improves our understanding of microphysics and furthers the goal of reducing uncertainty in climate modeling. Investigating the Migration of p97 Into the Nucleus in K562 Cells Due to Treatment With H 2O2 Berglind Bjarnad\u00f3ttir Mentors: Tsui -Fen Chou and Vivian Lai VCP/p97 protein is an ATPase protein that is involved in various cellular processes, including protein degradation and D NA damage repair. Many mutations in p97 have been linked to several diseases, including cancer. We observed that p97 is more abundant in the nucleus of K562 leukemia cells treated with H 2O2 than in untreated leukemia cells. However, it is unknown why it is more abundant or how it migrates into the nucleus. Therefore, we have tried to gain a better understanding of this by doing an immunoprecipitation for p97 with treated and untreated K562 cells and sent the result from that for further analysis using mass spectrometry. We are analyzing the data from the mass spectrometry looking for proteins that are upregulated in H 2O2 treated cells and could be involved in transporting p97 into the nucleus. We are also currently checking one another cell line to see if the same increase of p97 happens in the nucleus under H 2O2 treatment. Solubility of Water in Sodium Aluminosilicate and Calcium Aluminosilicate Melts Ambre Brabant Mentors: Ed Stolper and Mike Baker Water dissolves in silicate melt as OH and H 2O and has an enormous impact on the melt's physical and chemical properties. At low pressure, OH is the dominant species. However, the compositional dependence of OH solubility is not well- constrained, making it difficult to accurately model low -pressure m agmatic degassing. We measured the 1-atm solubility of water at 1300 \u00b0C in melt compositions in the Na 2O-Al2O3-SiO 2 (NAS) and CaO -Al2O3-SiO 2 (CAS) systems. Melts were equilibrated with CO 2-H2O gas mixtures in a 1 -atm furnace (pH 2O=0.298- 0.314atm) and quenc hed after 24 -64h. Glass compositions were determined using a scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer. Water contents were measured using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. The NAS glasses contained 800 -1400ppm wat er, with water contents correlated with Na loss from the different experiments. The CAS system has been less well -studied; time -series experiments show that water contents reach an approximately constant value after 24h. Subsequent experiments will involve three modified CAS compositions. These data combined with 1 -atm solubility data from the glass literature will be used to investigate simple models of water solubility as a function of melt composition in conditions where OH is the dominant water species. Structural Analysis of MurG Interactions With Substrates, Inhibitors, and MraY Helen Brackney Mentor: William Clemons Jr. The peptidoglycan layer in bacterial cells is a popular target for antibiotic development. The membrane protein MraY and peripheral membrane protein MurG are part of critical steps in the synthesis of peptidoglycan. Lipid I, a lipid substrate formed by Mra Y, is thought to be recognized by MurG through its soluble domain. Currently, there is no structure of MurG with bound lipid substrate, and the residues required for this interaction have not been conclusively defined. Crystallographic methods and Cryogenic Electron Microscopy were applied to study the interactions between MurG and the soluble domain of Lipid I through the substrate mimic Park's Nucleotide, Lipid II, and a Lipid I analog and to study the interactions of MurG and MraY with the aforementioned substrates. By adding Park's Nucleotide, Murgocil, Lipid II, the Lipid I analog, or a combination of the listed additives to concentrated MurG, crystals formed under optimized conditions. We aim to obtain electron- density maps from these techniques to model the structure of MurG. Characterization and Design of a Mach- Zehnder Setup for Quantum Frequency Conversion of Ion -Trap Photons to Telecom Wavelengths Michael Bregar Mentors: Maria Spiropulu, Umesh, and Raju Valivarthi The development of light -matter quantum networks for applications such as entanglement distribution is a thriving area of research that could enable quantum technologies to transmit information over long distances, probe fundamental physics, and simulate physical phenomena. In a quantum network envisioned by the Spiropulu Group, two ion trap nodes (Ca+), one at LBNL and the other at UCB, emit photons at 854 nm that must travel 10 km between nodes. To achieve low loss transmission, the frequencies of these t wo photons need to be converted to the optimal value of 1550 nm while also converting both h and v polarizations. The goal of this project was to characterize, design, and test various components in a Mach -Zehnder quantum frequency conversion (QFC) setup to find the most efficient configuration that can be used for quantum communication. A Python feedback system was designed on a separate homodyne detection setup using an NI -DAQ device and two balanced homodyne detectors to stabilize the output quadratures, which was later used to stabilize the Mach- Zehnder QFC setup. Subsequent work involves performing sum frequency generation using a 1902 nm pump laser and a 1550 nm tunable telecom laser to characterize PPLN waveguides to be used for QFC. Studying Intrace llular Autism and Alzheimer's elegans Mentors: Das The pathways underlying neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and Alzheimer's remain poorly understood. To gain insights into the intracellular mechanisms associated with these disorders, it is crucial to consider the interactions of protein mutations involved in cellular activities, such as the ubiquitin- proteasome degradation pathway. One mutation of interest in this context is in ufd -3, a protein in Caenorhabditis elegans that has been implicated in sensory function. The mating proces ses of C. elegans are a valuable model for studying the impact of the ufd -3 mutation on sensory function, as worms predominantly rely on olfactory and sensory signals during mating. Utilizing behavioral assays and fluorescent imaging analysis, this project aims to understand the implications of the ufd -3 mutation on mating -related behaviors and the protein trafficking and degradation processes. Results indicate impaired sensory function and impaired sperm function during mating in these ufd -3 mutants. These results contribute to our understanding of the protein degradation processes and intracellular mechanisms underlying these neurodevelopmental disorders in humans. Neural ODE -based Modeling and Control of Dynamical Systems for Robotic Planning Jessica Br own Mentors: Yisong Yue and Ivan Jimenez For effective motion control in robotic platforms, accurately modeling and predicting dynamics is essential. In this project, we employ Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) using the JAX library in Python to establish a pipeline for modeling the parameters, dynamics, and control of dynamical systems. This setup is generalizable to various dynamical systems due to its modular design. In utilizing JAX, our pipeline facilitates the efficient execution o f parallelized experiments on GPUs. Central to our investigation is the development and comparison of control strategies, specifically Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Proportional -Integral -Derivative (PID) controllers. This endeavor is part of a larger initiative aimed at advancing long -term robotic planning. A significant challenge in this field lies in the balance between rapid responsiveness and precision in control. Through our dynamical systems modeling approach, we aim to provide techniques to achi eve robotic planners adept in both speed and precision. Chemoenzymatic Functionalization of Quinolines With Carbene Quinoline, a sp 2-rich heteroaromatic, has gained significant recognition in the medicinal chemistry community because of its presence in numerous pharmacologically active substances, presenting a broad range of biological activities. Notably, the molecule's lack of unsaturated, chiral centers indicate potentially unexplored chemical space within its scaffold. Given precedent in the Arnold group, we posited that reduction and carbene transfer could significantly increase quinoline's sp3 centers. Here a heme- protoglobin (ApPgb), on products derived from quinoline reduction. This cyclopropanation occurs with significant chemo - and diastereoselectivity. Additionally, it is expected that the enzyme's ch emo-, diastereo -, and enantioselectivity can be refined with directed evolution. These findings further elucidate the new -to-nature chemistry for heme enzymes and could lead to the discovery of new molecules with promising biological activity. Epitaxial G rowth of Rare -earth Antimonide Thin Films Flat Llanos Lanthanum diantimonide (LaSb 2) is a square net metallic compound that possesses fascinating electronic transport properties in bulk. It has been observed to exhibit superconductivity at temperatures below 2K and linear magnetoresistance in magnetic fields as high as 45 T. Using Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE), a technique for growing single crystal thin films by evapora ting elemental source materials onto a crystalline substrate, we can synthesize and probe for these phenomena in thin film LaSb 2. We prepared and grew on different substrates with different crystal structures and surface reconstructions to study how the ep itaxial relationship between the film and the substrate affects the crystallinity and electronic properties of thin film LaSb 2. This investigation sought to tune the electronic properties by modifying the crystal structure using the substrate. We have succ essfully prepared atomically flat Sapphire (0001) in the 31 \u00d7 31 surface reconstruction, Sapphire (11 -20), and Magnesium Oxide (001) and have grown films on each of these substrates. By growing on MgO, we have suppressed a previously observed structural transition and stabilized the superconducting ground state. Error Cancellation in Analog Quantum Simulations Yiyi Cai Mentors: John Preskill and Yu Tong While fully fault -tolerant quantum computers are still work in progress, analog quantum simulators are projected to be able to solve relevant problems in many -body physics in the near term. However, the presence of noise introduces challenges in determining the extent of analog quantum simulator's advantages with respect to classical computers. In our work, we consider an error model in which the actual Hamiltonian differs from the target Hamiltonian to simulate by small local perturbations, which are assum ed to be random and unbiased. We analyze the error accumulated in observables in such a setting and show that due to stochastic error cancellation, the error scales with the square root of the number of qubits instead of linear. We explore the concentratio n of such error as well as its implication for local observables in the thermodynamic limit. Spin-labeling Biological Membranes to Probe Interfacial Phenomena John Cao Mentors: Ryan Hadt and Christian Totoiu Molecular quantum sensing seeks to leverage the unique phenomenon of quantum coherence to quantify biological properties that are difficult to access through optical methods. Paramagnetic molecules are particularly desirable as probes for this purpose, owing to their addressability by electron param agnetic resonance (EPR)\u2014a spectroscopic technique used to study unpaired -electron systems and capable of measuring quantum decoherence times. Understanding the behavior of coherence and decoherence in complex biological systems is essential for further developments in quantum information science, especially quantum sensing. Although lipid membranes have been subject to previous EPR studies, there exists an opportunity to investigate quantum coherences in such biologically relevant microenvironments. To addr ess this, we incorporated a chemically -inert nitroxide -based paramagnetic spin label into simple self -assembling micellar structures to track changes in decoherence times in response to systematic chemical perturbations. We observed tunability of morpholog ical properties for sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), Tween 20, and Triton X -100 surfactant micelles using dynamic light (cryo -EM), and correlated these properties to quantum decoherence times using EPR. This investigation of the effects of aggregate micellar morphology on decoherence time offers an attractive application of quantum sensing. Joint Reconstruction -Segmentation Using the Bhattacharyya Coefficient John Z. Cao Mentors: Franca Hoffmann and Jeremy Budd The practical application of image segmentation is often accompanied by the problem of noisy, distorted images. Traditional sequential methods suffer from the loss of segmentation- relevant information after reconstruction is performed, while c ontemporary learning -based methods are often hard to explain and do not give an explicit reconstruction of the image. Joint reconstruction- segmentation is a recent approach to overcome these difficulties, performing both tasks at the same time, using one to guide the other. In this project, we implement joint reconstruction- segmentation using the gradient flow stemming from the Bhattacharyya coefficient. Specifically, we model the segmentation as the variational problem of maximizing the distance between tw o probability distributions, one associated with the object to be segmented and the other with the image background. We model the reconstruction as the inverse problem of recovering the image from an indirect observation, under the constraint of respecting the previous segmentation. We test the efficiency of our algorithm on medical images provided by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Mechanical Modes in Tethered and Freely Accelerated Lightsails Luis Carretero L\u00f3pez Mentors: Harry A. Atwater, L ior Michaeli, and Ramon Gao Laser -driven lightsails represent a cornerstone of interstellar exploration as envisioned by the Breakthrough Starshot initiative. Understanding the emergence and evolution of mechanical modes excited by the driving laser in such freely accelerated membranes is crucial to assess structural and beam -riding stability. Vibrational modes offer insights into complex mechanical systems, and can be analyzed in stationary membranes and compared those in accelerated lightsails. Two types of numerical mass -spring models were implemented in MATLAB to simulate and visualize the dynamics and mechanics of ring -supported lightsail membra nes. In the linear model, simulated modes match analytical predictions, but challenges arise due to the lightsail's extreme aspect ratio (subwavelength thick, yet meter -sized) and large optical forces, particularly in the limit of zero tension. In comparis on, the geometrically nonlinear model takes into account pretension, arbitrary orientation and large shape deformations, resulting in more realistic mechanical and dynamical representation of lightsails. Bridging the linear and nonlinear regime with my mod elling approach establishes the framework for comparative modal analysis to deduce what one could infer from experiments on tethered lightsails in the laboratory about the structural dynamics of freely accelerated lightsails in space. Radiative -Convective Equilibrium in the CliMA Model for Climate Sensitivity Analysis Etienne Casanova Mentors: Tapio Schneider, Zhaoyi Shen, and Dennis Yatunin Radiative -convective equilibrium, the balance between incoming radiation absorbed by Earth and the outgoing radiation emitted to space with a convective heat adjustment, can be very insightful when it comes to analyzing the climate's sensitivity to greenho use gases. CliMA has been working on implementing cloud processes inside the atmospheric model, which would allow the convective adjustment of radiative -convective equilibrium to be possible. My project is to implement radiative -convective equilibrium insi de the CliMA atmosphere model codebase in single column models and analyze how changes in greenhouse gas concentrations affect the atmosphere. I did this by prognostically calculating surface temperature at every time step, updating the state of the surfac e model, and feeding that surface temperature back into other components of the model to allow for coupling between surface temperature and atmospheric processes. I then altered the general atmospheric model to support prognostic surface temperature feedba ck in any given simulation. Finally, I conducted simulations with varying greenhouse gas concentrations and analyzed their effect on surface and air temperature. Identifying Fast X -Ray Transients Over 11 Years of NuSTAR data Joahan Castaneda Jaimes Mentors: Fiona Harrison Fast X -ray transients (FXRTs) are astrophysical sources such as gamma ray bursts, stellar flares, and X -ray binaries which emit an outburst of X -ray emission and have characteristic timescales of a few thousand kiloseconds or less. The luminosity -duration phase space for X -ray transients (XRTs) is not as well explored for FXRTs as for XRTs of longer characteristic timescales. We perform a search on the past 11 years of data collected by the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array to identify FXRTs of characteristic timescales ranging from a few hundred seconds to five kiloseconds. We provide an upper bound on the number of potential FXRT candidates within the 11 years of NuSTAR data provided and present a final catalog of FXRT candidates with preliminary light curves, spectra, and image files. Retrieval -Augmented Theorem Proving Kaiyu Yang Formal theorem proving is essential for mathematicians to write complex proofs without error. Automated theorem provers (ATPs) allow us to augment formal theorem proving with a learning -based approach. To the best of our knowledge, all state -of-the-art lar ge language model (LLM) ATPs are closed -source or require unreasonable compute power. Our prior work released an open -source theorem proving dataset and ATP (trained with 120 GPU hours) to allow mathematicians and other community members access to a strong prover. After a successful release, we strengthened the ATP using LLMs trained on code datasets. Preliminary results indicate a potential for significant improvement when switching to specialized LLMs. Creating Superconducting Resonators to Probe Thin -Film Quality Matthew Chalk Mentors: Joseph Falson and Matthew Libersky Falson Lab focuses on using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to grow high quality thin- films. Some of these films, such as those made of Niobium, can be fabricated into superconducting circuits for quantum information and sensing applications. Thin- film attributes undesirable for these fields, such as dielectric loss and two -level systems, can be measured by etching the films into microwave resonators. Varying geometric features of these reso nators provides a method of probing the location and causes of these unwanted effects. In this work, we use thin- films of Niobium on sapphire grown using MBE to create coplanar waveguide resonators. A recipe for photolithography was developed to realize the desired resonator geometry. Subsequently, we probed these resonators at DC and microwave frequencies. Automated measurements were performed in a Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) down to single -digit Kelvin temperatures using lock -in amplifier s for low - frequency measurement and a vector network analyzer for microwave frequencies. The quality factor of the resonator as well as the residual -resistance ratio of the film will be used as guidance for subsequent resonator creation and future thin- film growths. Building an Autonomous Testbed for Motion Planning Algorithms on a Modified RC Car Aditi Chandrashekar Mentors: Soon- Jo Chung, John Lathrop, and Ben Rivi\u00e8re The INDY Autonomous Project is a global competition aimed at advancing autonomous vehicle technology through the design of high speed self -driving race cars. There is significant financial risk in testing planning and control algorithms on real race cars. There is a need for a fully functional autonomous testbed on an RC car. To this end, a Traxxas X -Maxx RC car was modified to carry an NVIDIA Jetson Orin for onboard computing as well as a ZED 2 AI camera for perception, object detection, and odometry. This hardware stack was tested with path planning and control algorithms including the A* algorithm. This testbed will enable the development of more sophisticated motion planning algorithms in the future. Optimizing WIRC+Pol Pipeline and Characterizing Brown Dwarf Circumstellar Disks in the Taurus Molecular Cloud via Near -Infrared Spectropolarimetry Tsung Hsien (William ) Compact disks cannot be spatially resolved with current 8 -m class telescopes but can create a measurable linear polarization at near -infrared wavelengths. WIRC+Pol, a low -resolution, near -infrared field Inf raRed Camera (WIRC) aboard the 200- in Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory, took advantage of this property. We tailored the WIRC+Pol data reduction pipeline to process the J and H band polarimetric data, enabling us to study the structure of the disks, the magnetic field of the brown dwarf, the oblateness of the atmosphere, and the presence of horizontal cloud bands. In particular, we extracted and analyzed the time and wavelength variability of the Stokes I, Q, U, and V to investigate the disk of CHFT -BD-Tau-4 (CT4), a brown dwarf on which two of the strongest superflares ever observed took place. By comparing the CT4 signal to that of IRAS F04366+2555, a nearby T Tauri star, we conclude that CT4 exhibits no time variability and has a consistent linear po larization of 0.63 \u00b1 0.03% in the J - band and 0.54 \u00b1 0.01% in the H -band. Such findings allow us to look for dust scattering via spectral slopes and characterize the interstellar polarization of the Taurus Molecular Cloud via Serkowski's polarization law. Neutralization, Binding Affinity, and Kinetics of Monoclonal Antibodies Elicited From Sarbecovirus Mosaic RBD Nanoparticles Jason Chen Mentors: Stephen Mayo and Adrian Bahn Neutralizing antibodies are key to providing protection from infectious diseases. However, not all antibodies that bind to antigens have neutralizing potential, and the biophysical and biochemical properties that predict neutralization have been incomplete ly described. Previous reports on the effects of kinetics, binding affinity, and epitope have suggested varying levels of importance of each to neutralization. To clarify those effects on neutralization, we have used surface plasmon resonance to determine precise binding kinetics and affinities of two class 4 and class 1/4 neutralizing and non- neutralizing murine monoclonal antibodies against four different results show that M8a -3 and M8a -6 had similar association rate constants, rang ing from 1.10 x 10 4 - 3.16 x 105 M-1s-1 for M8a -3 and 1.50 x 104 - 4.83 x 104 M-1s-1 for M8a -6. In contrast, x 10-5 - 9.15 x 10-3 M-1s-1, which was significantly slower than M8a -6's range from 3.13 x 10-2 - 7.42 x 10-2 M-1s-1. This finding supports previous reports on the mutational escape of SARS -CoV-2 epitopes from neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that slower dissociation kinetics enhance neutralizing ability. These results can inform future design c onsiderations for the prediction and generation of neutralizing antibodies. Dark Current Estimation in SPHEREx Intensity Mapping Shuang -Shuang Chen Mentors: James J. Bock and Ari Cukierman We calibrate the dark current (DC) of SPHEREx, an upcoming all -sky near -infrared survey, through observations. Since the dark current remains fixed to the detectors, by averaging multiple exposures from different pointings, we can reduce the sky signal and estimate the contribution of the dark current. In this project, we simulate observations for various sky components: Extragalactic Background Light (EBL), Diffuse Galactic Light (DGL), DC, zodiacal light, and photon noise. Stacking the exposures of each c omponent and combining them yields DC estimations for each detector array. To enhance the averaging of DGL signal, we impose a criterion of Galactic latitude exceeding 60 degrees to exclude the exposures pointing towards the Galactic plane, and separate the exposures by 3 degrees to ensure non -overlapping. Additionally, we filter out the horizontal stripe patterns in the DGL stacks due to their wavelength dependence. With around 4,000 effective exposures, our DC estimation achieves a robust 98% correlation coefficient with the original DC template. Furthermore, we will subtract the DC estimation from each exposure, and propagate the data to generate mosaics and power spectra for evaluating the effectiveness of the DC estimation. The Mechanism of Skd3's Dual Disaggregase and Foldase Activity Andrew Choe Mentors: Shu- ou Shan and Wren Stiefel Protein aggregation is a major challenge in maintaining proteostasis, and cells have evolved AAA+ chaperones that resolubilize aggregates to protect against this proteostatic stress. In humans, Skd3 is a medically relevant, hexameric AAA+ disaggregase that functions in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Recent work has found that Skd3 also assembles into dodecameric cages that trap disaggregated proteins and promote their proper refolding. In this project, we investigate the substrate trapping mechanism of Skd3's foldase function by engineering a complex formed by the association of Skd3 with the protease ClpP. After designing plasmids and introducing desired mutations, we independently expressed and purified the Skd3 mutant and ClpP. The Skd3 mutant's activity was verified by assessing its ability to refold aggregated luciferase. We then confirmed ClpP function by measuring its digestion of casein in conjunction with an established mutant Hsp104 co -chaperone that we also cloned, expressed, and purified. Having prepared the component proteins, next steps for the project will be verifying Skd3 -ClpP association before running protein digestion assays with the complex. Prote olysis fragments from these experiments will be analyzed using mass spectrometry, and the results will illuminate the mechanism and forces driving Skd3's foldase function. Optimizing Sample Preparation Protocols for Ca Isotope Analysis of Urine Samples Rithika Chunduri Mentors: Francois Tissot and Rosa Grigoryan Calcium is a vital element for many physiological processes in the body. Decreases in bone mass density - for instance, during osteoporosis - are associated with a net loss of calcium from the body via urine and incur an increased fracture risk. To gauge bone health in populations at risk of osteoporosis (e.g., post -menopausal women), bone density is measured via dual -energy X -ray absorption. This technique requires exposure to radiation and a hospital visit, which makes the test less accessible to at -risk individuals. In contrast, measuring calcium isotopes in urine via multi- collector inductively coupled plasma -mass spectrometry (MC -ICP-MS) has shown potential as a novel tool for diagnosing changes in bone mineral balance in conditions such as osteoporosis. However, current methods for calcium isotope analysis of urine are time -consuming and present a major bottleneck in clinical- scale studies. We systematically tested two diffe rent sample preparation protocols to optimize calcium isotope analysis of urine samples. Oven baking in glass test tubes was tested alongside the current sample digestion method, acid attack in PFA beakers. The residues were then purified via ion exchange chromatography to obtain pure calcium. The calcium concentrations and their isotopic ratios were measured using an iCAP ICP- MS and an MC -ICP-MS, respectively. This data will be analyzed, and subsequently, the most efficient sample preparation method will be identified for large scale Ca isotope analysis of urine samples. Thermal Characterization of Silicon Nitride Lightsails Nina Cielica Mentors: Harry Atwater and Ramon Gao The Breakthrough Starshot Initiative envisions accelerating ultrathin lightsails to relativistic speeds with laser radiation pressure. Silicon nitride is a promising candidate material for lightsails, which must exhibit low absorption at the propulsion wavelength and efficient infrared emission for thermal management. We report first s teps towards comprehensive characterization of the thermal properties of suspended subwavelength thick silicon nitride. To measure the temperature distribution of a laser -heated sample, an uncooled infrared thermal camera was set up. Radiometric calibration was needed to convert recorded values to temperature units using a black soot sample with an emissivity of one, heated to temperatures between 25\u00b0C and 100\u00b0C. To determine the emissivity of silicon nitride, infrared ellipsometry measurements were taken at 25\u00b0C, 50\u00b0C and 100\u00b0C. In this range, silicon nitride's emissivity appears to be independent of temperature. To model laser -induced heating and design photonic structures for enhanced thermal cooling, finite -element simulations were carried out in COMSOL. The proposed structures will be fabricated and experimentally characterized in the home -built setup to compare both unpatterned and patterned laser -heated silicon nitride membranes in terms of their thermal performance and thus suitability for laser-driven lightsails. Measurements of a Quantum Spin Glass Tommy Clark Mentors: Tom Rosenbaum and Dan Silevitch We investigate the Ising spin glass LiHo 0.167 Y0.833 F4 in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. By cooling to millikelvin temperatures in a helium dilution refrigerator, we can observe quantum effects related to the spin glass phase and its quantum phase transition. By manipulating temperature and longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields we observe complex phenomena related to the behavior of a spin glass. Of particular interest are memory effects whereby the spin glass, after a short- time perturbation, appears to remember its prior state. Furthermore, we measure the distribution of states to study tunneling effects in the system and the predicted square -root relaxation of the magnetization for short times. The goal is to uncover \"hole -digging\" effects where quantum tunneling can be seen to cut holes in the probability distribution at an associated resonance. Through measurements of the spin glass, we gain a deeper understanding of its free energy landscape and the comparison of classical and quantum transits through the free energy surface. Exploring Ca lcium Isotopes Ratios in Urine as a Tracer of Bone Health Dylan Cleveland Mentors: Francois Tissot, Rosa Grigoryan, and Michael Kipp Bone formation favours the incorporation of lighter calcium isotopes over heavier ones, leading to isotopic fractionation. If bone resorption exceeds growth, the isotope composition in bodily fluids shifts to be lighter, which is reflected in the isotopic ratio of urine. This project aims to analyse the calcium isotope ratio ( 44Ca/42Ca) in human urine to explore its potential for bone disease diagnosis. Low pressure chromatography is used to isolate the calcium, and the isotope ratio measurements carried out via MC -ICP-MS. The data generated over summer will allow a preliminary quantitative analysis of population- scale calcium isotope variability across various parameters of interest, including age, sex, diet, and lifestyle. This will give a significant indication of the efficacy of isotope ratios as a diagnostic tool, and guide future project work. Probing Thin -Shell Structure Stability: Efficacy of the 3 -D Printing Approach to Optimize Design Parameters Sage Cooley Mentors: Sergio Pellegrino and Meital Carmi Longerons are thin- shell structures found in the Caltech Space Solar Power Project deployable architecture. They derive the majority of their stiffness from geometry rather than mass; however, thin shells buckle unpredictably. Thin-shell stability analysis has recently advanced to include an energy landscape approach which can be used to identify resilient longeron geometric configurations under pure bending. Finding a more stable geometry is important for longerons because the composite material configuration has been shown to have highly unstable behavior. Efforts to uniformly 3 -D print thermoplastic (PLA, PET -G, RGD 525) longerons reveal the potential for additive manufacturing to produce uniform, strong, and flexible thin shells appropriate for probing experiments. Initial bending and probing tests show the ability for 3 -D printing samples to accelerate geometry optimization through iterative changes in the cross -section and comparison between energetic quantities. Enhancing Millimeter -Wave Kinetic Inductance Detector Camera Observations Through Statistical Processing Sage S. Crystian Mentor: Jack Sayers This research focuses on the application of advanced statistical processes to improve the observation capabilities of a long -range telescope located at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The crux of the study involves the utilization of techniques like outlier rejection, data normalization, Gaussian fits, KS tests, and density clustering methodologies such as DBSCAN to precisely distinguish between noise and signal in the observation data. This project explores how this strategy is likely to enhance the filtering process by ensuring valuable signal data is not discarded as noise. One proposed method was an iterative approach, cycling through the observed map to efficiently identify and distinguish the signal from the noise. We also delve into the potential role of time -ordered data in this context and how an analysis of its effects can improve observations. Initial results demonstrate our ability to successfully separate signal from noise, suggesting promising implications for the overall observation accuracy of the telescope. These findings have substantial significance in the realm of long-range imaging, particularly pertinent to millimeter -wave kinetic inductance detector cameras designed for imaging through optical obscurants. This work aims to contribute valuable knowledge to our scientific community, enabling better understanding and utilization of long -range telescopes for more accurate and efficient long -range, terrestrial observations in the future. Exploring a Range of Sound Frequencies to Create Mucus Flow in the tube dysfunction arises from persistent obstruction within the tube due to the accumulation of fluid, mucus, and inflammation, leading to chronic discomfort. This study aims to investigate the potential for dislodging mucus from the eustachian tube by subjecting it to various frequencies of sound. To replicate the eustachian tube conditions, an air chamber -based model was devised to simulate pressure gradient, accompanied by a tube emulating the tube's inherent characteristics. Mucus was introduced into this model and subje cted to a diverse spectrum of sound frequencies to observe its responses. The findings from this endeavor will yield insights into the simulation of eustachian tube dysfunction and how different sound frequencies impact mucus behavior within the tube. Moving forward, the project's progression should encompass a continued exploration of diverse sound frequencies to discern alterations in mucus flow dynamics within the eustachian tube. Quantifying the Ultrafast of Harry Atwater and Arun Nagpal It has recently been shown that plasmon emission in graphene occurs, in the mid -infrared, but the ultrafast decay mechanisms are still not understood completely. This has laid groundwork for the ultrafast photoluminescence properties of monolayer graphene to be studied as a function of Fermi energy in a GFET configuration. Now the graphene plasmon is also studied when coupled to an array of resonator devices. Here, the graphene plasmons couple to gap plasmons in planar devices as well as the modes of plasmonic and dielectric microdisk resonators. In the planar devices, the thickness of the gap between the monolayer graphene and gold back -reflector was modified such that the effect of detuning - between the gap plasmon and graphene plasmon- on emission may be understood. Transfer matrix modelling was done to select the necessary thicknesses for the gap plasmons to be resonant with or slightly detuned from the graphene plasmons. Optical excitation of the devices was done at 800 nm with a pulse width ~40 fs to capture the emission of \"hot\" electrons in graphene coupled to electromagnetic modes supported by newly fabricated resonators. Device characterization involved Raman spectroscopy, ellipsometry, profilometry, and electrical measurements. The finite -difference -time-domain electromagnetic field solving algorithm was used to obtain mode profiles and time dynamics of the structures. This paves the way for stimulated emission from surface plasmons to be performed and even utilized for high efficiency light-to-electricity energy conversion later on. Development of a CRISPR/Cas9 Based Knock -in and Knock -out Genome Editing Tool in a Species of Rove Beetles, Dalotia coriaria Arianna de la Torre Roehl Mentors: Joseph Parker and Hannah Ryon The implementation of direct genetic editing tools has greatly advanced the study of gene functions by enabling the targeted mutations in endogenous genes and the introduction of exogenous genes in the genome. The application of this tool in functional genetic studies will allow for a deeper understanding of the ways in which genetics are implicated in the evolutionary mechanisms of rove beetles in the Aleocharinae subfamily, using the free -living beetle Dalotia coriaria as our model organism. We aim to use a recently developed CRISPR/Cas9 based technique in insects that uses non- homologous end joining (NHEJ) to introduce transgenes at a specified target location, enabling simultaneous gene knock -ins and knock -outs. We hypothesize that this genome editing tool will yield germline transmissible mutations, facilitating the establishment of the first ever stable transgenic line of rove beetles. With the capability to knock -in exogenous genes, we are able to screen for novel knock -outs, and can knock -in any gene desired going forward, opening up an entirely new area of rove beetle research. A Globally -calibrated Hillslope Routing Model Based on Recurrent Neural Networks for Use in Land Surface Models Mauricio De Moura Lima Mentor: Tapio Schneider Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful tools for transforming observed precipitation into streamflow. Calibration of such a model in the continental United States, using a Long -Short -Term-Memory (LSTM) RNN, demonstrated that a single set of parameters can be used across basins for predicting streamflow, and that LSTMs can outperform physical models when those physical models are not tuned for specific basins. In this work, we extend this LSTM model in two ways: by using instantaneous runoff calculated from physical models as mass input on the network (instead of precipitation), and by extending the training data, training, and testing of the model to basins across the world. The resulting hillslope -routing model can then be integrated into Land Surfac e Models (LSMs), which often require runoff to be separated from precipitation in order to track the soil moisture content. By using a vectorized map with timeseries driven by reanalysis, we can perform world -wide calibrations and global simulations, outperforming existing global physically based models in commonly used scores in hydrology. Analyzing Sensitivity of an Atmospheric Circulation Model to Stability Functions in Monin- Obukhov Similarity Theory Gerard Decker Mentors: Lenka Novak The Monin- Similarity Theory of atmospheric turbulent surface fluxes by modifying flux-gradient equations using universal stability functions to account for different atmospheric static conditions. These non -dimensionalized height functions allow the recovery of mean temperature and wind profiles, as well as surface fluxes near the atmospheric surface boundary layer. These recovered surface fluxes are then utilized as boundary conditions for atmospheric, land, and ocean models. Different formulations of these stability functions have been proposed in early literature, each suitable for particular terrain, but have yet to be rigorously tested in a computational model. In this project, we investigate the performa nce of six different stability function formulations in CliMA's Earth System Model through metrics such as mean temperature structure, jet strength and latitude, eddy covariances, and precipitation. Sensitivity analyses with data from observational campaigns and reanalysis data reveal minor differences in the relative performance of the stability functions. SQUID Noise Spectroscopy: Designing Superconducting Qubits for Environmental Flux Noise Measurement Alexander Deters Mentors: Oskar Painter, Andreas Butler, and Gihwan Kim Superconducting quantum interferometry devices (SQUIDs) have long been used for designing superconducting qubits with flux dependence. While primarily employed for in situ parameter tuning, these components have also been sh own to make superconducting circuits effective tools for flux noise spectroscopy. This project aims to design an experimental setup wherein several tunable qubits, each with distinct SQUID geometries, are used to achieve accurate measurements of the enviro nmental flux noise \u2014distinct from local noise sources such as fabrication defects and atomic spins. To this end, we produce a fabricatable design for an eight -qubit quantum computer optimized for this measurement. Additionally, we introduce PySon, a Python library capable of automating design processes in the electromagnetic simulation software Sonnet. PySon's automation of design, simulation, and post - processing tasks enables the creation of a physically informed procedural generator for metamaterial Purcell filters. This generator is then applied to mitigate extraneous noise in our design. Identifying the Role of Arp6 and H2Av class, PIWI -interacting RNAs (piRNAs) primarily act to protect from dysregulation of transposable elements (TEs) with support from the Piwi clade of Argonaute proteins in silencing and biogenesis. These RNAs are generated from dual -strand genomic clusters in the line of Drosophila , Rhino -Deadlock marks. Although Rhino, an HP1 homologue, binding facilitates complex recruitment and read -through for piRNA precursor transcription, the ubiquitous presence of H3K9me3 marks and HP1 proteins leaves the unspecific mechanism of piRNA biogenesis incomplete. Therefore, we are using a series of biochemical and imaging techniques on mutant Drosophila ovaries to investigate our hypothesis that candidate proteins Arp6 and/or H2Av act as a 'bridge' between Piwi and Rhino to direct piRNA cluster biogenesis. is a component of the DOM -B chromatin remodelling complex which replaces histone H2A with H2Av, variant in Drosophila . Preliminary studies promisingly demonstrate interactions between Arp6 and Piwi, while disrupted Rhino localisation has been observed in H2Av mutant ovarian germ cells. Establishing a canonical interaction can be furthered by investigating additional interactions of Arp6/H2Av with the piRNA system and can inform research on mechanisms of generating specificity from diverse readers of epigenetically interacting systems. Discovering Planetary Nebulae With the Census of the Local Universe H Emission Line Survey Rong Du Mentor: Shrinivas R. Kulkarni Planetary nebulae serve as crucial windows into the late -stage evolution of low - to intermediate -mass stars and the ionization and refill of the interstellar medium. Modern discoveries of these nebulae primarily stem from extensive H surveys. In this study, we harness data from the Census of the Local Universe H$ \\alpha$ emission- line survey to uncover new planetary nebulae, assessing the viability of this approach. We validate our method by cross - referencing with an INT Photometric H Survey catalog of known planetary nebulae in the northern Galactic plane, based on rediscovering these sources through careful, rigorous, visual scrutiny of photometric images in our survey. Results show that out of the 317 true, 49 possible, and 76 likely planetary nebulae identified in previous studies, our investigation rediscovers 329 obvious, and 97 perceptible sources while encountering 4 undetectable sources and 12 sources with imaging issues. This pilot project successfully demonstrates the potential of conducting planetary nebula searches across the entire sky, particularly extending beyond the confines of the Galactic plane. Estimating Stability Function Formulation With Ensemble Kalman Inversion Wilson Duan Mentors: Tapio Schneider, Akshay Srid har, and Lenka Novak The goal of the CliMA research group is to develop a Julia -language Earth System Model (ESM) capable of modeling intricate and detailed processes in a wide variety of conditions across the globe. In order to model the Earth's atmosphe re accurately, it is necessary to quantify turbulent surface fluxes induced by flows that cannot be simulated directly. These fluxes represent the exchange of quantities such as momentum, heat, and moisture between the surface and the atmosphere. Surface f luxes, which are parametrized through the Monin- Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST), are highly dependent on profiles such as wind, heat and moisture in the atmospheric boundary layer. MOST expresses wind and heat profiles in terms of stability correction functions, MOST stability functions are derived empirically from observational data from sources such as SHEBA. Because the stability functions' parameters may vary from dataset to dataset, it is necessary to estimate these parameters in a general way given observational data. In this paper, we perform parameter estimation with the Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) process with Julia, employing the CliMA -developed packages EnsembleKalmanProcesses.jl and SurfaceFluxes.jl. In doing so, we evaluate the efficacy of the EKI algorithm in the context of MOST. Immune Response to the Mosaic -8b-mi3 Immunogen in mRNA Pre -immunized Mice Ana Duarte Montano Mentors: Pamela Bjorkman and Jennifer Keeffe A large part of the world has received an mRNA vaccine licensed by Pfizer or Moderna with the goal of combatting SARS -CoV-2. However, as the virus continues to evolve, the virus evades the existing immunity provided by mRNA vaccines. In our study, we investigate the ability of the Mosaic -8b-RBD-mi3 vaccine to elicit a broad response in the immune system of mice that had been pre -immunized with a Pfizer -like vaccine. The nanoparticle contains 8 different receptor binding domains from 8 different sarbecoviruses, including the SARS -CoV-2 Beta variant2, and was designed to target conserved epitopes on SARS -CoV-2 and zoonotic viruses that are currently unknown1. The mouse model was used to mimic humans that received an mRNA vaccine. A qualitative analysis of sing le B cells was done using the Berkeley Lights Beacon instrument and monoclonal antibodies from individual B cells from the mice were cloned using Golden Gate Assembly. We characterized the polyclonal and monoclonal antibody response via ELISA. The data col lected will provide evidence for how the human immune system might respond to the Mosaic -8b-RBD-mi3 vaccine and support the move to clinical trials. References. 1. Cohen, A.

Neutralizing Monoclonal Intracluster Light (ICL) is a luminous component of galaxy clusters, composed of stars gravitationally bound to the cluster potential but not associated with individual member galaxies. ICL is useful for understanding the evolution of galaxy clusters but directly studying it is challenging due to its low surface brightness, making accurate measurements elusive. To overcome this, we propose an approach using supernovae (SNe), which are highly luminous, as tracers to probe ICL properties and mass fraction. The Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey (ZTF BTS) provides a suitable database of SNe for the analysis, which overcomes problems encountered in the past, including limited sample sizes and selection biases. Our objectives include identifying and characterizing ICL SNe, comparing them with cluster -member -hosted and field SNe, and estimating the ICL stellar mass fraction. Through subtype distributions, peak luminosities, and light curve shapes of different SN samples, we aim to gain insights into the stellar population properties of ICL and its role in shaping the evolution of galaxy clusters over cosmic time. Additionally, we are developing a method that could be used for identifying host galaxies for any SN dataset. Analysis of Intervenors of Potential Fast Radio Burst Host Galaxies Through Spectral Energy Distribution Fitting With Photometry Matilda Eriksson Mentors: Vikram Ravi and Jean Somalwar The gas around galaxies in the circum - and intergalactic medium (CGM and IGM respectively) is not well understood. In the close universe (z~0), most of the gas is ionized making it difficult to observe directly. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are short duration (~millisecond), highly energetic radio pulse transients of which their host sightlines can be studied by the propagation effects that the ionized gas has on the radio pulses. Since detection of FRBs has been an active area of research for the last 15+ years, we now have large samples of well -localized FRBs that we can use to study the CGM and IGM in the sightline. To achieve this, we need to measure redshifts and stellar masses of the intervening galaxies. This project focuses on measuring these p roperties using spectroscopy and photometry. Reverse Engineering AAV to Understand Its Gene Delivery Pathway in the Blood -Brain Barrier and Central Nervous System (AAVs) are viral vector tools used for gene transfer. Limited by an incomplete understanding of their underlying mechanisms, the ability to forward -engineer AAVs for targeted gene delivery across the blood -brain barrier (BBB) is constrained. Reverse -engineering AAVs specialized in infecting only the BBB, neurons, or all brain cells (neurons and glial cells) could address this. AAVs selected and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) will provide a foundation for exploring AAV mechanisms and drawing comparisons between their biology and documented capabil ities. GPAs may inform how the AAV capsid protects and releases its DNA cargo. Analysis of DSF data could establish a relationship between capsid melting point, capsid stability, and how far it can travel through the BBB. SPR will examine a relation betwee n surface binding strength and capsid BBB crossing. These experiments aim to develop an in- depth map of how AAVs non- invasively infect the brain; the map will start with AAV crossing the BBB and end with releasing a gene in the targeted cell.

Channel Selection for Feature -Extracted Data From Microelectrode Array Brain type of brain- machine interface consisting of hundreds of electrodes, each transmitting a channel of neural data to be decoded into instructions. The quality of data varies between channels, and changes over time. Currently, we are feeding all channels to our decoder, but this approach is inefficient. Channel selection could enable the elimination of all but the top channels, improving the efficiency of decoding without sacrificing accuracy. In this project, we explored different architectures for channel selection algorithms. We developed binary good/bad classifiers for post -feature -extraction neural data, based on set -length segments of feature -extracted data from individual channels, which are labeled \"good\" or \"bad\" depending on the performance of a linear decoder trained on just those channels. We compared the effectiveness of several high- performing algorithm designs, including: gradient boosting, support vector machines with linear and RBF kernels, and fully connected networks. Currently, we have achieved an accuracy of 81% overall and 60% for good channels only. We will continue to evaluate more algorithms, and explo re methods of improving performance, with the goal of designing a robust, accurate channel selector which proves effective on future days and with new patients. Formal Languages and Constructing the Noncommutative Geometry of Icosahedral translational symmetry and with rotational symmetries of orders five or greater than six. In two dimensions, these structures can be mathematically represented usi ng Penrose tilings, which have been studied extensively. A powerful construction for these tilings exists using formal languages, which can compactly encode the necessary substitutions, decorations, inflation and deflation rules, and local matching rules. However, besides the case of the icosahedral Danzer tiling \u2014which uses four tetrahedra as prototiles \u2014little progress has been made in using formal languages to model quasicrystals. In this project, we work towards constructing a D0L formal language for the We also aim to examine the properties of this language and the corresponding noncommutative geometry of this quasicrystal. Photoinduced, Copper Fleury Mentors: Cho Nucleophilic reactions with alkyl halide electrophiles, such as S N2 and S N1 reactions, are often utilized in organic synthesis but are not without limitations in reactivity and stereoselectivity. Transition- metal catalysis can be employed to address these shortcomings with a variety of electrophi les and nucleophiles. Our work aims to further the progress in enantioselective cross -coupling of unactivated secondary alkyl electrophiles with nitrogen nucleophiles using a photoinduced, copper -catalyst in the reaction of 3 -halo pyrrolidine a nd nitrogen nucleophiles. Resulting chiral 3 -substituted pyrrolidines are frequently occurring motif in bioactive molecules. The reaction is catalyzed by copper -based complexes generated in situ with three ligands: a bisphosphine, a phenoxide, and a chiral diamine. The copper/bisphosphine/phenoxide complex serves as a photocatalyst to be activated with 440 nm blue LEDs for carbon -halogen bond activation. This complex works in conjunction with the copper/chiral diamine/phenoxide complex which catalyzes enantioselective carbon -nitrogen bond formation. Our optimization process of this reaction between pyrrolidine derivative alkyl halides and nitrogen nucleophiles is ongoing with a goal to obtain quantitative yields and greater than 90% enantiomeric excess. Towards Robotic Exoskeleton Multi -Contact Walking via a Gait Library Sara Frunzi Mentors: Aaron Ames, Maegan Tucker, and Amy Li Using robotic mechanisms to restore autonomy through walking in paraplegic individuals is an active field of robotics research. Current work in the AMBER Lab has improved dynamic walking with ATALANTE, a crutch- less exoskeleton developed by Wandercraft, bu t only with a flat -footed model, wherein the dynamics of the foot are simplified so it can be assumed that the entire surface of the foot is coming into contact with the ground at once. This model has been useful for walking in many robots, but it makes an unnatural comparison to human- like walking and is infeasible for rough terrains. This work presents the utilization of a gait library as a step towards implementing multi -contact walking, a model which takes into account regions of the foot striking the g round in succession, as opposed to the entire foot at once. In this approach, we generate multiple gaits of several velocities using optimization functions and constraints based on physical limitations of the exoskeleton and desired traits of a gait. Thes e gaits are stored in a library that can be accessed by the robot controller. By tracking the robot's velocity, the controller can switch to a different gait upon interference to prevent the robot from falling. Because multi-contact walking is more complex than flat -footed walking, singular gaits may be less stable for prolonged use; using a gait library addresses this stability concern. Future work on this project will incorporate user feedback to change the desired velocity and take user preferences into account. Physics- Informed Neural Networks for Modeling Slow Slip Events in a 2D Fault Rikuto Fukushima Mentor: Jean- Philippe Avouac The episodic transient fault slips called slow slip events (SSEs) have been observed in many subduction zones. These slips often occur in regions adjacent to the seismogenic zone during the interseismic period, making monitoring SSEs significant for understanding large earthquakes. Various fault slip behaviors, including SSEs and earthquakes, can be explained by the spatial heterogeneity of frictional properties on the fault. Therefore, estimating frictional properties from geodetic observations and physics -based models is crucial for fault slip monitoring. We propose a Physics -Informed Neural Network (PINN)- based new approach to simulate fault slip evolution and estimate frictional parameters from observation data. PINNs, which integrate physical laws and observation data, represent the solution of physics -based differential equations. In the previous study, a PINN - based appro ach was applied to a simple single -degree -of-freedom spring -slider system to model SSEs. In this study, we applied this method to a 2D fault model and validate its effectiveness in a forward problem. We successfully reproduced the spatio -temporal evolution of SSEs and this result indicates the significant potential of PINNs for simulating slow slip events in a 2D fault model. Cold Radioactive Molecules for Precision Measurements Mumtaz Gababa Mentors: Nick Hutzler and Chandler Conn Polyatomic molecules have gained recognition as a sensitive probe in the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), specifically the search for the combined violation of charge and parity (CP) symmetries. Specifically, linear triatomic molecules possess many attributes that aid BSM searches: laser -coolability and large polarization that is induced by a doubly degenerate bending motion in a vibrationally -excited state, leading to powerful rejection of systematic errors through internal co -magne tometry. Radioactive molecules retain all the benefits of polyatomic molecules, including their laser -coolability and easy polarizability, while adding additional benefits due to the exotic properties of the deformed, radioactive nucleus. However, the comp lexity of their production and study has, until just recently, prevented us from realizing their exciting applications not only in fundamental precision measurements, but also in astrophysics and relativistic quantum chemistry. Before we can control and ma nipulate these molecules to perform symmetry violation measurements, the internal quantum structure must be studied in detail. In this work, we are exploring and mapping the near -infrared transitions in radium monohydroxide (RaOH), a molecule of particular interest for fundamental physics experiments, in hopes of determining branching ratios for laser cooling. This will be second radium -containing molecule to be studied spectroscopically and the first direct probe of the internal structure of a radium -conta ining polyatomic molecule. Enhanced molecular production and signal optimization are discussed, utilizing cryogenic buffer gas cooling with unique absorption and fluorescence techniques for better characterization of the internal structure of RaOH. Analyzing Metal Carbonate Sorbents for Point Source Carbon Capture Genevieve Gandara Mentors: Melany Hunt and Leopold Dobelle In the United States, greenhouse gas point source emitters, such as power plants, refineries, and coal and gas facilities, emit over 3 gigatons of carbon dioxide, or approximately 50% of the country's CO emissions. Flue gas emitted by these sources contai ns high concentrations of CO (~ 5 -15%), which can be captured directly at a high efficiency through point source capture. The current state -of-the-art method for carbon capture at the industrial scale uses amine- based solvents, but these are toxic and cor rosive. In this project, we study metal carbonate sorbents, which are less expensive and non- toxic alternatives. Sorbents were prepared using the methods of extrusion and spheronization. Experiments were conducted in a fixed bed reactor with a nearly satur ated gas stream. Our most promising sorbent is potassium carbonate, which absorbs over 99% of CO in a C10 gas stream (90% Ar and 10% CO). Regeneration was also explored, but a KCO sorbent which can be regenerated to its full capacity is yet to be found . The other constituents of the sorbent include binders and other absorbent materials such as Ca(OH), CaCO, and starch. Different combinations of these constituents were tested to find a sorbent that is regenerable, does not burn at high temperatures, ha s a high surface area, and has good mechanical structure. Analyzing Large -Scale Circulation in the CliMA Aquaplanet Simulation and its Sensitivity to SST and Resolution Kahaan Gandhi Mentors: Tapio Schneider and Zhaoyi Shen We use aquaplanet simulations to examine atmospheric circulation in an idealized climate. These numerical models represent an Earth- like planet covered entirely by water, simplifying topography and radiation to study the hydrosphere and atmosphere in isolation. Though conditions are s implified, these simulations maintain the physical complexity of their global climate model counterparts. We evaluate how the atmospheric circulation responds to changes in sea surface temperatures (SST) and model resolution. We force the model with zonall y symmetric and zonally asymmetric sea surface temperatures and vary the horizontal and vertical resolution of the model. Since the aquaplanet is purely theoretical, simulated outputs cannot be compared against real -life observations. To establish a compar ative framework, we cross -analyze results across a diverse suite of aquaplanet simulations, each uniquely forced. This experimental approach can be used to examine the sensitivity of convective parametrization that models the dynamics of turbulence, convec tion, and clouds. Our numerical investigation targets linear and nonlinear responses to these perturbations, and our analysis focuses on zonal mean changes in atmospheric circulation. This project advances CliMA's mission to reduce climate prediction uncer tainties with a robust, scalable, open-source model. Numerically Consistent Data -Driven Subgrid -Scale Model for Large -Eddy Simulation Michael Lawrence Garcia Mentor: H. Jane Bae In this work, we train a data -driven subgrid -scale (SGS) model for large -eddy simulation (LES) which incorporates numerical error arising from the LES equations. LES solves the low -pass filtered Navier -Stokes equations while using a model for unclosed SGS terms. The typical approach for generating d ata-driven closure models in LES computes required SGS terms using a filtering operator on direct numerical simulation (DNS) data. Recent research highlights that the numerical error between the derivative and filter operators is comparable to the modeling error of traditional SGS models. We develop an artificial neural network (ANN) trained on both filtered DNS data and computed commutation error to act as a numerically consistent closure model in LES. We develop an artificial neural network (ANN) trained on both filtered DNS data and computed commutation error to act as a numerically consistent closure model in LES for forced isotropic turbulence. Our goal is to create a high fidelity SGS model for LES which can adapt to different numerical methods in comp utational fluid dynamics solvers. We discuss the details of the LES model and the training process. Investigating Subsidence Associated With Anthropogenic Activity Over Riyadh Using InSAR Jabri Garcia -Jimenez Mentors: Charles Elachi and Yuan Kai Liu This project aims to search for subsidence associated with anthropogenic activity over Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. This is achieved using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), a method used to measure land deformation over time and large areas with accur acy by using radar signals from Earth- orbiting satellites. Advanced Rapid Imaging and Analysis Unwrapped Interferograms (ARIA ARIA project. ARIA -tools, an open- source package in Python, is used to download the products and extract data and meta -data necessary for time- series analysis. MintPy, another open-source package in Python, performs time -series analyses and reads the stack of interferograms and produces three dimensional (2D in space and 1D in time) ground surface displacement in line -of-sight direction. By looking at annual and secular decomposition of the time series subsidence can be searched for by superimposing the deformation maps (and decorrelation maps) on optical imagery within Google Earth. Design and Testing of Nanophotonic Cavities for T -center Integration Antonia Ghita Mentors: Andrei and Adrian Beckert Quantum networks require optically -addressable qubits with long coherence times. Spin qubits in solid state luminescent centers are promising candidates for such light -matter interfaces. The T -center, a recently rediscovered silicon color center, is a suitable photon- spin interface for quantum network s thanks to its high radiative efficiency in the telecommunications O -band and long -lived nuclear spins. Measurements of the linewidths of waveguides containing ensembles of T -centers have shown near -transform limited optical transitions which makes the T -center very promising for high fidelity entanglement. Purcell enhancement via integration into a nanophotonic resonator will further increase its emission rate and pave the way to transform limited and indistinguishable photons. To couple the on- chip cavity electromagnetic field to the control and readout optics, high efficiency grating couplers and low loss waveguides are needed. I optimized the efficiency of grating couplers using subwavelength structures, simulated waveguide losses and designed a high Q -factor cavity with high transmission at the T -center optical transition wavelength. I tested the simulated devices experimentally and worked towards achieving fabrication tolerant designs. In the future, these designs will be fabricated on SOI wafers conta ining T - centers for characterization and control of silicon- based spin -photon interfaces. Vertebrate Sleep Regulation With Madelyn Gilbert Mentors: David Prober and Jasmine Emtage Although sleep is a highly conserved behavior, not much is known about the genetic and neuronal mechanisms that are responsible for sleep regulation. Zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) have recently been introduced as a behavioral sleep model because they are diurnal vertebrates that exhibit similar sleep behaviors to mammalian sleep. An advantage to using zebrafish models is that there are many mammalian genes with zebrafish orthologs. The human gene stk32a was identified via a genome -wide association study (GWAS) and found to have a zebrafish ortholog that when mutated, causes a disordered sleep phenotype. The function of the stk32a gene in zebrafish is unknown, but it is endogenously expressed in the neuromasts along the lateral line system. Ablation of hair cells in the neuromasts can be used to observe potential sleep phenotypes and determine if stk32a in the lateral line impacts sleep. Perturbation of the hair cells in the lateral line system was attempted via drug -induced ablation and capsaicin- mediated conditional ablation. Should ablation of the hair cells work in stk32a-/- zebrafish mutants, it is expected that behavioral exper iments will show no additive effect on the sleep phenotype and indicate that stk32a acts in the hair cells to regulate sleep. Disentangling a New Compton -Thick AGN From a Serendipitous Annie Giman Fiona Harrison and Peter Boorman Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are the extremely luminous centers of large galaxies containing an accreting supermassive black hole. The majority of AGN are thought to grow beneath thick parsec -scale layers of gas and dust which obscure their innermost regions at lower energies. The most extreme obscured AGN are optically thick to Compton scattering, with line -of-sight column densities N H > 1.5 x 1024 cm-2 (aka Compton- thick). Understanding the geometry and properties of Compton- thick AGN is key to understanding obscuration in AGN more broadly, but not many examples are known. In this work, we explore a candidate AGN that has been missed by previous large -scale AGN surveys, 2MASX J21391374 -2646315, in addition to a serendipitously observed contaminant galaxy, using NuSTAR and XMM- Newton X-ray observations. We conduct follow -up optical spectroscopy of the contaminant and classify it as a previously unidentified quasar at redshift z ~ 1.8. Through broadband X -ray spectral modeling and Bayesian sampling algorithms, we disentangle the contaminating flux from the background quasar to unambiguously confirm the AGN to be Compton- thick. Our study highlights the power of combining hard (> 10 keV) X -ray observations with high angular resolution X -ray images in uncovering hidden sites of supermassive black hole accretion in the local Universe. Constraining the Capacity of Sediments to Carry Organic Carbon in Arctic Rive rs Asiah Giuntoni Mentors: Michael P. Lamb and Yutian Ke Rivers contribute substantially to the production, transport, and deposition of both sediments and organic carbon (OC). Eroded solids that are transported in the form of suspended particulate matter (SPM) and consist of particulate organic carbon (POC) are redistributed to varying geomorphic units. Various properties of sediments such as their grain size, mineralogy, and specific surface area (SSA) directly constrain OC loading as a result of aggregate formation, layering and burial processes, and mineral s urface coverage. By investigating the controls of OC loading and interpreting the possible fates of eroded permafrost OC, we can therefore address how accelerated bank erosion in permafrost regions will influence the global carbon cycle. For this project, we explored the relationship between the grain size and total OC (TOC) content of SPM collected from three discontinuous permafrost sites on the Yukon River. Aliquots of sediment were analyzed for grain size using the Mastersizer 3000 and for TOC content w ith the Costech Elemental Analyzer. Initial results show that OC loading is dependent on the dominant grain size and thus changes in different geomorphic domains; The Alakanuk Delta has higher OC loading because it is dominated by fine -grained silts and is located downstream. Structural and Biochemical Alvinella pompejana Nucleoporins Nika Gladkov Mentors: and George Mobbs Challenges in expressing and purifying requisite amounts of relevant human proteins have significantly hindered contemporary investigations of post -synaptic biochemistry, limiting our understanding of the fundamental biochemical processes that underlie neural function. In order to overcome these challenges, the Hoelz lab has identified deep -sea worm Alvinella pompejana as a promising model organism candidate for sourcing proteins with superior biochemical stability, high amenability for large -scale expressi on, and significant structural homology to their human counterparts. With the broad goal of validating A. pompejana as a novel model organism for the study higher -order biochemical processes, we seek to structurally characterized several protein constituen ts\u2014termed nucleoporins \u2014of the A. pompejana nuclear pore complex (NPC), the structure of which is well -characterized and conserved across a wide range of phyla. We focus our efforts on several nucleoporin constituents of the cytoplasmic filament nucleoporin complex \u2014a key -sub-complex of the NPC which plays several roles in not only nucleocytoplasmic transport but also the structural integrity of the NPC \u2014the solenoid region of nucleoporin 93, the R2 region of nucleoporin 35, and nucleoporin Gle1. We seek to ex press, purify, and crystallize the nucleoporins in order to verify structural similarity to their human homologues, thus establishing A. pompejana as a suitable model organism for the study of neural biochemistry. GPU Optimization for Parameter Estimation in the Attentional Drift Diffusion Model Jacob Goldman Mentors: Antonio Rangel and Zeynep Enkavi The Attentional Drift Diffusion Model (aDDM ) is a computational model that describes the impact of visual attention on decision- making. It expands the widely used algorithm of evidence accumulation models to account for how visual fluctuations influence information intake and bias choice. Estimating free parameters that best describe empirical data poses a computational challenge because the model does not have an analytical solution for the likelihood function of choice dependent response times. One way to compute the likelihood of any observed cho ice and response time given a set of parameters and fixation patterns is through a sequential updating of the probability of crossing decision boundaries. Likelihoods for each observed data point can be computed independently but together identify the para meters with the maximum likelihood. In this project, we utilized Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to optimize model fitting performance. GPUs offer increased parallelism and higher memory bandwidth, making them suitable for this task. We developed a CUDA -based software toolbox to perform aDDM model fitting and data simulation, providing significant speedup from previous implementations. This research presents a significant step forward in increasing the broader adoption of models designed to increase unders tanding of the role of attention in decision- making. Mapping and Interpreting the Formation of Martian Depositional Rivers Emiliano Gonzalez Mentors: Michael Lamb and Abdallah Zaki The Martian surface was once dramatically different from today, featuring extensive lakes, rivers, and even clues of an ancient ocean. Although erosional valley networks have been identified since the early history of Mars exploration, a planet -wide discovery of Martian depositional rivers has recently been mapped, supporting the presence of ancient sedimentary basins. These depositional rivers appear as sinuous ridges standing as topographic highs due to long -lived aeolian erosion. However, the similarity in the morphology of Martian ridges to glacially formed eskers on Earth a nd volcanically formed wrinkle ridges may suggest that they were also formed by glacial and volcanic activity. Although previous studies have determined the major forces responsible for the formation of Martian depositional rivers, no studies have systematically interpreted or distinguished the various processes involved in their formation. We have developed a method to interpret these depositional rivers' origin as fluvial, glacial, or volcanic by comparing their morphological characteristics. Features suc h as sediment color, sedimentary structures, texture, and pattern were used to form a hypothesis behind a system's formation, which helps to specify the erosional and depositional processes involved in their formation, contributing to our understanding of the ancient Martian hydrological cycle, and processes that shaped the planet's surface. On the Computation of the Functor $TC^+( -;\\mathbb{F}_p)$ for Local Integer Rings Samuel P. Goodman Mentor: Matthias Flach In this project, we fully determine $ \\text{TC}^+( \\mathcal{O}_F; \\mathbb{F}_p)$ when $F$ is a $ \\mathcal{O}_K; any number field $K$. The functor $ \\text{TC}^+$ has proven to be the more natural description, com pared to the more well -known $\\text{TC}$, for the arithmetic invariants appearing in the formulae for special values of Dedekind $ \\zeta$ - functions, the zeta functions corresponding to number fields. In addition to directly pertaining to special values of $\\zeta$ -functions, these groups (and more generally groups coming from topological Hochschild homology) are taking center stage in modern number theory and arithmetic geometry, meaning that understanding them better is of great importance. Prior research ha s already elucidated connections between $ \\text{TC}^+_{2n - 1}(\\mathcal{O}_F; \\mathbb{F}_p)$ and $ \\text{TC}^+_{2n}(\\ mathcal{O}_F; \\mathbb{F}_p)$ but doesn't give information about the of $ \\text{TC}^+_n( \\mathcal{O}_F; \\mathbb{F}_p)$ for a parti cular value of $n$. Recent techniques, however, have determined the structure of $ \\text{TC}( \\mathcal{O}_F; \\mathbb{F}_p)$, which was the launching point for understanding this related functor. By determining this structure, we complete the next step in und erstanding how these groups behave. We hope that these techniques can soon be extended to understanding $ \\text{TC}^+( \\mathcal{O}_F)$ more generally, for example $ 1$. Galaxy Feedback Charvi Goyal Mentors: Phil Hopkins and Sam Ponnada Super -massive black holes at the centers of galaxies, known as active galactic nuclei (AGN), provide energetic feedback necessary to \"turn off\" star formation in high- mass galaxies (M halo 1012.5 MSun) as observed. However, the physics that drives this \"quenching\" remains uncertain. Cosmic rays (CRs) have been proposed as a promising channel of AGN feedback, but the nature of CR -feedback from AGN requires further theoretical and observational constraints. Thus, we analyze a set of high- resolution simulations of massive galaxies from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project including AGN feedback with different CR physics parameters and compare them to observed galaxy scaling relations. We f ind that all runs agree with observed galaxy scaling relations, demonstrating that all CR physics parameters explored produce galaxies with reasonable bulk properties. More detailed investigations of these simulations characterizing gas properties in the halos and modeling detailed emission properties for closer observational comparisons may help in understanding the physical mechanisms leading to similar bulk properties and plausibility of certain CR models, further constraining the parameter space. A Nov el 2H-1-Benzopyran Mechanophore Derived From Carbazole Wendy Granados Razo Mentors: Maxwell J. Robb and Yan Sun Polymer mechanochemistry is an emerging field of research where mechanical force is used to promote chemical transformations of force -sensitive molecules termed as mechanophores incorporated into polymers. Mechanophores that undergo a visible color change upon being subjected to mechanical force enable the straightforward visualization of stress in polymeric materials. Benzopyrans are a well -known class of photoswitches that generate a colored merocyanine species under ultraviolet light; however, the mechanochemical reactivity of benzopyran remains unexplored. Herein, we designed and investigated the mechanochromic behavior of a novel 2 H-1- benzopyran derived from carbazole. The mechanochemical ring -opening reaction of the targeted benzopyran compound was suc cessfully predicted by computational simulations. Encouraged by these computational predictions, we synthesized polymers containing the benzopyran motif and investigated its mechanochemical reactivity in solution using ultrasonication techniques. Notably, in addition to undergoing a mechanochemical ring - opening reaction, we discovered a bathochromic shift in the absorption of the merocyanine product in the presence of acid resulting in pH -dependent chromogenic behavior. We are exploring applications of this benzopyran mechanophore that leverage its unique multimodal reactivity for force sensing as well information storage through logic gating . Modeling the Reflection Spectra of the Black Hole X-ray Binary GX 339-4 From Its 2021 Outburst Sanya Gupta Mentors: Fiona Harrison and Oluwashina (Shina) Adegoke We report on the overarching properties of the black hole binary GX 339-4 to, for the first time, model the broadband X-ray reflection spectrum based on its 2021 outburst observed by the \\textit{NuSTAR} telescope. During this outburst, the source successfully went through all state transitions over the course of thirteen different observations. The source exhibited strong relativistic reflection features including the broad iron $K_{\\alpha}$ line at 6.4 keV and the Compton hump that peaks around 20 keV. Using basic phenominological/physical models, we probe the evolution of important accretion flow parameters over the entire outburst. These include the powerlaw photon index, the disk blackbody temperature, and its normalization. We further computed the inner disk radius corresponding to each of the observations. This is important to study the evolution of the inner accretion disk as the source transitions from one state to another. We also quantified the strength of the reflection spectrum (importantly, the broad iron $K_{\\alpha}$ line) for any correlations with the illuminating X-ray flux. Joint Reconstruction -Segmentation Using Graph -Based Methods Ashug Gurijala Mentors: Franca Hoffmann and Jeremy Budd This research is focused on tackling the task of segmenting imperfect images. Prior implementations that sequentially reconstruct and segment images are limited because the reconstruction task is unaware that segmentation will follow. Another approach invo lves the use of neural networks, which although powerful, lack explainability. This research explores the novel approach of simultaneously reconstructing and segmenting the image. We allow for the reconstruction task to aid segmentation process, thereby ov ercoming the limitations of previous methods. We use a graph -based approach, representing the image as a graph with pixels as vertices and weighted edges according to pixel similarity. The approach is integrable in a variational framework where the goal i s to minimize functionals across functions defined on a graph utilizing gradient flows. We formulate the reconstruction-segmentation process as the minimization of Tikhonov reconstruction and Ginzburg -Landau segmentation energies. To facilitate wider adop tion and practical usage of the proposed approach, particularly in fields like medical imaging, we introduce a Python pipeline. Developing the Python pipeline required implementing various optimization strategies to align the principles of the proposed app roach with the practical constraints of coding. Assessing Environmental Factors on Preimplantation Development Using a Stem Cell Embryo Model Human fertility is declining at a concerning pace. With maternal age at conception considered a driver of this trend, novel approaches for preserving maternal fertility are urgently required. Meanwhile, many environmental factors have been shown to impact female fertility, as well as development of the preimplantation embryo, leading to subfecundity. However, the morphological changes and mechanisms impacting early development remain to be uncovered. As access to human embryos is extremely limited, we chose the most extensively studied model organism for mammal development, the mouse embryo. Therefore, we engineered a model of mouse preimplantation embryos from stem cells and exposed them to various xenobiotics determined as relevant from a literature resear ch. Then, embryos were fixed and analyzed using brightfield and immunofluorescence imaging. Treatment with toxins resulted in disruption of several features of normal embryo development. The addition of nutritious compounds however, lead to accelerated de velopment and favorable morphological features. Our study provides a proof -of-concept and framework for future high- throughput studies using human stem cell derived embryo models. Subsequent research could yield unprecedented insights and guidelines for the preservation of human fertility and drug testing. Design of Hydrogels Incorporating Acoustic Cavitation -Induced Mechanochemistry Tiba Hamza Mentors: Mikhail Shapiro, Yuxing Yao, and Stella Luo Mechanochemistry is the study of chemical reactions that are induced by mechanical force. This field provides opportunities for noninvasive drug delivery systems that can be activated using biocompatible ultrasound. The common way to activate a mechanophore is to incorporate it into a polymeric ma terial that transduces mechanical forces required for the chemical reactions. However, the polymers can be diffused in the body before activation such that a carrier to precisely deliver the polymers i n vivo is needed. The carrier must incorporate and reta in the mechanophore's activation properties to be an effective drug release system that promises high spatial and temporal resolution via focused ultrasound activation. Hydrogel can act as a vehicle to retain the mechanophore for longer periods of time and allow for a controlled release upon ultrasound. In this work, the activation of the mechanophore incorporated in a gel matrix is investigated in an in vitro setting. This system has the potential to be controlled via ultrasound parameters with its extents under investigation in this study. The mechanisms of the activation of the mechanophore in solid state are being explored utilizing a new testing protocol that involves fUS activation of the gel within an acoustically transparent material as well as previ ously established methods. The novel application of focused ultrasound -activated mechanochemistry will enable new possibilities in the design of implantable drug -release vehicles. Exploring Lightweight Debiasing and Enhancing Robustness Through Data Augmentation in Pretrained Pengrui Rafal Kocielnik Large -scale pretrained language models, while revolutionary, can inadvertently incorporate biases from their training data, leading to potential unintended outcomes. Traditional debiasing methods, although effective, are resource -intensive and may adversely affect a model's linguistic capabilities. In contrast, lightweight debiasing offers a more efficient approach, but its effectiveness is often constrained and challenges in generalization arise. In response to these challenges, our research adopted a dual- pronged approach. We first investigated the Mass Memory Editing Technique, a novel lightweight method that modifies the original model by adjusting weights over specific critical layers. This was contrasted with the prevalent adapter tuning, an approach that retains and freezes the original model, introducing subsequent adapter layers for fine -tuning. Despite the Memory Editing Technique's prowess in targeted debiasing, its generalizability was limited. This realization transitioned our focus to the second phase: fortifying the robustness of lightweight debiasing through data augmentation tailored for adapter tuning. This involved the exploration of term -based, sentence -based, synonym -based, and task -based augmentations. Preliminary findings highlight that these augmentations not only enhance debiasing efficacy but also preserve the model's inherent linguistic strengths. Characterizing a Thruster Array Wate Shana Hartwick Mentors: Morteza Gharib and Sean Devey Traditional water tunnels used for fluid dynamics experiments push fluid through a large circuit, which include complicated features like turning vanes, diffusers, pumps, and more. Most of the body of a traditional water tunnel consists of these flow conditioning and straightening features; the test section is only a small percentage in comparison. An alternative water tunnel design and its characterization will be presented that takes up less space and resources than large circuit water tunnels but still has a comparable test section size. The design's flow velocity range and spatial and temporal characteristics were determined using particle image velocimetry (PIV). This facility will support a variety of research experiments, from fundamental fluid mechanics to the hydrodynamics of boxfish. Investigating the Stability of Metal Oxide Protection Layers for Solar Water Splitting Photocathodes Noah Hicks Mentors: Nathan S. Lewis and Alexandre Ye The development of renewable energy storage devices like photoelectrochemical cells (PECs) are crucial as we move towards a greener future. PECs utilize light- absorbing semiconductors with the appropriate bandgaps to excite charge carriers an d split water into oxygen and clean, renewable hydrogen. However, these devices are yet to make way in industry as they are most efficient in highly corrosive environments. Therefore, our goal is to find protection layers that can both stabilize the substrate (here the photocathode) and permit charge carrier flow. Here, we report the behavior of atomic layer deposited (ALD) metal oxide protection layers such as Ta 2O5, TiO 2, and HfO 2 on p-InP in spectroscopy (XPS) were physically characterize layers, while cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Mott Schottky analysis were used to electronically characterize the protection layers. Future research will include characterization of other metal oxides and eventually the optimization of a protective layer for the photocathode in H 2O, increasing the stability and practical usability of solar fuel cells as a renewable energy storage option. Querying Protein Interactions Software Package Using Eukaryotic Linear Motif Database Chi Hoang Mentors: Lior Pachter and Laura Luebbert Proteins in a cell fulfill their function by interacting with other proteins. One example are transcription factors, which are proteins that regulate gene expression levels. Transcription factors regulate gene expression by binding to DNA regulatory proteins. Similar to a key and lock mechanism, proteins have specific interaction domains for different tasks, which can be recognized from their amino acid sequence. Many human diseases, including most cancers, are caused by mutations of protein interaction domains. Understanding how changes in amino acid sequences disrupt protein interactions is crucial for mapping the potential pathological effects and predicting the consequences of a mutation. Here, I introduce a new Python and command line program, called gget elm , which allows researchers to identify protein interaction domains directly from an amino acid sequence or UniProt ID by pulling information from the Eukaryotic Linear Motifs (ELM) database. Instrumentation of an Ultrafast EELS Instrument Samuel A . Holloway Mentors: Scott Cushing and Nick Heller Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) is an analytical technique that uses excitation of electrons to discern changes in the electrical structure of a sample. This is done through the inelastic interaction of pump and probe electrons and electrons in a sample material. When the interaction occur s, the sample electrons create a \"hole\" in the atomic orbital due to excitation that can then be measured. What makes this EELS instrument different from other EELS instruments is its Electron- pump Electron- probe set up. The pump and probe electrons intera ct with and excite the valence band and conduction band of the sample through collision interactions. These interactions allow for an observer to view the electronic changes in a sample down to femtoseconds. The instrument itself combines ultrafast x -ray and ultrafast Transmission Electron Microscopy inherently, as most EELS set -ups can perform these tasks. The value in this form of spectroscopy is the capability to obtain a more detailed view of bond structures, chemistry, and electronic structure of thin samples compared to set -ups only using electrons in either the pump or the probe. The characterization of the element can be determined by the elements \"fingerprint\" as each element interacts with these excitations in different yet discernible ways. Unde rstanding Pupil Response Patterns in Autism Qianhui Hong Mentors: Ralph Adolphs, Qianying Wu, and Na Yeon Kim Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) features atypical social and emotional processing, which can be reflected in the pupil dilation response (PDR) to external audio -visual stimuli. This project aimed to quantify how different features in naturalistic movies affect pupil dilation using an eyetracking dataset collected in 20 healthy controls and 13 high- functioning ASD participants. In particular, we extr acted changes of the pupil diameter at a high sampling rate (600 Hz) while participants were watching 18 sounded, short YouTube movies. After data preprocessing and normalization, we found that the pupil diameter is affected by various factors in the movie , including lighting, changing of scenes, sound volume, emotion arousal, etc. Compared to the control group, the ASD group in general has greater dilation when the emotion arousal is high and when a new human subject appears. These preliminary findings can thus form the basis of fine -grained future analysis that will comprehensively characterize the importance of different features in inducing atypical pupil dilation patterns in ASD. Optimizing Small Molecule Mitophagy Modulators Ian Horsburgh Mentor s: Tsui-Fen Chou and William Rosencrans Macroautophagy, also referred to simply as autophagy, is a cellular system to degrade organelles or protein aggregates via the lysosome. The PINK1/Parkin pathway, which selectively targets damag ed mitochondria for autophagy, is often mutated in neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson's, causing a buildup of damaged mitochondria in neurons. Certain proteins are also known to be capable of initiating autophagy and activating them could help cle ar damaged mitochondria and thus improve neuronal health in patients with dysfunctional PINK1/Parkin. In this project, I use both computational and in vitro approaches to optimize small molecule binding efficiently to these proteins capable of inducing autophagy, thus enabling targeted degradation of damaged mitochondria. Accessible and Extensible System for Real -time Animal Tracking and Behavior Quantification Brian Hu Mentors: Athanassios Siapas and Jonathan Kenny The ability to provide feedback to animals in real time is an invaluable tool for neuroscience and animal research in general to establish causal relationships between stimuli and the corresponding behaviors. Recent advancements in deep learning have allow ed researchers to estimate animal poses in a non- invasive manner. However, experiments often require specialized hardware that can't be easily integrated with state -of-the-art machine learning algorithms. My project aims to bridge this accessibility gap and create RataGUI: an intuitive and extensible system that connects video streams from an arbitrary number of different cameras to a customizable processing pipeline with the ability to trigger external hardware. This integrated system enables real -time exp eriments with low - latency, closed -loop feedback to directly relate behavior with neural activity. RataGUI's modular structure streamlines user customization while also resulting in improved reproducibility as experimental parameters are automatically saved and restored. Written from the ground up entirely in Python, RataGUI's open- source codebase is designed to be extensible to user -submitted code and future innovations in computer vision. Benchmarking and Advancing SOTA Segmentation on Primates in the W ild Mark Hu Mentors: Pietro Perona and Markus Marks The fields of primatology, anthropology, and psychology currently rely heavily on visual imagery of primates in the wild, which is hard to capture accurately and requires time to process. Analyzing such data requires manual inspection, which is time -consuming and biased, and therefore can lead to errors that affect subsequent findings. Supervised Machine learning helps to automate the analysis process by training to predict humanly annotated labels for do mains where large -scale annotated datasets are available. In this project, we evaluate the performance of a combination of the Grounding DINO object detection model and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) on a dataset consisting of camera -trap primate images and hand -held recordings of chimpanzees collected by the Wild Minds Lab across field sites in Africa. By selecting input prompts to the models through manual inspection and random selection, we optimize the detection capabilities on the data. Our goal is to reach an accuracy rate of primate detection comparable to manual scanning, which allows primatologists to improve the efficiency and accuracy of work with video imagery of primate behavior. Scalable Gaussian Processes for Non- ergodic Earthquake Lavrentiadis Non-ergodic ground -motion models attempt to estimate the probability an earthquake will exceed a certain intensity and are used to assess the seismic hazard at nuclear power plant locations, among other applications in civil engineering. However, current codes scale cubically with the number of data points, severely limiting the size of processable datasets. This work applies recent state of the art results in sparse approxima te Cholesky factors to significantly accelerate the computations necessary in statistical inference. Our method enjoys a number of advantageous properties, including near -linear time and space efficiency, optimality in Kullback -Leibler divergence, and emba rrassingly parallel computation. We develop two code repositories: SparseKolesky.jl, a user -friendly, well - documented library for sparse factorization of generic covariance matrices and EarthquakeGPs.jl, specializing our methodology to earthquake models. W e write our codes in Julia, the high- performance scientific programming language with the intention of targeting supercomputing clusters. The project website and additional resources may be found at https://kolesky.cgdct.moe/. LunaX Moon Base Simulator - Exploring Lunar Development and Sustainability Bo-Ruei Huang Mentors: Yuk Yung and Jonathan Jiang The LunaX Moon Base Simulator project exemplifies a dynamic undertaking inspired by NASA's Artemis program, which seeks to reintroduce humans to lunar landsc apes and establish a self -sustaining lunar base by 2024. In response to this ambitious endeavor, we present an immersive video game experience that enables participants to delve into the intricacies of lunar development. Leveraging the versatile Unity platform, the game offers a comprehensive simulation of lunar base operations. Core features encompass sophisticated resource management, intricate life support systems, and strategic infrastructure creation. Players have the opportunity to construct their lunar base and formulate strategic approaches for sustainable development. The potential of this game transcends mere entertainment; it serves as an educational instrument, affording players insights into the multifaceted i ntricacies of lunar exploration and the challenges of establishing a habitable environment. By bridging the realms of gaming and tangible lunar endeavors, the LunaX Moon Base Simulator possesses the ability to ignite curiosity and cultivate enthusiasm for space exploration within a diverse array of audiences. Creating a Second LEONARDO (LEgs ONboARD drOne) With Updated Components and Revamped Hardware Fangyao Huang Mentor: Soon-Jo Chung LEONARDO is an innovative robotics system that combines a bipedal robot with a propeller -based stabilization system, this combination allows it to navigate terrain inaccessible to traditional bipedal robots while achieving higher energy efficiency compared to conventional drones in the same weight class. The existing LEONARDO robot has stayed relatively unchanged since its completion in order to preserve its functionality, this project seeks to create an updated version of the LEONARDO robot using existing designs but with updated hardware and software which would facilitate further testing of the bipedal -drone system. One such test involves the installation of wheels onto LEONARDO which would allow it to traverse flat terrain at a significantly higher energ y efficiency; ongoing efforts have been made to enable cooperation between multiple robots made possible by the construction of a second LEONARDO. Preventing False Scientific Predictions in Quantum Experiments Jerry Huang Mentors: John Preskill and Hsin- Yuan Huang Learning properties of quantum systems is an important task for developing quantum technologies. Since obtaining new quantum data is usually expensive, scientists will often reuse the data to predict many properties. However, quantum experimenta tion is inherently an adaptive process where the scientist will typically decide what to test after seeing previous results on the data, and improperly reusing this data can lead to false predictions. In this work, we show that for certain properties, it i s in general impossible to design an algorithm that can prevent this failure when predicting many adaptively -chosen properties. Specifically, when predicting adaptive local and Pauli observables, we proved a polynomial lower bound in the number of queries for the required number of samples of the quantum state. However, predicting many adaptive properties becomes possible for bounded Frobenius -norm observables, where we designed an algorithm that requires only a logarithmic number of samples with no depende nce on the dimension of the state. Exploration of the Learning From Hints Paradigm Paul Huang Mentor: Yaser S. Abu- Mostafa In machine learning, the goal is often to approximate some unknown target function by utilizing learning algorithms to exploit the information contained in the training data distribution. While raw training data serves as a foundational input, there is potential in utilizing transformed versions of this data. Such transformations convey human knowledge about the target function, acting as \"hints\" for the learning algorithms. Although the concept of using hints in learning algorithms has been widely studied in machine learning literature, most works focused on data augmentation, also known as duplicate examples. This narrowe d focus has ignored the potential of another effective hinting technique - the deployment of virtual examples. Virtual examples offer the advantage of guiding the model to learn hints in a broader input domain, as opposed to the limited scope of duplicate examples confined to the training data distribution. Our research focuses on the utilization of virtual examples as a hint -providing mechanism, testing their efficacy against using duplicate examples as hint -providers. We evaluate these techniques based on the resulting model's performance and robustness on both data highly correlated to the training set and out-of-distribution data that models have not seen in the training stage. A Type Checker for Mathematical Proofs Written in LaTeX Zachary Huang Mentor : Adam Blank The primary goal of this project is to answer the question: how can we best apply modern programming language technologies in order to help students learn proof -based discrete mathematics? A tool which could analyze student proofs written in LaTeX and identify common mistakes such as type mismatches and circular logic would be invaluable to the learning process and help students improve the rigor of their mathematical proofs. The objective is to implement such a tool and test its effectiveness in CS 13, a new course on discrete mathematics intended for CS majors. LaTeX, however, is quite difficult to analyze statically, but if we ignore the advanced features of LaTeX, we can parse out the overall textual and mathematical content of proofs using a context -free grammar. We can then fit a Hindley -Milner -like type system onto the extracted mathematical content to perform type inference/checking in a similar manner to functional programming languages. We cover the main \"data types\" of discrete math, including numbers (naturals, integers, rationals, and reals), sets, and sequences. In addition, the system can process arithmetic operations, inequalities, set operations, and more. Then, pattern- matching can be used to perform ad -hoc proof recognition and analysis. Development of Ca -Isotope Spectrometer for Monitoring of Bone Mineral Density Mentors: Mitchio Okumura and Termeh Bashiri In micro -gravity environments, individuals have experienced rapid bone loss and osteoporosis. Presently, there is no technology that will allow for in- flight monitoring. Furthermore, calcium isotope fractionation has preliminarily been related as a possibl e biomarker for bone loss. As such, the development of an analysis tool for the determination of calcium isotopes is being pursued. Optogalvanic spectroscopy (OGS) has been identified as having an ultrasensitive detection capability and is being utilized t o obtain spectra of calcium isotopes. Further work includes obtaining spectra, analysis of calcium ratios, development of cell for samples, and enhancing spectral clarity. Gaussian Process Regression With a Random Kernel Produced By a Mondrian Process Evelyn Huerta Mentors: Houman Owhadi, Ricardo S. Baptista, and Eliza W. O'Reilly There are numerous techniques used for predictive modeling, such as random forests, neural networks, Gaussian process regressi on, etc. They each possess different strengths and weaknesses, thus they perform better on specific types of data sets. In particular Gaussian process regression with a common kernel such as a RBF (radial basis function) or linear kernel perform well on co ntinuous data but poorly on discontinuous data. Thus a common approach to fit discontinuous data accurately is to use discontinuity detection algorithms before applying predictive modeling technique. However, our approach is to attempt to use a Gaussian pr ocess with a random Mondrian kernel to directly generate a discontinuous function that fits the discontinuous data and avoid the discontinuity detection step altogether. The success of this project will improve the accuracy of fitting discontinuous functio ns while minimizing computational cost. Topological Transport Induced by Coherent Phonons William Hunt Mentors: Gil Refael and Iliya Esin Periodic drives can induce a wide range of exotic phases beyond those accessible at equilibrium, including generating non- trivial topological transport properties 'on demand.' Here, we demonstrate that periodically driving a conducting wire with coherent p honons induces a steady state with a quantized current response. The quantized current arises from a drive-induced topological Floquet spectrum, and non- equilibrium steady state occupation stabilized by coupling to a low -temperature heat bath. We present a simple analytical model of the steady -state and quantized current by modeling weak phonon driving and coupling to a heat bath in a Lindblad master equation. We support these analytical results with a numerical analysis of a coherent -phonon- driven lattice model. Our results suggest, that quantized current is a characteristic feature of coherent phonons and therefore can be used in the detection of coherent phonons. Characterization of Swarming and Collective Behavior in Brine Shrimp (Artemia salina) Populations Joonha Hwang Mentors: John Dabiri and Nina Mohebbi Studying collective animal behavior requires a multidisciplinary approach with context provided by organismal biology, statistical mechanics, lab and field studies, and computational modeling. Previous studies have investigated the diel migration of brine shrimp (Artemia salina) and the hydrodynamics of induced vertical swarm motion. We propose a set of metrics to characterize this collective behavior, including velocity distributions, nearest neighbor distances, and the polarity coefficient . We examine the effects of agent density and light source properties on these metrics to evaluate their effectiveness and discuss causes for trends present. Further studies, such as one on collective wake p ropagation of brine shrimp, may leverage these metrics to analyze gathered swarm data and validate theoretical models. Investigating the Role of Non -NF2 Genes in Meningioma- Genesis Using Raja Paediatric meningiomas have been shown to exhibit unique clinical features such as a higher mitotic index and more frequent invasion when compared to their adult counterparts. Most paediatric cases, like adult meningiomas, show abundant alterations in the NF2 gene, but the overall mutational genetic landscape for these tumours remains poorly characterised. Using CRISPR/Cas9 - mediated mutagenesis in the zebrafish embryo, we have generated, in combination with NF2 knockouts, knock -outs of ten candidate genes will validate the guide RNAs for these genes and ascertain knock -out success by quantitating the efficiency of mutagenesis. Using a meninges -specific transgenic line, we expect to quantify in vivo cellular proliferation across the knockouts to decipher the cumulative effect of mutations in meningioma -genesis. Comparative Neuroanatomical Analysis of Peripheral and Defense Circui try in Rove Beetles Maria Jaimes Mentors: Joe Parker, Jess Kanwal, and Jaison Omoto Selective ecological pressures often lead to the evolution of novel anatomical structures which require concurrent changes in the central and peripheral nervous system. D espite the importance of evolutionary changes to the nervous system, how neural circuits are rewired to control novel structures remains largely understudied. Here, we aimed to identify how peripheral circuits have been evolutionarily modified to alter motor behavior and enable the control of an anatomically novel exocrine defense system in free -living versus socially symbiotic rove beetles . Rove beetles are a hyperdiverse clade that have convergently evolved multiple times toward symbiotic interactions with ants from an ancestral free -living state. We first mapped and compared the central nervous system neuroarchitecture of the free -living, Dalotia coriaria Using immunostaining and dye injection proto cols, we identify the major segments of the ventral nerve cord (VNC) as well as expression pattern of motor neurons responsible for leg movements . Furthermore, we attempted mapping the efferent and afferent nerve connections between the abdominal defense g land and the VNC. Our neuroanatomical mappings provides the first comparative analysis of the motor system between rove beetle species and bring us closer to uncovering neurobiological mechanisms underlying the evolution of species interactions. Safety Aware Human Robot Collaboration: A System to Fuse Human Intention Estimation and Multiple Robust Backup Controllers Neil Janwani Mentor: Joel Burdick Human Robot Collaboration is an important paradigm in the field of robotics, and has been the subject of intense research. Here, robots may be required to follow trajectories that satisfy complex safety constraints and reach goals that align with their human partner's intention. However, state -of-the-art systems currently achieve only one of these objectives -resulting in robots that either provide safer guarantees (rather than always safe guarantees) or robots that do not utilize human intention to adjust safety behavior. For instance, choosing backup, safe behaviors for robot motion, like stopping or changing orientation, may depend on high level goals such as mission objectives. Thus, we present a pre -trainable, online robust safety system with minimal violations and conservatism for enhanced human robot collaboration and safety. A neural network will be use d to translate multi -modal robot and human input into a choice of backup controller -represented as a control barrier function. The robustness of the backup safe sets will be addressed by utilizing a Gaussian Process -based online residual dynamics estimator and its forward propagation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on a tracked robot in various environments with backup control requirements. With our intention- aware backup safe control method, the robot remains safe. On a Conjecture on the Values of Psi Correlators Toyesh Jayaswal Mentor: Tim -Henrik Buelles Moduli spaces are parameter spaces for certain geometric objects which allow for the study of enumerative problems, that is counting how many objects satisfy certain constraints, through cohom ological methods. One important class of spaces is the moduli space of stable curves, and psi correlators are numbers naturally arising from their cohomology. They give insight to the geometry of the spaces, but while recursive formulas exist, an explicit formula is deemed intractable. This project explores a conjecture by Liu and Xu stating that these numbers should be maximized when certain parameters are evenly distributed by analyzing different methods that can be used for computation. We prove the conj ecture for the case of two -correlators by analyzing an explicit formula recently derived by Zograf. Understanding the relationships between these numerical values could provide insight into geometric problems which can be solved using psi correlators. Developing End- user AI Inspection Tools for Large Language and Vision- Text Models Roy Jiang Mentors: Anima Anandkumar and Rafal Kocielnik Modern language and vision models learn implicit social biases such as gendered and racial prejudices due to the media and texts they are trained on, which may propagate discriminatory effects where AI is employed. As such, methods for bias detection and quantification understandable to non- technical social experts is imperative. Existing methods for auditing models prov e inadequate, relying on the use of fixed datasets and being severely unusable for non-technical experts. This project aimed to address these issues through the design, development, and iteration of end -user tools for the inspection of stereotypical bias i n state -of-the-art large language (LLM) and text -vision AI models. These tools were developed through a process of UI/UX prototyping, technical feasibility evaluations, as well as stress testing with novice users and both technical and non- technical experts. Currently, we have a working version of the LLM testing tool and an initial prototype of the text -vision tool on the HuggingFace platform. We conclude that such a task is accompanied by challenges in balancing, efficiency, clarity and faithfulness, and that these tools are a necessary step in the development of fairer AI. Lastly, we recommend more principled evaluation of the tools with the target audience of social scientists and ethics experts. Kilonova Light Curves of HD 222925's Progenitor Ian Johns on Mentors: Erika Holmbeck and Ryan Patterson Despite their familiarity on Earth, the origin of elements heavier than iron remains mysterious. Currently, the leading theory for heavy element nucleosynthesis is that a majority of observed isotopes are form ed in neutron star mergers, visible though the \"kilonovae\" that proceed them. Owing to their rarity, studying kilonovae presents an observational problem and a limited sample size. In this work, we reproduce the light curves associated with past mergers. S pecifically, we derive a kilonova light curve from the elemental abundances of the \"gold standard\" star HD 222925, which is metal -poor and thought to be enriched by a single neutron star merger. We find a variety of simulated neutron star merger models wer e able to reproduce HD 222925's observed abundances; therefore, we construct their corresponding light curves in hopes of distinguishing between valid merger models. We find that the merger models produce light curves that are observationally too alike to distinguish between. Moving forward, performing this analysis on more stars like HD 222925 should yield a robust population of kilonova light curves to better inform future models and live observations. Creating an Intuitive XR Space for Efficient 3D Data Inspection and Direct Manipulation Supported by 2D and 3D Interfaces Sam Johnson- Lacoss Mentors: Santiago Lombeyda and S. George Djorgovski There are certain phenomena that in order to be fully understood, one must first grasp their three -dimensional spatial relations. For these situations, two dimensional screens and a passive point -of-view fail to allow a viewer to fully utilize the extent of our cognitive faculties to understand thre e dimensional structures and retain those intricacies. As such, extended reality environments often prioritize the third dimension in representations of data, in the attempt to provide clearer insight into these phenomena. However, this priority often negl ects data that is more effectively conveyed by both two -dimensional and complex connected three -dimensional representations, rendering such data difficult to navigate in an efficient or meaningful way. This project defines an intuitive and efficient extend ed reality space for object -focused visualization that combines two - and three -dimensional interaction techniques as well as representations, to create a tool for more efficient and meaningful data analysis. Developing an Inner Cell Mass Model Using Exten ded Pluripotent Stem Cells and Embryonic Stem Magdalena Zernicka -Goetz and Sergi Junyent As cells continue to split after initial fertilization, they eventually begin to differentiate into three cell types: Epiblas t cells that give rise to all the cells in the body, Primitive endoderm cells (PrE) that give rise to the yolk sack surrounding the organism, and Trophectoderm cells that become the placenta. The Inner Cell Mass (ICM) refers to the collection of Epiblast and PrE c ells inside the trophectoderm layer. There is often difficulty in studying the development of the ICM because of this trophectoderm layer, creating the need for a model that mimics ICM development. Extended Pluripotent Stem Cells (EPSCs) were used to create this model by collecting small aggregates of them in cells numbers that resemble the ICM, as EPSCs have been shown to be capable of giving rise to both cell fates within the inner cell mass. Markers specific to PrE and Epiblast cells were used to visuali ze and justify the components of these models. The optimization of this model is ongoing as data and results are still being collected to verify this model. MineDojo 2: A Minecraft Environment With a Unified Observation and Action Space to Build More Powe rful Embodied Agents Bilal Khan Mentor s: Anima Anandkumar and Guanzhi Wang Fan et al. 2022 introduced MineDojo : an environment built in Minecraft for training reinforcement learning agents on open -ended tasks. Recently, Wang et al. 2022 introduced Voyager, an LLM -powered agent that interacts with Minecraft through text observations and high- level actions using a text -only environment to solve complex tasks. To combine the strengths of MineDojo and Voyager and solve the most difficult open- ended tasks in Minecraft, we develop MineDojo 2: a Minecraft environment with a unified observation and action space that provid es access to both visual and text -based observation APIs and both high- level and low -level action APIs to build more powerful embodied agents. Developing a Secondary LEONARDO (LEgsONbARDdrOne) System Matteo Kimura Mentor: Soon- Jo Chung This project focused on developing an updated LEONARDO system, a bipedal robot enhanced with quadcopter motors, to utilize new hardware and an updated control system. I worked on determining new, updated hardware to integrate onto a second version of the L EONARDO robot in addition to rewriting parts of the software to reflect these changes in the hardware. Developing this system has been relatively successful, however, there were several challenges that had to be overcome with troubleshooting much of the ne w hardware and integrating it with the rest of the system. Overall, this secondary LEONARDO provides an exciting updated and adequate test platform to continue testing multimodal forms of robotic locomotion. Exploring Highly Energetic bb Signatures From the NMSSM at the LHC Stavros Klaoudatos Maria Spiropulu Xie The -to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM), motivated by the -problem present in the N=1 extension of the Standard Model, the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, in its soft supersymmetry breaking term gives rise to a trilinear coupling between 3 fields, which yields a cross section for the cascade decay of the form X -> HY. Exploring this cascade decay can give us insights into the self -coupling constants of the Higgs, whose understanding can help us better comprehend the nature of the Higgs Boson and it's potential. This study presents the terms describing said decay and presents the findings from simulations based on CMS 2017 conditions, on said cascade decay quantities. Additionally, machine learning methods for particle reconstruction in the CMS are explored, making use of signal and background data generated from the simulation. Magnetic Field Effects on the Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reactivity o f CoPi/CoBi Catalysts for Applications in Sustainable Hydrogen Production and Artificial Photosynthetic Devices Hermann F. Klein- Hessling Barrientos Mentors: Ryan G. Hadt and Ruben Mirzoyan In an effort to transition away from fossil fuels , photoelectrochemical water -splitting presents a promising avenue to generate sustainable molecular hydrogen as a fuel source and molecular oxygen as a biproduct on the commercial scale. The kinetic and thermodynamic barrier behind this process is the oxygen evolution re action (OER), which involves the transfer of 4 protons and 4 electrons to form the oxygen- oxygen bond. This study investigates the effects of a directional, uniform, and tunable externally applied magnetic field on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of the phosphate -based and borate -based amorphous cobalt oxide thin films, which serve as oxygen evolution catalysts (OEC's). These films are of particular interest since they consist of abundant earth materials, are low -cost, operate at neutral pH, and have self -healing properties. A magneto - electrochemical setup was designed and 3D printed to investigate how varying strengths of a magnetic field influence the OER performance in these catalysts. Increases in OER catalytic activity of up to an order of magnitude, as defined by Tafel Slope analysis, was observed at highest attainable field strength of 1.4 T. The observed magnetic field effect was found to be dependent on film thickness, pH, and film composition (i.e., electrodeposited from either phosphate vs. borate buffers). The results offer unique insights into the capabilities of magnetic field enhancing OER catalysis in amorphous cobalt oxide films, and further supports the yet -inconclusive intramolecular oxygen radical (O*) coupling mechanism for the oxygen evolution rate determining step between adjacent Co oxo units. Devising an Algorithm to Predict Viscoelastic Properties of the Brain From Magnetic Resonance Elastography Rohan Kolhe Mentors: Mikhail Shapiro and (Amir) Hossein Salahshoor The brain is a highly heterogeneous media with patient -specific material properties. Accelerated and accurate prediction of the spatially -varying material properties in a personalized manner is useful for many therapeutic applications. This project focuses on creating a computational model to find viscoelastic properties of the brain using displacement field data that is obtained from procedures like magnetic resonance elastography. We were able to complete a computational framework to derive the heterogeneous properties from the strain field data. Our physics -based approach utilizes advanced clustering techniques in data science. We showcase our approach in simple models, like a block of heterogeneous soft gel. Future steps will apply this algorithm to strain fields of the brain under ultrasound pressure to understand how ultrasound affects the elasticity of the brain. Position -Specific Carbon Isotope Analysis of Tree Ring Cellulose via Orbitrap Mass Spectrometry Celia Kong -Johnson Mentors: Alex Sessions and Hannah Dion- Kirschner Tree rings are a critical archive for paleoclimate research, and the carbon isotope composition ( 13C) of their cellulose records information about past climate, including water availability. However, exis ting methods for isotopic measurements of tree rings combine signals from environmental changes and tree physiology. We are developing a new method of position- specific carbon isotope analysis ( 13C-PSIA) to differentiate between these two signals using Orbitrap mass spectrometry. This method requires the conversion of whole wood to gluconate without altering 13C values of cellulose in preparation for PSIA via Orbitrap. We tested protocols to purify cellulose from wood, hydrolyze glucose from cellulose, and oxidize glucose to gluconate, with the best methods to date achieving 50 - 70%, 40- 55%, and 70 -75% yields, respectively. After further optimization, we have confirmed that our cellulose purification process yields pure cellulose with no side products and does not fractionate carbon isotopes. Additional analyses are required to ensure no fractionation is occurring throughout the other conversion processes. The preparatory chemistry we have developed enables Orbitrap PSIA of cellulose, which will help distinguish environmental and physiological signals in tree rings and allow paleoclimatologists to reconstruct climate variations more accurately. Mechanical Characterization of Chainmail -inspired Mechanical metamaterials are novel architected structures composed of interlocked unit cells. Their mechanical characteristics can be tuned to fulfil specific energy absorption demands by varying cell geometry, topology, and crystallography. Of particular interest is the shear response of these structures, as they demonstrate a region of zero stress that is fluid -like and a non- zero region analogous to solids, demarcated by a phase transition point. The phase transition point was found to be tunable by varying the angular arrangement of the chains. Rheological testing again revealed fluid -like decreasing trends in the storage and loss moduli until a similar critical strain was reached, after which the moduli increased sharply. This solid -like behavio r observed in the shear and rheology tests was further investigated via quasi- static tensile experiments. Certain geometric and topological configurations of the chainmail had the ability to withstand 10% strain, while the material elongation at break is around 6%. Finally, tensile experiments were conducted on chains composed of interconnected trefoil knots, revealing drastic changes in stiffness with varying rotational angles. Collectively, the tunability of chainmail structures provide opportunities to service diverse areas such as robotics and structural protection, among others. Recyclable Porous Carbon Solids for Oxygen Recovery in Long- Term Space Exploration Alice Kutsyy Mentors: Katherine Faber and Laura Quinn The Sabatier reactor has traditionally been utilized for CO 2 to O 2 recycling within spacecraft cabins. However, only around 50% of oxygen is recovered, so recent work has been done to add a methane pyrolysis reactor, which breaks down methane and increases oxygen recovery to nearly 100%. This groundbreaking technology only has carbon as its byproduct, which is then deposited onto high- surface area carbon capture substrates. However, the consumable substrates required for long -term exploration are heavy - about of the system weight for a 1000 -day mission. Therefore, this study aims to design a porous carbon solid that can be used, broken down into a powder, then remade into a fresh substrate. Crucially, this solid must be entirely composed of carbon to keep the chemical composition constant despite carbon deposition across lifecycles. Sample substrates were provided by Honeywell Aerospace, which were then characterized via scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X -ray diffraction analysis, and mercury porosimetry to determine the ideal properties of the final porous solids. These substrates were broken down into a powder using various crushing processes, including a sledgehammer and a ball mill. The ball milling process was optimized by exploring various parameters such as solvents, milling media, and rinse conditions. Subsequently, the resulting powder was freeze -cast, yielding various porous carbon solids by adjusting freezing conditions, sintering temperature, and solvent selection. These newly formed specimens were characterized and compared against the original substrates before being broken back down into a powder. This study can help evaluate how the carbon capturing substrates in the methane pyrolysis may be broken down, as well as explore freeze-c asting as a new fabrication method for such substrates. Progress Toward a Divergent Total Synthesis of the Mitomycins Lulu Kwan Mentors: Brian Stoltz and Kevin Gonzalez Mitomycins are a family of natural products which have been of interest to the scientific community due to their potent anticancer properties. Since their isolation in 1965, only two total syntheses of any A or B series mitomycin have been achieved. Although successful, these syntheses were racemic and lacked divergence due to the comple x framework of the mitomycins. A novel route to synthesise mitomycin B will allow for the preparation of non- natural analogues and will open up routes to create mitomycins of other series. Our route centres around accessing a key vinyl- quinone to use as an electrophilic coupling partner. Successful amination of this quinone will forge a crucial C - N bond and will enable completion of our total synthesis via an asymmetric, convergent total synthesis of mitomycin B. Using Machine Learning to Classify Autism From Oculomotor Features Audrey Lai Mentors: Ralph Adolphs and Na Yeon Kim Quantifying gaze behavior through eye tracking has unveiled distinct patterns in autism, offering potential for screening and diagnosis. However, it has been difficult to identify reliable visual features that can be used to distinguish autism across different studies. This project investigates whether autism can be classified using oculomotor features obtained over a sufficiently long and diverse set of stimuli, without needing to decompose the stimuli into specific objects such as faces. Participants with autism (N = 13) and control participants (N = 19) completed a series of tasks using a Tobii eye tracker. These tasks consisted of well- validated measures to prompt specific eye movements, as well as naturalistic viewing of images and movies. We established an optimal method for characterizing oculomotor events (e.g., fixations, saccades, and smooth pursuit) through the application of a machine learning -based algorithm. We then compared properties of those events, such as duration, velocity, and acceleration, between the autism and control groups. The findings will advance our understanding of oculomotor signatures in autism, and have the potential to enhance early detection of autism. On-chip Sample Interactions in LNOI Tze King Lam Mentors: Scott Cushing and Emily Hwang To realize on- chip sample interactions for fully integrated entangled photon spectroscopy, inline spectral filters and sample interaction architectures must be developed to distinguish pump photon excitations from entangled photon light-matter interactions and facilitate measurable on- chip sample interactions. Using ANSYS Lumerical, we have computationally explored a long -pass filter design based on directional couplers (DC) in the lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) platform. This DC filter design can theoretically attenuate the pump light (406 nm) by 15 dB while enabling near 100% transmission at the downconverted entangled pair center wavelength (800 -830 nm). A linear taper (LT) was also optimized to combine the filter with an on- chip spontaneous parametr ic down conversion (SPDC) source on the same material platform. Finally, simulated transmission spectra for polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) doped with indocyanine green (ICG) on a straight waveguide suggested the viability of sample interaction mediated by the coupling of the fundamental TE mode with the cladding. Progress in the Electrochemical Carboxylation of Aryl Aldehydes Mentors: Karthish Manthiram and Thu Ton Electrochemical carboxylation has emerged as a promising method for converting C O 2 into value -added organic compounds. The electrochemical carboxylation of organic compounds has several advantages, such as using a non-toxic and abundant carbon source to perform C -C bond formation. Additionally, the electrochemical carboxylation of aldehy des results in the synthesis of alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), a commercially significant compound. A sacrificial -anode free method for the electrochemical carboxylation of benzaldehyde to mandelic acid was studied. Efforts focused on increasing the faradaic efficiency and yield by attempting to reduce the hydrogenation side reaction. Preparing electrolytes in water -free environments suggest that reducing the water content of salts and solvents increases the faradaic efficiency of the reaction. Future work will focus on the development of a high performance liquid chromatography method for the simultaneous quantification of mandelic acid, benzaldehyde, and other side products in the reaction mixture. Cross -Talk and Higher Order Computations in Nuclear Receptor s Jordan Lay Mentors: Michael Elowitz and Yodai Takei Nuclear receptors (NRs) are ideal drug targets since they act as both signal receptors and transcription factors. They are of great interest medically and biologically due to their involvement in various physiological functions and diseases. Understanding the architecture of receptor interactions and the resulting cellular changes will enable improved drug design and inform biological programming efforts. Despite this importance, a detailed understandi ng of cross -talk between receptors is lacking, as previous studies primarily focused on individual components in isolation rather than an interacting network. Thus, this project explores how NRs as a system compute \"inputs\" by sensing multi -dimensional ligand environments and perform the appropriate \"outputs\" by executing transcriptional programs that determine cell fate. We induced human liver hepatoma cell lines, an ideal model system exhibiting high NR activity, with various combinations of receptor agonists and analyzed the resulting transcriptomic changes with barcoded bulk polyA mRNA sequencing followed by identification of differentially expressed genes. To generate a more comprehensive understanding of combinatorial NR systems, future work involves expanding the methodology to single -cell technology, incorporating information from receptor binding locations on the genome, and developing high- throughput nascent RNA sequencing methods to improve temporal resolution. Accessing Medium Vinyl Cyclic structural motifs are commonly found in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and advanced materials. Among cyclic compounds, 5 - to 6-membered rings are the most prevalent due to their stability and ease of preparation. Synthetic methods for small -ring cyclic structures (5 -7 membered rings) have been well -established and developed. However, these methods encounter challenges when attempting to achieve the synthesis of medium - sized rings (8 -11 membered cycles). Medium -sized rings possess torsional and transannular strains, rendering them less stable and consequently more difficult to synthesize. The Nelson Lab has recently laid the foundation for generating vinyl carbocation intermediates through Lewis acid -weakly coordinating anion catalysis. In this study, we present a catalytic method for synthesizing medium -sized ring systems via intramolecular Friedel -Crafts reactions of vinyl carbocations. Using Supervised Machine Learning to Predict the Regioselectivity of C -H Oxidation Sites in Complex Molecules Gina Lee Mentors: Sarah Jules Schleinitz, and Alba Carretero Targeted C -H oxidations, which split C -H bonds into C -O bonds, can derive complex molecules from other pre - existing molecules rather than synthesizing them de novo . As a resul t, they allow for greater efficiency in the synthesis of complex molecules. However, due to the multitude of existing sites where oxidation may occur, it is extremely difficult to manually pinpoint the most effective site to create the product. Thus, this project aims to utilize supervised machine learning to predict the most reactive sites within a complex molecule, where the desired product will be created. A Random Forest model, which utilizes a \"wisdom of the crowd\" method by generating numerous decision trees, is used, and a set of electronic descriptors are generated through quantum chemical methods for each carbon atom in the data set. The model is then tested and run through the data set of 288 unique reactions using their descriptors, with the reactions split between the testing and training sets. The accuracies are then compared to a baseline established by a method based on the atoms' Gasteiger charges, and the model is improved based on its performance with numerous proportions of testing and training data splits. Engineering TEV Protease to Increase Auxin Sensitivity in a Macrophage -CAR-T Cell Circuit Mengziang Lei Mentors: Michael Elowitz and Kaiwen Luo Numerous attempts have been made to circumvent the challenge of antigen heterogeneity in CAR T cell therapy. Nevertheless, these attempts typically rely on a single -cell design, which does not address T -cell infiltration issues, and may have a potential inability to achieve complete tumor killing. A macrophage -CAR-T two cell circuit has been conducted in mammalian cells with the bio -orthogonal auxin to amplify signals from rare tumor -exclusive antigens. The TEV protease in the T cells constantly cuts the CAR and can be inhibited by the auxin. However, the current system exhibits limited responsiveness to the auxin. In this study, to increase CAR -T cells' sensitivity to the auxin signal, we engineered the TEV protease to possess reduced stability or decreased efficiency by introducing mutations, improving the auxin- inducible degron, and attaching additional degron. Even though introducing new mutations into the TEV protease did not improve auxin sensitivity, in the end, we produced a TEV protease with a DHFR tag that led to 49% CAR -T cell activation rate in response to the auxin and are ready to test it in the killing assay. Targeted Recombination in Active Populations of Photo -stimulated Neurons: Developing a Functional Label of Subcircuits Within an Aggression Locus Mark J. Lewis Mentor s: David Anderson and Amit Vinograd Targeted recombination in Active Populations (TRAP) is a genetic labelling technique used to fluorescently mark cells expressing activity -dependent CreER T2 within a limited timeframe. Anderson et al. have identified and correlated a small population of neurons in the ventrolateral sublocus of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) with aggressive behaviors in mice. Inducing aggression states in the presence of injectable tamoxifen results in distinct labelling of VMHvl neurons, as well as its upstream/downstream projections. Photo -stimulation uses optogenetic sensors and actuators to render a cell \"active\" for a highly controllable period of time. We present a novel combination of these methods to allow for the robust labelling of an aggression subcircuit in the VMHvl with minimal noise. Closed Geodesics on Genus 0 Triangular Unitary Shimura Curve Guanxi Li Mentor: Elena Mantovan Shimura varieties have become the center of the study of number theory in recent years. In this project, we will explore the number -theoretic properties of closed geodesics on triangular unitary shimura curves. Sarnak has shown that the geodesic on the projected upper half -plane that connects real points has a compact image under projection onto the modular curve if and only if it has non- trivial stabilizers generated by one element. Additionally, Sarnak has shown the number -theoretic property of the length and multiplicity of closed geodesics on shimura curves. Bekki later generalizes the statements regarding endpoints and stabilizers of the modular curve to quaternionic shimura curves and the (2,3,7)- shimura curve. In this project, we generalized these statements for triangular unitary shimura curves, specifically for the case of (2,3,10) triangle group, for which we obtained the explicit representation of the group and also the expression for the endpoints of the geodesics. We generalized Sarnak result regarding length and multiplicity to the (2,3,10)- unitary shimura curve, which states that the length of the closed geodesics is 2log( ), where is the fundamental relative unit of Q( 5)(D)/Q(5), and we conjectured the multiplicity of the geodesics to b e (5)(), the narrow class number of the field Q( 5)(D). This conjecture could be potentially proven by establishing one -to one correspondence between primitive hyperbolic elements in the triangle group and equivalent classes of quadratic forms. Proteomics Examination and Structural Elucidation and Phospholipase A2 Activating Protein Mutant and Interaction -Containing a regulatory element that modulates phospholipase (specifically PLA2) and its disease mutant was linked to lethal neurodevelopmental disruption and autism spectrum disorder. This project seeks to uncover PLAA mutant structure as potential therapeutic target and further the understa nding of PLAA regulated ubiquitination processes, which have been lowly characterized during mammalian neurodevelopmental processes. Additionally, proteomics examination will reveal binding confirmation PLAA and P97, a cancer therapeutic target valosine -containing protein, and trace out related co -factors. Lastly, Cryogenic Electron Microscopy and computationally assisted folding models was adopted to characterize the binding moiety between PLAA -P97 and mutant structure of PLAA. The Abundances of CO, H 2O, and OCS in Venus's Atmosphere From Observations and Modeling Ting-Juan Liao Mentors: Yuk. L. Yung, Eliot Young, and Mark Bullock Scientific investigation into Venus's atmosphere has spotlighted gaps in photochemical models' ability to explain the trace ga s species distribution. Key elements such as CO and OCS are essential to Venus's sulfur cycle and cloud formation. To understand the abundance and variability of these trace gases before the DaVinci probe's descent, we launched an observational study using NASA's IRTF telescope equipped with the ISHELL high- resolution spectrometer. From June 11 to June 30, 2023, we captured K, H, and J -band spectra of Venus's night side, utilizing the SMART software to calculate synthetic spectra across various gas abundanc es and emission angles. Our high- resolution spectral data (R= /~25,000) enabled the successful mapping of CO, H 2O, and OCS abundances in the equatorial region, revealing daily and latitudinal variations. We specifically examined the sensitive balance between chemistry and transport, as indicated by the anti -correlation between OCS and CO abundance with cloud opacity. Through near -IR observations, this study seeks to untangle the complex interaction between atmospheric dynamics and chemical reac tions in Venus's cloud formation. We contribute insights into the observed cloud patterns and the relationship between atmospheric chemistry, dynamics, and cloud creation on Venus, thereby providing vital parameters to refine photochemical models. Profili ng of Synthetic Transcription Factors to Uncover Design Principles of Combinatorial Gene Regulation Emily Lin Mentors: Michael Elowitz and Evan Mun Multicellular complexity requires the cooperation of thousands of specialized cell states derived from a si ngular genomic template. Each cell state is characterized by its distinct combination of transcription factors (TFs) which uniquely regulate the genome for that state. While traditional approaches to understanding natural gene regulation demonstrate the ne cessity of many individual TFs, they lack fundamental models of how a set of TF binding sites proximal to a gene produce a precise regulatory outcome. To uncover the rules that could underly a fundamental model of cis-regulation, we utilized a synthetic TF design to modularly recruit combinations of transcriptional effector domains, which are the components of TFs that dictate how the TF impacts the transcriptional output of a gene it is recruited to. Specifically, we examined how TFs respond to a controlle d perturbation of the positioning, co-recruitment, and timing of regulatory events. Our initial results quantified an efficacy decay that transcriptional effectors undergo over a shared length scale. Ongoing work intends to characterize synergistic and antagonistic transcriptional effector domain combinations. Our findings highlight the rules and limitations within eukaryotic cis-regulation, informing optimal design for synthetic regulatory schemes and providing the core of a fundamental model for predicting regulatory outcomes. Regioselective Aryl Amination With Hydroxylamine Ethan Lin Mentors: Frances Arnold and Kathleen Sicinski Primary arylamines are found in a range of valuable compounds from pharmaceuticals to organic semiconductors. Although there exist chemical methods to synthesize arylamines, many strategies use rare and expensive transition metals or toxic organic compound s to achieve site -selective amination. Enzyme biocatalysts present a greener alternative for site -selective synthesis of anilines, as enzymatic reactions occur in gentle aqueous conditions. Enzymes catalyze numerous diverse reactions in nature and have hig h chemo - and regioselectivity stemming from their innate three -dimensional and chiral active site. However, no native enzymes have been discovered to catalyze primary aryl amination with hydroxylamine in nature. Herein, we discovered a class of enzymes, pr otoglobins, that show basal activity towards amination of an activated arene, aniline. We then utilized reaction optimization to boost the yield of a thermostable Aeropyrum pernix foun d that addition of an iron reducing agent, sodium dithionite, improved the enzymatic yield of p- phenylenediamine (2 -fold) and o-phenylenediamine (1.3 -fold). Additionally, altering the reaction buffer from nitrogen- free minimal salt medium (pH 7.2) to potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8) improved yield 1.3 -fold. Utilizing optimized reaction conditions, we are performing error -prone PCR and site saturation mutagenesis to generate mutations of our lead biocatalyst. Utilizing General Vision Language Models for Animal Action Recognition Jonathan Lin Mentors: Pietro Perona and Markus Marks Accurate animal action recognition holds significant implications across diverse fields such as bioengineering, nature conservation, and pharmaceutical experimentation. A m ulti-species action recognition model offers distinct advantages over single -species models due to its versatile applicability and out -of-the-box capabilities. The current challenge with multi- species action recognition is the variety of ways different species of animals can accomplish the same action, such as climbing. We present a method for multi -species action recognition by utilizing Contrastive Language -Image Pre -Training (Radford et al., 2021) and X -CLIP (Ma et al., 2022). CLIP encodes a latent space between an image and a set of captions, while X -CLIP encodes a latent space between several images, across the temporal setting, and a set of captions. In this project, we present the results of action recognition by utilizing CLIP and X -CLIP with the general pre -trained weights. Our findings underscore the insufficiency of generalized pre -trained CLIP and X -CLIP models for precise atomic action recognition in the animal domain, emphasizing the necessity of custom pre -training to achieve heightened accurac y. Engineering Synthetic Allostery for Phosphorylation- Based Protein Circuits Meryl Liu Mentors: Michael B. Elowitz and Dongyang Li Phosphorylation is a ubiquitous post -translational modification, encoding information reversibly and dynamically in cellular signaling pathways. Synthetic protein circuits can reprogram cellular behaviors to function as sensors, switches, and amplifiers. In contrast to protease -based designs, kinase -driven phosphorylation promises to enable fast, reversible protein circuits that can sense and respond to various inputs, including endogenous signaling states and environmental stimuli. Current approaches include split -protein reconstitution and domain insertion, which require extensive fine -tuning for targets while the repertoire of engineered kinases is limited. However, mutating negatively -charged allosteric hotspots to phosphorylatable residues in physically contiguous, co -evolving sectors has previously achieved successful rewiring of yeast MAPK pathways. Here, we extend this strategy to expand the protein circuit toolbox by engineering allosterically -controlled human kinases. We developed a computational pipeline to conduct statistical coupling analysis and identify sector -connected solvent -accessible D/E residues throughout a eukaryotic kinome -wide sequence alignment. We then adapted imaging -based kinase translocation reporters for high- throughput kinase activity profiling using flow cytometry. We are conducting an alanine scan to distinguish functionally -coupled candidate residues for introducing phosphorylation motifs of an input kinase. Our work provides insights into allostery design principles and opens up avenues for the systematic development of phosphorylation- based protein circuits with composable engineered mammalian kinases. Tracking Erosion and Channel Morphologies of Single -Threaded Rivers in Permafrost Flume Experiments Zhuo (Andy) Liu Mentors: Michael P. Lamb and Maria N. Schmeer Permafrost environments are particularly vulnerable to climate change, and thawing of permafrost may significantly influence the dynamics of Arctic river systems. In single -threaded rivers, lateral erosion into floodplains and deposition of sediment in point bars alters the distribution of sediment and nutrients. However, no one has yet performed experiments of a single -threaded channel through a sand and ice mixture to study how permafrost distribution may change with riverbank erosion. We perform controlled laboratory experiments to maintain a single - threaded channel that can erode and deposit at both of its banks, with flow conditions of a natural river. We design a setup that allows us to examine the effects of sediment transport and riverbank erosion on river geometry in both unfrozen and frozen cases. We quantify sediment inputs and outputs using a sediment feeder at the head of the experimental channel and a sediment trap at the end. In addition, we use images from an array of cameras to measure channel geometry (slope, width, depth) and location during the experiments to obtain the erosion rate of the riverbanks and describe the evolution of the channel. We run an unfrozen experiment that tests our setup and data and image processing techniques. The unfrozen results will be used to describe the behavior of a dynamic river channel under unfrozen conditions in the lab and allow us to prepare future frozen experiments. Overall, these results have implications for experimental work on river channel evolution, ultimately contributing to the advancement of climate -resilient strategies for fluvial systems in permafrost environments. Tipping Point Forecasting in Non -Stationary Dynamics on Function Spaces Miguel Liu- Schiaffini Mentor: Anima Anandkumar Tipping points are abrupt, drastic, and often irreversible changes in the evolution of non- stationary and chaotic dynamical systems. For instance, increased greenhouse gas concentrations are predicted to lead to drastic decreases in low cloud cover, referred to as a climatological tipping point. In this paper, we learn the evolution of such non- stationary dynamical systems using a novel recurrent neural operator (RNO), which learns mappings between function spaces. After training RNO on only the pre-tipping dynamics, we employ it to detect future tipping points using an uncertainty -based approach. In particular, we propose a conformal prediction framework to forecast tipping points by monitoring deviations from physics constraints (such as conser ved quantities and partial differential equations), enabling forecasting of these abrupt changes along with a rigorous measure of uncertainty. We illustrate our proposed methodology on non- stationary ordinary and partial differential equations, such as the Lorenz -63 and Kuramoto -Sivashinsky equations. We also apply our methods to forecast a climate system tipping point in stratocumulus cloud cover. Whole -Cell Segmentation on Multi -Channel Images Using Self -Attention Mechanism YuHsiang Lo Mentors: Yisong Yue, Uriah Israel, Markus Marks, and Xuefei (Julie) Wang The advancements in biomedical image segmentation have enabled a better understanding of spatial and functional relationships of cells in tissues. With the introduction of multiplexed imaging, the number of concurrently quantifiable protein markers has increased, resulting in multi- channel images that provide improved opportunities for precise segmentation. However, existing segmentation models depend on fixed -channel input images, which restricts the information richness of bio datasets, as these datasets frequently consist of varying and numerous channels. To address these challenges, we introduce a foundational image segmentation model capable of accommodating input images with varying numbers of channels. To do so, we investigate how to incorporate multiplexed information as inputs in the Segment Anything Model(SAM). We intend to employ the self -attention mechanism on the embeddings produced by passing the multiplexed channels through the encoder, and the combined embeddings will then be used as inputs for the decoder. This approach will enable our model to perform whole -cell segmentation on multi -channel images. Understanding the Neural Circuits Aggression: Drosophila Wing Thr eat Behavior Mina Mandic Mentors: David Anderson and Shuo Cao Innate social behaviors involve complex and functionally relevant movements. However, it remains unclear how these actions are coordinated by the brain. Drosophila display \"wing threat\" behavior - a complex, multi -motor aggressive behavior, composed of fou r different actions: wing elevation, pump, turn, and charge. The Anderson lab has identified genetically labeled \"AIP neurons\" that specifically control wing threat display. To understand the aggression circuitry in the Drosophila brain, it is crucial to identify other connectome -derived neurons that are involved in wing threat and elucidate their connection to AIP neurons. Our methodology entails identifying split - gal4 drivers to label each downstream neuron of interest, followed by gain- of-function and epistasis behavior experiments. Gain- of-function results tell us which behaviors are caused by activation of the neuron of interest. Epistasis results determine whether the effects of AIP neurons are mediated by the inhibited neuron. Our preliminary findings indicate that the neuron CL139 plays a role in wing elevation, and DNp45 induces an augmented velocity response to optogenetic stimulation. Future investigations involve epistasis tests to discern which wing threat behavior DNp45 is responsible for. Additionally, we aim to classify other downstream neurons (DNg39, CL335, CL176) of AIP to gain further insights into the circuitry governing wing threat behavior. Applying a DNA -Encoded Chemical Library to Screen for Selective Binders of HDAC Isoforms Jessica Mann Mentors: Mitchell Guttman and Mackenzie Strehle DNA-encoded chemical libraries (DECLs) are powerful, high -throughput tools for small molecule screening. Generated by attaching chemical compounds to sequenceable oligonucleotide barcodes, millions of DECL molecules can be screened simultaneously for binding to a protein target. This process is faster and more affordable than other screening platforms, avoiding the need for specialized equipment. In this study, we apply a DECL to screen for selective binders of different HDAC isoforms using a pool- and-split, affinity selection- HDACs, or histone deacetylases, are an enzyme family involved in regulating gene expression, implicated in several human diseases including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and cardiovascular disorders. HDACs are difficult to drug individually due to the similarities between their active sites, so these results can be used to develop highly specific drugs against each HDAC isoform. Additionally, we compare screening data using two different methods of protein isolation to inform subsequent screening experiments, either via endogenous purification or cloning with a V5 tag. In the future, my group will apply this DECL technology to develop a split -pool scre ening workflow against proteins and RNAs. Improved Deep Learning -Based Reconstruction for 2D Phase Contrast MRI Ishaan Mantripragada B. Ennis, and Lior S. Pachter Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non- invasive imaging technique to produce detailed soft tissue anatomical images without exposing the body to ionizing radiation. The measured MRI signal can be represented as complex numbers which generate magnitude (real component) and phase images (imaginary component). Typically, MRI images are presented as magnitude images, which generally offer a qualitative view of the patient's anatomy and structure. On the other hand, PC -MRI stores valuable information about the velocity of flowing blood. 2D PC -MRI oftentimes requires patients to hold their breath for up to 20 seconds during a scan, to eliminate the effects of respiratory motion. However, this poses challenges for both sick and older patients. To reduce breath hold durations, we propose a solution that involves undersampling the data collection, which shortens the scan time but produces inaccurate image reconstructions with conventional reconstruction approaches. We plan to use fully sampled 2D PC -MRI images and a Convolutional Neural Network to generate a deep learning -based reconstruction that learns how to reconstruct accurate PC -MRI images from undersampled images. Similar techniques have already been demonstrated in the literature and offer 12x reduction in scan time for magnitude images and 8x reduction in scan time for 2D PC -MRI. Experimental Determination of the Nitrogen Isotopic Fractionation During Core Formation in Rocky Protoplanets and Planets Mentors: Paul D. Asimow and Damanveer S . Grewal Knowing the origin and evolution of nitrogen and other life -essential volatiles in rocky bodies is key to understanding the formation of habitable worlds in our Solar System. One way to track their journey in the planetary nebula is by using their isotopic composition in iron meteorites, the remnants of the metallic cores of the earliest formed planetesimals in the Solar System. Because different groups of iron meteorites sample different regions of the early Solar System, reconstructing the 15N/14N of their parent bodies can provide valuable insight into the dynamics of the nitrogen budget of the Solar System. To study the nitrogen isotopic fractionation, we performed high pressure -temperature experiments at conditions relevant to core formation (1 GPa, 1200 -1400\u00b0C) using a metallic mixture, analog for the core composition of the earliest planetesimals. We measured the solid and liquid composition of the quenched experiments using an Electron Probe Microanalyzer, which helped us adjust future expe riments to explore most of the relevant compositional parameter space. Then, we will measure the nitrogen fractionation using a Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer and backtrack the isotopic ratio of the parent bodies of iron meteorites. Advancing Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Through the Innovation of a Robotic Fish Fin Propulsor Hambik Margoosian Mentors: Morteza Gharib and Meredith Hooper Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have the potential to revolutionize exploration methods by offering convenience and cost- effectiveness. However, conventional AUVs utilizing screw propellers for propulsion face limitations such as inefficient power consumption, reduced maneuverability, and a large acoustic footprint, impacting their practicality in certain applications. In contrast, bio -inspired AUV designs, mimicking fish locomotion, have the potential to improve power efficiency, maneuverability, and operate quietly. The power efficiency optimization of AUVs is of high priority to maximize its potential use in longe r missions. This project focuses on developing a mechanism that utilizes a fish- like caudal fin capable of three -axis rotation controlled by a fin trajectory optimization algorithm which aims to achieve efficient propulsion. Relationships Between Nighttime Light, Economic Variables, and Covid- 19 in the United States Katherine Marquis Mentor: Pawel W. Janas Covid -19 has caused over 1 million deaths in the United States by May 2022 (WHO). Nighttime light (NTL), as used as an indicator of human activity, may reflect Covid -19 transmission and severity. This study attempts to assess the relationship between NTL and Covid -19 by assuming that high NTL radiance levels indicate a large amount of human contact to spread Covid -19 and that significant drops in NTL radiance levels correspond to quarantine or deaths due to Covid -19. In order to examine this relationship, NTL monthly composite satellite images from 2018 - 2023 were collected from NASA, county information was collected from the U.S. Census Bureau, Covid -19 case and death statistics at the county level were provided by Johns Hopkins, Covid -19 vaccination information was collected by the CDC, and economic variables were collected by Opportunity Insights. After preprocessing this data, various machine learning models were applied to the data to analyze relationships. Bayesian Active Sensing and Planning Applied to Attitude Dynamics and Spacecraft Control Arnauld Martinez Mentors: Soon-Jo Chung and Jimmy Ragan Modern spacecraft must be equipped with a high degree of fault tolerance to ensure safe and successful system operation during critical moments in the spacecraft 's mission. To combat total system failure, engineers implement redundancy to allow multiple failures to occur without compromising vehicle performance or objectives. However, if a redundant system fails, the source of the failure reduces to a family of potential problems that requires significant time to analyze and repair. To combat this, the ARCL lab developed FEAST (Fault Estimation via Active Sensing Tree Search), a novel algorithm that identifies failing sensors and actuators in a redundant system. The accuracy of FEAST has been verified on planar spacecraft models. In this paper, we extend FEAST to consider the attitude/orientation of the spacecraft about its center of mass. We model the spacecraft using quaternions and vary its orientation using reaction wheels. Additionally, we build a more realistic sensing model to simulate known failure modes in monocular cameras. By design ing a procedure to identify faulty sensors and actuators, we aim to increase spacecraft reliability and crew safety. A symptotic Growth Rate for the Number of Tilings of a Regular Dodecagon John Griffith Mattson, Jr. Mentor: Nets Katz In this paper, we try to compute S(n) := |T n|, where Tn is the set tilings of an n-sided dodecagon out of equilateral triangles and rhombi with small angle 30\u00ba, both of side length one, with equivalence up to rotational symmetry. First, we present a n algorithm for finding all possible ways of tiling an arbitrary outline, and then we apply this algorithm to compute S(1). This algorithm essentially involves finding all the ways to tile the boundary, and then use a sequence of a few tricks to split the space of all possible solutions into further -refined disjoint subsets of that space. To compute S(n), we present a few more algorithms, including: one, a procedure for \"ballooning\" a solution in T n to a solution in Tkn, where k is a positive integer; two, a procedure for completing a solution in Tn to a solution in Tn + 1; and, three, a procedure for making a solution in Tn that contains at least (3 n2 + 1)/4 dodecagons of side -length one, where n is any odd number. We begin by using the first algorithm to e stablish that there are, in fact, solutions in Tn, where n is greater than 1. We then use the second algorithm to establish that the sequence {||} is exponentially increasing. Finally, we use the third algorithm to establish that this same sequence is (1)3 42. Curating a Retrospective Art Exhibit for the Caltech/JPL Data to Discovery Program Ethan McFarlin Mentors: Santiago Lombeyda and Hillary Mushkin Melding the spirit of scientific inquiry with foundational research in human- computer interaction and visual perception, Caltech's Data to Discovery (D2D) Initiative aims to demystify complex data sets through the design of interactive visualization systems. Past projects launched by the initiative vary precipitously not only in their means of visualization but also their underlying scientific focus \u2014 from tracking the movement of the Mars' Exploration Rover to simulating glacier flow in Antarctica. The wide breadth of projects undertaken combined with the 10 year anniversary of the program engenders the opportunity to revisit unexpected parallels and insights uncovered by D2D. This paper describes the development of a comprehensive retrospective to revisit a nd communicate those visual and scientific insights in a manner that is widely digestible to those outside the field. The process of creating the retrospective involves curating raw material for an interactive art exhibit and thematically analyzing connect ions between projects. Distinguishing Experimental Groups of Animals Through Unsupervised Learning Cameron McNamee Mentor s: Pietro Perona and Markus Marks Understanding behavior is crucial for understanding the brain. Manually distinguishing behavioral patterns is labor - intensive, time-consuming and potentially prone to human biases.. Using machine learning (ML) we can overcome each of these shortcomings. Training ML models in a supervised setting requires vast amounts of annotated data, which do not exist for animals and collecting this data is costly. Instead, we employ XCLIP, a large vision- language model, to derive video embeddings of animal movements. We try to learn the differences in behavior across experimental groups by analyzing these video embeddings. We utilize an Autoregressive Hidden- Markov -Model (AR-HMM) to temporally cluster these embeddings into behavioral states. We use the number of occurrences of those states and their transition matrices to describe behavio ral differences across experimental groups. Specifically we validate our approach by describing behavioral differences in sheep that underwent neurosurgery. Designing an Efficient Decoder for a Novel Quantum Error Correction Scheme Nadine Meister Mentors: John Preskill and Chris Pattison One of the largest obstacles in developing quantum computers is its sensitivity to unwanted interactions with the environment that lead to errors in the computation. Hence, reliable error detection and correction is necessary to build large scale fault tolerant quantum computers. To correct errors in the physical qubits, quantum error correction schemes encode a single logical qubit into multiple physical qubits. Unlike classical bits in classical computers, qubits are typically not easily transportable. Consequently, quantum gates can only be applied between nearby qubits. Given this geometrically local restriction, a newly proposed quantum error correction scheme, the hierarchical code, asymptotically outperforms previously known state of the art quantum error correction codes. In any of these schemes, when trying to detect errors, simply measuring each qubit will collapse the state and destroy some of the encoded information. Thus, recovery operations must decode the information by performing measurements to identify which errors have occurred without fully collapsing the state. We developed a decoder for the hierarchical code to determine how many physical qubits are needed to protect a certain number of logical qubits at a target logical success rate, and ultimately, estimate the overhead of quantum error correction. Development of a Deep Sea Thermophilic Model Organism for the Study of Large Scale Protein Assemblies Filipe Andreas Melo Mentors: Andre Hoelz and George is a polychaete worm identified at hydrothermal vents near the sea floor, a habitat exhibiting tempe ratures as high as 80\u00b0C. This extreme environment has led to an unusually high degree of thermostability within the A. pompejana proteome , making the expression of recombinant proteins an attractive option for structural biologists aiming to determine structures that have proven intractable from alternative higher eukaryotic model systems, such as humans due to their relative lack of stability. We aim to demonstrate A. pompejana as a useful model organism by showing the structural homology of proteins withi n its nuclear pore complex (NPC), compared to their human and fungal counterparts, which have recently been characterized. The NPC is an ~110MDa protein complex that makes up the only pathway through the nuclear envelope and is central to the export of mRN A from the nucleus to cytoplasm. I aimed to recapitulate crystal structures of the NPC protein Nup214, the proteins Nup214 and Ddx19 in complex, and Ddx19 in complex to Gle1 to compare them to their human homologs. I did this by expressing these proteins i n E. coli , purifying them to a high degree of homogeneity by affinity, ion exchange, and gel filtration chromatography, then screening for crystallization conditions. This study demonstrates the suitability of this structural model organism with ample yiel ds and promising crystallization hits obtained. Kinetic Inductance Detector Analysis and Simulation Mira Menezes Mentor: Sunil Golwala Low mass dark matter, with masses in the MeV range, will only deposit energy on the eV scale in a detector. We are developing Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs), which are able to sense phonons deposited by these low energy interactions. Each detector consists of a superconducting aluminum LC circuit. When phonons hit a detector, they break the cooper pairs in the detector into quasiparticles, making it superconduct less well. This can be easily read out in a change to the LC circuit's quality factor and f requency. KIDs are easily multiplexed on a single wafer, and this allows for improved screening of background noise. To be able to interpret results from an array of KIDs, we must understand how the array reacts to various inputs. We analyze the results of various experiments, including behavior where highly energetic devices lose their energy much faster than other devices. We have also created models to understand the behavior of phonons moving through the array as a whole. Characterization of ins-6 Expression Within the C. elegans Chemosensory System in Response to Ascaroside Input Soraya Mercado Mentor s: Paul Sternberg and Mark Zhang C. elegans is one of the most influential biological models for developmental biology and neurological research because of its fully sequenced genome and its compact nervous system. The most compelling aspect of their nervous system is that their neurons can perform a myriad of different responses after exposure to a singular input. These responses can either be short -term chemical responses, or they can be long -term phenotypic changes. The long -term phenotypic change in this study would be the dauer diapause state, which worms enter under exposure to ascarosides. This project focuses on how C. elegans' chemosensory neurons regulate gene expression for dauer diapause and studies their neuron's omnidirectional potential in terms of creating a myriad of responses after receiving a singular input. To do this, we measure the expression of ins-6 after exposing the C. elegans to different combinations and concentrations of ascarosides; the expression of ins-6 should decrease after treatment. From this research, we found that ascarosides only influence ins-6 expression when in conjunction with each other, but ascaroside #8 reduces ins-6 expression the most within ASJ neurons. Further research into this subject will create a more accurate model of gene regulation within a nervo us system. Deformation and Misorientation Barometer of Experimentally Shocked Olivine: A Micro - to Meso -Scale EBSD Study Jenna Meyers Mentors: Paul Asimow and Jinping Hu Precise constraints on the shock conditions experienced by meteorites during their impact histories offer insights into the evolution of their parent bodies and, more broadly, the dynamics of our solar system. Shock pressure is the key information provided by shock metamorphic features in meteorites. However, the challenge lies in the fact that many features, like fractures and mosaicism, occur across a wide pressure range, making it difficult to obtain narrow pressure brackets. Ruzicka and Hugo (2018) us ed Electron BackScatter Diffraction (EBSD) quantify the crystallographic of shock stages S1 -S5 and developed correlations between shock stage, temperature, and olivine misorientation. To tie this method to well-defined peak shock pressures, we conducted two shock recovery experiments, S1258 and S1259, on Transvaal dunite (Hu and Asimow 2020). S1258 used an Mg -Cu graded density impactor to achieve a quasi -isentropic loading path to 30 GPa with well -defined shock temperature. In contrast, S1259 was shocked by a regular steel flyer to 26 GPa but the sample was saturated with pore water to enhance local melting. Both starting samples were cut into cylindrical wedges and assembled with a matching steel wedge to c reate frictional sliding along the sample -wedge interface. We performed detailed SEM analysis to study the shock deformation in the recovered samples. In both samples, in addition to pervasive fracturing, sub -grain development, and local melting, planar deformation features were observed in several grains in heavily deformed areas. We observed misorientations ~4\u00b0 in olivine grains; the misorientation angles are correlated with distance to the ramp and the edges. These numbers are generally consistent with shock stage S4 -S5 meteorites. With their well -defined pressure and temperature, our experiments serve as a solid tie -point in the shock classification scheme.

SQUID as Amplifier Sensitive Barkhausen Noise Measurements Shanya Mishra Mentors: Thomas Rosenbaum and Daniel Silevitch The use of a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID)- based amplifier can drastically improve the sensitivity of magnetic measurements, enabling the detection of events that involve very few spins, with the challenge that mechanical vibrations i n closed -cycle cryostats can drown out the signals of interest. We demonstrate that a SQUID can be used as an amplifier in such a system. Vibrations in the cryostat were mitigated by the installation of air bearings and wrapping a sheet of Sorbothane (a ma terial specifically for shock absorption and vibration damping) around the pulse tube cryocooler. We wound a matched pickup coil for the SQUID with a room-temperature operational range demonstrating a flat response between 3 Hz and 20 kHz. The assembly of the SQUID and pickup coil was then characterized at 2 K by measuring the background noise spectrum and the frequency response to an applied ac magnetic field. The background noise amplitude showed an improvement by a factor of around 4 in comparison to the noise amplitude measured in a previous SURF project prior to the vibration mitigations. The frequency response of the SQUID -based amplifier was flat below 10 Hz but varied at higher frequency, so further work is needed to optimize the parameters of the fe edback loop to linearize the response. The sensitivity of the SQUID -based amplifier will be tested by performing measurements on a sample of permalloy. In the future, the SQUID -based amplifier can be mounted on a helium dilution refrigerator and be used to make extremely sensitive Barkhausen noise measurements on quantum ferromagnets. Molecular Mechanism of Nucleocytoplasmic of p38 and cGAS Frida Moreno Mentors: Andr\u00e9 Hoelz and Chia Yu Chien Nested between the inner and outer lipid layers of the nuclear envelope, nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are the sole gateways that mediate the bidirectional macromolecule transport between the cytoplasm and nucleus. One of the macromolecules that relies on the NPC for intracellular transport is mitogen- activa ted protein kinase 14 (MAPK14), also known as p38 . MAPK14 is critical for directing cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis in addition to stimulating immune responses against external stressors. Thus, the hyperactivity of MAPK14 in the nucleus carries detrimental health implications ranging from mild inflammatory disorders to autoimmune diseases and cancers. By researching the route taken by MAPK14 into the nucleus, it becomes possible to explore the nuclear transport inhibition as a solution to the negative effects of dysregulated MAPK14. Alongside the research being conducted on MAPK14, the transport of the primary immune sensor of cytosolic DNA, cyclic GMP- AMP synthase (cGAS), is also under investigation. Progress on recombinant protein purifications and pull- down technique has allowed for further pathway analysis with the hopes of identifying the critical transport factors for p38 and cGAS. Building a Spectral Library of Serpentinization With a Focus on Fe -rich Bruc where water interacts with ultramafic rocks, yields minerals like serpentine and brucite, fostering potential habitability in celestial bodies like Mars, volatile -rich asteroids, and outer planets' icy moons. Hydrogen gas production during this process varies due to the involvement of various Fe -bearing minerals. Our objective is to characterize the products of serpentinization with planetary mission- relevant spectroscopies in order to provide a database for interpreting mission data as well as terrestrial datasets, e.g., micro imaging spectroscopy of the Oman Drilling Project's serpentinized ophiolite sequence. We focus first on Fe -bearing brucites because of their role in enhancing H 2 production as Fe(II) in brucite oxidizes through fluid -rock reactions. We synthesized Mg xFe(1-x)OH2 samples via coprecipitation, dried them at the University of Colorado, and analyzed them under argon in a Caltech anoxic glove box. Spectral measurements on four samples (Mg#'s 90, 66, 50, 33) show wavelength shifts consistent with trends in other minerals like Fe(II)- bearing smectites. We also studied natural samples of Fe -bearing serpentines and will present analyses using FTIR, UV/Vis, M\u00f6ssbauer, and Raman spectra. Our new spectral library will aid in distinguishing Fe(II)- bearing brucites, key to understanding H 2 production during serpentinization. Optimization of Non -Linear Optical Waveguide Parameters to and Robert Gray Photon pairs have a vast array of applications in quantum information science, from quantum communication protocols to photonic quantum computing. Single -mode pairs are the most desirable for such applications due to the pair exhibiting spectral uncorrelation, where the measurement of one photon projects the other onto a pure quantum state, and multiple independent sources can be made to demonstrate quantum interference. Thin- film lithium niobate (TFLN) has recently emerged as a promising platform for integrated nonlinear photonics, but current waveguide designs still lack the phase -matching conditions for type -0 spontaneous parametric down- conversion to produce photon pairs limited to a single temporal mode. We utilize a machine -learning framework to optimize for waveguide dimensions, poling design, and input pump pulse structure to achieve high spectral purity, a measure of spectral uncorrelation between photon pairs. We further demonstrate the applications of our engineered waveguide through nonlinear time -domain simulations which show that the outputted single -mode photons can be utilized for an ultra -fast quantum random number generator. The results from our optimization framework and nonlinear optical simulations show promise for the use of the TFLN platform in a variety of quantum information and photonics applications such as quantum key distribution, sensing, metrology, and computation. Formal Compositional Design of an Automobile System Using Pacti and Contracts Jack Myles Mentors: Richard Murray and Inigo Incer An important aspect of systems engineering is identifying the specifications of the various components that are needed to facilitate the design, integration, and management of a complex system. Contract -based design is a recently developed methodology that complements other system design approaches for effectively managing high- complexity systems, using assume -guarantee specifications, expressed as linear inequalities, to model the components of the system. Pacti is a recently developed open- source Python p ackage for carrying out compositional system analysis and design. We explore the ability of Pacti to create a system model for an electric automobile. We have developed various contracts to represent the components of the system, and have used them to identify estimates of the capabilities of the vehicle in a variety of real -world scenarios. Multiple different viewpoints can be analyzed, including the efficiency of the automobile in converting energy to distance traveled and the effect of components' cost w ith varying performance on efficiency. These viewpoints can be useful in analyzing the model from both a business and engineering perspective. Our utilization of Pacti to apply contract -based design to an electric automobile defines the potential for appl ying Pacti and contract -based design methods to model - based systems engineering of other complex electromechanical systems. Generalization Properties of Deep Learning Models Trained With Regularizer Mirror Descent Using Different Regularizer Functions Gustav Naucl\u00e9r Mentor: Babak Hassibi Despite modern deep learning models being highly over -parametrized they can often generalize well to unseen data. It is understood that this is partially due to implicit regularization given by the learning algorithm. In cases where additional regularization is required, for example when data is corrupt, explicit regularization such as weight decay is often used. The problem with these methods is that they do not come with any convergence guarantees. A novel method has been proposed to solve this problem, Regularizer Mirror Descent, which utilizes convergence properties of Stochastic Mirror Descent to minimize the sum of training loss and an additional regularizer function of the weights. In this project we train a ResNet -18 architecture on the Cifar -10 dataset with various levels of corruption using the Regularizer Mirror Descent algorithm with different lq norm regularizer functions. We investigate the generalization results together with the characteristics induced on the weights of the models. Determining the Composition of Earth -Sized Planets in the TOI -406 System Kendra Nguyen Mentors: Heather Knutson and Michael Greklek -McKeon M dwarfs are stars smaller and cooler than the Sun but are more active with more frequent flares. As such, planets orbiting M dwarfs may have properties different from planets in our solar system. By obtaining the masses and radii for M dwarf planets, we can determine their bulk composition and gain insight into the impact of M dwarf stellar activity on planetary formation, evolution, and habitability. We have obtained such measurements for two Earth- sized planet candidates, TOI -406.01 and TOI -406.02. Observations of the TOI -406 system were conducted through the Las Cumbres Observatory global telescope network, and we used the ExoWIRC photometric reduction pipeline to produce transit light curves and determine the transit times. Finding the transit time is needed for calculating masses based on transit timing variations (TTVs). TTVs are deviations from expected transit times due to gravitational interactions between planets in a multi- planet system. With inputs of planet masses and orbital parameters, the cod e TTVFast efficiently models transit times. Thus, by generating models that match the transit times we found, we have determined the masses. With the masses and radii, we calculated the bulk densities and placed the first direct constraints on the composition of both TOI -406.01 and TOI -406.02. Machine Learning Based Approach to Comparing Gene Variant Detection Methods Ali R. Niazi Mentors: Ashish Mahabal and Lisa Guan Understanding gene variants is fundamental to understanding the mechanisms that drive c ellular function, inheritance, and molecular development of diseases. Many traditional sequencing methods result in inaccurate variant calling and remain limited in detecting variants at lower sample percentages, variant sizes, and other genomic features. We used Genome Editing samples from Amplicon Sequencing (AmpSeq) data (n = 25), and from Duplex Sequencing (DuplexSeq) data (n = 5) and evaluated comparative variant calling performance. We found that both methods largely inaccurately called variants, with low True Positive Rates (TPR), with the majority of variants not being called at all. We designed a Machine Learning (ML) based framework that takes in binary alignment and map (BAM) files in pileup format and uses a Ridge Classifier to predict variant calls. Thus, we hope to provide a data -driven, ML -based solution to variant calling inaccuracies to improve existing methods of next -generation sequencing technologies. Searching for EM Counterparts to Binary Black Hole Mergers in AGN Using LIGO O4 Cece Ochoa Mentor: Matthew Graham Active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been found to be promising locations for binary black hole (BBH) mergers. Utilizing LIGO and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) we are able to continue the search for EM counterparts to BBH m ergers. LIGO provides us with alerts when gravitational waves are detected, along with possible sources including BBHs. ZTF is a wide field imager located on the Palomar 48 -inch Oschin telescope which surveys the sky each night searching for EM flares that could be the result of BBH mergers. Here we present our preliminary results from the current LIGO observing run (O4) and from LIGO O2, which ran from November 2016 to August 2017. By creating a more extensive data set of EM counterparts to BBH mergers, we hope to fill gaps in our current knowledge of BBHs and AGN, and expand upon pre -existing science. Identifying and Classifying Misinformation About Cryptocurrencies on Twitter Jamal Omosun Mentor: R. Michael Alvarez Misinformation on Twitter, especially around cryptocurrency, has long been a topic of conversation on the platform. There has been a long history in the crypto community on Twitter of bot accounts, spam, scam, and misinformation. Recently there have been incidents where misinformati on has had an effect and actively influenced crypto trading and market prices such as in the case of the currency Ripple. The goal of our project is to train models that can accurately identify misinformation involving cryptocurrencies and classify them. W e gathered a large dataset of thousands of tweets and then tested them against a preselected selection of misinformation key phrases and other such identifiers. The results of this analysis give us an idea of how likely any given tweet is to be misinformation, a scam, or from a bot account. Alkynalated Carbondots as a New Vial for Gene Delivery of Cy3 -DNA Into Nicotiana benthamiana G\u00f6zde Demirer and Jesus Galeana Food security concerns are at a constant rise due to the reduction in crop yields associated with climate change and pathogenic organisms. Novel methods for biomolecule delivery to plants present a promising avenue to achieve effective plant genetic engine ering and equip crops with enhanced resistance to a diverse range of abiotic and biotic stressors. However, one major limitation still needs to be addressed, the 5 -20 nm size exclusion limit of the plant cell wall, which hinders the delivery of biomolecule s. Recently, carbon nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), have been studied as an effective option for nanoparticle -mediated biomolecule delivery method. Similarly, an interest in using other carbon allotropes like carbon nanodots (CNDs), which a re typically smaller than 10 nm in diameter, have gained traction for their ability to serve as biomolecule vectors and fluorophores. Specifically, when functionalized with positively charged polymers like polyethyleneimine (PEI), CNDs and CNTs can electro statically absorb DNA on their surface, creating a CNT -DNA or CND -DNA complex suitable for biomolecule delivery in planta . Unfortunately, the loading limit dictated by electrostatic interactions hinders the use of surface passivated CNTs and CNDs for the d elivery of biomolecules. Motivated by this, our work proposes a novel method for the covalent attachment of DNA via a simple copper(I)- catalyzed cycloaddition modified with alkyne functiona l groups. This research will present the synthetic route to the surface passivation of carbon dots with alkynes necessary for CuAAC mediated biomolecule attachment. An Investigation Into the Potential of Machine Learning for the Prediction of Regioselecti vity of refers to the cleavage of a C -H bond and subsequent replacement of the hydrogen atom with a different (desired) atom. It is arguably one of the most commonly used techniques in organic synthesis. However, C-H functionalization is only a viable tool in organic synthesis when there is only one reactive site in the reactant (i.e. it is regioselective) which can be predicted with confidence. Currently, there is a great dependence on the prediction of C -H functionalization regioselectivitie s using a set of manually -intensive heuristic rules that fail on more complex molecules. In this work, we propose a machine learning -based pipeline for the prediction and validation of regioselectivities. We survey recent literature studies on C -H functionalization reactions using two specific reagents with an emphasis on C -H oxidation and leverage semi -empirical quantum mechanical descriptors to prepare the training set for the model. We conduct a hyper -parameter search to establish the optimal architectur e of the model. Finally, we validate the model on over 288 reactions and develop an interface for regioselectivity predictions of user -accepted reactant molecules. Design of a Qubit Module for High Fidelity State Transfer From Quantum Transducers Ricky Pa rada Mentors: Oskar Painter and Piero Chiappina The transmission of information between remote nodes in a quantum network would expedite prospects such as quantum cryptography and distributed quantum computing. Due to their dominance in control and operating times, superconducting quantum circuits (SQCs) are primary candidates for realizing scalable quantum computers. However, cryogenic temperature dependencies render SQCs incompatible with long -range transmission. To overcome this issue, quantum transduce rs are being developed to convert microwave photons into optical photons better suited for network communication via optical fibers. Going forward, it is crucial to design a qubit module that can efficiently catch photons emitted from these transducers. We design an SQC module that facilitates efficient quantum information transfer from a transducer to a superconducting qubit using a directional photon catch scheme. We calculate the optimal temporal pulse shape of transducer -emitted flying photons through d etailed state transfer simulations and determine the corresponding qubit parameters that emit such a pulse. We achieve an effective qubit -photon coupling rate of ~12 MHz as a result of optimizing the transducer to qubit fidelity subject to the numerous the oretical and physical constraints. Future work includes implementing the design on a standard qubit layout to experimentally realize quantum state transfer and remote entanglement mediated by quantum transducers. Analysis of Quantum Parity Detector Signal and Noise Sources for Phonon Detection John Parker Mentor: Sunil Golwala Quantum parity detectors (QPDs) are a proposed class of quantum devices which use the tremendous sensitivity of superconducting qubits to quasiparticle (QP) tunneling events as the detector concept. Phonons in a silicon substrate generate QPs in a superconducting absorber. QP tunneling events switch the charge -parity of the sensitive region of the detector, which is measured as a frequency shift in a coupled microwave resonator. We simulate this two state, time dependent signal. We consider the effect of re sonator response time as well as generation recombination, Fano, and telegraph (shot) noise. From simulated signal -noise traces, we reconstruct QP tunneling rates, and hence reconstruct deposited phonon energy. This procedure is repeated for various device parameters and deposited energies. We quantify the energy threshold and dominant noise sources for various device parameters. Simulations like these will help determine optimal device parameters for future QPDs. Exploring the Future of Quantum Machine Le arning in Astronomy Autumn Pearce Mentors: Matthew Graham and Ashish Mahabal In recent years, telescope surveys have become an increasingly popular way of collecting astronomical data. As a result, the field has seen radical growth in the amount of data available. While this data has greatly aided research efforts, it has also introduced new challenges. In the past, researchers could visually identify and categorize objects, or they could apply time -consuming computer processes to each individual obj ect. With so much data to analyze, this is no longer feasible. To address this issue, machine learning algorithms are being used to sort and analyze data. However, the computational complexity of machine learning algorithms increases exponentially with the number of parameters analyzed, which limits their usability in the face of exponentially large datasets. This study investigates the potential of quantum machine learning to prevent these constraints from limiting progress in astrophysical research. Quantum computing hardware is still in its infancy, but this new form of computing is already known to provide immense speedups to classical machine learning tasks. Thus, it holds promise for revolutionizing the way we process vast amounts of astrophysical info rmation. Moreover, this project hopes to establish a bridge between astronomy and quantum computing, as the fields currently operate independent from one another. Investigating the Starspot Paradigm of T Tauri Stars in the Accurate age and mass determinations for young stars are crucial for understanding their evolution. However, strong magnetic fields in these systems, causing phenomena like starspots and flares, make it difficult to achieve precise measurements. Low -mass stars wit h fully convective interiors and strong magnetic fields can experience significant convection suppression, leading to extensive starspot coverage. We present results from multi -epoch near-infrared spectroscopy of 32 T -Tauri Stars in Taurus -Auriga with the aim of studying spot- behavior. We constructed composite models of spotted stars by combining BTSettl -CIFIST atmospheres to represent the spots and the photosphere along with accretion and disk continua. Using a Markov -Chain Monte -Carlo algorithm, we derive d best -fit spot and photospheric temperatures, spot filling factors, as well as disk and accretion filling factors, successfully reproducing stellar spectra. We find best- fit spot filling factors over 30% for all of our targets, with a constant spot- to-photosphere temperature ratio of 0.7, consistent with estimates for older types of spotted stars. Using K2 photometry, we are able to correlate spectral variability variability on we calculate effec tive temperatures and luminosities and use the Stellar Parameters of Tracks with Starspots (SPOTS) models to derive corrected masses and ages for our sample. High Throughput Engineering of Next -Generation Mammalian Acoustic Reporter Genes for Multiplexed Ultrasound Imaging Anh Phuoc Nguyen Phung Mentors: Mikhail Shapiro and Nivin Nystr\u00f6m Genetically encoded ultrasound contrast agents in the form of biogenic gas vesicles (GV), which are air -filled protein nanostructures native to aquatic microbes, have re volutionized a new pathway for biomolecular imaging. The latest iteration of mammalian acoustic reporter genes (mARG), derived from Anabaena flos -aquae , enables heterologous expression of GVs strong non- linear signals for real -time, non- destructive imaging in deep tissue. Building on this, the development of next -generation mARG with enhanced acoustic contrast is desired to realize ultrasound multiplexing, which permits unique differentiation of acoustic signals or spatial distribution from different GV populations. Here, we devised two approaches towards high throughput engineering of GvpA and GvpC - structural proteins that are responsible for GVs' mechanical and hence acoustic properties. First, two alanine and cysteine -scanning gvpA libraries were generated by site -directed mutagenesis, constituting 141 mutants for arrayed acoustic screen. Candidate positions that outperform the wild -type were then selected for further site -saturation and combined mutagenesis. In parallel, we developed a directed evolution pipeline for randomized screening of pooled gvpC libraries by monoclonal integration into AAVS1 landing pad cell line. Drag Reduction and Stability Analysis of Biohybrid Robotic Jellyfish Mounts Giannka Picache Mentors: John Dabiri and Kelsi Rutledge Biologging \u2014which is the practice of using animals equipped with sensor tags \u2014is a promising new avenue for ocean monitoring. However, a limitation of biologging is that it only provides data on where the animal swims. Biohybrid robotic control \u2014which is the ability to navigate an animal along a desired path of motion \u2014addresses that limitation. By implanting a microprocessor and electrodes into the bell (the umbrella -like body) of a jellyfish, previous research has shown enhanced swimming spee ds up to 3 times its normal gaits. Moreover, it was found that the implanted cap, which is the plastic housing for the jellyfish's microelectronics system, further increases swimming speeds when affixed to the apical surface of the bell. In this study, we aim to further explore the hydrodynamic influence of implanted caps. We tested different shapes and surfaces to determine an optimal design for decreasing drag and increasing stability. We measured the terminal velocity and corresponding drag coefficient of both traditional and bioinspired drag -reducing designs. We identify an optimal shape and surface texture for maximum performance in biohybrid robot jellyfish. This study provides important design considerations for the jellyfish platform while giving ins ights into drag -reducing shapes and surface textures in low velocity, laminar flows. Late-time Chandra and eROSITA Observations of Pillai Mentors: Shrinivas Kulkarni and Yuhan Yao A star that passes too close to a massive black hole (MBH) will be disrupted by tidal forces in a tidal disruption event (TDE). As the disrupted stellar material falls back to form an accretion disk around the MBH, X -ray emission is produced in the central region. Sazonov et al. (2021) presented the first statistical sample of TDEs systematically selected in the X -ray band using the first two all -sky surveys conducted by the eROSITA telescope onboard the SRG satellite. However, without late -time observations, several key predictions of TDEs have not been tested. We obtained follow -up observations of five TDEs in the Sazonov et. al. (2021) sample using the Chandra X -ray telescope and later eROSITA surveys to characterize their late -time flux and spectral evol ution. Two physically motivated spectral models \u2014non- thermal power law and thermal disk emission\u2014 are used. We also examined light curves from optical sky surveys to better constrain the multi -wavelength evolution. This work aims to test whether the accretio n rate follows that predicted by the fallback accretion model and investigate the frequency of late -time corona formation, and changes in the accretion disc geometry. Looking for Dwarf Carbon Stars Using Low -Resolution Spectra From Gaia DR3 XP Spectra Evan Portnoi Mentors: Kareem El -Badry and Ben Roulston For decades, scientists have had both convincing theories and conclusive proof that small stars incapable of produc ing their own carbon can still have carbon- rich atmospheres by matter accretion from a nearby giant carbon star that is a binary companion. However, they are rare and not easily distinguishable from normal oxygen- rich stars without detailed spectroscopy, l ooking at each spectrum by hand to find carbon features. Because of this, there are still very few documented dwarf carbons. However, machine learning methods such a Support Vector Machine can be used to identify carbon stars en masse using the training se t derived from Gaia DR3. The algorithm takes color, spectral indices quantitatively representing features in the spectrum, and a series of coefficients from the Hermitian polynomial. Testing and cross -validation have shown scores of 95% accuracy. The set d ata tables can be created for the entire Gaia DR3 dataset of over 200 million sources. Initial tests have shown a predicted carbon star rate of .01%. If this proves to be correct, the machine learning pipeline can be applied to the whole dataset and cross -referenced with parallax data to determine the size of the stars, creating a large catalog exclusively containing dwarf carbon stars. Development of a Coherent Optical Receiver for Fiber Optic Communication Applications Olivers Prnis Mentors: Ali Hajimiri and Samir Nooshabadi Fiber optic technology has already proven to be a vital part of the modern world. Whether it is establishing a high- speed Internet connection for a single household or entire countries, using light to transmit information is currently the fastest way to communicate across short and long distances. However, with the increasing demands for ever faster speeds and higher bandwidths, there is a need for improved designs for optical receiver systems to translate the optical signals into electronic ones. This research project focuses on developing and characterizing a new type of integrated optical receiver utilizing coherently modulated light waves. Blowup Analysis for the Weak Convection Hou- Li Model Xiang Qin Mentor: Thomas Y.Hou We study the a -parameterized weak advection version of a 1D model proposed by Hou- Li. This model is based on an approximation of the axisymmetric Navier -Stokes equations in the r direction. By considering the fixed -point problem of some nonlinear map, we show that the weak convection model admits exact self -similar finite -time blowup solutions with smooth profiles for 2/3<a<1. We also verify and visualize our theoretical results using a direct numerical iterative method. Our work reproduces the previous re sults in a purely analytic approach, and obtain more properties of the profiles. Probing Neural Correlates of Performance -Based Arbitration During Model -Based and Model -Free Control Sarita Raghunath Mentors: John P. O'Doherty and Vincent Man Arbitration between multiple systems is the key to decision making. Previous studies in model -based (goal -driven) and model -free (habitual) reinforcement learning indicate that meta -level control mechanisms assess the reliability of each system to guide decision makers towards the strategy that predicts rewards more accurately. However, recent work from the lab suggests a novel performance -based arbitration mechanism - unlike reliability -based models, performance- based arbitration models weigh the system that yields the highest expected reward (performance). We hypothesize that medial prefrontal (mPFC) regions are involved in performance -based strategy - switching due to their role in top -down control. We also investigate the basal ganglia, particularly the gl obus pallidus, given its role in strategy switching for reliability -based arbitration. To explore this, we apply this new computational model to fMRI data from participants performing a two -step decision -making task, previously used to indicate model -based /model -free decision -making. By utilizing variables from performance -based arbitration in GLM analysis, we aim to better understand the neural correlates for performance -based arbitration over multiple decision -making systems. In the future, we will use these fMRI analysis results to guide electrophysiology work which will investigate the underlying physiological signal in the globus pallidus and basal ganglia. Stabilization High Matthew Espinosa In catalysis, high oxidation state compounds can significantly lower the activation energy to perform difficult transformations. One such process is the formation of aryl-fluoride bonds, which are a common motif in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials. Nickel has been shown to facilitate this coupling through some high-valent nickel species, and that these states can be supported by pyridine -containing ligand s. The isolation of these species is necessary to enable reactivity studies. Fluorinated silicates developed in the Agapie Group could be a solution to this problem. By appending these silicates to a pyridine -based ligand core, we hypothesize that high oxidation state metal complexes can be isolated. To synthesize the target ligand, a Negishi Coupling approach was taken. We report spectral data that indicates the product is formed, but it remains a challenge to isolate and purify the material before metalation. Dualities as Sequential Robijn Vanhove Dualities in physics are mappings that relate two different looking theories that actually describe the same physics . They are ubiquitous as quantities on one side of the duality are often easier to compute than quantities on the other side. They are significant in condensed matter physics as they can map between different phases of matter. It is known that sequential quantum circuits (SQCs) are the minima l class of quantum circuits that can map from one phase to another. Broadly speaking, this project attempts to understand the relation between these different objects. We investigated dualities between categorically symmetric 1D systems and showed that they correspond to SQCs changing the boundary of a 2D topologically ordered system. Understanding this mapping in more generality and in higher dimensions will allow us to get a new perspective on dualities as well as systematically construct new ones. Testing the Efficacy of Isotopic Clumping Data When Applied to Temperature Dependent Sex in Modern Day Reptiles Martha Richmond Mentor: John Eiler The isotopic clumping of 13 -C and 18 -O observed in carbonate mineral lattices can be used to determine the temperature at which that carbonate formed , without independent knowledge of the 13 -O and 18 -O contents of water . We tested whether eggshell clumped isotope abundance data could be used as a basis for reconstructing egg shell growth temperature, and thereby constrain sex distributions among modern- day reptiles known to show temperature -dependent sex determination (TSD). This study could shed light on the impacts of warming global temperatures on sex ratios and reproductive capacities. The data was obtained us ing the 'paleothermometer' developed by Eiler et al . We studied the reproducibility and accuracy of our results by replicate analysis of samples with known incubation temperatures via mass spectrometry . We are now exploring whether these values represent the internal temperature of the mother or of the external environment. The latter has the potential not only to be used as a non -invasive technique to study TSD but also to challenge various publications regarding gigantothermy propositions from fossilised eggs. Future directions of this study may involve generating a comparison between herpetological species or testi ng the efficacy with differing age of samples, even exploring TSD in Mesozoic gigantotherm eggs. PdPtOx Thin Film Catalyst Cintr\u00f3n Mentors: Karthish Manthiram and Chenyu Jiang Production of propylene ox ide with hydrogen peroxide requires the direct burning of fossil fuels to reach elevated reaction temperatures. Electricity can serve as a greener alternative to fossil fuels, sustainably functionalizing olefins with the aid of efficient and selective elec trocatalysts. However, understanding mechanisms of electrochemical reactions remains untrivial due to dynamic changes of the catalysts under applied potential. Olefin epoxidation using water as the oxygen atom source has been previously demonstrated in amb ient conditions with PdPtOx/C nanoparticles as the catalyst drop -cast onto carbon paper (CP) electrodes (Chung et. al. 2023, Science, manuscript under review ), achieving a Faradaic efficiency (FE) higher than 90% for cyclooctene oxide. Due to its porous na ture, CP is regarded as an unsuitable substrate for in situ spectroscopies that require an ultra -high vacuum environment, such as soft X -ray absorption spectroscopy. By changing the substrate to a nonporous material and depositing the catalyst without sacr ificing its high catalytic performance, the mechanism of this oxidation reaction can be investigated to reveal the reason why PdPtOx excels as a novel catalyst for olefin epoxidation. This study provides insight on how deposition methods of PdPtOx affect i ts structure and catalytic properties by analyzing the FE obtained from the use of CP, indium tin oxide, and glassy carbon as substrates. PdPtOx thin films were prepared by drop -casting, sputtering, and spin coating, and chronopotentiometry was carried out at 40 mA/cm 2 until a total charge of 20C was passed. A series of characterization methods were performed to obtain information on the oxidation states, morphology, and thickness of PdPtOx thin films. Implementing Property -Based Testing in NetworkX Nilo Rivera Mentors: Chris Umans and Ross Barnowski Currently, most software is tested with a set of example inputs and expected outputs. A newer approach is property -based testing, in which many example inp uts are generated, and the outputs are tested for specific properties they are expected to have, such as commutativity. NetworkX, a Python package for graph data structures and algorithms, could benefit from this form of testing. However, as property -based testing is not yet prevalent, I had to develop an algorithm for generating random graphs to use as test cases. This algorithm had to be capable of ensuring specified characteristics in its output, such as connectedness, and finding the simplest graph that fails a test. I will continue this work for the remainder of the summer by determining which properties each algorithm in NetworkX should have and writing tests for each of these properties, improving the efficacy, development time, and readability of the NetworkX test suite. Accompanied by an analysis and research paper, this work will contribute to the adoption of property -based testing in software used across the many industries where graphs play a vital role. Evolutionary Comparison of Neuromodulatory Systems in Rove Beetle Species Camila Romero Mentors: Joseph Parker, Jess Kanwal, and Jaison Omoto Animals have evolved their nervous system to interact adaptively with members of other species. In particular, neuromodulatory systems can play a critical role in modulating the function of circuits over evolution without anatomical re -structuring. However , the evolutionary changes to neuromodulatory systems that enable novel interspecies behavioral interactions are largely unknown. Here, we characterize and compare how the expression patterns of key neuromodulatory systems are evolutionarily modified to enable symbiotic specialization. To investigate this phenomenon, we used two rove beetle species: the free -living beetle Dalotia coriaira that chemically defends itself against predatory ants and the social symbiont Platyusa sonomae that deploys an appeaseme nt chemical to reduce ant aggression and lives alongside ants. Using immunostaining and confocal microscopy, we compared neuromodulator expression patterns within and between the central nervous systems of Dalotia and Platyusa . Specifically, we looked at tachykinin, serotonin, and dopamine expression, as these neuromodulators have previously been associated with aggressive and defensive behaviors. We hypothesize that the neuromodulator expression patterns for these neuropeptides may differ to reflect the behavioral differences between rove beetle species. Our comparisons lay the groundwork to uncover neural changes underlying the evolutionary shift in behavioral interspecies interactions in these two beetle species. Time -domain Observations at Millimeter W avelengths Vikram Nitika Yadlapalli SPRITE consists of two 10.4 -m radio dishes operating at 90 GHz and is designed to perform time -domain observations at millimeter (mm) wavelengths. Millimeter observations allow us to peer into the inner regions of extreme astronomical environments. The primary focus of our project is to improve SPRITE's system calibration and data quality. Beyond this, we also utilize SPRITE to observe various sources that are known radio emitters such as young eccentric stellar binaries, flaring blazars, and certain stars such as UV Ceti. There are numerous goals that can be accomplished using SPRITE including learning about the mechanisms behind outbursts from the magnetospheres of nearby stars, collisions between supernova explosions and dense surrounding matter, and the physics of active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes. Deep Generative Modeling for Safe Control Using Conditional Variational Autoencoders Igor Sadalski Mentors: Aaron Ames and Ryan Cosner In safety -critical contexts, ensuring robust behavior in the presence of external disturbances is of primary concern. The existing literature outlines controller architectures designed for this purpose, contingent upon a priori knowledge of the disturbance distribution. While uncertainty and co mplex nonlinear -effects present in the real - world render analytical modeling (e.g., based on fluid dynamics modeling) unfeasible there are various learning methods, including Bayesian Neural Networks and Gaussian Processes, that could potentially predict the disturbance with its associated uncertainty. Unfortunately, practical implementations of these demands substantial computational resources, resulting in operation at reduced frequencies. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach utilizing conditional variational autoencoders which is a learning framework built on variational inference. By adopting this approach, we can learn properties (mean, variance -covariance matrix) of complex disturbance's distribution. The subsequent integration of this learned model with a Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based controller ensures the safety of the system. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in simulation and deploy it on a hardware system. Assembly and Characterization of Neural Probe Systems for Dense Electrophysiological Recordings Omar Salas Mentors: Michael Roukes and Laurent Moreaux Our perception of the world is based on the circuit -like interaction between our neurons. While we have made a lot of progress understanding the mechanics behind individual neurons, we have little knowledge on how neurons interact with each other inside the brain. We assembled a 32 -channel electrophysiological (ephys) probe to measure the electrical signals from the interneurons in the cortex in vivo . The dense array of channels allows better resolution to isolate distinct waveforms and triangulate the location of emitting neurons compared to previous ephys systems. The recorded ephys data was then analyzed using SpyKING Circus. Allowing us to look at spikes at a determined threshold, identify overlapping spikes, and sort them based on their features. In addition, we look at possible designs for higher channel probe assemblies based around a 256 dense electrode array probe. These include the design of a custom PCB to accommodate 64 channels as well as the use of an interposer to spread out all 256 channels, thus facilitating the assembly of a 256 -channel probe. Discovering Social Bias in Text -To-Image Models Through Likelihood Estimation already been adopted into key commercial workflows. Characterising the implicit biases they exhibit is a necessary first step in avoiding discriminatory outcomes. Existing bias testing methods rely predominantly on external models, such as CLIP or attribute classifiers, that often exhibit their own biases. Our novel framework directly probe s the text -prompt conditioned image generation distribution, by leveraging an evidence lower bound to approximate the intractable generating distribution. The key idea is that a diffusion model's ability to denoise a noised image, given a text -prompt, is a proxy for that prompt's likelihood. Using our framework, we recover expected and significant inter -sectional social biases in Stable Diffusion v2.1, a state-of-the-art open- source text -to-image model. Our findings caution against the uninformed adoption of text -to- image foundation models for downstream tasks, including classification. Bio-inspired Underwater Propulsion: Advancements in Fin Mechanisms Jacob Schuster Mentors: Morteza Gharib and Meredith Hooper Modern marine thrusters have revolutionized underwater propulsion, reaching impressive levels of efficiency and power. Yet, some aquatic animals are able to propel themselves at much higher energy efficiencies than even the best human- made propulsion systems. Taking inspiration from the propulsion of aquatic creatures, The Gharib Research Group aims to create a bio -inspired alternative to traditional marine thrusters by mimicking the movements of fish fins. To achieve this, we are developing a fish robot that can achieve collinear flow, while executi ng trajectories determined by a machine learning algorithm. The robot uses a central motor and a swash plate mechanism connected by a universal joint to complete these trajectories. In the future, we hope to optimize the design of the fish robot and fin trajectories in order to improve underwater propulsion methods around the world, making them both more efficient and eco -friendly. Assessment of Electrochemical Sensors Sensitivity for Integration in Chronic Wound Management Device Alex Seder Mentor: Wei Gao Increasing instances of chronic wounds have become a significant concern, particularly in cases of cancers, heart conditions, diabetes, and autoimmune disorders, necessitating specialized care and extended healing periods. In this study, we focus on enhancing wound monitoring through the application of previously established electrochemical sensors within the Gao lab's Smart Bandage device. Our objective is to enable noninvasive tracking of wound physiological conditions, including pH, hydrogen peroxide, oxygen, nitric oxide, and temperature. Testing of pH, hydrogen peroxide, and nitric oxide sensors was conducted following standard protocols, with sensitivity and stability consistently maintained within a range of 5 -10% for all tested sensors. Our findings revealed that hydrogen peroxide stability is compromised outside the pH range of 7 due to the instability of the Prussian Blue. Nitric oxide sensors demonstrated robustness across different pH levels, displaying enhanced sensitivity and voltage at lower pH values, and reduced sensitivity with lower voltage at higher pH values. Through systematic assessment of our sensors under varying pH and temperature conditions, we effectively determined the bandage's capabilities in assessing diverse pH and temperature scenarios. Looking ahead, the integration of electrophysiological therapeutic treatment into the bandage holds promise for stimulating tissue regeneration. Furthermore, the potential utilization of solar cells or magnetoelastic generators for powering such therapeutic measures introduces the possibility of a self -sufficient and comprehensive monitoring system tailored for chronic wounds. Characterizing Hazardous Near Earth Asteroids With Thermal Infrared Data From NEOWISE and Repo rting Previously Missed Detections to the Minor Planet Center Elena Selmi Mentor: Joseph Masiero Near Earth Asteroids (NEA) are of great interest to the scientific community due to their proximity to Earth, making them both potential hazards and possible targets for future missions, as they're relatively easy to reach by spacecraft. The Wide- field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) has scanned the sky since 2010 at different wavelengths, discovering hundreds of new NEOs and expanding the observation dataset of previously known ones. In this project, we recover all observational epochs for a list of asteroids and run a thermophysical model utilizing Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) simulations to fit diameter, albedo, thermal inertia and period. Results for most targets are used in conjunction with those obtained by other groups utilizing polarimetry data and improved measurements of the H absolute magnitude, to build comprehensive assessments of these asteroids. In parallel, we search for previously missed detections of NEAs in NEOWISE's Year 9 data and report them to the Minor Planet Center (MPC). This helps to expand further the database of epochs available for future research on NEOs and allows to fully take advantage of the data already collected by WISE. Preparation for NEMS -MS With Ultra -Thin and Mert Yuksel Mass Spectrometry (MS) is used as a technique for identifying proteins through quantitative measurements of charge -to-mass ratio. Nonetheless, traditional techniques rely on pure solutions with a high number of the same samples and lack the high sensitivity necessary for detection of small proteins which can have crucial biological functions. Due to their small scale and high quality factor, nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) resonators provide a promising platform for high- resolution MS, working on the s ingle-molecule level and achieving higher sensitivity. The Roukes group has developed such systems, achieving imaging of a single protein's inertial mass distribution in real time by monitoring shifts in vibrational modes upon adsorption of the protein. Yet, attaining high mass sensitivity remains a challenge in NEMS -MS. In this project, the goal is to implement an LC network tailored for achieving impedance matching in an ultra -thin silicon film NEMS resonator, with the aim of optimizing signal transfer and thereby enhancing achievable mass sensitivity. Additionally, a electrometer mapping PCB is to be designed and implemented for a more efficient method of system alignment. Assembly Test Stand for Construction of Barrel Timing Layer (BTL) in CMS at CERN Kristina Ann Sevier Mentors: Maria Spiropulu and Jason Trevor This project involves constructing an Assembly Test Stand to help with the proper installation of the scintillator silicon photomultipliers (Scintillator SiPMs) to a tray that will be installed into the Barrel Timing Layer of the Compact Muon Solenoid in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. I have referenced the CAD file of the Assembly Test Stand provided by engineers at CERN and used it to order the necessary parts for its construction fro m McMaster and manufacture parts via metal working equipment. I built the Assembly Test Stand from these parts and modified parts as necessary for the build. During the assembly process, there was a lack of communication with the design, so I consulted with the engineers at CERN who created it. I have also manufactured parts incorrectly, therefore, I noted my mistakes and bought new stock to recreate the parts correctly. Even with these difficulties, the overall construction of the test stand was a success. The Assembly Test Stand successfully holds the tray, but the installation of the Scintillator SiPMs has not started, so its success is still undetermined. The next steps are to work on the installation and improve the Assembly Test Stand as needed. Analysis of Di -Higgs Decaying to Two Bottom Quarks and Two Photons Using Proton- Proton Collision Data in CMS at the Large Hadron Collider Joseph Sheeran Mentors: Harvey Newman and Irene Dutta In the Standard Model of particle physics, the Higgs field associated with the Higgs Boson, discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider, generates the intrinsic masses of fundamental particles. By studying the cross section of the process Di -Higgs to two bottom quarks and two photons ( ) we can measure the strength of the Higgs boson self -coupling which is related to the shape of the Higgs potential. Using simulated data of varying energies, we can build convolutional neural networks to better discriminate between background and signal events in the data collected by the Compact Muon Solenoid, and as a result, improve on the constraints on the self -coupling relative to the previous analysis of this channel. We have begun training our model on simple background data and will gradually incorporate all of the main backgrounds along with the simulated signal data in order to build an improved analysis. This will potentially allow us to obtain stronger bounds on Di- Higgs production when implemented on real data. Understanding XP Codes From Quantum Lego Ruohan Shen Mentors: John Preskill and Charles Cao The Quantum Lego framework is a powerful approach for constructing large quantum error correction codes by combining smaller codes. By representing encoding maps as tensors and contracting them, we obtain the encoding map of the larger code. While this framework has shown efficiency for Pauli stabilizer codes on qubits and qudits, its expressibility is limited in the vast many -body Hilbert space. To address this limitation, we propose replacing the atomic Legos with XP codes, which is a lately proposed non- stabilizer code. Surprisingly, we find that the operator matching rule still produces the new stabilizers, as long as we match the logical identity group. Additionally, we establish the condition that the traced code remains an XP code. Our results demonstrate that the Quantum Lego framework can be successfully extended to XP codes, offering new possibilities for error correction in quantum systems. In future work, we plan to explore numerica l methods to discover exotic examples of XP Legos. Moreover, we aim to leverage tensor enumerators, a by -product of the Lego framework, to design efficient decoders for XP Legos. Exploring Misinformation in Twitter's Musk -era Siddhartha Shendrikar Mentors : Michael Alvarez and Jacob Morrier This project aims to detect the changes in climate misinformation after Elon Musk acquired Twitter. There have been previous studies specific to this goal, however we are going to look deeper into the underlying data an d draw conclusions aimed at finding the reasons for the increase in misinformation. We will use hashtags with high misinformation rates to gather the data, measure the differences, and interpret them using a method called causal inference. In the early stages of the project, we gathered hundreds of millions of tweets from the past year that are related to climate. Subsequently, we cleaned up the data, and found the coherence of the topics and started topic modeling to identify trends. The upcoming stages ar e to create visuals and dive into the realm of misinformation. Optimization of the SMI41 Antibody -Expressing rAAV Vector to Mediate Long -Term Contraception Sydney Singal Mentor: Bruce Hay The lack of efficient, long -term contraceptive methods to control the overpopulation of various wild animal populations remains a widespread issue. One approach to inhibiting fertility is long -term vectored contraception (VC). In VC, a single injection of a non- replicating, recombinant adeno -associated viral (rAA V) vector delivers to muscle cells a gene encoding a protein that inhibits a key molecule required for fertility. Our work centers on the monoclonal SMI41 antibody, which binds to and blocks the gonadotropin- releasing hormone (GnRH), thereby inhibiting gam ete development for several years. While this approach was shown to block fertility in mice, it may be ineffective in larger mammals because high levels of the SMI41 antibody are required to mediate contraception. Our goals are to enhance AAV targeting to muscle and overall SMI41 expression as ways to increase the levels of SMI41 produced per vector genome. We are working to identify a capsid that mediates vector entry into muscle and exploring the inclusion of two expression- enhancing sequences in the vect or transgene. immunosorbent (ELISA) was performed to quantify the amount of SMI41 expressed in vitro by the optimized vector constructs. Future steps may include in vivo analysis of vector function and antibody expression in mice. Measuring Fast Radio Burst (FRB) Scintillations Using CHIME Catalog1 Data Anant Singh Mentors: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond -duration bursts of radio waves that mostly originate from outside our galaxy. Although their exact causes remain uncertain, astronomers are now beginning to use these bursts as tools to probe the cosmos. One of the remarkable properties of these radio transients are their scintillations, which are variations in brightness caused by the scattering due to the irregularities in the intervening medium. These scintillations can be used as a tool to study the properties of the intervening medium and the FRB source itself. We develop a pipeline to measure the scintillations for some of the brightest FRBs using CHIME Catalog1 Data. The result will be used to compare with the scintillation model in the Milky way and constrain the origin of the scattering of FRBs. Terrain Aware Adaptive Control Emilia Sj\u00f6gren Mentors: Soon- Jo Chung and Sorina Lupu Developing robust algorithms for robots is essential to ensure reliable and efficient motion capabilities. We are exploring how we can integrate information about the terrain into control algorithms in order to take the environment into account. By extracting images in real time that the robot is taking, we are utilizing machine learning models, specifically a vision transformer called DinoV2 from Meta AI . By analyzing the feature vectors and performing dimensionality reduction using principal component ana lysis, the most important properties can be extracted. The ground properties together with depth images can be visualized as point clouds and elevation maps. These representations can then be used as inputs into adaptive control algorithms running on the r obot. Testing of Mechanical Optical Fiber Switches for Use by the High -Resolution Infrared Spectrograph for The HISPEC project is an experimental spectrograph device, planned for the Keck Observatory in Hawaii. The purpose of the project is the detailed characterization of exoplanets in our universe. A crucial part of the HISPEC assembly is a Mechanical Optical Fiber Switch, which requires extensive verification testing prior to implementation, as the resultant data from HISPEC entirely depends on the proper operation of the Switch device. The testing of the Switch device was carried out by measuring the output p ower from a light source on a power meter, via a pair of fibers connected by the Switch connectors. The power was measured over the course of many repeated connections on a single Switch port, and this allowed us to acquire power throughput data over a set of many connections. From the acquired data, we can conclude that cleanliness is of absolute importance. Occasional cleanings of the fibers inside the switch is a necessity to avoid power drops due to dust accumulation. While we were able to extract some conclusions from the data, further testing is required to find out exactly what cleaning intervals would be the most efficient. GPS-Guided Thermal Image Annotation via Orthorectified RGB Aerial Mentors: Soon- Chung and Co nnor Lee Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have found widespread use in a variety of applications, ranging from agriculture and defense, to remote sensing and entertainment. To enable nighttime operations, UAVs are typically equipped with long -wave infrared cameras that can capture live thermal images for aiding in navigation and scene understanding. Today, deep neural network -based models can provide scene understanding for RGB imagery through the forms of 2D/3D object detection and image segmentation. However, applying such models to perform similar analysis in the thermal domain presents a challenge due to the lack of available thermal s cene- specific training data. Unlike RGB cameras, thermal cameras are not ubiquitous, thus making data collection expensive. Even when such datasets are available, most are not annotated as they look very different from what people often expect, thus requir ing experience and expertise to annotate. In this work, we focus specifically on developing a method using machine learning segmentation models to automatically annotate thermal data for training semantic segmentation models. After developing the thermal s egmentation model, we will use the model on various thermal image segmentation tasks to help aid navigation and scene -understanding of UAVs during their nighttime operations. Understanding the Roles of Intrinsically Disordered Regions multivalent inte ractions with other disordered regions, driving formation of locally enriched hubs. Transcription factors (TFs) often contain such IDRs for the recruitment of coactivators and transcriptional machinery. Human rhabdomyosarcoma is driven by the onco genic Pax3 -FoxO1 fusion protein, which consists of the Pax3 DNA -binding domain fused to the strongly activating FoxO1 IDR. In this project, we utilize live cell fluorescence imaging of full length IDRs as well as truncated variants, to identify whether Fox O1 IDRs promoted the formation of transcriptional hubs and any dominant interactions driving hub formation. We also employ luciferase assays to study the functional relevance of such interactions on transcription. We demonstrate that Foxo1 IDR, but not Pax 3 IDR, was able to form local hubs of enrichment, underscoring the relevance of such interactions. From various truncation mutations, we identify that blocks of positive and negative charge were major drivers behind IDR colocalization. By characterizing dy namic features driving colocalization of IDRs relevant to cancer, we hope to open novel therapeutic avenues towards the treatment of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. Neural Theorem Proving Anandkumar and Kaiyu Yang Large Language (LLMs) have shown promise in Neural Theorem Proving (NTP) using Interactive Theorem Provers (ITPs) such as Lean, especially after our recent release of LeanDojo, an open -source Lean playground that extracts fine -grained data from Lean proof files and facilitates interaction with the proof environment programmatically, and ReProver, the first LLM -based prover augmented with retrieval for selecting premises from a vast math library. Built on top of these advances, this work on one hand upgrades LeanDojo with full support for Lean 4, the latest enhanced version of Lean to be official released, in order to preserve LeanDojo's relevancy in the future and arm it with more high- quality data from Lean 4 proofs. On the other hand, this work also creates LeanONNX, a complementary tool to LeanDojo that leverages the power of LLMs back to assist with ITPs, by enabling LLM inferencing in Lean 4 as a copilot for theorem proving. Those two directions together establish a roundtrip between the potent instruments of LLMs and ITPs, fostering a beneficial loop that automatically advances the field of Neural Theorem Proving (NTP) in the long run. Structural Characterization of Human Nuclear Pore Membrane Protein GP210 Philip Spyrou Mentors: Andre Hoelz and Edjer The human nuclear pore is an anchored macromolecular assembly forming the only bidirectional gateway regulating the exchange of macromolecules across the nuclear membranes. One of the 34 unique proteins which assemble the nuclear pore, GP210 is an integral membrane protein composed of a singular helical transmembrane domain and 17 repeated domains of an Ig like fold. GP210 is one component of the inner ring of the nuclear pore complex, and is theoretically responsible for anchoring the nuclear p ore, providing flexibility, and stabilizing the nuclear envelope curvature. Due to its high flexibility, GP210 was subdivided into individual Ig -like domains. Seventeen Ig -like domain have been identified, which were each individually tested for expression and solubility. Soluble Ig -like domains were tagged with a histidine -SUMO tag for Nickel affinity purification by and then ion exchange chromatography based on the pI of the purified domain. Finally, a size exclusion chromatography allowed researchers to obtain highly pure protein sample suited for crystallization. Commercially available crystallization screens were used to increase the probability to obtain protein crystals. Crystals for Ig17 have been obtained and been optimized. Due to poor yields of other soluble Ig domains, new expression constructs are being generated to create longer chains of Ig domains with potentially better expression and solubility. Structural characterization at high resolution of these Ig domains will allow researchers to unde rstand the flexibility of GP210 which acts like a belt allowing the NPC to open and close for nucleocytoplasmic transport. Monte Carlo Tree Search on a Graphics Processing Unit in the Context of Online Robotic Decision Making Felix Steinberger Eriksson Mentors: Soon- Jo Chung and Benjamin Rivi\u00e8re Effectively leveraging parallel computation on graphics processing units (GPUs) is a promising direction for speeding up online robotic decision making and planning algorithms. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is an established method with well -known empirical results. Since it was first described, MCTS has been adapted to areas beyond turn- based games with full observability, expanding its domain of applicability to areas like control and robotics. There are also recent theoretical results on the non- asymptotic convergence properties of MCTS. Although there exist parallel implementations of MCTS, parallel MCTS implementation is underexplored in the context of robotics. Furthermore, sever al recent methods for online robotic decision making make use of MCTS as a subroutine to obtain solutions to decision problems, or generalize it to explore the sample complexity of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We provide parallel implementations of so me variants of MCTS and related newly proposed tree search algorithms. These parallel implementations are used in empirical analysis of a newly proposed anytime tree search -based planning algorithm that provides insight into new sample complexity measures for finite deterministic tabular MDPs. Machine Learning Model to Predict Patient Fatigue Using Data From Wearable Sensors Ashwitha Surabhi Mentors: Wei Gao and Changhao Xu Wearable sensors have become an increasingly popular area of research due to their ability to transform the medical industry by allowing the measurement of a patient's physiological signals in constant time. In this project, we are measuring the pulse, GSR (Galvanic Skin Response), and temperature data from patients and using this data to predict patient fatigue, which becomes important for a patient as they are able to monitor their own health and energy levels throughout the day. Using data processing techniques, we are able to analyze the raw data from the patient and create more metr ics such as systolic upstroke velocity time for pulse data and weighted moving average data for temperature and GSR data. Then, using machine learning techniques, specifically a transformer model using GPT 2, we will be able to take this data from the wear able sensor as an input to predict patient fatigue levels. Improving Methods to Enhance Porous Ceramic Conductivity With Carbon Nanotubes Matthieu (Finn) Sutcliffe Mentors: Katherine Faber and Kevin Yu The Faber group has developed a method to grow directionally porous ceramics by freeze -casting preceramic solutions. Silicon oxycarbide can be formed in this manner with a high degree of control over pore size, morphology and fraction, making it suitable for mass transport applications such as sensing and battery electrodes. However, the samples produced are electrically insulating, so the group has explored ways combine these ceramics with conductive carbon nanotubes. From these processes, specimen conductivity has been successfully increased by 10 orders of magnitudes up to around 0.01 Scm -1. Further increases in conductivity require the investigation of methods that can achieve higher CNT loading. This work seeks to refine three such methods, namely dispersing nanotubes in the pre -ceramic solution, growing nanotubes from nickel dispersed in the pre -ceramic solution, and growth from nickel deposited after casting. For the first method, it was found that nanotube dispersion by ultrasonication is mechanically limited to no more than 12wt.% due to solvent saturation leading to a gel -like consistency. The second method remains limited by the formation of Ni 2Si during pyrolysis, which does not oxidise in air below 1100\u00b0C . In the post- pyrolysis deposition method, it is theorised based on observation that nic kel migration is dominated by segregation of a suspected silica phase homogeneously nucleating in the subsurface of the deposited layer. Light Yield Analysis of LYSO Scintillation Crystals for the Barrel Timing Layer at the Compact Muon Solenoid Kai Svens on Mentors: Maria Spiropulu, Adi Bornheim, and Jason Trevor The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is in the multi -year process of upgrading its particle beam luminosity, which will rename it the High Luminosity LHC (HL -LHC), expected to begin operation in 2028. The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is one collision site locate d around the main LHC loop, and will require greater detection capabilities in order to account for the upgraded luminosity. In particular, a new minimum ionizing particle (MIP) Timing Detector (MTD) will be installed cylindrically around the collision cha mber of the CMS in three parts: the Barrel Timing Layer (BTL) and two Endcap Timing Layers (ETL). The BTL will comprised of cerium doped lutetium (SiPMs), which wil l be packaged in modules sized approximately 5\u00d75\u00d70.5 cm. In the coming year, Caltech will become one of four assembly centers worldwide for constructing over ten thousand modules needed for the BTL. To this end, Caltech has constructed a device named the Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) jig, which will be distributed to all the assembly centers. The jig measures the scintillation light yield of each read -out channel on a module to ensure that the quality of the construction has met passing criter ia. We conduct a performance test of the QA/QC jig to commission its design. In particular, we examine the consistency and accuracy of the jig with different sources of radiation, SiPM over - voltages, and data analysis procedures. Our most notable result is a discrepancy on the order of 10% when comparing light yield measurements taken with different sources of radiation. We offer several potential reasons for this discrepancy, and discuss possible methods of correction. Further studies are required to offic ially commission the final design of the jig, but the results found in this project have provided evidence that the jig can deliver an accuracy within our desired tolerance. Understanding Mechanical and Acoustical Factors in Sonogenetics Aaban Syed Mentor s: Mikhail Shapiro and Hao Shen Description: Controlling cellular activity is at the foundation of biological and clinical research. Light -based methods have been able to demonstrate high levels of control but suffer from low tissue penetration and high invasiveness. On the other hand, ultrasound (US ) is capable of deep tissue penetration while maintaining high spatial resolution. Sonogenetics is a method in which US is used to control the activity of genetically defined cell populations. Mechanosenstitive membrane proteins (MSMPs) such as ecMscL -G22S , mmPiezo1, and hsTRPA1 have been reported to sensitize cells to US stimulation, but the performance of those MSMPs in vivo has been inconsistent. We reasoned this is potentially because various mechanical effects, only specific to the traditional in vitro sonogenetic setups, were often neglected upon in vivo translation. These include acoustic streaming, substrate vibration, and the formation of standing waves. This project aimed to determine how each of these effects might impact the responses of MSMPs up on US stimulation by testing previously reported MSMPs in our newly designed in vitro setup capable of decoupling those confounding effects from each other. To date, we have cloned and functionally validated those MSMPs in our setup and established the ana lysis pipeline for evaluating their sonogenetic performance through calcium imaging. Development of Magneto -Optical Instrument and SHG Intensity Calculations for Different SHG-Processes Terri Yu Chen Tai Mentors: David Hsieh and Mingyao Guo This project investigates the modification of the rotational anisotropy -second harmonic generation (RA -SHG) setup, specifically SHG measurements on magnetic materials, in which the time -reversal symmetry is broken below the critical temperature. By comparing pa tterns in different RA -SHG channels under magnetic fields, the symmetry of the magnetic order can be revealed, providing an accurate all -optical way to probe materials' intrinsic magnetic properties. The first part of this report will detail the design of a magneto -optical instrument that assists in collecting data for experiments regarding how the direction of the magnetic field affects the pattern when a laser beam is shone onto the magnetic material at a low temperature. The second part will walk through the calculations of the intensity of SHG from different dipole and quadrupole sources, which represent distinct polarization geometries, obtained using Mathematica. Ultrasound -Based Imaging of Kinase Activity Using Engineered Gas Vesicles: Specificity Te sting for Protein Kinase A (PKA) and Enhanced Kinetic Properties Tigist Terefe Mentors: Mikhail Shapiro and Jee Wong Yang In this study, we investigate the utilization of engineered gas vesicles (GVs) as an innovative ultrasound -based imaging tool, enabli ng real -time monitoring of kinase activity in living tissues. Kinases, pivotal regulators of cellular processes, play a crucial role in cancer progression, emphasizing the significance of accurate activity monitoring. Traditional fluorescent biosensors for in situ kinase activity visualization encounter limitations due to light scattering in deep tissues, compromising imaging precision. Through strategic modifications to the ribbed surface structure, engineered GVs are designed to enhance the acoustic diffe rential signal. The research focuses on two primary aspects: firstly, evaluating the newly engineered GvpC (GV -associated protein C) for its specificity towards Protein Kinase A (PKA) and other cancer -related kinases while ensuring non- reactivity with othe r common kinases; secondly, exploring various GV constructs to optimize kinetics by accelerating ribbed structure shedding, thereby promoting faster buckling of GVs. The successful targeting of PKA and other cancer -related kinases with engineered GVs demon strates the potential of this noninvasive, high- resolution ultrasound approach for real -time imaging of kinase activity in living tissues, opening new avenues for studying kinase dynamics and their implications in cancer research, providing valuable insights into the dynamic behavior of kinase signaling pathways in vivo. Improving the Representation of Precipitation Particles in CliMA's Earth System Model Apoorva Thanvantri Mentors: Tapio Schneider and Anna Jaruga Accurate climate models are vital to predicting the impacts of climate change and guiding mitigation strategies. The representation of clouds in climate models is critical due to their ability to cool Earth's atmosphere. Many cloud related processes act on scales that are too small to be resolved by climate models and therefore need to be parameterized. Rudimentary parameterizations of microphysical processes, such as the terminal velocity of precipitation particles (i.e. water droplets, ice crystals), lead to model biases. Terminal velocity in particular affects the particle's residence times, as well as their collision and diffusion growth rates - this, in turn, affects the simulated cloud cover, precipitation formation rate, and below cloud humidity. Chen et. al. 2022 derived a new terminal velocity parameterization based on particle size, shape, and air density by using multiple gamma function terms and accounting for the asphericity of snow particles. My work integrates the new parameterization with the 1 and 2 moment cloud microphysics schemes at CliMA. I then analyzed the resulting differences for individual particles, their group fall speeds, and cloud simulations using a 1 -dimensional kinematic model. Signatures of Nonviolent Nonlocality From Scatte a Schwarzschild Black Hole Agla \u00de\u00f3rarinsd\u00f3ttir Mentors: Yanbei Chen and Brian Seymour In the semi -classical approximation Hawking showed that by applying quantum field theory black holes must evaporate. Since Hawking radiation is thermal, such evaporation can lead to a violation of unitarity, since the black hole goes from a pure initial state to a mixed state. This loss of unitarity is known as the Information Paradox. Many ideas that attempt to resolve this paradox predict violent deviations from general relativity at distances l p away from the event horizon. Nonviolent nonlocality (NVNL) is a proposal by Steve Giddings where quantum information is more softy transferred from the black hole interior to the exterior, via nonlocal mechanisms that manifest as random metric fluctuations at distances Rs outside the horizon. If NVNL exists, it will have observational implications in gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO and LISA. In this work, we study how the NVNL perturbations modify how gravitational waves scatter off a Schwarzschild black hole. Specifically, we compute the perturbation to the Zerilli equation caused by NVNL. In our preliminary study, we send in a Gaussian wave packet and examine how the random metric fluctuations caused by NVNL would affect the outgoing wave. Eventually, we would like to use more realistic waveform models that better approximate gravitational waves emitted by binary black hole mergers, and more accurately study how well detectors can search for NVNL . Developing Optogenetic Control Over Gene Expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms to Understand the R ole of the Extracellular Matrix in Biofilm Formation Alika Ting Mentors: Dianne Newman and Georgia Squyres Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen contributing to persistent chronic infections by forming biofilms, aggregates of cells joined by a matrix of extracellular DNA and polysaccharides. The polysaccharide Pel plays a role in the structure of the biofilm, and we hope to understand how biofilms respond to perturbation of Pel spatial regulation. We use the optogenetic circuit pDawn to turn on expression of a gene of interest in P. aeruginosa using blue light. To characterize pDawn, we created a strain with optoge netic control over the gene mApple, exposed cells to blue light for varying amounts of time, and measured red fluorescence. We found that maximum optogenetic activation requires 9 hours of blue light exposure. We then patterned gene expression via red fluo rescence on E. coli bacterial lawns using a projector to shine images in blue light, confirming that the pDawn optogenetic system can be used to spatially control gene expression. For the remainder of our project, we are cloning pDawn to the Pel biosynthetic operon, pelA -G, such that blue light will increase Pel production in P. aeruginosa . This will allow us to observe how the biofilm responds to changes in the spatial patterning of Pel production. The Fractal Hand: A Novel Malcolm Tisdale Mentor: Joel Burdick Robust, yet fast, grasp planning for adversarial objects remains an unresolved challenge in robotics. Synergistic grippers tackle this problem by trading computational with mechani cal complexity, thus leveraging environmental features to achieve successful grasps. The expired patent US1059545A describes a highly conformable universal vise, also known as a fractal vise, whose design principles inspire our approach. We have developed a synergistic, nonanthropomorphic, Fractal Hand that is agnostic to an objects' shape and pose. The Fractal Hand enables grasping of adversarial objects with minimal grasp planning. This paper presents the design methodology and experimentation of a Fracta l Hand embodiment, as applied to robotic manipulation. We first develop a type and dimensional synthesis method that quantifies the scale variant complexity \u2014 the range and variation of detail at different scales \u2014 of objects in a data set to generate a cu stomized Fractal Hand embodiment. We then show the hand grasping adversarial objects using a fast, simple, grasp planning pipeline. This work aims to explore and highlight the potential of the extensive, yet largely unexplored, design space of fractal hand s. Orbit Design for Formation -Flying Missions Andres Torres Mentor: Soon- Jo Chung Multi-satellite missions have been well- established for a long time, particularly constellation swarms. A frontier of multi- satellite missions is formation flying satellites, which enables much more complicated and expanded satellite capabilities. One major difficulty in formation flying is determining suitable orbits for each satellite. Our goal is to design orbits that: (1) best position satellites to achieve their mission objectives; and (2) minimize fuel costs needed to maintain the orbits. This problem can be transformed into an optimization problem. One approach that we have applied with success and are actively improving is a genetic algorithm, which iteratively improves a formation into a better one. However, despite the success of the genetic algorithm there are still two main challenges: (1) it can get stuck in local extrema, meaning that the formation generated might not be the best possible one; and (2) it takes a while to converge to an acceptable formation. An alternative is using deep reinforcement learning, which after training, can provide high quality formations significantly faster than the genetic algorithm. We apply and compare both methods to NASA 's Distributed Aperture Radar Tomographic Sensors (DARTS) mission concept which has the goal of drastically improve radar imaging of the Earth. Understanding the Role of the Dorsal Motor Nucleus of the Vagus Nerve in Gastric Emptying in a Mouse Model of -Synuclein Aggregation Matthew Torres Mentors: Sarkis Mazmanian and Fonseca Parkinson's disease is characterized by neuronal loss in specific areas of the substantia nigra in the brain and accumulation of the protein -Synuclein in both the substantia nigra and in neurons of other tissues in the body, such as enteric neurons of the gastrointestinal tract. This not only impacts motor function, but also results in gastrointestinal symptoms, like constipation, which can manifest before motor symptoms do. Previous research on the Thy1 -hSNCA mouse model, which presents Syn overexpression, has shown that 5 month old mice from this model display -Synuclein aggregation in the stomach and reduced gastric emptying compared to wild -type mice. To attempt to explain how Parkinson's disease can cause impaired gastric emptying, we evaluated the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, a region of the brain from which efferent neurons originate to initiate autonomic regulation of the stomach, via confocal fluorescence microscopy to compare the activation of neurons between wild-type and Syn-overexpressing mice under fasted and fed conditions. The Vertical Evolution of Marine Particulate Organic Matter Eunice Tsang Mentors: Alex Sessions and Shaelyn Silverman The marine carbon cycle plays a key role in regulating Earth's global temperature and climate, as the largest reservoir of bioavailable carbon is stored in the ocean. In particular, marine particulate organic matter (POM) plays a crucial role in sequestering CO 2 away from the atmosphere through its vertical transport of carbon from the surface ocean to the seafloor. While sinking, POM can be remineralized back to CO 2 via microbial or animal heterotrophic processes, or it can disaggregate into smaller particles. Mechanistic understanding of the degradative processes acting on POM, and their controls, is crucial to be able to predict how these processes will change in the future. While these processes are difficult to probe in situ due to their dynamic nature, characterizing how the molecular composition and stable hydrogen isotope values of POM vary with depth in different marine ecosystems and size fractions may provide insight into the degradative mechanisms acting on these particles. We hope to apply a novel analytical tool - compound -specific hydrogen isotope analysis of amino acids (i.e., 2HAA analysis) - to elucidate how 2HAA values in POM shift diagnostically in response to different degradative processes. Here, we will present quantitative abundances of amino acids in sinking and size -fractionated particles collected by the Close lab (U. Miami) from ecologically distinct sites during NASA EXPORTS and BIOS -SCOPE expeditions. Additionally, we will incorporate 2HAA values obtained from these POM samples into our future analyses. These measurements can provide insight into determining which environmental factors most significantly control POM degradation in different marine ecosystems. Results of this study may ultimately contribute to 2HAA as a useful and highly important proxy for in situ degradative mechanisms acting on marine POM . Split TurboID -based Proximity Labeling for Identification of Proteins at Mitochondria -Lysosomal Contact Sites Natalie Tsubamoto Mentors: David Chan and Zheng Yang The mitochondria and lysosome are key organelles in the regulation of energy -production, autophagy, proliferation, and programmed cell death. Dysfunction in either has been closely linked with multiple neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders, including Charcot -Marie -Tooth Type 2, Parkinson's disease, and Gaucher's disease, among others. Due to their closely overlapping roles, it is unsurprising that the mitochondria and lysosome regulate each other in many of these key functions. Communication between these organelles was long believed to be indirect, however recent studies have observed the formation of mitochondrial -lysosome contact sites in healthy, untreated cells, mediated by the tethering protein RAB7 GTPase. Additional proteins are believed to be recruited to these contact sites for the exchange of metabolites critical for normal function in both organelles. Here, we report on the utilization of a Split TurboID -based proximity labeling system to isolate and identify these recruited proteins and further investigation of their role in cellular metabolism, as well as their pathological significance. Composite Subsystem Symmetries and Decoration of Sub- Dimensional Excitations Avi Vadali Mentor: Xie Chen Flux binding is a mechanism well understood for global symmetries. Given two systems each with a global symmetry, gauging the composite symmetry vs. each of the individual symmetry corresponds to the condensation of the charge pair and the binding of the two fluxes. In this paper, we study what happens when combining subsystem symmetries, especially when the component charges and fluxes have different sub -dimensional mobilities. We investigate 3+1D systems with planar symmetries where, for example, the planar symmetry of a planon charge is combined with one of the planar symmetries of a fracton charge. We propose the principle of Remote Detectability to determine how the fluxes bind and potentially change their mobility. This understanding can then be used to design fracton models whose sub -dimensional excitations are decorated with nontrivial statistics or non- abelian structures. In particular, one construction provides the \"ungauged\" subsystem symmetry - protected topological state corresponding to the Cage -net models. Calcium Isotopes as a Biomarker: Are They Effective for Diagnosing Bone Disease? Phillip A. Vakoula Mentors: Francois Tissot and Rosa Grigoryan Osteoporosis is a bone disease characterized by the loss of bone mineral density. The progression of osteoporosis is typically assessed using dual- energy x -ray absorptiometry (DXA or DEXA), which, while effective at quantifying bone loss, is poorly subscri bed as a screening technique due to access barriers (travel to clinic, radiation exposure, etc.). Multiple studies have shown a promising future in the use of natural calcium isotope variability as a bone turnover marker and more specifically as a diagnostic tool for osteoporosis and other similar bone diseases, with the hope that it would provide a more readily accessible screening method. However, it has been shown that healthy individuals with no net bone loss still have considerable urinary isotopic variability, which confounds the sensitivity and specificity of this diagnostic tool. To better understand this variability, we created a model of bodily calcium isotope mass balance to simulate different scenarios involving both healthy individuals and those experiencing bone loss. We find that a healthy person's calcium isotope mass balance is not constant, due to variable dietary compositions and kidney reabsorption, and this is reflected by the isotopic composition of urinary calcium. While this complicates diagnosis of changes in bone mineral balance using urinary calcium isotopes alone, strong correlations between urinary calcium isotope ratios and calcium excretion rates allow a means of normalizing urine calcium data to improve the sensitivity and specificity with respect to diagnosing bone loss. We find that such normalizations could substantially improve the performance of this diagnostic tool, but would need to be calibrated against data from healthy individuals across various populations. Deciphering Reanimation From General Anesthesia Using Drosophila Heaven R. Hong and Pratyush Kandimalla Despite the centrality of anesthesia to modern medicine, methods that reliably promote reversal of the anesthetized state are lacking. Return to consciousness from anesthesia, termed reanimation, is an entirely passive process dictated by the pharmacokinetics of the agent in the bloodstream. The vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster is a highly tractable experimental model that enables genetic dissection of neural circuit function in the brain. In Drosophila confined to a two -dimensional behavioral arena, exposure to general inhalation anesthetics such as sevoflurane, at concentrations similar to those used in humans, induces cessation of spontaneous - and stimulus - triggered walking. Preliminary work identified a population of dopaminergic neurons (DANs) whose optogenetic activation induced coordinated walking in the presence of anesthetizing levels of sevofluorane, suggesting that stimulating DAN activity may promote emergence from anesthesia in flies. To determine if DAN activation triggers true functional rea nimation of the Drosophila brain, as opposed to simply eliciting motor commands, we adapted an optomotor behavioral task (the \"stampede\" assay) to determine if behaviors that require complex sensorimotor processing behaviors are intact in reanimated flies. This work also establishes a promising new experimental platform for a broader investigation of the neural mechanisms that could mediate reanimation from anesthesia, with the potential for advancing our understanding of the basic neural mechanisms that underlie the anesthetized state. Controlled 2.5D Laboratory Experiments to Investigate Preferential Flow of Meltwater in Snow Analog Priscilla Vazquez Mentors: Xiaojing (Ruby) Fu and Nathan Jones Snow is an important part of the hydrological cycle as 70% of the total freshwater that is circulating on Earth continuously is stored within snow or icy environments. Tracking meltwater infiltration in snow is a challenging process because of the emergence of preferential flow pathways or \"fingers\" due to the gr avity fingering instability. The meltwater interaction between discrete snow layers is particularly (important) as it can refreeze into ice lenses or contribute to lateral runoff within the snowpack, yet the dynamics of this process are not yet understood. In order to study the interaction between preferential meltwater flow and layered snow systems, a quasi -2D flow cell filled with two distinct layers of glass bead packs is used as a snow analog. Experiments are performed considering multiple scenarios to investigate both hydraulic barriers and capillary barriers. Additionally, we have observed ponding in between layers as it occurs because of the 2D -flow cell. These observations will provide important insights into the dynamics of snow meltwater/layer interface interactions and will provide experimental data to validate the numerical model developed by the Fu group. Accelerating Convergence of Climate Parameter Estimation With a Momentum Approach Sydney Vernon Mentors: Tapio Schneider, Oliver Dunbar, and Eviatar Bach The Climate Modeling Alliance (CliMA) looks to accurately represent small -scale, climate -invariant processes, such as cloud physics, in order to reduce model uncertainty. Such representations often introduce unknown parameters. These parameters are estimated using Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI), an iterative gradient- free method which minimizes the distance between model output and observed data while balancing contributions from prior knowledge. E KI updates an ensemble of particles, converging on the optimal parameter value using statistical information about the ensemble to replace the role of a gradient in traditional approaches. EKI requires climate model evaluations, which are often expensive; it is therefore of interest to accelerate EKI convergence. We modify a known acceleration method for gradient descent, Nesterov's momentum, taking advantage of the fact that EKI approximates gradient descent. Intuitively, the method mimics a ball gaining s peed while rolling down a constantly -sloped hill. We study multiple variants on the algorithm, including an approximated higher -order scheme, and compare their convergence on example inverse problems. We conclude that these methods do indeed accelerate con vergence in practice, reducing the necessary model evaluations. The resulting EKI methods with momentum were incorporated into CliMA's publicly available codebase for use by the wider scientific community. Establishing the Chronology and Story of the Old Engelmann Oak Sarah Vierling Mentor: Alex Sessions An old Engelmann oak tree near the center of the Caltech campus succumbed to an incurable soil fungus in 2017. Estimated to be up to 400 years old, the tree potentially records a detailed history of local climate variability in Pasadena, California and was initially considered a witness to the creation of the United States, Spanish colonization, and the predecessor Tongva community. We will present results of radiocarbon dating, stable carbon isotope measurements, and high- resolution image analysis of tree ring widths from a radial slice of the oak tree trunk. Whole wood samples were purified to yield alpha -cellulose through a series of NaClO 2 and NaOH extractions; alpha -cellulose is a preferred archiv e for physiological and environmental data because it avoids post -synthetic oxygen or carbon exchange. Radiocarbon dating was performed on 14 alpha -cellulose samples at the W. M. Keck Carbon Cycle Accelerator Mass Spectrometer (Keck -CCAMS) Facility, Univer sity of California Irvine; results are still pending. Stable carbon isotope ratios ( 13C values) of over 100 whole wood samples and ten alpha -cellulose samples were measured by elemental analyzer isotope -ratio mass spectrometry (EA -IRMS) at constant 13C values (- 25.54 \u00b1 0.67) over the interior ~48.8cm of the tree, with a marked decline to -29.25 in the outer 6.1cm of the section. In the outermost 1cm, 13C values increase to -27. We tentatively interpret the decline as representing an increase in water availability via Caltech irrigation, while the return to higher 13C levels shows the tree weakening with age. Our data provide insights into the oak's age and how climate has changed the local biotic environment. Furth er research will replicate methodologies on different tree sections, enhancing our accuracy and understanding of historic climate behavior. An MCMC and Diffusion Based Algorithm for Inverse Problem Solving Austin Zheng, Nikola Kovachki, and Bahareh Tolooshams In recent years, diffusion models have become more commonly used as unsupervised inverse problem solvers, given sufficient modification to the sampling process. Similarly, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have seen widespread usage in scientific computing and inverse problem solving. We propose a MCMC -based algorithm that explores the latent sampling space of a diffusion model, incorporating the diffusion model's deterministic sampling process and the inverse problem's forward operator as feedback when computing acceptance probabilities. This pushes the chain towards higher probability regions in the latent space that, when used as starting points for the deterministic sample r, map to the observed data. We evaluate our method on smaller -scale synthetic data experiments and an image inpainting problem on the LSUN Bedroom dataset. Towards an Enantioselective Total Synthesis of Pedrolide Jessica Wang Mentors: Sarah E. Reisman and Cedric Lozano Complex natural product synthesis is of great interest to organic chemists from both applied and intellectual standpoints. The Reisman Group has had a long standing interest in total synthesis, with particular attention to synthe sizing natural products via convergent coupling approaches. Pedrolide, a novel tigliane -type diterpenoid that is heptacyclic and features an embedded bicycle[2.2.1]heptane system, is a compelling synthetic target based on its complex structure alone. Pedro lide also has interesting biological activity and medicinal potential. Our convergent synthetic strategy towards pedrolide relies on a radical -based cyclopropane fragmentation to construct the bicycle[2.2.1]heptane, and an enantioselective homo -Diels\u2014Alder\u2014developed in collaboration with the Sigman Group at the University of Utah\u2014to construct the cyclopropane. Herein we report efforts regarding two enantioselective synthetic routes towards pedrolide, focused on answering synthetic questions regarding functi onalization and our key synthetic steps. These efforts will ultimately contribute towards an enantioselective total synthesis of pedrolide. Search for Nonresonant Pair Production of Highly Energetic Higgs Bosons Decaying to Bottom Quarks Sherry Wang Xie, Christina Wang, Cristi\u00e1n Pe\u00f1a, and Artur Apresyan We reconstruct the rare production a pair of Lorentz -boosted Higgs bosons via gluon and vector boson fusion, as well as its subsequent decay into two bottom quark -antiquark pairs. This analysis focuses on drawing correspondence between proton -proton col lision data collected by the CMS Collaboration during Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and various simulated signal and background samples generated by POWHEG 2.0. Performing the analysis in the signal, top, and one -lepton control regions, each def ined by the strictness of selections on jet properties, allows us to understand the features of both of the dominant background processes as well as the X bb tagger modeling. By isolating and researching jet properties, we lay the groundwork for a future interaction network -based jet tagger. The ultimate goal of the analysis and tagger algorithm together is to further constrain the strength of the Higgs self -coupling constant, providing insights on how the Higgs mechanism structure gives rise to electroweak spontaneous symmetry breaking and potential phenomena beyond the Standard Model. Investigating Potential Finite -Time Blowup in Models for 3D Euler Singularity Using Fixed -Point Method Xiuyuan Wang Mentor: Thomas Y. Hou The fundamental question on the gl obal regularity of the 3D Euler and Navier -Stokes equations with smooth initial data remains one of the most challenging open problems in fluid dynamics. Huang et.al. have developed a xed - point method to prove the existence of self -similar nite time blow up in 1D generalized Constantin- Lax-Majda model, which is a simplied model for vorticity formulation of the 3D incompressible Euler equations. Our current work aims to further advance this line of research by extending this method to multi -dimensional cas es and applying it to investigate possible finite -time singularities in several simplified models proposed to study 3D Euler singularities, both numerically and theoretically. A Recurrent Neural Network Model for Sequence Learning Built Upon Endotaxis Meg Wilkinson Mentors: Markus Meister and Zeyu Jing Sequence learning holds a pivotal role in animal navigation. From previous experiments, after repeated trial -and- errors in the maze, the animal becomes able to execute smooth, optimal paths towards a chosen goal without hesitation. These observations lead to our conjecture that the learning process transitions from a trial -and-error approach to sequencing actions together. This pr oject aims to construct a sequence learning model that is downstream to the pre -existing Endotaxis model. The Endotaxis model is a three -layer neural network that offers explanation for the trial -and-error phase of learning. We constructed a recurrent neur al network (RNN) that learns sequences of actions by the supervising signal from Endotaxis. This network demonstrates how the agent is able to learn the correct action at each node in the maze and furthermore, is able to sequence these correct actions together to form the shortest path to the chosen goal. This project paired with the Endotaxis model offers a more complete explanation of the behaviour of an agent in a new environment: from the earliest stages of exploration, trial-and-error and goal learning to the latter stage of sequence learning and planning. Design and Physical Prototyping of a Reconfigurable Surface Structure Audrey Wong Mentors: Sergio Pellegrino and Alexander Wen The shape of a structure is often closely tied to its function, and can optimize performance when tailored to a specific application. As a result, structures capable of changing shape to achieve different results are highly desirable. Kirigami -inspired str uctures permit large deformations without permanent damage and are advantageous in design versatility. While folding cannot intrinsically change the curvature of a structure, it can approximate multiple target surfaces of varying curvatures. The objective is to design and prototype a structure which achieves a set of desired target configurations, implement the necessary torsion spring stiffness values, and restrict the hinge rotations to the required ranges. This structure is designed to achieve rigidity i n multiple target configurations through the placement of unilateral constraints and springs. Verifying Web Browser Security With Cachet, a JIT Compiler DSL for Expressive Static Assertions June Woodward Mentors: Deian Stefan and Richard M. Murray Implem entations -typed programming languages often perform inline caching , which takes advantage of observed regularities in an executing program and speeds up the \"fast path\" by replacing a function call with the type -specific method that it deleg ates to. However, since a dynamically -typed program is not required to maintain these regularities, implementations must also preface each inline cache with a guard , ensuring that a method is not called on the wrong type. SpiderMonkey's just -in-time (JIT) compiler has experienced multiple bugs and vulnerabilities from subtle mismatches between these assumptions and checks. The PLSysSec team at UCSD has made Cachet, a domain- specific language (DSL) where these invariants can be expressed and statically verified, and partially rewritten SpiderMonkey's CacheIR -to-MASM compilation step in Cachet. In my SURF project I continued to apply Cachet to SpiderMonkey, and improved the build system and documentation. Hardware Design and Software Integration for the Autonomous Flying Ambulance Brittany Wright Mentors: Soon- Jo Chung, Joshua Cho, and Matthew Anderson The autonomous flying ambulance (AFA) is an eight -motored vertical take -off and landing vehicle that is intended to transport a patient and paramedic to a medi cal facility faster than land -based emergency transportation. The AFA is on its 4 th iteration with a testbed (a 4x2 grid of motors with electronics attached) that runs Neural -Fly, a deep-learning model for unmanned aircrafts. This testbed functions as a research platform for fault -tolerant control where in the event of a motor failure, the aircraft re -allocates motor efficiencies to maintain steady flight. Apart from this testbed, a 1/5th model of the AFA's fuselage has been built. On this model, we install the testbed electronics which include a flight controller that uses adaptive control and an onboard computer that runs Neural - Fly. This installation involves designing mounts to secure the electronics while accounting for constraints like space, wire management, power management, and mass distribution. This also includes integrating the flight software, Ardupilot, onto the electronics and using open- source applications such as Mission Planner to set flight parameters. After completing this hardware and software integration, we intend to have this 1/5 th model fly with the same capabilities as the testbed. Uncovering the Mechanisms of Drosophila Odor Formation: A Study of Early Life Olfactory Sense Modification Process With a Chronic Natural Odor Zihang Xiao Mentor: Elizabeth J. Hong Just like humans, olfactory experience in early life can alter how Drosophila melanogaster behave towards odors in later life. Understanding how early life experience affects olfactory function provides insights into understanding the development of the nervous system and the role of the sensory environment in shaping this process. Prior work showed t hat chronic exposure to natural odors increases the attraction of flies to familiar odors when measured in a free -flight trap assay. However, both the neural and behavioral mechanisms that mediate this increase in attraction are not known. Here, we optimiz ed an odor -dependent upwind running assay, in which the intensity and timing of the odor stimulus relative to the fly can be precisely controlled, to investigate if and how odor experience affects odor intensity thresholds for upwind attraction in flies. Additionally, we used transgenic flies that enable genetic silencing of defined neural populations to investigate the contribution of dopaminergic function to odor - experience dependent plasticity. Development of Secondary Channel Networks Correction on Wetlands Hydrodynamics System Modeling Olivia Xu Mentors: Michael Lamb and DongChen Wang The coastal wetland ecosystem is highly sensitive to local hydraulic conditions and is impacted by the presence of numerous secondary channels that alter water flows. However, these narrow channels sometimes are not well resolved in the bathymetry data due to resolution limitations and/or survey errors, giving rise to issues in channel network connectivity. The accurate representation of the channel network is crucial for the wetland hydrodynamic model to predict the future behavior of the system. We develop a geospatial data analysis tool in Python to extract channel widths from remotely sensed images, employing convolution and segmentation techniques for edge detecti on as well as feature and cross -sectional data extraction to automatically perform secondary channel network corrections. We also leverage MATLAB software OceanMesh2D for the development and utilization of a mesh generation tool that adopts an automated approach for mesh refinement based on the corrected bathymetric data. The framework's application on land build processes at the Atchafalaya River Delta region and AVIRIS datasets enables a more comprehensive analysis of secondary channel networks' influence on wetland ecology, morphology, and materials transport efficiency. Estimation of Computational Models of the Impact of Attention on Simple Choice Using Julia Lynn Yang Mentors: Antonio Rangel and A. Zeynep Enkavi Neuroeconomics studies the neurocomputational bases of decision- making. Experiments within this field often include simplified choice scenarios, such as picking one of two snack options where experimenters record choice and response time data. Literature has shown that behavior in such tasks are well- described by a noisy evidence accumulation process that compares values associated with each item, and attention can especially bias this process. Inspired by evidence accumulation models in cognitive psychology, the attentional drift diffusion model (aDDM) formalizes how overt attention, measured by fixation patterns, biases choice and response times. Current methods for estimating parameters of the aDDM are computationally inefficient and can take hours to day s. To address this issue, we developed a new toolbox in Julia. By taking advantage of the compiled language and multithreading packages we significantly sped up parameter estimation. Wider adoption of our toolbox can enable researchers to test more complex models of decision -making by significantly reducing the time between building and fitting models. Expressing Quantum Ground States Efficiently With Classical Neural Networks Tai-Hsuan Yang Mentors: John Preskill and Mehdi Soleimanifar Finding quantum ground state is crucial problem in quantum mechanics. However, the complexity of finding ground state is QMA -complete, which means that the problem is difficult even for a quantum computer. In this project, we prove that certain gapped ground states with the physical property called approximate conditional independence can be described with only polynomial many parameters with the construction of artificial neural network. We also prove that for 1D shallow quantum circuit equips with this property and show that various spin models would satisfy this property by numerical experiments. Investigating the Roles of the Ventromedial Hypothalamus and the Medial Preoptic Area in Aggressive and Sexual Behaviors Madison Yee Mentors: David J. Anderson and Jineun Kim The ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) and the medial preoptic area (MPOA) have been implicated in controlling mice's feeding, mating, and aggression. Glucose levels can affect these neurons' activity during combative interactions by influencing the mice's internal states. While current research at the David J. Anderson Lab investigates the roles of VMHvl and MPOA neurons in mediating aggression and sexual behaviors, little is known about how physiological homeostatic states, such as glycemia, influence their activity and thus the internal states that govern mice's social interactions. To analyze the relationship between behavioral changes and glycemia, we devised behavioral paradigm s and employed machine -learning -based behavior analysis platforms including the Mouse Action Recognition System (MARS), the Behavior Ensemble and Neural Trajectory Observatory (BENTO), and Social LEAP Estimates Animal Poses (SLEAP) that track the mice's poses and movements. Preliminary analysis of the SLEAP model for single animal tracking indicates strong accuracy, as the 50th, 90th, and 95th percentiles of the difference between the model's prediction and the animal's true location were 5.085, 18.259, and 32.442 pixels respectively. We also used targeted recombination of active populations with cFos induction, in- vivo fiber photometry, and single -cell calcium imaging to monitor and analyze neural activity during mating and aggression across fasting -induced hypoglycemia and euglycemic levels. Future work will use the aforementioned tools to evaluate differences in mice's behaviors based on their internal states and develop a quantifiable, reproducible correlation between mice's glucose and aggression levels. Trail Following and Olfaction in the Myrmecophile Sceptobius lativentris Jessica Yin Mentors: myrmecophilous rove beetle Sceptobius lativentris facilitates its social parasitism of host ant Liometopum occidentale through behaviors like trail -following. We propose that Sceptobius' trail-following behavior is mediated by detecting volatile iridoids in Liometopum's foraging trails through olfaction. To confirm this mechanism, the odorant receptor co -receptor (Orco) was knocked down in adult Sceptobius via RNAi, rendering all olfactory receptors nonfunctional, and the beetles' ability to trail -follow was then evaluated. An additional rove beetle, the free-living species Dalotia coriaria, was also tested in order to establish the effectiveness of Orco RNAi knockdowns in adult rove beetles. 1 -octen -3-ol, alcohol, induces -knockout b eetles are unable to discriminate the odor and do not show such avoidance. Comparing the 1 -octen -3-ol responses of Orco -knockdown -type and Orco -knockout beetles will help determine the effectiveness of RNAi in producing a behaviora l phenotype. Confirmation of the RNAi method in Dalotia and any resulting changes in Sceptobius' behavior when Orco is knocked down will lay the groundwork for establishing which specific odorant receptors are recruited during trail following, further incr easing our understanding of how Sceptibius' symbiotic relationship with Liometopum is maintained and facilitated. Modeling the Evolution of Long -lived Binary Neutron Star Merger Remnant Tuojin Yin Mentor: Elias R. Most Important discoveries about binar y neutron star (BNS) mergers have been enabled by the combination of the gravitational -wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) signals of GW170817, such as insights into properties of nuclear matter at extreme densities. Despite its success, current detectors can only probe the final orbits of the binary; direct information about the final end state, black hole or neutron star, remains current inaccessible. EM observations indicate that the remnant neutron star evolved from differential to uniform rotation befor e collapsing to black hole. Our project thus focuses on the period after uniform rotation is achieved. We aim to combine numerical relativity (NR) simulations evaluated on the parameters of the binary from GW170817 with our refined analytical toy model to provide a more accurate picture of how the uniformly rotating remnant core increases in mass and angular momentum due to accretion. This may have direct implications for some of the constraints on dense matter derived from this event. We also hope to disco ver a universal relationship for the angular momentum of the uniformly rotating remnant core so that future investigation into the fate of BNS remnants with new GW data can be performed faster without running computationally expensive NR simulations. Using Multi -Wavelength Datasets as a Growth Rate Indicator for Supermassive Black Holes Miranda Zak Mentors: Fiona Harrison, Peter Boorman, and Murray Brightman Active galactic nuclei are powered by accretion onto a supermassive black hole. Studying the Eddington ratio, or the ratio of the bolometric luminosity to the Eddington limit, can help us understand accretion and outflow processes as well as the evolution of the AGN and its interaction with the host galaxy. However, the Eddington ratio can be diff icult to estimate \u2014both the black hole mass and bolometric luminosity are necessary in calculating the Eddington ratio. Accurate measurements of these quantities are not easy to obtain, particularly for obscured sources, and they often require dedicated fol low-up. In order to develop a way of predicting Eddington ratios in cases of incomplete data, we use data from sources with extensive multi -wavelength coverage from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey and the BAT 70 -month catalog. We train and test the random forest machine learning algorithm on different combinations of observed and intrinsic X -ray, optical, and infrared parameters for 385 obscured and 345 unobscured sources. We present several methods of predicting the Eddington ratio for a given sample of n on-blazar AGN, compare their accuracy and the significance of individual parameters in the predictions, and predict the Eddington ratio for around 900 sources from the BAT 105 -month catalog. Dusty Galaxies as Seen by SPHEREx Edward Zhang Mentor: Andreas F aisst Dust plays a critical role in the study of galaxies as it is strongly related to the formation of stars and the evolution of galaxies. Dust grains have been observed to scatter and absorb blue light and emit it at infrared wavelengths. The new SPHEREx infr ared space telescope will provide all -sky, low -resolution, spectroscopic observations of stars and galaxies at wavelengths of 0.75 - 5 m, allowing for the study of the dust properties of many galaxies. However its sensitivity, wavelength coverage, and the strategy of the survey will only allow SPHEREx to get useful data for a subsample of galaxies. Additionally, it is unknown how well the SPHEREx observations can constrain different models of galaxy spectra, hence their respective dust properties. Thus thi s project prepares for the SPHEREx observations by first creating spectral templates using data from the 2006 AKARI infrared satellite combined with theoretical models of dust emission. These templates are then run through the SPHEREx Sky Simulator to obta in realistic observed spectra. By varying the dust emission model and the brightness of the sources, we can study the parameter space in which useful measurements with SPHEREx can be obtained. Development of a Chemically Recyclable, 3D Printable Silicone Material Hongyi Zhang Mentor: Julia R. Greer, Seneca Velling, Sammy Shaker, Seola Lee, and Akash Dhawan Silicone is a versatile polymer material with many desirable characteristics, such as corrosion resistance, thermal stability, low toxicity, a nd electrical insulation properties, and has widespread application in commercial, medical, and research scenarios. However, its 3D crosslinked structure has impeded its recycling and manufacturing through extrusion- based 3D printing techniques, and its hi gh gas permeability and crosslink chemistry prevented its application in UV -curing -based 3D printing techniques. Previously, it was reported that the photoinitiated thiol -ene click chemistry, where a thiol and an alkene connect to form a thioester, allowed the UV -crosslinking of mercaptan- functionalized polysiloxane and vinyl - terminated polysiloxane and enabled the digital light processing 3D printing of silicone elastomers. Separately, introduction of disulfide moieties in polymer chains was shown to faci litate the chemical degradation of the cured material through base -catalyzed thiol -disulfide exchange reaction. This work aims to develop a chemically recyclable, 3D -printable silicone materials by integrating the thiol - disulfide exchange reaction with the photoinitiated thiol -ene silicone system. We show that disulfide moieties can be introduced into mercaptan clean and facile iodide -catalyzed reaction, and the resulting partially mercapta n-functionalized polysiloxanes, when mixed with vinyl -functionalized polysiloxane can be UV -cured to form disulfide -containing silicone networks. Ongoing work focuses on performing chemical degradation on the cured disulfide -containing silicone and characterizing the thermomechanical properties of the oligomer. -MDa transport complexes called nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) facilitate the selective transport of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope. Protein constitue nts of the NPC, called nucleoporins (nups), are essential to biology's central dogma, facilitating directional transport of RNA from nucleus to cytoplasm. We utilize Alvinella pompejana , a thermophilic extremophile worm living near deep -sea vents, as a model organism to investigate the structure and biochemical interfaces of the cytoplasmic filament nup205. Using cryo-EM, X -ray crystallography, and affinity assays, we will elucidate the structure and interaction interfaces of nup205 to near -atomic resolutio n. Our findings will facilitate a more complete understanding of NPC structure and assembly mechanics and will lead to development of targeted therapies targeting erroneous NPC homologies. Sample Complexity of Learning Physical Processes Haimeng Zhao Mentors: John Preskill and Matthias C. Caro Learning what happens during a physical experiment is a fundamental task in many fields of science. The intrinsic complexity of this task can be characterized by the sample complexity: the number of samples scie ntists need to collect to accurately and confidently infer the underlying quantum process. In this work, we analyze the sample complexity of learning physically implementable processes that are local and have bounded circuit complexity. We find that the sa mple complexity of learning these processes to average case accuracy scales linearly with the circuit complexity up to logarithmic factors. In contrast, we prove that learning to worst case accuracy requires exponentially more samples. We also investigate the sample complexity of learning from classically described data and the curse of dimensionality in learning to approximate certain multi -variable functions. Our results provide statistical foundations of the fundamental question: how can we possibly lear n about nature efficiently, and offer theoretical guidance to the practical implementation of quantum machine learning. Characterizing the Fabrication Parameters of Holographic Lithography for Scalable Production of Architected Materials Zhangqi (Jackie) Zheng Mentors: Julia Greer and Kevin Nakahara Nanoarchitected materials have recently emerged as a highly desirable class of materials capable of exhibiting combinations of properties, for example, ultra-low density, high energy absorption, stimulus respo nsivity, and enhanced damage tolerance, exceeding the limits of their constituent materials. Using a 3D laser interference lithography (LIL) process with a metasurface mask, we produce nano -architected sheets (35 m thick and 2.5 \u00d7 2.5 cm2 wide, 500 nm internal feature size) made of negative tone epoxy -based photosensitive resist (SU- 8). During the LIL fabrication, a wide variety of defects and morphological variations arise due to chemical, thermal, and optical gradients inherent to photopolymer development. This work shows that by characterizing and decoupling the contributions of all the dosage steps and optimizing their energies relative to the resin formulation, we can reduce the processing time and increase the yield of the LIL process significantly. U sing the optimized energy contributions, we also present how active adjustments may be made to the fabrication recipe to mitigate the likelihood that an imperfect dosage at one step will lead to an unwanted defect in the resulting structure. Furthermore, b y tuning the resin composition and compensating with corresponding dosage steps, we can expand the range of sample thicknesses to better suit different experimental needs. Accessing the Temperature -Dependent Vibrational Dynamics of Pb Using Inelastic Neutron Scanning Zhiyi Zheng Mentors: Brent Fultz and Camille Marie Bernal- Choban Inelastic neutron scattering serves as a powerful experimental technique to investigate the temperature -dependent phonon anharmonicity of materials. Such analysis offers insights into anharmonicity's effect on the sample's thermal properties, such as vibrational entropy and thermal expansion. This study applies this method to face -centered cubic (fcc) solid lead (Pb), investigating its behavior within the temperature range of 298 K to 573 K. By employing MCViNE simulations, the vibrational densities of states (DOS) were determined, allowing for a comprehensive examination of the vibrational dynamics response. Preliminary results indicate that the crystal's vibrational entropy constitutes the primary component of its total entropy, with a contribution exceeding 85 percent. The material's overall thermal behavior will also be discussed. Autonomous Flying Ambulance: Hardware Integration and Testing Zhonghe Catherine Zheng Mentors: Soon- Jo Chung, Matthew Anderson, and Joshua Cho The overarching goal of the project is to build a scaled -down version of an Autonomous Flying Ambulance (AFA), an emergency vehicle capable of carrying patients and medics to hospitals. In the current 4th iteration of the AFA, researchers are developing a new fault- control algorithm that stabilizes the aircraft when one or multiple motors fail. Testing the algorithm is dangerous and costly if done on the actual AFA model; hence, the algorithm is currently being developed on a skeletal prototype. While the fuselage of the model was already manufactured, the model still lacked the electronics required to fly. This project focuses on integrating those electronics into the model, which involves designing and fabricating the electronic casing, wiring the components, and calibrating the hardware for the new system. Both the prototype and the AFA model use a Pixhawk flight controller with ArduPilot and an onboard computer to run the algorithm. While the prototype is an eVTOL octocopter, the model has both eVTOL and fixed -wing modes, meaning it can take off vertically while also using its wings to produce lift when flying. This more sophisticated flight model allows algorithms to be demonstrated on a higher fidelity aircraft, producing more accurate data and results . Experimental Feasibility of Photon Blockade With Mohammad Mirhosseini Joshi A theoretically proposed protocol for producing photon blockade in weakly nonlinear systems is studied. Feasibility of its experimental implementation using a kinetic inductance resonator with fourth- order nonlinearity is analyzed in relation to limitations of nonlinearity, one - and two -photon drive strengths. Parameter optimization is discussed. The analysis was conducted using numerical simulations and theoretical tools. The protocol is found to be possible, but challenging, to implement. There is potential for producing highly non- classical non- Gaussian and Wigner negative states, that could be a valuable resource for quantum technology. Further work includes attempting to implement the protocol 'on- chip' and verifying its performance with quantum state tomography. Characterization of Sphingopyxis alaskensis Michael Lydia Varesio Oxidation of manganese has been theorized to fuel the growth of chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms. Our lab isolated Candidatus Manganitrophus noduliformans (Species A) and Ramlibacter lithotrophicus (Species B) and found them to rely on Mn(II) oxidation for growth. Unpublished observations show that Sphingopyxis alaskensis can substitute for Species B. This study characterizes S. alaskensis and attempts to label it fluorescently for further research on manganese oxidation by Species A. Cell and colony morphology were characterized, and growth kinetics were measured in different media. Furthermore, the recovery of the bacteria from frozen stocks in different cryoprotectants was investigated, indicating a preference for 10% DMS O over 15% and 25% glycerol. While S. alaskensis was first isolated from Alaskan salt water, our strain was derived from tap water in Pasadena. We explored salt tolerance and found that our strain grew in salinity concentrations up to 28.13 ppt (highly saline). To establish parameters for building a genetic toolset in S. alaskensis, I tested the bacteria's resistance to ampicillin, kanamycin, and chloramphenicol. With these data, I am in the process of constructing fluorescently labeled transformants. This work has assisted in understanding and developi S. alaskensis as a model organism to probe into biotic Mn oxidation. Sensory Deception: Unveiling Audio -Visual Illusions Within Spots Chelsea Zou Mentor s: Shinsuke Shimojo and Ailene Chan Human perception is inherently multisensory. The brain seamlessly integrates incoming sensory inputs to create a unified understanding of the environment. While cross -modal information is usually complimentary, researchers have reported multiple scenarios where the senses appear to \"deceive\" one another. These multisensory illusions are especially robust when one of the senses is unreliable. In this study, we are interested in analyzing the effects of audio -visual illusions in blind spots. Blind spots, char acterized by the absence of photoreceptors due to the optic nerve exiting the retina, are intriguing areas in the visual field. Our investigation focuses on the possibility that auditory stimuli can evoke visual experiences within these blind spots. To probe this phenomenon, we employed two multisensory illusions developed by the lab: the Double Flash and Rabbit Illusions. We mapped each participant's blind spots and presented the experiments using custom code scripts written in PsychoPy. Surprisingly, our findings suggest that blind spots may not be as \"blind\" as conventionally thought. Other senses appear to play a role in influencing the perception of these areas. This discovery challenges traditional notions of sensory isolation and highlights the complex interplay between our sensory modalities, even within areas of apparent sensory deficiency. "}
