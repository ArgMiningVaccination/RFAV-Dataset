Licensed, registered homeopath since 2003 DETOXING VACCINES, METALS AND OTHER TOXINS I integrate homeopathic vaccine detox remedies with the correct organ support and bowel nosodes to allow detox pathways to work as optimally as possible. I also do similar protocols for metals, medications, yeast, viruses and other toxins specific to the history of the patient. I frequently use anti inflammatory remedies and constitutional remedies for maximum support during the healing process and a calmer route to gains without aggravations. BIOMEDICAL PROTOCOL SUPPORT I have knowledge of supplementary protocols that would support your healing. This includes anti inflammatory protocols, nutritional support, homeopathic tissue salts (useful for behavioural issues). I can combine homeopathic treatment and to work around any existing protocols if you wish to integrate homeopathy into your current plan. PANDAS Certain viruses can get stuck in the system causing chronic inflammation that can cause symptoms that can include some of the following: OCD, unexplainable meltdowns/tantrums, tics, sensory disorders, urinary issues amongst other things. Using homeopathic nosodes can help reduce the inflammatory response to help your child to be calmer. Homeopathic remedies to reduce inflammation are used alongside individualised (constitutional) prescribing to minimise any \"flares\" (behavioural aggravations). If a child presents with PANDAS I usually treat the flares symptoms first as a matter of priority before any other detoxing. CONSTITUTIONAL REMEDIES Using classical remedies for behavioural or emotional conditions such as night terrors, hyperactivity, stimming etc Bowel nosodes are also useful for these issues. bottom of page "}
