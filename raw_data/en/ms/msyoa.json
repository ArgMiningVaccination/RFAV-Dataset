Vol. 10-1Preface The Idaho Administrative Bulletin is published once each month by the Department of Administration, Office of the Administrative Rules Coordinator, pursuant to Section 67-5203, Idaho Code. The Bulletin is a monthly compilation of all administrative rulemaking documents in Idaho. The Bulletin publishes the official rulemaking notices and administrative rule text of state agency rulemakings and other official documents as necessary. State agencies are required to provide public notice of rulemaking activity and invite public input. The public receives notice of rulemaking activity through the Idaho Administrative Bulletin and the Legal Notice published monthly in local newspapers. The Legal Notice provides reasonable opportunity for public input, either oral or written, which may be presented to the agency within the time and manner specified in the Notice of Rulemaking published in the Bulletin. After the comment period closes, the agency considers fully all information submitted in regard to the rule. Comment periods are not provided in temporary or final rule-making activities. CITATION TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The Bulletin is cited by year and issue number. For example, Bulletin 08-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2008; Bulletin 09-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2009. Volume numbers, which proceed from 1 to 12 in a given year, correspond to the months of publication, i.e.; Volume No. 09-1 refers to January 2009; Volume No. 09-2 refers to February 2009; and so forth. Example: The Bulletin published in January 2009 is cited as Volume 09-1 . The December 2008 Bulletin is cited as Volume 08-12 . RELATIONSHIP TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE The Idaho Administrative Code is published once a year and is a compilation or supplemental compilation of all final and enforceable administrative rules in effect in Idaho. In an effort to provide the reader with current, enforceable rules, temporary rules are also published in the Administrative Code. Temporary rules and final rules approved by the legislature during the legislative session, and published in the monthly Idaho Administrative Bulletin, supplement the Administrative Code. Negotiated, proposed, and pending rules are only published in the Bulletin and not printed in the Administrative Code. To determine if a particular rule remains in effect, or to determine if a change has occurred, the reader should refer to the Cumulative Rulemaking Index of Idaho Administrative Rules , printed in each Bulletin. TYPES OF RULEMAKINGS PUBLISHED IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The state of Idaho administrative rulemaking process, governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, Title 67, Chapter 52, Idaho Code, comprises five distinct activities: negotiated, proposed, temporary, pending and final rulemaking. Not all rulemakings involve all five. At a minimum, a rulemaking includes proposed, pending and final rulemaking. Many rules are adopted as temporary rules when they meet the required statutory criteria and agencies often engage in negotiated rulemaking at the beginning of the process to facilitate consensus building in controversial or complex rulemakings. In the majority of cases, the process begins with proposed rulemaking and ends with the final rulemaking. The following is a brief explanation of each type of administrative rule. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING Negotiated rulemaking is a process in which all interested parties and the agency seek consensus on the content of a rule. Agencies are encouraged, and in some cases requ ired, to engage in this rulemaking activity whenever it is feasible to do so. Publication of a \"Notice of Intent to Promulgate\" a rule in the Administrative Bulletin by the agency is optional. This process should result in the formulation of a proposed and/or temporary rule.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 10 January 6, 2010 - Vol. 10-1PROPOSED RULEMAKING A proposed rulemaking is an action by an agency wherein the agency is proposing to amend or repeal an existing rule or to adopt a new rule. Prior to the adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, the agency must publish a \"Notice of Proposed Rulemaking\" in the Bulletin. This notice must include: a) the specific statutory authority (from Idaho Code) for the rulemaking including a citation to a specific federal statute or regulation if that is the basis of authority or requirement for the rulemaking; b) a statement in nontechnical language of the substance of the proposed rule, including a specific description of any fee or charge imposed or increased; c) the text of the proposed rule prepared in legislative format; d) the location, date, and time of any public hearings the agency intends to hold on the proposed rule; e) the manner in which persons may make written co mments on the proposed rule, including the name and address of a person in the agency to whom comments on the proposal may be sent; f) the manner in which persons may request an opportunity for an oral presentation as provided in Section 67-5222, Idaho Code; and g) the deadline for public (written) comments on the proposed rule. As stated, the text of the proposed rule must be published in the Bulletin. After meeting the statutory rulemaking criteria for a proposed rule, the agency may proceed to the pending rule stage. A proposed rule does not have an assigned effective date, even when published in conjunction with a temporary rule, and therefore, is not enforceable. An agency may vacate a proposed rulemaking if it decides not to proceed beyond the proposed rulemaking step, and stops the formal rulemaking process. TEMPORARY RULEMAKING Temporary rules may be adopted only when the governor finds that it is necessary for: a) protection of the public health, safety, or welfare; or b) compliance with deadlines in amendments to governing law or federal programs; or c) conferring a benefit; If a rulemaking meets any one or all of the above requir ements, a rule may become effective before it has been submitted to the legislature for review and the agency may proceed and adopt a temporary rule. However, a temporary rule that imposes a fee or charge may be adopte d only if the Governor finds that the fee or charge is necessary to avoid an immediate danger which justifies the imposition of the fee or charge. A temporary rule expires at the conclusion of the next succeeding regular legislative session unless the rule is approved, amended, or modified by concurrent resolution or when the rule has been replaced by a final rule. State law requires that the text of both a proposed rule and a temporary rule be published in the Administrative Bulletin. In cases where the text of the temporary rule is the same as the proposed rule, the rulemaking can be done concurrently as a proposed/temporary rule. Combining the rulemaking allows for a single publication of the text. An agency may, at any time, rescind a temporary rule that has been adopted and is in effect. If the temporary rule is being replaced by a new temporary rule or if it has been published concurrently with a proposed rule that is being vacated, the agency, in most instances, should rescind the temporary rule.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 11 January 6, 2010 - Vol. 10-1PENDING RULEMAKING A pending rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under regular rulemaking procedures and remains subject to legislative review before it becomes a final, enforceable rule. When a pending rule is published in the Bulletin, the agency is required to include certain information in the \"Notice of Pending Rulemaking\". This includes: a) a statement giving the reasons for adopting the rule; b) a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for any changes; c) the date the pending rule will become final and effective; d) an identification of any portion of the rule imposing or increasing a fee or charge. Agencies are required to republish the text of the rule wh en substantive changes have been made to the proposed rule. An agency may adopt a pending rule that varies in content from that which was originally proposed if the subject matter of the rule remains the same, the pending rule change is a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule, and the original notice was written so as to assure that members of the public were reasonably notified of the subject. It is not always necessary to republish all the text of the pending rule. With the permission of the Rules Coordinator, only the Section(s) that have changed from the proposed text are re published. If no changes have been made to the previously published text, it is not required to republish the text again and only the \"Notice of Pending Rulemaking\" is published. FINAL RULEMAKING A final rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under the regular rulemaking procedures and is in effect and enforceable. No pending rule adopted by an agency will become final and effective until it has been submitted to the legislature for review. Where the legislature finds that an agency has violated the legislative intent of the statute under which the rule was made, a concurrent resolution may be adopted to reject the rulemaking or any part thereof. A \"Notice of Final Rule\" must be published in the Bulletin for any rule that is rejected, amended, or modified by the legislature showing the changes made. A rule reviewed by the legislature and not rejected, amended or modified becomes final with no further legislative action. No rule shall become final and effective before the conclusion of the regular or special legislative session at which the rule wa s submitted for review. However, a rule that is final and effective may be applied retroactively, as provided in the rule.

Internet Access - The Administrative Code and Administrative Bulletin are available on the Internet at the following address : http://adm.idaho.gov/adminrules/ HOW TO USE THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Rulemaking documents produced by state agencies and published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin are organized by a numbering system. Each state agency has a two-digit identification code number known as the \"IDAPA\" number. (The \"IDAP A\" Codes are listed in the alphabetical/numerical index at the end of this Preface.) Within each agency there are divisions or departments to which a two-digit \"TITLE\" number is assigned. There are \"CHAPTER\" numbers assigned within the Title and the rule text is divided among major sections with a number of subsections. An example IDAP A number is as follows: IDAPA 38.05.01.200.02.c.ii. \"IDAPA\" refers to Administrative Rules in general that are subject to the Administrative Procedures Act and are required by this act to be published in the Idaho Administrative Code and the Idaho Administrative Bulletin. \"38.\" refers to the Idaho Department of Administration \"05.\" refers to Title 05, which is the Department of Administrations' s Division of Purchasing \"01.\" refers to Chapter 01 of Title 05, \"Rules of the Division of Purchasing\" \"200.\" refers to Major Section 200, \"Content of the Invitation to Bid\" \"02.\" refers to Subsection 200. 02. \"c.\" c. \"ii.\" refers to Subsection 200.02.c. ii.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 13 January 6, 2010 - Vol. 10-1DOCKET NUMBERING SYSTEM Internally, the Bulletin is organized sequentially using a rule docketing system. All rulemaking actions (documents) are assigned a \"DOCKET NUMBER.\" The \"Docket Number\" is a series of numbers separated by a hyphen \"-\", ( 38-0501-0901). The docket numbers are published sequentially by IDAP A designation (e.g. the two- digit agency code). The following example is a breakdown of a typical rule docket number: \"DOCKET NO. 38-0501-0901\" \"38-\" denotes the agency's this case the Department of Administration. \"0501-\" refers to the TITLE AND CHAPTER numbers of the agency rule being promulgated; in this case the Division of Purchasing (TITLE 05), Rules of the Division of Purchasing (Chapter 01). \"0901\" denotes the year and sequential order of the docket being published; in this case the numbers refer to the first rulemaking action published in calendar year 2009 . A subsequent rulemaking on this same rule chapter in calendar year 2009 would be designated as \" 0902 \". The docket number in this scenario would be 38-0501- 0902. Within each Docket, only the affected sections of chapters are printed. (See Sections Affected Index in each Bulletin for a listing of these.) The individual sections affected are printed in the Bulletin sequentially (e.g. Section \"200\" appears before Section \"345\" and so on). Whenever the sequence of the numbering is broken the following statement will appear: (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CITATIONS TO ADMINISTRATIVE RULES IN THE CODE AND BULLETIN When making a citation to another Section or Subsection of a rule that is part of the same rule, a typical internal citation may appear as follows: \"...as found in Section 201 of these rules.\" OR \"...in accordance with Subsection 201.06.c. of these rules.\" The citation may also include the IDAP A, Title, or Chapter number, as the TITLE number of the rule. \"01\" denotes the Chapter number of the rule. \"201\" denotes the main Section number of the rule to which the citation refers. Citations made within a rule to a different rule chapter (external citation) should also include the name of the Department and the name of the rule chapter being referenced, as well as the IDAP A, Title, and Chapter numbers. The following is a typical example of an external citation to another rule chapter: \"...as outlined in the R ules of the Department of A dministration, IDAPA 38.04.04, \"Rules Governing Capitol Mall Parking.\"IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 14 January 6, 2010 -

Changes have been made to the text of the proposed rule. The pending rule text reflects changes in certain definitions. The purpose of these changes is to clarify the intent of the definitions and the rule. The pending rule provides for possession permits of listed invasive species. The pending rule exempts certain species from possession permit requirements. The purpose of these changes is to provide for species that are known to be present in portions of the state. The pending rule provides for transport permits. The purpose of this change is to allow for the movement of exempt species outside of known established distributi on boundaries of the species. The pending rule includes an \"Early Detection and Rapid Response Aquatic Invertebrate Species\" category. The purpose of this category of species is to provide regulation of transport of contam inated conveyances and equipment, establish reporting requirements, establish inspection procedures, allow for hold orders, and provide for a decontamination protocol for EDRR AIIS contaminated conveyances. The section that allows for declaration of an invasive species was deleted. The section related to general permits and research permits was deleted. The \"EDRR AIIS Containment List\" was deleted. The section related to the pet industry was deleted. These sections were deleted due to redundancies that resulted from the above mentioned changes. The text of the pending rule has been amended in accordance with Section 67-5227, Idaho Code. There were significant changes to the proposed rule. Therefore, the entire rule is being published in this bulletin.

The action is authorized pursuant to Sections 33-105, 33-2402, and 33-2403, Idaho Code. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise explanatory statement of the reasons for adopting the pending rule and amending the temporary rule and a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the text of the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for the change: Title 33, Chapter 1 and 24, Idaho Code were amended to clarify that postsecondary institutions need to register to ensure they are legitimate degree granting institutions and that proprietary schools are legitimate. Criteria for evaluating these institutions and schools are set forth in this rule. Criteria are essential for determining the legitimacy of the institution for degree granting purposes and the legitimacy of proprietary schools. Additionally, in order to provide protection for Idaho Citizens, the underfunded tuition recovery account has been replaced by the requirement of a surety bond. The changes to the rule from proposed to pending are in the calculation of the surety bond. The purpose of the surety bond is to cover the amount of tuition that a student has paid into a program should the school go out of business prior to the completion of the program or course of study, allowing students to be refunded their costs. The amended formula better captures this amount. The text of the pending rule has been amended in acco rdance with Section 67-5227, Idaho Code. Rather than keep the temporary rule in place while the pe nding rule awaits legislative approval, the State Board of Education amended the temporary rule with the same revisions which have been made to the pending rule. Only the sections that have changes that differ from the proposed text are printed in this bulletin. The original text of the proposed rule was published in the October 7, 2009 Idaho Administrative Bulletin, V ol. 09-10 , page(s) 189 through 198 . FEE SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(2), the Governor has found that the fee or charge being imposed or increased is justified and necessary to avoid immediate danger. This fee or charge is being imposed pursuant to Section 33-2402 and 33-2403, Idaho Code. The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: The current fee of one hundred dollars ($100) per course or course of study has been changed to the amount of one-half of one percent of the gross Idaho tuition revenue of the institution or school during the previous registration year, but not less than one hundred dollars ($100) and not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000). Fees assessed are to be dedicated for use by the board in connection w ith its responsibilities under Section 33-2401, Idaho Code. Pursuant to Section 67-5224(5)(c), Idaho Code, this pending rule will not become final and effective until it has been approved, amended, or modified by concurrent resolution of the legislature because of the fee being imposed or increased through this rulemaking.

This pending rule has been adopted by the agency and is now pending review by the 2010 Idaho State Legislature for final approval. The pending rule becomes final and effective at the conclusion of the legislative session, unless the rule is approved, rejected, amended or modified by concurrent resolution in accordance with Section 67-5224 and 67-5291, Idaho Code.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Section 67-5224 and 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a pending rule and amended a temporary rule. The action is authorized pursuant to Sections 33- 105 and 33-107, Idaho Code. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise explanatory statement of the reasons for adopting the pending rule and amending the temporary rule and a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the text of the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for the change: The Idaho State Department of Education oversees Idaho Public Driver Education and Training programs. During the 2009 Idaho Legislative Session, private driver education businesses were moved out from under the State Department of Education, to the Division of Occupational Li censure. This move made it necessary to revise the Idaho Operating Procedures for Public Driver Education Programs document to address public driver education programs and their new relationship with private driver education programs. In addition to thes e needed changes we have worked to better align our standards with national standa rds for Driver Education and Training programs, specify policies that have been unclear before, and add a few new policies that improve the service we offer Idaho teens. Examples of improvements include clarifying reasons students may be dropped from a course, the duration of a course, hours per day students may be in class and in a car, requiring parent-teacher c ontact, reducing paperwork for teachers, and disallowing multiple D.U.I. offenders and felony offenders against children from becoming Driver Education and Training instructors. Changes being made following the public comment period to the operating procedures that are incorporated by reference in this rule are directly related to Section 6.0, Public Schools Contracting with Private Driving Schools, of the Idaho Operating Procedures for Public Driver Education Programs. With th e revisions, private driver education businesses will not have to meet public driver education instructor requirements to contract with a public school with the exception that they must have a current criminal history check on an official SDE fingerprint card on file at the Idaho State Department of Education. Instead, private driver education businesses will be ab le to use instructors that have met the Bureau of Occupational Licensure instructor re quirement as outlined in the policies and procedures for private driver education businesses under the Bureau of Occupational Licensure. Other changes made include minor revisions that address questions of clarity and structur e to the rule as it pertains to classroom duration, correspondence courses and reimbursement to school districts. The language that addressed reimbursement to school districts was eliminated due to th e fact that it is addressed in statute and was considered redundant. The text of the pending rule has been amended in accordance with Section 67-5227, Idaho Code, and is being republished following this notice. Rather than keep the temporary rule in place while the pending rule awaits legislative approval, the Department amended the temporary rule with the same revisions which have been made to the pending rule. Only the sections that have changes differ from the proposed text are printed in this bulletin. The original text of the proposed rule was published in the August 5, 2009 Idaho Administrative Bulletin, V ol. 09-8, pages 33 through 35.

Many teachers that have taken the Mathem atical Thinking for Instructio n (MTI) course during the first year of implementation have requested additional classes in this field of study. Research shows that in order for a professional development opportunity to be successfully implemented, follow up opportunities must be made available. As part of the math initiative, the follow up support includes working closely with regional math specialists and district instructional coaches. To ensure that qualified educators are conducting this additional follow up support, a mathematical consulting teacher endorsement has been de veloped. The MTI courses have already been developed and other courses will be developed in cooperation with all of the participating institutions of higher education and the State Department of Education. One primary goal of the endorsement program is to produce exemplar teachers, who will lead and build the knowledge of their colleagues throughout the state of Idaho.

Two goals of the task force were to ensure all students are prepared to be successful in high school and to increase academic engagement and student accountability for middle school students through a relevant and rigorous curriculum. Desire d outcomes included ensuring all studen ts are prepared to be successful in high school and beyond and to improve student preparation for high school and post-secondary education. To achieve these goals and work toward the desired outcomes, the Middle Level Task Force determined that students need to be introduced to the language and concept of a credit system before entering high school. This rule change would require each LEA (local education agency) or di strict to design and implement a credit system starting no later than the seventh grade. Changes being made for the pending rule are to provide greater clarity and structure to the rule. Language has been added to the section on Alternate Mechanisms to require that each district forward their mechanism to the Department. The changes to the Limited English Proficie nt and Special Education s ections emphasize that the respective teams make decisions on alternate re quirements or accommodations for those students.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Section 67-5224, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a pending rule. The action is authorized pursuant to Sections 33-105 and 33-1612, Idaho Code.DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise explanatory statement of the reasons for adopting the pending rule and a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the text of the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for the change: This revision to IDAPA 08.02.03.105 includes: The recommendation that the State Board of Education adopt a minimum of 60 hours of instruction per credit. The recommendation to establish a policy that al lows students to earn credit by demonstrating mastery of a subject instead of only bein g allowed to earn credit through seat time. The recommendation to allow middle school students to complete high school courses before entering grade nine in all subject areas instead of just Math and Science. Changes being made to the pending rule address concerns that were expressed with the mastery provision as well as inconsequential revisions that address questions of clarity and structure to the rule as it pertains to Humanities and Social Studies. In the mastery provision, we have eliminated the specific examples of mastery and will instead make those available through a Q and A document produced by the State Department of Education. The intent of this revision was always to allow local school districts to determ ine what constitutes mastery of a subject as is evident in the rule language, \"as defined and approved by the local sc hool district or LEA.\" The correction to the Humanities section includes the change from \"world literature\" and \"world history\" back to \"literature\" and \"history\" so as to not exclude courses that are based on United State literature and or United States History. Th e corrections to the Social Studies section reverts back to include the language \"Current world affairs and geography will be integrated into all social studies instruction\" since concerns were raised about its exclusion and continuing to include it in the rule does not cause any issues. The text of the pending rule has been amended in accordance with Section 67-5227, Idaho Code. Only those sections that have changes that differ from the proposed te xt are printed in this bulletin.

External peer reviewers and U.S. Department of Education staff evaluated Idaho's submission and found it was not in compliance with certain regulatory and statutor y requirements. During the 2005-2006 school year, Idaho addressed critical elements summarized in the report findings including that the achievement standards should be reviewed and reorganized to solve the problems and inconsiste ncies that were revealed an d that they be renamed the Idaho Content Standards. Since then, the term \"state achievement standards\" has been updated in IDAPA 08.02.03.004 to read \"Idaho Content Standards.\" However, the term was not changed elsewhere in rule. The rule change will update the term usage, as well as correct an incorrect citation. The pending rule is being adopted as proposed.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given this agency has adopted a temporary rule. The action is authorized pursuant to Section 33-105, Idaho Code. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule: In February 2009, the State Board of Education approved the changes to the Title III/Limited English Proficiency Accountability Plan. Following the approval, the State Board of Education submitted the revised Accountability Plan to the US Department of Education (USDOE) for their approval. The USDOE responded in a letter that the amendment requests would not be approved unless Idaho alter the requirements slightly in one of the four components. This rule change brings Idaho into compliance with the USDOE request. Idaho requested to adopt the \"n\" size of 34 for Title III purposes, in order to maintain consistency with Title I. This would ensure that districts with less than 34 LEP students would not be held to the same IELA accountability targets as those districts with more than 34 students. However, the USDOE determined that districts that received Title III funding through a special consortia grant application, even if they had less than 34 students, must not be exempt and still held accountable. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 mandates that a ll states must set achievement standards/cut scores for their assessments in order to determine the proficiency leve l and growth for every student each year. Idaho revised the achievement standards/cut scores for the IELA in July 2009. A panel of 15 Idaho educators came to gether to determine new achievement standards/cut scores for the IELA. The panel members determined to minimally revise the standa rds/cut scores to be used. Th e raw cut scores were then translated into scale scores for the purpose of equating th e IELA alternate year and grade level forms. The revised scale scores ensure consistent progression across grade sp ans, enabling educators to make decisions based on the students' IELA proficiency level. The most significant changes are in the Early Fluent and Fluent categories. The impact of the adoption of the revised scale score tables for the IELA will enable LEP students to be tested and placed more appropriately in one of five proficiency levels: beginning, ad vanced beginning, intermediate, early fluent and fluent. This will help schools and districts to determine the appropriate services for each student and the information necessary to exit a student out of the LEP program. The State Department of Education (SDE) conducted the Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) appeals in summer 2009 due to the transition of the assessment program to SDE. In reviewing the appeals, it was noted that three clarifications needed to be made in order to more clearly guide the appeals process. 1. To clarify which public entity creates and provides AYP calculations to schools and districts.2. To clarify affect of full expulsio ns on continuous enrollment status. 3. To clarify rules governing withdrawn status, specifically with regard to medical reasons, homebound status, and expulsions. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section(s) 67-5226(1)(b), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate for the following reasons: It is imperative that this rule be instituted at this time on a temporary basis so that these rule changes can be integrated into the next test administration and AYP app eals cycle. The test administration occurs in April and the AYP appeals occur in June. Thus, the rule must be adopted as temporary or would not be able to go into effect for this school year.STATE BOARD AND DEPARTMENT OF E DUCATION Docket No. 08-0203-1001 Rules Governing Thoroughness Temporary Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 57 January 6, 2010 - Vol. 10-1FEE SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(2), the Governor has found that the fee or charge being imposed or increased is justified and necessary to avoid imme diate danger and the fee is described herein: N/A ASSISTANCE ON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS: For assistance on technical questions concerning the temporary rule, contact Scott Cook at (208) 332-6976.

A new fee is being added for the initial approval an d the renewal of a program approved under these rules. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if appli cable, of any fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: 1. The requirement for criminal history and backgro und checks is being expanded to include employees working in provider programs serving adults. Currently, only treatment providers serving adolescents are required to pay for a Department criminal history a nd background check. The fees for the criminal history checks are covered under IDAPA 16.05.06, \"Criminal History and Background Checks.\" While there is a fiscal impact to the Criminal History Unit - Indirect Services Budget, and the Provider Fee Substance Abuse Receipts (neither of which go to the general fund), there is no anticipated fiscal impact to the state general fund. 2. The Department is proposing a new fee for the initial approval as well as the renewal inspections of substance use disorder treatment programs. This fee will be $100 per treatment facility, $100 per facility for treatment and Recovery Support Services, and $50 per R ecovery Support Services only. It is estimated that $11,600 in fees will be collected annually. This money will be used by the Division of Behavioral Health to offset the cost of contracting the inspection process with the \"Application of Substance Abuse Technologies Quality Management and Certification Services (CAS AT)\" program. The services of CASAT have been retained in order to handle all aspects of the treatment programs approval process.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Section 67-5224, Idaho Code, and IDAPA 20.01.01, Rules of Practice and Procedure Before the State Board of Land Commissioners (\"Board\"), Sections 830 through 835, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a pending fee rule. Th e action is authorized pursuant to Section 58-104(6), Idaho Code. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise explanatory statement of the reasons for adopting the pending rule and a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the text of the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for the change: This rulemaking clarifies and corrects some of the rule changes approved in 2008. The issues addressed by this rulemaking include, but are not limited to, removing the actual fee amounts from the rules and allowing the Board to set the fees subject to the maximum fee amounts in Section 58-1307, Idaho Code, clarifying several definitions and encroachment standards, allowing some boat lifts to be approved with an abbreviated permitting process, and providing for lake specific encroachment standards to assi st with implementation of lake management plans. These rules are being promulgated in conjunction with changes to IDAPA 20.03.17, Rules Governing Leases on State- Owned Submerged Lands and Formerly Submerged Lands. Some changes were made to the pending rules after the close of comments on October 28, 2009. These changes are in response to comments received from the public a nd department personnel. Parkin g requirements at commercial marinas will be one parking space per moorage only for pr ivately owned slips with designated parking spaces. All other parking requirements will be one parking space per two moorages, as the rule currently states. The construction standards for covered slips was changed to specifically prohibit extra piling or hard covers due to the impacts on the near shore area. The process of inspecting float home sanitation, and bringing all float homes up to the sanitation standards, was modified to be less ambiguous. The permitting procedure for certain kinds of boat lifts was also modified to correct an error in the printing of the Proposed Rule. Pursuant to Section 67-5228, Idaho Code, typographical, transcriptional, and/or clerical corrections have also been made to the rule and are being published with this Notice of Rulemaking as part of the pending rule. The text of the pending rule has been amended in accordance with Section 67-5227, Idaho Code. Only those sections that have changes that differ from the proposed text are printed in this bulletin. The original text of the proposed rule was published in Book 2 of the October 7, 2009 Idaho Administrative Bulletin, V ol. 09-10, pages 90 through 106. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased. This fee or charge is being imposed pursuant to Section 58-1307, Idaho Code: The actual fee amounts would be removed from the rules and would be set by the Board subject to the maximum amounts in statute. This would allow, for instance, the Board to reduce the f ees down to the approximate cost of processing applications for small waterlines. As a nonnavigational encroachment they ar e currently assessed a fee, required by the Rules, that often exceeds the department's costs. FISCAL IMPACT: This is a general fund program. The department does not anticipate any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year.DEPARTMENT OF LANDS Docket No. 20-0304-0901 Regulation of Beds, Waters, & Airspace Over Navigable Lakes Pending Fee Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 220 January 6, 2010 - Vol. 10-1ASSISTANCE ON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS: For assistance on technical questions concerning this pending fee rule, contact Eric Wilson, (208) 334-0261 or ewilson@idl.idaho.gov.

Based upon the written comments filed with the Commission, the Commission made several clarifying changes to the proposed rules. Rule 5 was changed to make the rule consistent with statutory definition of small business service. The word \"cash\" was removed from Rule 102 to r ecognize that electronic payments are possible, and Rules 303 and 304 were clarified to allow for electronic forms of payment and notice. Rule 201 was changed to allow customers to choose to pay by automatic charges to checking accounts or credit cards, and also agree to terms that do not require a payment date on billing statements when choosing automatic payment methods. Rule 604 reduces notice to customers from thirty (30) days to ten (10) days, as is required by statute, and language is added to clarify the notice requirement applies to rate increases.
