They addre ss some important aspects of COVID19 management and policy, especially in Australia, wit h a focus on the nature, deployment and effects of \"vaccines\". It is abundantly clear that there has been repress ion and suppression in scientific circles and the media of any views or suggestions that run counter to the govern- ment/mainstream narrative. However, many studies n ow indicate that the Covid19 vaccines, especially the mRNA vaccines, are less than 'safe a nd effective', and the ramifications are truly confronting. Armed with these facts, the sci entific and medical communities can now begin proper discussions of potential solutions tha t improve the benefit/risk ratios for the public and do not harm careers and livelihoods of professi onals seeking the best outcomes for their patients.

Altman Appendix B: Australian COVID-19 vaccines Adverse Ev ent Summary & Analysis The Time of Covid 4 PART A: Background - COVID-19 Gene- Based 'Vaccines' 1. The Nature of the COVID-19 Gene- Based 'Vaccines' 1.1. The nature of the COVID- 19 'vaccines' has been largely misrepresented by mainstream media, big pharmaceutical companies, and governments, and is consequently poorly understood by the population at large. Most people consider vaccines to be relatively safe and well researched and readily accept their widespread use. 1.2. However, these COVID- 19 'vaccines' are not really vaccines - they are serious gene- based therapies which employ a gene-based technolog y which has never before been deployed in a fully approved therapeutic product. In this sense they should properly be considered to be experimental, and much safety a nd efficacy information has been gained since the introduction of these products mor e than a year ago. 1.3. COVID- 19 'vaccines' as a therapeutic fall under the US Food and Drug Ad ministration (FDA) Office of Cellular, Tissue, and Gene Therapies' d efinition of \"gene therapy products\" , in that it involves \"introducing a new or modified gene into the body to help treat a disease\"1. Despite this, the FDA did not evaluate this ther apy in relation to the established gene therapy guidelines. Gene therapie s have never been widely used in a general population. 2. Regulatory Status of the COVID-19 Gene- Based 'Vaccines' 2.1. On or about the following dates, the TGA grant ed conditional Provisional Approval of the following gene- based 'vaccines': COMIRNATY Pfizer Australia Pty Ltd - a mRNA vaccine (25 January 2021) Pfizer paediatric vaccine has been Provisionally A pproved (3 December 2021) 5- 11 years VAXZEVRIA AstraZeneca Pty Ltd - a viral vector vaccine (15 February 2021) COVID-19 VACCINE Janssen-Cilag Pty Ltd - a viral vector vaccine (25 June 2021) SPIKEVAX Moderna Australia Pty Ltd, - a mRNA vacci (9 August 2021) Moderna paediatric vaccine has been Provisionally Approved (17 February 2022) 6-11 years & 6 month to 5 years (19 July 2022) NUVAXOVID Novavax Inc. - a non-gene protein-based vaccine delivering spike protein in a lipid-nanoparticle matrix carrier (19 January 2022) 2.2. The TGA receives technical and policy advice f rom the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation ( ATAGI ). Members of ATAGI have both academic and clinica l interests in vaccine research. The TGA relies heav ily upon the recommendations of ATAGI in relation to the efficacy, safety and use o f vaccines. Many government and 1 What is Gene Therapy? (25/7/2018) US-FDA https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/cellular- gene - therapy-products/what-gene-therapy The Time of Covid 5 private corporate entities rely, in many cases excl usively, upon the health policy advice issued by ATAGI. The TGA also receives advice from the Advisory Committee on Vaccines ( ACV ) in relation to safety, quality and efficacy of va ccines supplied in Australia. 2.3. Provisional Approval is a relatively new drug regulatory pathway introduced into the Therapeutic Goods Act in 2018. Under this expedited review system, therapeutic agents (including vaccines) can be made available f or use when there is a perceived urgent need to use a drug even though the amount of ordinary safety and efficacy data normally required to approve that drug is not avail able. The manufacturer is required by the TGA to submit additional safety and efficacy data over a defined period to answer specific important outstanding safety and ef ficacy issues not completed or concluded before the product is Provisionally Appro ved. Products released under \"Provisional Approval\" cannot be considered fully e valuated. Under t hese circumstances and because there is pending or outst anding safety and efficacy data to be generated and evaluated, it is premature to d eclare such drugs \"safe and effective\" , and the use of these agents needs to be constantl y under review in light of emerging safety data to reassess the risk versus an y perceived benefit. 2.4. The new generation COVID- 19 'vaccines' have not been fully ' approved ' by the Australian drug regulator - all these products have been \"Provisionally Approve d\" due to deficiencies in the normal scope and depth of sa fety and efficacy data normally required for full approval. This is of particular importance in relation to vaccine mandates in so far as the regulatory status of thes e products establish without any doubt that important safety and efficacy concerns r emain in relation to the use of these products. In such circumstances, forcing individua ls on a massive scale to receive such serious medications with potentially unknown a nd serious adverse consequences, including death, using coercive vacci nation mandates, is without precedence in medicine. 2.5. Conventional vaccines usually take about 7 yea rs to develop and test. In a 2018 publication sponsored by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation2, vaccines were divided into three categories: simple, complex and unprecedented. 2.6. The unprecedented category represents those va ccines directed towards a disease that has never before been successfully treated and include vaccines against HIV and malaria. According to authors Seneff and Nigh3 unprecedented vaccines are expected to take more than 12 years to develop due to the te chnical difficulties, and they are expected to have a very low chance (about 5%) of pro ving safety and efficacy in even early Phase II clinical trials involving small numb ers of individuals, and a very much lower chance (about 2%) of moving to larger Phase II I clinical trials and demonstrating safety and efficacy before being considered for mar keting.

International Journal of Vaccine Theory, practice and Research: 2(1) https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/23 The Time of Covid 6 19 'vaccines' were developed in less than a year an d are supported by abbreviated safety and efficacy clinical data. These gene- based 'vaccines' are in the 'unprecedented ' category. 2.7. Historically, a large number of conventional v accines have been withdrawn due to safety concerns following widespread use. These in clude vaccines for Yellow Fever, polio, smallpox, Dengue fever, measles, respiratory syncytial virus, Swine flu, rotavirus, influenzae. 3. How the Gene-Based COVID- 19 'Vaccines' Work 3.1. These 'vaccines' use a genetic technology which has not been employed for any fully approved drug and in this sense the use of these pr oducts should properly be considered experimental. This technology, due to i ts inherent safety risks, has previously only been investigated in relatively ear ly clinical research for possible use in certain cancers and rare genetic disorders. The se products deliver either RNA in a lipo-nanoparticle (which has never been used previo usly) or DNA genetic material contained in a viral vector to produce the spike pr otein, similar to that found on the surface of the coronavirus, in order to provoke an immune response. It is the spike protein which is now known to be the main toxic com ponent of the SARS-CoV- 2 coronavirus. It is also the spike protein produced by these 'vaccines' which is understood to cause the unprecedented number of ser ious adverse events and death being reported following vaccination in various int ernational adverse drug reporting systems. 3.2. All COVID- 19 'vaccines' employ new generation nanoparticle te chnology: either non - viral or viral based nanoparticles4. The extremely small size of nanomaterials also means that they are much more readily taken up by t he human body than larger sized particles. Nanomaterials are able to cross biologi cal membranes and access cells, tissues and organs that larger sized particles norm ally cannot5. Such wide and efficient distribution following administration has significant implications in relation to organ and tissue toxicity as compared to convention al vaccines which largely remain at the site of injection. Specifically, nanopartic les may cross the blood-brain barrier (the membrane protecting the spinal cord and brain) and they may be associated with long term inflammation in various tissues and organ s, and they may be associated with cardiovascular adverse effects.6 4 Kisby, T. et al (August 2021) Reasons for success and lessons learnt from nanoscale vaccines against COVID- 19.

Threat Posed by SARS-CoV-2 4.1. The threat posed by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in producing the COVID-19 infection to segments of the community has been exaggerated due to the nature of the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) test used to detect \"cases\". The PCR test as use d in Australia and elsewhere was set (cycle threshold value: \"Ct\") to be exquisitely sensitive and could produce a positive result even if no live vir us was present or even if a fragment of a single viral particle was present. A survey o f the utility of PCR tests reported that positive PCR tests set to a Ct of 35 only correlated with a positive culture in 3% of cases7. In Australia and elsewhere, the PCR Ct was norma lly set at even higher values conferring less reliability. The PCR test was neve r intended to be diagnostic for COVID-19 due to this attribute. Individuals testin g positive for COVID-19 frequently have very low viral loads and are asymptomatic (sho w no symptoms) and are incapable of transmission of the virus due to their low viral loads. Children, in particular, are at virtually nil threat of serious COVID-19 infection (see below). Some estimates suggest that up to 97% of COVID positive c ases\" detected by PCR detected no virus on culture and therefore were of questiona ble value8. Indeed, so grave are the many limitations and lack of reliability attrib utable to PCR tests, that external peer review revealed 10 major scientific9 flaws that resulted in strong calls for the retraction10 of the Corman-Drosten paper,11 published by Eurosurveillance. 4.2. In recognition of the limitations of the PCR t esting, these tests are no longer considered generally appropriate by the US Center f or Disease Control ( CDC ) in determining the number of COVID-19 cases and their emergency use authorisation has been withdrawn reflecting this fact12. 4.3. COVID-19 government statistics represent anot her complicating factor. There is no discrimination between those individuals in hospita l or intensive care \"dying with\" COVID-19 as opposed to 'dying from ' COVID-19. Patients in hospital for serious non- COVID-19 related illness are routinely tested for C OVID-19 and often return a positive test. These patients are routinely recorded as \"CO VID cases\" and this can be misleading . 7 Jaafar, R. et al (2020) Correlation between 3790 Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction-Positives Samples and Positive Cell Cultures, Including 1941 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coro navirus 2 Isolates Clinical Infectious Diseases, Volume 72, Issue 11, 1 June 2021, page e921. 28 Septemb er 2020 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32986798/ 8 Jaafar, R., Aherfi, S., Wurtz, N., et al (2021) Correlation between 3790 Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction-Positives Samples and Positive Cell Cultures, Including 1941 Se vere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Isolates Clinical Infectious Diseases, Volume 72, Issue 1 1, 1 June 2021, Page e921, https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1491 9 Borger, P et al (November 2020) External peer review of the RTPC R test to detect SARS-CoV-2 reveals 10 major scientific flaws at the molecular and methodological level: con sequences for false positive results https://cormandrostenreview.com/report/ 10 Borger, P et al (November 2020) Retraction request letter to Eurosurveillance editorial board https://cormandrostenreview.com/retraction-request-letter- to-eurosurveillance-editorial-board/ 11 Corman, V et al (January 20202 Detection novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by real-time RT- PCR , Eurosurveillance, Volume 25, Issue 3 12 CDC Laboratory Alert (07/21/2021) Changes to CDC RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 Testing https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dls/locs/2021/07- 21-2021 -lab-alert-Changes_CDC_RT-PCR_SARS-CoV- 2_Testing_1.html The Time of Covid 8 4.4. According to the Australian Bureau of Statisti cs up to 15 February 202213 \"There are 2,639 death registrations that have been received b y the ABS where an individual is certified as having died from or with COVID-19 betw een the start of the pandemic and 31 January 2022\". The median age for those who died from COVID-19 w as 83.7 years (81.2 years for males, 86.0 years for females) amon g individuals reasonably assumed to have multiple serious co-morbidities. COVID-19 is an infection principally causing more serious illness in older individuals. 4.5. Australian government Department of Health web site: Coronavirus (COVID-19) case numbers and statistics (updated 7 May 2022) states there have been a tota l of 6,165,105 \"cases\" of COVID -1914. This translates to a death rate of COVID-19 of 0.0428% (for those 'dying with ' COVID-19). COVID-19 was only the 38th leading cause of death in Australia reported in 2020 statistics. With the delta then Omicron waves since late 2021, deaths with COVID-19 have risen, b ut data where it is available, as in NSW, indicate that proportions of hospitalisations a nd deaths are as high or higher among vaccinated than among unvaccinated people (se e 13.11 below). 4.6. The NSW Respiratory Surveillance Report ending 23 July 2022 states: '146 COVID- 19 deaths were reported this week, a 3% increase fr om 142 reported last week. All 146 deaths were eligible for a third dose of COVID- 19 vaccine..... ', indicating that there were no deaths reported for unvaccinated individual s15. 4.7. To place these numbers in perspective, the num ber of deaths due to influenza reported by the Australian Bureau of Statistics increased st eadily from 68 in 2011 to 274 in 2016, and rose sharply to 1,183 in 201716. When grouped, influenza and pneumonia contributed to 4,369 deaths in 2017 and were the ni nth leading cause of death for the year. During 2018, influenza and pneumonia were th e twelfth leading cause of death (n = 3,102 deaths). 4.8. No statistic is available regarding the number of Australians 'dying from ' COVID-19. The total number of Australians 'dying from ' COVID-19 would be some fraction of the total deaths reported . Officially reported 'COVID-19 deaths ' do not discriminate between those dying \"with\" COVID -19 and those dying \"due to\" COVID -19. Some government websites make this clear17. 4.9. The impact of COVID-19 varies depending on the age group. There is no Australian statistic available to demonstrate that any otherwi se healthy child died 'due to ' or 'from' COVID- 19. 13 Australian Bureau of Statistics: Causes of Death, Australia: Doctor Certified Deaths , Summary Tables.

The lack of information on the actual cause o f death in children in these rare instances makes any assessment of the risk of death due to CO VID-19 in this age group tenuous. The risk of death due to COVID-19 may range from ex ceedingly rare to virtually and statistically nil. 4.11. There is emerging evidence that the COVID-19 gene- based 'vaccines' are showing rapid and significant diminished efficacy against t he Omicron variant, particularly in children aged 5- 11.18 4.12. Some useful information regarding COVID-19 as cribed deaths in the UK was obtained by a Freedom of Information Request (FOI/2021/3368) , showing the number of deaths where COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned on the death certificate, from 1 February 2020 to 31 December 2021, by sex and age g roup in England and Wales19. This data (presented below as a downloaded Excel table) is important because it is a record where COVID-19 is the only listed possible c ause of death, and it covers a period where the most virulent strain of SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in the global population. Age group Males Females <1 1 0 1-4 0 0 5-9 0 0 10-14 0 1 15-19 1 0 20-24 4 1 25-29 12 3 30-34 24 7 35-39 42 15 40-44 52 24 45-49 87 43 50-54 138 52 55-59 234 92 60-64 254 102 65-69 279 119 402 85-89 470 533 90+ 520 971 4.13. This data supports the view of a virtually or statistically near nil risk of death due to COVID-19 in very young children , adolescents, and adults through to middle-aged. 18 Dorabawila, V. et al (February 2022) Effectiveness of the BNT1 62b2 vaccine among children 5-11 and 12- 17 years in New York after the Emergence of the Omicron Variant. M edRxiv preprint https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.25.22271454v1 19 UK Office of National Statistics FOI/2021/3368. Released 17 January 2022 . The Time of Covid 10 4.14. Another study in children and young people (<1 8 years of age) in the UK covering 12,023,568 individuals, from March 2020 to February 2021, examined the records of 3,105 who died including 61 who were positive for S ARS-CoV-220. 4.15. This study is instructive, in that it describ es in detail an evaluation process which should normally be conducted in evaluating whether or not an individual's death can be ascribed to COVID- 19, in light of pre-existing co-morbidities. Many re ports of \"COVID deaths\" do not attempt to discriminate or ascribe causality to this level , and therefore are of limited usefulness. This study wa s done at a time when the more virulent strain of SARS-CoV-2 was dominant, and it could be assumed to significantly overstate the risk of death due to the current Omic ron variant which has been dominant during 2022 worldwide21. 4.16. Despite the potential for this study to overe stimate the risk of death in 2022, the authors conclude: \"...the risk of serious outcomes from SARS -CoV-2 for individuals under 18 years of age remains extremely low \" - and even considering child deaths where COVID-19 was not the sole cause, the authors conclude - \"we estimated the infection fatality rate to be five per 100,000 indicating that more than 99.99 5% of children and young people recover from SARS-CoV-2 infection. \" 5. Initial Perceptions of the COVID- 19 'Vaccines' 5.1. Initially, despite limited clinical and epidem iological data, a number of community and health professional perceptions were widely held in relation to these new vaccines including: the vaccines prevent infection by the SARS-CoV-2 v irus and subsequent COVID-19 developing (COVID-19 being the disease cau sed by the virus) the vaccines prevent transmission of the SARS-CoV- 2 virus from infected to non-infected individuals the vaccines would provide durable immunity the vaccines are 95% effective the vaccines are safe and effective 5.2. In light of more than a year of widespread COV ID-19 vaccination usage all these initial perceptions have been shown to be without foundatio n. It is undisputed that COVID- 20 Smith, C et al: Deaths in children and young people in England a fter SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first pandemic year. Nature Medicine; Vol 28, Jan. 2022, 185-192. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01578-1 21 WANG, L. et al: COVID infection severity in children under 5 years ol d before and after Omicron emergence in the US. Preprint - doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.12.22269179 ; The Time of Covid 11 19 is commonplace in fully vaccinated individuals a nd now multiple boosters are being recommended at relatively frequent intervals. The current COVID- 19 'vaccines' have lost effectiveness against the emerging variants - to many, they have failed. However, the incidence of serious adverse events from these gene- based 'vaccines' continue to be reported and continue to rise in unprecedented n umber and severity.22 5.3. A good example of the popular misconceptions c oncerning the gene-based COVID- 19 'vaccines' is the claim of 95% efficacy which was repeated and unchallenged in the mainstream media and by health authorities in Austr alia and elsewhere. 5.4. Approval of the gene-based COVID- 19 'vaccines' were bas ed on single clinical trials from each company. These single trials were the so le basis for both the safety and efficacy claims. For example, in the case of the P fizer gene-based 'vaccine ' it was widely stated and generally accepted at the time th at the clinical efficacy of the vaccine was determined in a large clinical trial of about 4 4,000 subjects and the efficacy was 95%. 5.5. Without an understanding of the design, conduct and reporting of clinical trials, the ordinary person might interpret this statement in a number of different ways. For example, this \"95%\" efficacy might be interpreted to mean that vaccination provides a 95% chance of being protected from being infected fo llowing exposure from a person infected with SARS-CoV-2; or it might be interprete d to mean that vaccination reduces the risk of the average healthy person falling seri ously ill and needing hospitalisation following SARS-CoV-2 infection; or it might be inte rpreted as showing the risk of death due to severe COVID-19 illness is reduced by 95%. 5.6. Indeed, none of these interpretations are corr ect. 5.7. The claimed 95% efficacy was based upon only 17 0 subjects who contracted COVID- 19 during the trial which had a median follow up of two months post-second dose. The claimed clinical efficacy was not based upon 44,000 subjects. Of the 44,000 subjects enrolled and divided roughly equally between receiv ing active prophylactic vaccination or placebo, only 170 subjects tested positive for C OVID-19 AND developed even mild COVID-19 symptoms (similar to the common cold) whic h was the criterion set for \"clinical efficacy\"; with eight testing positive in the vaccinated group AND displaying a COVID-19 symptom as mild as a sore throat, fever or cough, while 162 tested positive in the placebo group AND displayed a COVID-19 symptom as mild as a sore throat, fever or cough. This is where the 95% COVID \"vaccin e\" efficacy claim originated and, based on this pivotal data, it should not be inferr ed that the Pfizer COVID- 19 \"vaccine was shown to be 95% effective in preventing serious COVID-19 disease, symptoms, hospitalisation or death\"23. 22 US Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) - open data - through to 29 April 2022 https://openvaers.com/covid-data RECORDED 27,758 deaths reported as related to the COVID-19 vaccines. 23 Australian Government - Therapeutic Goods Administration (25 January 2021) Australian Public Assessment Report for BNT162b2 (mRNA) , Comirnaty, Pfizer Australia Pty Ltd - PM-2020-05461-1-2 Final https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/auspar-bnt162b2-mrna-210 125.pdf The Time of Covid 12 5.8. The Pfizer trial (mentioned above) reported 99 .07% of unvaccinated individuals did not develop symptoms of COVID-19 while 99.95% the vaccin ated group did not report COVID-19 symptoms thus producing an absolute risk r eduction of symptoms of 0.88%. This statistic is a realistic measure of protection from COVID-19 (which may only present as mild symptoms) in an uninfected populati on over the trial surveillance period. 5.9. A subsequent Pfizer COMIRNATY gene-based COVID -19 'vaccine ' trial which was pivotal in the approval of this 'vaccine ' for children 5-11 relied on the clinical symptoms of only 19 children (3 developed symptoms in the Co mirnaty vaccine group and 16 in the placebo group) upon which to base its claimed a relative clinical efficacy of 90.7%.24 Once again, the claimed clinical efficacy only refe rred to the chance of preventing the mild symptoms, similar to the common cold, in children who tested positive for COVID-19. The absolute vaccine clinical efficacy to prevent e ven mild symptoms among the 4500 trial participants can then be calculated to be under 1% . 5.10. A similar approach was adopted by other manuf acturers such as Moderna claiming similar \"efficacy\" which has not been understood by either the media or the lay public. 6. Risk of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Children 6.1. All therapeutic agents, including vaccines, pr esent a safety risk. Therefore, the risk- benefit analysis of any medication needs to be weig hed up. 6.2. Drug regulatory agencies now recognise that mo st children with COVID-19 have either no symptoms (asymptomatic) or have only mild sympto ms. 6.3. I have searched without success for evidence a nd statistics for the incidence of severe COVID-19 and death due principally to COVID-19 in c hildren aged 5-11 in New Zealand and Australia. 6.4. Some information appears in the Australian TGA AusPAR (Public Assessment Report) Pfizer mRNA Vaccine COMIRNATY dated December 2021, which was used to approve the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for children 5- 11 years of age. On page 11 of this Australian report, Table 1 (below) includes CO VID-19 \"cases\" in Australia by age 24 Australian Government - Therapeutic Goods Administration (7 December 2021) Australian P ublic Assessment Report for Tozinameran (mRNA Covid-19 vaccine), Comirnaty PM-2021- 05012 -1-2 https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/auspar-tozinameran-mrna-covi d-19-vaccine-211207.pdf The Time of Covid 13 group and highest level of illness severity - 1 January 2021 to 10 October 2021 the numbers of children in age group 0-4 and 5-11 are p resented. It reports that over more than a nine month period in 2021 (at a time that th e more virulent stains of SARS-CoV- 2 were prevalent) that one person under 18 years of age died either \"with\" or \"due to\" COVID- 19. Table 1: COVID- 19 \"cases\" in Australia by age group and highest le vel of illness severity - 1 January 2021 to 10 October 2021 6.5. A search of the Risk Management Plan report re leased by Pfizer in February 2022 reviewed all available US COVID-19 cases and deaths to 14 August 2021. T he incident of death in children who tested positive t o COVID-19 in ages 0-4 and 5- 11 years was listed as \" <0.1% \" for each group25. This statistic, once again, does not distinguish between those children dying \"with\" COV ID-19 or \"due to\" COVID -19. 6.6. The above data sets are consistent with studie s26 showing the mortality rate in children hospitalised with COVID-19 of less than 0.18%, which i s less than the mortality rate 25 See European Medicines Agency COMIRNATY (COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN Version number: 5.0, page 21 https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/rmp-summary/comirnaty- epar-risk- management-plan_en.pdf ; Leidman, E (et al) (January 2022) COVID-19 Trends Among Persons Aged 0-24 Years - United States, March 1- December 12, 2020 , CDC https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7003e1.htm 26 Patel, N Paediatric (September-October 2020) COVID-19: Systematic review of the Otolaryngol. 2020 ; Ludvigsson, J, (March 2020) Systematic review of COVID-19 in children shows milder cases and a bett er prognosis than adults AXTA https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/apa.15270 The Time of Covid 14 seen in children from seasonal influenza.27 These figures correlate with further findings showing 46.7% of children 0 to 18 years 28 being asymptomatic upon infection. PART B: Emerging Picture of the Safety and Efficacy of the COVID- 19 'Vaccines' 7. Failure to Demonstrate a Favourable Risk/Benefit Case for Vaccinatin g Children with COVID- 19 'Vaccines' 7.1. Table 1 above, shows that no children died and 4 aged 5-11 were admitted to Intensive Care Units ( ICU), however, as indicated previously in this report, it is important to distinguish between those children admitted to ICU \"from COVID- 19\" or \" with COVID- 19\". It is possible that at least some of these children were admitted for s erious co- morbidities (as often is the case), but coincidenta lly tested positive for COVID-19. Until this reasonable possibility is ruled out, this info rmation should not be relied upon as evidence that children suffer, to any meaningful ex tent, serious disease caused by COVID-19. 7.2. In reality, the risk of COVID-19 death in an o therwise healthy 5-11 year-old is virtually or statistically nil. Investigations of extremely rare cases have been poorly characterised, and it is unclear to what extent any reported death is directly attributable to COVID-19 as opposed to pre-existing medical cond itions. A Johns Hopkins study published in July 2021 monitoring 48,000 children d iagnosed with COVID-19 found a mortality rate of zero among children without a pre -existing medical condition.29 7.3. As COVID-19 is now known to rarely produce ser ious disease in children, this should have significant impact upon the risk-benefit analy sis of using the gene-based 'vaccines' w hich have known serious short-term serious adverse effects, including death, and potentially serious unknown longer term adverse effects in this age group. 8. Serious Adverse Effects of the COVID- 19 'Vaccines' 8.1. Very limited relatively short-term safety data is available from the individuals involved in the controlled clinical trials submitted to drug regulatory agencies in support of the 27 Baht, N et al (December 2005) Influenza-Associated Deaths among Children in the United States, 2003 - 2004 N Engl J Med 2005; 353:2559-2567, DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa05172 1 https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa051721 ; Tingting, S et al (August 2019) Mortality risk factors in children with severe influenza virus infection admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit Medicine: August 2019 - Volume 98 - Issue 35 - p e16861 https://journals.lww.com/md- journal/fulltext/2019/08300/mortality_risk_factors_in_children _with_severe.25.aspx Fleming, D (July 2005) Mortality in children from influenza and respiratory syncytial virus Journal Epidemiol Community Health; 59(7): 586 -590 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1757088/ ; Sachedina, N (November 2010) Paediatric mortality related to pandemic influenza A H1N1 infection in England: an observational population-based study The Lancet, VOLUME 376, ISSUE 9755, P1846-1852, NOVEMBER 27, 201 0 https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS0140-6736(10 )61195-6/fulltex ; Statista (October 2021) Influenza mortality rate during the 2019-2020 flu season in the Unite d States, by age group* https://www.statista.com/statistics/1127799/influenza- ed 29 Makari, M Evidence Behind the CDC's Push to Vaccinate Children , Wall St. J, https://www.wsj.com/articles/cdc-covid- 19-coronavirus-vaccine-side-effects-hospitalization-kids-1162670 6868 The Time of Covid 15 emergency authorisations or provisional approvals o f the COVID- 19 'vaccines'. As such, there is a heavy reliance upon post-marketing adverse drug reaction report (ADR) systems to identify the type and incidence of adverse effects which are caused by the 'vaccines'. There are a number of such syst ems. Australia has the Drug Adverse Event Reporting system ( DAEN ), and the US has the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System ( VAERS ) which reports both US and international adverse events. 8.2. The problem with these systems is that they in volve voluntary reporting and most doctors are reluctant to report adverse drug reacti ons to vaccines due to fear of being accused by health regulators (Australian Health Pra ctitioner Regulatory Agency, AHPRA) of being considered to be \"anti -vax\".30 Many doctors both here and overseas and other health professionals fear losing their li cence to practice if they even apply for vaccine exemptions, and many investigations are currently underway by AHP RA at the present time. Also, the criteria for assess ing a causal relationship between a vaccine and an adverse event can be set so high tha t only a small percentage of serious adverse events or deaths are officially rep orted as being caused by a vaccine. These are some of the reasons why it is widely ackn owledged all adverse event reporting systems suffer from notorious underreport ing31. This can result in an underreporting factor of between 10-30 or more, i.e .: one must multiply the official incidence of adverse events by 10- 30, to obtain a real-world estimate of the true incidence of the adverse event. For US VAERS repor ting in respect of the Covid-19 'vaccines', the underreporting factor (URF) is esti mated to be between 40x -49x32. 8.3. In Australia, it is difficult to obtain statis tics regarding details of the number of deaths caused by the gene- based 'vaccines'. A Freedom of Information request (FOI-3586) was made to the TGA for data on the deaths reported as possibly related to the COVID- 19 'vaccines' and the 196 -page report is available online but is almost completely redacted.33 In the US the VAERS adverse drug reporting system h as recorded 27,758 deaths associated with gene- based \"vaccine\" administration through to 29 April 2022. The TGA COVID-19 vaccine weekly safety report released 23 June 202234 indicates a total of 889 deaths in association wit h COVID-19 gene-based 'vaccines' of which on ly 13 have been identified by the TGA as definitely causing death. However, there are no public details availa ble as to the criteria used by the TGA in arriving at this number of 13 deaths. This reported incidence of death does not account for any underreporting factor. 30 https://caldronpool.com/the-ahpra-inquisition-against-australi an-health-professionals/ ; see point 9 in https://support.mips.com.au/home/12-commandments- to-avoid-ahpra-notifications ; https://www.ahpra.gov.au/News/2021- 03-09-vaccination-statement.aspx ; an open letter to the American Board of Medical Specialties and the Federation of State Medical Boards: The destruction of Member Boards' credibility (2 6 Response to Australian Freedom of Information request FOI-3586: T he age of deceased for all reported adverse events resulting in death for events reported against any of th e TGA approved COVID-19 vaccine https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/foi-3586-01.pdf 34 https://www.tga.gov.au/periodic/covid- 19-vaccine-weekly-safety-report- 23-06-2022 The Time of Covid 16 8.4. Further confounding a proper of assessment of reported deaths is the complete lack of guidance or directions from the TGA or State or Territory health departments, with respect to any requirement to conduct autopsies on persons dying at any time post COVID-19 vaccination. This is an unfortunate state of affairs when it is known to the TGA as a consequence of its Pharmacovigilance dutie s, that by employing new histopathological methods developed in Germany, tha t identify the mRNA generated spike proteins at the scene of fatal pathological i nflammatory reactions, deaths that could be easily attributed to a 'normal' heart atta ck, or a 'normal' stroke, are now instead being found to have been caused by COVID-19 vaccines. Critically, in the German studies, of the 15 deceased examined, deaths due to the vaccines were found to be 'likely' and 'very likely' in 80% of cases.35 8.5. Prior to COVID-19 vaccinations, over the last 10 years there has been an average of about 155 deaths per year reported in relation to a ll conventional vaccines to the US VAERS. This includes all standard childhood vaccines on vaccine schedules, annual flu vaccines, travel vaccines, hepatitis, human pap illoma virus vaccines, tetanus vaccines, meningococcal vaccines and herpes vaccine s. 8.6. The website OpenVAERS extracts VAERS data each week specifically in relation to adverse event reports for the Covid- 19 'vaccines' . An inspection shows the contrast in reported mortality for the gene-based COVID- 19 'vaccines ' compared to all other vaccines combined since 1990.36 Table 2: All reported potential vaccine deaths to V AERS since 1990 to VAERS 35 Documents available, but see the recent presentation here: https://odysee.com/@en:a5/Pathology- Conference_Burkhardt_Presentation_EN_20220311:7 36 US Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) - open data- https://openvaers.com/covid-data The Time of Covid 17 8.7. Statistics on the number of flu vaccines admin istered over many years is provided by the US CDC37, and range from about 110 million per year to more t han 190 million per year since 2008. Similarly, there have been more p eople who have received measles/mumps/Rubella vaccinations (301,000,000) th an COVID-19 vaccinations (255,000,000) since VAERS commenced reporting in 19 9038. 8.8. The relatively high number of adverse reports received by the VAERS (hosted by the US CDC) relative to other commonly used vaccines, i s also seen in both of the other two major adverse drug reporting systems: VigiAcces s (hosted by WHO) and EudraVigilance (hosted by the European Medicines Ag ency)39. 8.9. Dr. Jessica Rose, specialist data analyst, has focused her attention on the US VAERS data and published on the general ADR data as well as specifically in relation to myocarditis.40 37 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - Historical Reference of Seasonal influenza Vaccine Doses Distributed.

As of 22 April 2022, in the United States alo ne there had been recorded 5,309 cases of myocarditis, 782,665 adverse events, 151,796 sev ere adverse events, and 14,613 deaths in VAERS following COVID-19 vaccination.41 Every adverse drug reaction report needs to be individually assessed to rate th e probability of causing any particular adverse reaction - not all reports are assessed as \"causal\". On the o ther hand, the underreporting factor can range from 5 to perhaps a s high as 31 times42 or more. 8.11. The confounding assessment factors of underre porting of adverse effects on one hand, and the possible lack of evidence of causatio n on the other hand in relation to deaths caused by vaccines, can be resolved to a lar ge degree by an examination of the statistics of death temporally associated with vaccine administration. 8.12. Dr. Jessica Rose has analysed the percentage of individuals experiencing adverse effects within 24- and 48-hour periods in relation to COVID-19 vaccine administration. 8.13. Of particular interest is the Rose analysis o f VAERS % reported deaths following vaccination with the gene-based vaccines versus the number of days following injection43. This analysis included a graphical representatio n of the temporal relationship between the number of deaths reported in association with COVID-19 vaccine administration and the time of death measur ed in days following injection. In relation to the widely accepted Bradford Hill cr iteria for the assessment of adverse drug reactions, a close temporal relationship betwe en drug administration and the adverse event represents some of the strongest evid ence upon which to assign a cause-effect relationship. The following graphical representation depicts the perc ent of reported deaths versus the number of days following injection of a COVID- 19 \"vaccine\" (data ending December 2021) showing a clustering of deaths withi n about 2 days of administration (orange line) compared to an expected background in cidence of a hypothetical event which is not related temporally to vaccine administ ration (yellow line). 41 US Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) - https://vaers.hhs.gov 42 Critical Appraisal of VAERS Pharmacovigilance: Is the U.S. Vaccine Adve rse Events Reporting System (VAERS) a Functioning Pharmacovigilance System?

In this respect, anaphylaxis is used as a positive control to assist the interpreta tion of the data. The Time of Covid 20 Another important temporal relationship extracted f rom the VAERS data is shown below between the incidence of myocarditis and COVID- 19 \"vaccine\" administration. 8.14. The abovementioned analyses are short-term an alyses, i.e. observations within days, weeks or months of vaccination. No long-term safet y data is available for the COVID- 19 gene-based vaccines. The long-term safety of th e gene-based vaccines is completely unknown and there are potentially seriou s concerns which will only be resolved many years into the future. These concern s are based on the identification of pathogenic attributes of the spike protein and i nclude profound disturbances in regulatory control of protein synthesis and natural cancer surveillance protective mechanisms, a potentially causal link to neurodegen erative disease, immune thrombocytopenia, Bell's palsy, liver disease, impa ired adaptive immunity, impaired DNA damage response and tumorigenesis. 8.15. It has been suggested that the increase in de aths temporally associated with the introduction of the gene- based 'vaccines' is not due to these new 'vaccines' but rather due to increased numbers of injections overall. Ho wever, this explanation does not appear valid as the COVID-19 vaccines represent a s mall proportion of all vaccines given in the US since 1990. For example, just cons idering flu vaccines, it has been reported that since the 08/09 flu season a total of 1,720,400,000 flu vaccines were administered while only 557,637,223 doses of the CO VID-19 vaccines were administered in the USA. Many other types of vaccin es are routinely used. The Time of Covid 21 8.16. A detailed summary and analysis of the advers e drug reactions reported in association with the COVID-19 gene- based \"vaccines\" is presented as an addendum to thi s Report44 Focus on Myocarditis and Pericarditis 8.17. Of all the serious more short-term adverse ev ents receiving attention in relation to the gene-based COVID-19 vaccines, myocarditis has proba bly received the most attention due to the seriousness of the condition (can cause permanent heart damage and be fatal) and its potential to affect longevity especi ally in the younger age groups with a predominance among younger males. 8.18. In analysing the possible incidence of myocar ditis associated with the gene-based vaccines, it is useful to compare the historical ra tes of myocarditis prior to the introduction of these vaccines with the rate associ ated with the vaccine rollouts (Pfizer, Moderna and Janssen) during 202145. 8.19. It appears that there is a risk of myocarditi s from both COVID- 19 infection (especially in the elderly population) and from gene-based COVI D-19 vaccines - both considered to be related to the toxic spike protein. The US C enter for Disease Control (CDC) has attempted to discriminate between the two causal fa ctors in order to arrive at a risk of myocarditis caused by the vaccines. If there is a risk of people contracting myocarditis from SARS-CoV-2 then this would appear to be neglig ible, as no health authority has produced a report or meaningful evidence that SARS- CoV- 2 significantly elevates the risk of myocarditis. 8.20. The risk of myocarditis, pericarditis and car diac arrhythmias associated with several gene-based COVID- 19 'vaccines' or SARS -CoV-2 infection itself was studied in a large case series study of people aged 16 or older in Eng land between 1 December 2020 and 24 August 2021.46 8.21. In this large study the temporal relationship between the gene-based vaccines and myocarditis was seen in the subgroup analysis by ag e showing an increased risk of myocarditis associated with the two mRNA vaccines i n those younger than 40 years of age. Subgroup analysis was only performed for m yocarditis. While those under 16 years of age were not studied it is widely recognis ed and accepted that younger males are most at risk of myocarditis. In addition, the authors state: 'Our findings are relevant to the public, clinician s and policy makers. First, there was an increase in the risk of myocarditis within a wee k of receiving the first dose of both 44 Mitchell, Lisa: Summary and analysis on adverse drug reactions regarding COVID-19 vaccines submitted t o the Australian Drug Adverse Event Notification (DAEN) system (5 August 202 2) 45 Rose, J and McCullough P (September 2021) A Report on Myocarditis Ad verse Events in the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting system (VAERS) in Association with COVID-19 injectable Bio logical Products.

'Myocarditis is underdiagnosed in practice, with being directed towards myocardial ischemia or infarction.' 8.22. In a nationwide study in France involving 32 million people aged 12-50 years of age and receiving 46 million doses of mRNA vaccines, 1, 612 cases of myocarditis and 1,613 cases of pericarditis occurred in France betw een 12 May 2021 and 31 October 2021.47 The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis for both the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines was found to be increased both af ter the first and second doses. The risk of this association was statistically sign ificant and particularly evident for the Moderna COVID- 19 'vaccine ' where the risk of myocarditis/pericarditis was inc reased 30 times suggesting a dose-response relationship, g iven Moderna has 100 micrograms of mRNA and COMIRNATY has 30 micrograms of mRNA per dose. The risk was increased in younger age groups. The inci dence of both myocarditis and pericarditis reported in this study was consistent with the incidence reported in other countries. 8.23. Another study from Israel investigated the in cidence of myocarditis and pericarditis in post COVID- 19 unvaccinated patients.48 This is an important study because some have argued that the myocarditis and pericarditis i ncidence observed in populations may be due to COVID-19 and not due to COVID- 19 'vaccines'. This retrospective cohort study of 196,992 adults following COVID-19 i nfection and 590,976 control adults who tested negative for COVID-19 concluded: 'Post COVID -19 infection was not associated with either myocar ditis or pericarditis. We did not observe an increased incidence of either pericarditis nor myocarditis in adult patients recovering from COVID- 19 infection.' 8.24. Aside from being under-diagnosed in practice, it is generally known that many doctors avoid reporting myocarditis and other serious possi ble adverse events in relation to the gene-based vaccines for fear of being seen as c ritical of the national health COVID- 19 vaccination policies, and possible health regulator intimidation and retribu tion. This, combined with the inherent underreporting of advers e events in general, suggest the true incidence of adverse effects such as myocardit is may be much higher than officially reported. This needs to be considered i n the calculation of the risk-benefit analysis. 8.25.

As of 10 July 2022, since inoculating 5-11 year-olds in Australia began on 10 January 2022, five (5) children were previously reported to have died following receiving a COVID- 19 'vaccine', as recorded by the TGA' s DAEN website Australian Government Therapeutic Goods Administration, Database of Adver se Event Notifications ,50 specifically: Case no. 719838 11 Mar 7-year-old male - cardiac arrest, generalised tonic-clonic seizure. Case no. 724023 25 Mar 9-year-old female - cardiac arrest. Case no. 724925 28 Mar 6-year-old male - adverse event following immunisation (which has since been removed).

Myocarditis and pericarditis are serious medi cal conditions which may have life-long consequences and may be life threatening and may af fect 5-11 year-old children. As of 28-7-2022, despite possibly significant underreportin g, there have been 37 suspected cases of chest pain (indicative of myocar ditis and pericarditis) have been reported to the DAEN system in this age group51. 8.28. The paediatric COVID-19 gene- based 'vaccines' have only been available for a lim ited time as compared to the vaccines for the older age groups. But the safety record of the 'vaccines ' used in the older age groups is an indicator of th e adverse events one might expect in the younger age groups. 8.29. In this regard, the following information sho uld be taken into consideration: a. The VAERS database reports that as of 22 April 202 2, in the US alone there were 5,309 cases of myocarditis, 782,665 adverse ev ents, 151,796 severe adverse events, and 14,613 deaths recorded followin g COVID-19 vaccination in the US.52 b. After introduction of the gene-based COVID-19 vacc ines in the US, VAERS quickly accumulated an unusually large number of ad verse events. Between November 3 and December 19, 2021, VAERS received an overwhelming 4,249 adverse reaction reports for children aged five thr ough eleven years who received the Pfizer COVID- 19 COMIRNATY 'vaccine'.53 8.30. Further, in the documents related to a recent FOIA request, in the Pfizer informed consent document54 it was revealed that the company recognised the ri sk of myocarditis to be as high as 1 in 1,000. Myocardit is is overwhelmingly found in younger people. Other Safety Factors and Issues to Consider 8.31. Another factor which needs to be considered i s the delay in assessing and reporting adverse drug events due to the unprecedented number of such events being reported. Pfizer itself has acknowledged this issue in its cu mulative analysis of post- authorisation adverse event April 2021 ( Pfizer's Adverse Events Report ) (released in or about November 2021 51 Australian Government Therapeutic Goods Administration COVID-19 Va ccine Safety Report 28-0702022. https://www.tga.gov.au/periodic/covid- 19-vaccine-safety-report- 28-07-2022 52 U.S. Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) - https://vaers.hhs.gov 53 Hause, A et al (December 2021) COVID-19 Vaccine Safety in Children Aged 5-11 Years - United States US November 3- December 19, 2021 CDC Report https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm705152a1.htm 54 Pfizer Clinical Trial Informed Consent Document.

More are joining each month with an expected total of more than 1,800 additional resources by the end of June 2021 .\"56 8.32. During phase III clinical trials for the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine products, safety was assessed based on a maximum observation period of 6 months. This is not adequate to assess long-term safety outcomes. A typical tim eline of up to 10 years would be considered appropriate for long-term follow up. Th ere are many examples where biological products have been recall ed (let alone gene-based products) such as the rotavirus vaccines in 2010, the H1N1 influenza vacc ine in 2009 and a meningococcal vaccine in 2005-2008. 8.33. Data from pivotal clinical trials used to sup port the gene- based 'vaccines' of Moderna, Pfizer and Janssen were re-analysed by Classen57 to determine 'all cause severe morbidity\" defined as \"severe infections with COVID -19 and all other severe advers e events between the treatment arms and control arms respectively '. This type of analysis avoids any bias within the adverse drug re porting system where a cause- effect assessment might be arbitrarily discounted d ue to the overly strict criteria required to establish such a relationship. This an alysis found a statistically significant increase in all cause severe morbidity in the vacci nated group compared to the placebo group. When all types of severe events were conside red, the vaccinated group suffered more severe adverse events; this suggests the gene-based vaccines are doing more harm than good. 8.34. In a published paper by a world-expert analys t of the VAERS database for all age groups, Dr. Jessica Rose58 found that, based on the ratio of expected severe adverse events to observed adverse events in VAERS for a nu mber of conditions, the 'underreporting factor ( URF)' for COVID vaccine-associated deaths was 31. Using this URF for all VAERS-classified severe adverse events, as of October 2021, COVID- 19 'vaccines' were associated with 205,809 deaths, 818 ,462 hospitalizations, 1,830,891 55 FDA released document: Pfizer 5.3.6 Cumulative analysis of post-authorization adverse event reports of pf-07302048 (bnt162b2) received through 28-feb-2021 - page 6 56 The Vault Project: Pfizer Secretly Hired 600+ Employees to Process F lood of COVID Vaccine Adverse Events.

Further relevant background information is pr ovided by life insurance industry data for adults. These data suggest historic increases in d eath claims coinciding with gene- based 'vaccine ' rollouts. A publicly available quarterly report b y the Group Life Insurance Industry, covering roughly 90% of the empl oyer-based policies in the US, reported that younger age groups were suddenly dyin g at historically unprecedented rates beginning in Q3 of 2021.59 8.36. Other evidence of the damage caused by the ge ne-based 'vaccines' comes from the number of ambulance calls in response to cardiac ar rests and acute coronary syndromes (heart attacks) for young people in the 1 6-39 age group during the COVID- 19 vaccination rollout in Israel (January -May, 2021) compared with the same period of time in prior years 2019 and 2020.60 8.37. There is also an alarming and massive rise in deaths among healthy, young professional athletes from around the world since t he COVID-19 vaccination campaign was initiated. As of 4 June 2022, approximately 1, 090 athletes61 suffered a cardiac arrest, with 715 of them dying as a result. The maj ority of arrests occurred in competition or training. The frequency of these ev ents in comparison to historical data is of great concern. In a 2009 review of professional athletes' deaths62, published in a prominent European Cardiology journal, they found t hat from 1966 to 2004, there was an average of only 29 sudden athlete deaths per yea r worldwide. Compare this number to just the month of January 2022 alone wher e 127 collapses and 87 death s among professional athletes were reported. Overall, these athlete deaths reflect an approximately 22-fold increase in the year after th e introduction of COVID vaccines, to date unexplained by other identifiable causes. 8.38. Australian Bureau of Statistics data also ref lect a similar surge in Excess Deaths commensurate with the rollout of the 'vaccines', wh ere Excess (non-COVID) Deaths for 2022 already are 17.5% above baseline, as the fo llowing graph63 vividly depicts. 59 SOA Research Institute (January 2022) Group Life COVID-19 Mortality Survey Report (page 23 ) https://www.soa.org/48ff80/globalassets/assets/files/resources/resea rch-report/2022/group-life-covid- 19-mortality.pdf 60 Sun, C.L.F et emergency cardiovascular events among under-40 popula tion in Israel during vaccine rollout and third COVID-19 wave Scientific Reports 12:6978. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022- 10928 -z 61 1111 Athlete Cardiac Arrests, Serious Issues, 732 Dead, After COVID Inje ction.

New South Wales COVID-19 data for hospital admission s, ICU admissions and deaths in the 14 days up to 23 July 202264 is shown below. The data shows 693 people with known vaccination status were admitted to hospital; of these, one person was reported as unvaccinated. In interpreting this data it is n oted that this is at a time when it is estimated that about 95% of individuals over 16 year s of age are reported to be vaccinated. Also, unvaccinated individuals enterin g hospital for any reason may be more likely to be tested for COVID-19 as compared t o those individuals who declare they are vaccinated. Taking these factors into account, the data suggests that Co vid- 19 vaccinated individuals are placing relatively hi gher demands on hospital resources as compared to the unvaccinated, a trend that has b een occurring in 2022. 64 https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Documents/weekly-covid- overview-20220723.pdf The Time of Covid 28 Fertility, Birth Rates, miscarriages, stillbirths an d neonatal deaths 8.40. One category of death not normally accounted for in Excess Deaths figures are stillbirths. After the deployment of COVID- 19 'vaccines' in Germany and Scotland, statistically significant increases in stillbirths, perinatal, and neonatal deaths are now apparent from late 2021 leading into 202265. 65 Guetzkow, J (July 2022) Springtime for Stillbirths in Germany Winter for women and babies, Substack https://jackanapes.substack.com/p/springtime-for-stillbirths- in-germany The Time of Covid 29 8.41. Correspondingly, extraordinarily high drops i n birth rates are now apparent in Germany and Taiwan, with an over 10% decline66 in the former, and an over 25% decline67 in the latter. Similar declines in birth rates are no w also being seen across US states68, Sweden69, Canada70, and highly COVID-19 vaccinated Hungary.71 8.42. These declines appear to correlate with data released by Pfizer to regulators on or shortly after 28 February 202172, where Pfizer reported on outcomes in 270 pregnant women who received the Pfizer 'vaccine'. No outcome or follow -up by Pfizer was provided for 238 of the pregnancies thus underminin g any claims of safety in pregnancy. Of the remaining pregnancies 28 out of 29 babies died, a death rate of 97% in those pregnancies Pfizer did follow- up. Though this Pfizer pregnancy data is grossly lacking, it nonetheless begs critical quest ions which regulators have to date not asked. Regulators should begin asking question s or considering the continued use of these 'vaccines', particularly now when fu rther studies are confirming relatively high impacts on women's menstrual cycles73. Furthermore, data74procured from Pfizer under Court order show that the Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs ) used as the delivery vehicle for the synthetic mRNA, extensively bio-dis tribut es throughout the human body and accumulat es in various organs including the kidney, spleen, ad renal glands, testes and ovaries although 'vaccine' recipients were initially inform ed the 'vaccines' would remain in the deltoid muscle at the site of injecti on. Although the effects of the delivered synthetic mRNA upon the various organs st udied is currently unknown, many studies75 show toxic effects of LNPs . 66 Syed, A (July 2022) Children of of- men/comments?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email 67 Chudov, I (July (July 2022) Swedish data: what does it really show us?

Collectively, the available peer-reviewed lit erature points to a number of serious safety concerns regarding COVID- 19 'vaccines'. Already by December 2021, in excess of 1,000 peer-reviewed articles and studies focussing upon post-vaccination deaths and injuries had been published76. 8.44. The long-term potential for the Spike Protein (produced by the COVID- 19 'vaccines') to induce a range of autoimmune diseases has been c ommented upon by several authors. Because there is no long-term safety data available at the moment, the chance of induced autoimmune disease cannot be dete rmined77. 9. Potential Toxicity of the Spike Protein Produced by Gene-Based 'Vaccines' 9.1. The Spike Protein contained on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus facilitates the binding of the viral particle to human cells, allow ing infection of those cells, and has inherent toxicity in its own right.78 However, the Spike Proteins produced by the COVID- 19 'vaccines' are not identical to the Spike Protei n on the natural SARS -CoV- 2 virus79 in that some uracil nucleotide bases (there 4 nucleotide bases in RNA: uridine, cytosine, guanine and adenine) are re placed with pseudouridine (a methylated derivative). This seemingly small chang e imparts profound pharmacological characteristics to the mRNA molecul e produced by the COVID- 19 'vaccines' including the ability to evade natural d egradation as happens to natural mRNA. Further, the synthetic mRNA Spike Proteins i nterfere with the body's natural immune system (including Toll Like Receptors) which explains why these mRNA particles can provoke latent viral eruptions of Her pes Zoster and Epstein-Barr viruses as report ed in adverse drug reaction reporting systems. 9.2. Reactivation of the dormant virus Herpes Zoste r, which is responsible for shingles, has been reported in relation to COVID-19 vaccination b ut at the moment no cause-and- effect relationship has been acknowledged. In orde r to investigate a possible cause- effect relationship, a systematic review of the lit erature was undertaken80. A total of 54 cases reported in the literature were found and reviewed. Thirty-six patients out of 45 (80%) developed herpes zoster following the primi ng dose of mRNA COVID- 19 vaccine. Furthermore, 96% of patients developed it within a temporal timeframe defined by WHO as indicative of a causal relationshi p. The authors even suggested possible use of prophylactic herpes zoster anti-vir al medication prior to vaccination to herpes prone individuals. 76 Peer Reviewed Medical Papers for Adverse Events in COVID-19 Vaccine Reci pients - 021) W orse Than the Disease?

Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology Volume 20, Issue 11, Pages 3350- 3361 https://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.14521 The Time of Covid 31 9.3. Multiple modes of Spike Protein toxicity have been reported including those related to blood clotting and mitochondrial damage81. 9.4. It has been a widespread belief that the Spike Protein produced by the gene-based 'vaccines' is the same as the Spike Protein on the surface of the SARS -CoV-2 virus, therefore, the effects of both will be similar. Fu rthermore, it has been assumed that exposing an individual to just the Spike Protein of the 'vaccines' is safer than exposure to the natural virus. However, these reasonings ar e now being questioned. It is now understood that the mRNA produced by the gene- based 'vaccines' contains pseudo - uridine instead of uridine as a nucleotide base and remains in circulation for much longer. 10. mRNA Does Not Remain at the Injection Site and Is Not Ra pidly Destroyed 10.1. The normal biochemical protective mechanisms ensure that mRNA molecules are normally rapidly destroyed outside cells. Initiall y, it was thought that mRNA produced from COVID- 19 'vaccines' would be rapidly destroyed. However, evidence now shows that the mRNA from thes e 'vaccines' may linger for 15 days or more post -vaccination82. The persistence of this mRNA has implications for c ontinued production of Spike Protein and associated possible toxicity associated with the Spike Protein. Another study suggests mRNA produced following COVID-19 vac cination may remain in lymph nodes for up to 60 days83. 10.2. These nucleotide m anipulations of the 'vaccine' mRNAs to reduce its r ate of degradation and therefore to enhance its capacity t o drive Spike Protein production per molecule of mRNA, may produce concentrations mu ch higher than those observed with natural infection in some individuals. G ene-based 'vaccines' appear to drive production of incredibly high numbers of Spike Prot ein mRNA molecules (13 trillion to 40 trillion) almost instantaneously as compared to natural infection. This may account for the serious adverse effects and deaths reported following administration of gene- based COVID- 19 'vaccines' in advers e drug reporting systems, and further research is needed with regard to this important observation . 10.3. The immediate injection of literally trillion s of Spike Protein producing mRNA molecules, as distinct from the slower accumulation of Spike Protein by natural infection, could be responsible for the numbers of deaths reported within 48 hours of COVID- 19 'vaccine ' injection, although this is yet to be proven. Thi s is why COVID- 19 81 Lei Y, Zhang J, Schiavon CR, et al (2021) SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Impairs Endothelial via Downregulation 2 .

These authors also reflect upon the lack of transparency regarding lot- to-lot gene sequencing for vaccine quality control which might explain why some batches/lots of gene-based COVID- 19 'vaccines' are associated with much high inciden ces of severe adverse effects84. 10.5. A biopsy study provided direct evidence linki ng Spike Protein concentrations produced following vaccination in heart tissue to the develo pment of myocarditis.85 11. Long -Term Potential Genetic Damage and Cancer Potential of COVID-19 'Vaccines' 11.1. In considering the safety of any new therapeu tic, potential for both genotoxicity (damage to genes) and mutagenicity (potential to ca use cancer) are among the highest priorities. This should especially apply to genetic therapeutics such as the COVID- 19 'vaccines', and more so when administration of these products to health y individuals of all ages worldwide was envisioned. 11.2. Evidence shows the spike protein produced by the Pfizer mRNA vaccine can enter into the nucleus of cells and disrupt fundamental c ellular processes involved in DNA repair. This adds to concerns and raises serious po tential safety issues regarding a diminished ability of the body to prevent the rise of cancers86. Neither of these observed genetic type molecular effects are expecte d in relation to conventional vaccines. 11.3. The gene-based COVID- 19 'vaccine' manufacturers presented their products as 'vaccines' to drug regulators even though , by their very nature, they were a new class of gene-based therapies. This had significant impa ct on reducing the usual safety testing requirements which were normally applied to gene-based therapies. It should be noted that in order to assist and accommodate th e introduction of these experimental drugs, the CDC and other organisations began applying recently reduced safety data requirements applicable to conventional vaccines to these gene-based 'vaccines' and the definition of 'vaccine' was amended to accommodate these new gene-based therapies87.

But these guidelines were drafted well before the inven tion of the gene-based COVID 'vaccines'. 11.4. Drug regulators around the world have accepte d official product information statements which acknowledge the omission of this i mportant pre-clinical (in-vitro and/or animal) genotoxicity and mutagenicity safety data. 11.5. Provisional Approval for the new gene-based C OVID- 19 'vaccines' began early 2021. However, since then important laboratory genetic da ta has been published which raises the theoretical possibility that the mRNA co ntained in these gene-based 'vaccines' may be reverse transcribed (that is, inc orporated) into one's DNA around the body (including a wide variety of tissues and o rgans including eggs in the ovary) which is contrary to the assumptions of the drug re gulators such as the TGA. This research, according to established protocols, was d one on an in-vitro human liver cell line. The potential safety implications for curren t and future generations are of great relevance and significance and drug regulators shou ld be demanding immediate further investigations89. These findings raise the possibility that these gen e-based COVID- 19 'vaccines' might induce cancers and that these effects may be inherited into future generations. Until this and other ques tions are addressed it is not prudent nor reasonable to claim these products are \"safe\". 11.6. Following an extensive critical review of the immunological and metabolic consequences associated with the mRNA based COVID- 19 'vaccines ', some expert molecular biologists have concluded these 'vaccines ' should be withdrawn due to their potentially devastating and wide ranging short-term and long-term adverse effects90. 11.7. Furthermore, in relation to risk-benefit, it has been reported that \"based on publicly available official UK and US data, all age groups u nder 50 years old are at greater risk of death after receiving a COVID-19 inoculation tha n an unvaccinated person is at risk of a COVID-19 death91. In such circumstances, it is extremely difficult to justify mandatory vaccination. 11.8. It is also unknown if the Danish drug regulator's r ecent decision to cease its gene - based vaccination program is related to concerns re garding genotoxicity92.

The issue of potential mutagenicity and genot oxicity is of high importance and received attention at Australian Senate Estimates on 1 June 2021 (Community Affairs Legislation Committee)93. 11.10. In that hearing, Prof. Skerritt (head of the Australian TGA) by Senator Malcolm Roberts on the potential for the mRNA to enter the nucleus of cells and cause potentially serious genetic adverse events which could affect f uture generations : \"Senator ROBERTS: How long before we know the intergenerational effec ts? Dr Skerritt: There is no evidence at all from animal or human st udies that the RNA vaccines, if you're talking about them, incorpo rate into the genetic material of human beings. They wouldn't have received regul atory approval, and that includes by much bigger regulators such as the FDA, if these bits of mRNA incorporated into the human genetic material. In f act, medicines that incorporate into human genetic material and are inh erited are currently not permitted in most major countries, including Austra lia.\" 11.11. The statement by Prof. Skerritt was made pri or to the publications referred to above. These events provide compelling evidence to reject the indiscriminate general use of these gene-based COVID- 19 'vaccines' and to prevent mandatory vaccination on safety grounds. 12. COVID- 19 'Vaccines' Do Not Prevent Infection or Transmission 12.1. The COVID- 19 'vaccines' neither prevent infection nor do they prevent transmission of the infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection is via airbo rne infection of viral particles entering via the mucosa (surface lining) of the nos e. COVID- 19 'vaccines' do not induce mucosal immunity: instead they induce blood- borne immunity, which is not effective in countering organisms entering and mult iplying in the mucosal tract. This is why, despite population vaccination rates approa ching 90%, COVID-19 cases remain stubbornly high in many countries. 12.2. 'Dr Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute o f Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) said the viral load of Delta variant in the nasal passages of vaccinated people was \"almost identical\" to that in noses of unvaccin ated peop le.94 It is an accepted principle that the viral load or amount of virus pr esent is directly proportional to cases-almost-identical The Time of Covid 35 the development of symptoms of infection and the ab ility to transmit the infection to others. 12.3. Dr Rochelle Walensky, director of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) said publicly that the COVID- 19 vaccines \"can't prevent transmission\" [of SARS -CoV- 2]95. This is basically because the COVID-19 vaccines do not prev ent infection in an individual i.e. the COVID- 19 'vaccines' are not \"sterilizing\". 12.4. In addition, three articles in The Lancet rep ort that the current COVID-19 gene-based vaccines do not prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-296. 12.5. Contrary to initial popular belief and in lig ht of recent evidence, mandatory COVID- 19 vaccination will neither significantly or effective ly prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection or prevention of transmission of infection to others. According to Gunter Kampf, fully vaccinated individuals can carry similar viral load s to unvaccinated individuals and spread the virus just as easily97. 12.6. Gunter Kampf, stated: \"There is increasing evidence that vaccinated indiv iduals continue to have a relevant role in transmission. In Massachusetts, U SA, a total of 469 new COVID- 19 cases were detected during various events in Jul y, 2021, and 346 (74%) of these cases were in people who were fully or partly vaccinated, 274 (79%) of whom were symptomatic. Cycle threshold values were simi larly low between people who were fully vaccinated (median 22.8) and people who were unvaccinated, not fully vaccinated, or whose vaccination status was unknown (median 21.5), indicating a high viral load even among people who were fully va ccinated.\" 12.7. The author concludes: \"It is therefore wrong and dangerous to speak of a pandemic of the unvaccinated\" . 12.8. A Wisconsin, USA, study in June/July 2021 (when the Delta variant was prominent) found no difference for SARS-CoV-2 infected individ uals in viral load measurements by PCR test cycle threshold (Ct) data between 310 f ully vaccinated and 389 unvaccinated individuals: Testing found high viral load in 68% of the fully vaccinated 95 Jaafar, R. et al (2020) Correlation between 3790 Quantitative Polymeras e Chain Reaction-Positives Samples and Positive Cell Cultures, Including 1941 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Isolates Clinical Infectious Diseases, Volume 72, Issue 11, 1 June 2021, pag e e921. the unvaccinated not justified The Lancet 398, ISSUE 10314, P1871, NOVEMBER 20, 2021 https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140- 6736(21)02243-1/fulltext Brown et al (July 2021) Outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infections, inclu ding COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections, associated with large public gatherings \u2014 Barnstable County, Massachusetts, July 2021 2021;70: The Time of Covid 36 and 63% of the unvaccinated. This data suggests tha t vaccinated are just as likely to be spreaders of SARS-CoV-298. 12.9. The risk of infection leading to COVID-19 var ies depending on age and clinical status (including the presence of natural immunity) and mu st be weighed against the accumulating evidence of serious adverse effects in cluding death, as well as the waning efficacy of the vaccines in protecting again st infection. 13. Diminished 'Vaccine' Efficacy and Potential N egative 'Vaccine' Efficacy 13.1. In the first part of 2022 a number of public health sources in the US, Australia, Denmark, Israel and the UK have suggest ed the protective efficacy of the COVID 'vaccines' is waning or possibly even resulting in \"negative efficacy\" , i.e. those vaccinated are at a higher risk of infection. This was in the context of the later subvariants of Omicron as reported in an observatio nal study 22,072,550 SARS- CoV-2 cases99. 13.2. The authors state: \"The vaccine effectiveness (VE) for the third dose was in negative since December 20, 2021, with a significantly increased proportion of SARS-CoV2 cases hospitalizations and deaths among the vaccinated; a nd a decreased proportion of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths among the unvac cinated.\" 13.3. In is acknowledged that epidemiological data interpretation is both challenging and complicated because there are confounding variables to consider such as age, gender, vaccination status and co-morbidities. The re is also the added complexity of consideration of the definition of \"fully vaccinate d\" as this varies depending on vaccine schedules. There remains the lack of distinction b etween someone hospitalised or dying \"with\" COVID versus someone hospitalised or dying \"due to\" COVID and often those dying within 14 days of vaccination are often considered as \"unvaccinated\". Overall, however, this large study suggests a negat ive vaccine efficacy, which is of great concern. 13.4. The main reason for this negative vaccine efficacy has been mainly ascribed to the fact that the Omicron strain of viruses which we are exp eriencing now are considerably different to the original Wuhan strain and subsequen t Delta strain. Those individuals vaccinated with the gene- based 'vaccines' based on the Wuhan strain of virus are paradoxically more susceptible to Omicron infection . 98 Riemersma, K.K. et Vaccination: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.31.21261387v6.full -text 99 Increasing SARS-CoV-2 cases, hospita lizations and deaths among the vaccinated elderly populations during the Omicron (B.1.1.529) va riant surge in UK medRixiV preprint https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.28.22276926v2 The Time of Covid 37 13.5. Stanford University researchers100 found that \"prior vaccination with Wuhan -Hu-1-like antigens followed by infection with Alpha or Delta variants gives rise to plasma antibody responses with apparent Wuhan- Hu-1-specific imprinting manifesting as relatively decreased responses to the variant viru s epitopes compared with unvaccinated patients infected with those variant v iruses .\" Basically, these researchers are saying that vaccination with the cu rrent COVID- 19 'vaccines' will lead to a diminished ability to protect from infection b y the newer variants. 13.6. Pivotal epidemiological data which is useful in determining vaccine effectiveness versus time is published by \"Our World in Data\", a non-profit organisation based in the United Kingdom.101 This organisation uses data sourced from Johns Hopk ins University Center for Systems Science and Engineeri ng (CSSE). 13.7. The data below plots the rate (cases per mill ion) of confirmed COVID-19 cases by selected country versus time (and is updated regula rly). COVID-19 cases by selected country versus time 13.8. This same data can be used to represent the 7 -day rolling average of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Australia. 100 Roltgen, K et al (March 2022) Immune imprinting, breadth of variant recognition, and germinal cen ter response in human SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination . Cell https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0092- ation The Time of Covid 38 7-day rolling average of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Australia 13.9. COVID-19 vaccination commenced in Australia e arly in 2021. While the both absolute number and percent of the population COVID vaccinat ed increased rapidly for countries during 2021 and into 2022, the data shows both the rate and absolute number of confirmed COVID-19 cases markedly increas ed towards the end of 2021. This worldwide data demonstrates a failure of the C OVID- 19 'vaccines' to prevent infection and transmission of the disease. 13.10. This data strongly suggests that commencing in 2022 the COVID-19 vaccines have substantially lost the ability to prevent infection and transmission of the virus, despite high rates of vaccine uptake in the population. Th is provid es evidence of the futility of vaccine mandates. 13.11. All epidemiological and health statistical d ata requires careful interpretation as definitions may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdict ion and health protocols can impact the interpretation of the data. However, without e vidence to the contrary, the above data appears to provide a compelling evidence of a negative vaccine efficacy. In other words, COVID-19 vaccinated individuals are more lik ely to be infected with the current strain of the COVID-19 virus and be admitted to hos pital than compared to non- vaccinated individuals . Similar observations have been made in other count ries. 13.12. As mentioned earlier, a major contributing f actor to this phenomenon may be due to the fact that since early 2022, the dominant varian t of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is The Time of Covid 39 Omicron102 (see graph below) whereas the current COVID- 19 'vaccines' are constructed to produce antibodies towards the origi nal Wuhan strain . Share of SARS-CoV-2 sequences that is the Omicron va riant by country 14. The COVID- 19 'Vaccines' Do Not Provide a Similar and Acceptable Risk/Benefit Across All Age Groups irrespective of indi vidual Clinical Status including Natural Immunity 14.1. Mandatory vaccination by its very nature assu mes that a therapeutic agent produces a similar risk and a similar benefit for all indivi duals. However, this is never the case. Therapeutics should always be prescribed with a con sideration of the particular clinical status of the individual, which is why prescribing information always contains specific warnings and contraindications of use in relation t o age, health status etc. Drugs are never prescribed on a \"one size fits all\" basis. P rescribing a drug and ignoring the particular clinical circumstances of an individual is not good medical practice. 14.2. Natural immunity plays an important role in C OVID-19. There is no evidence to suggest that COVID-19 gene-based 'vaccination ' offers superior protection from COVID-19 as compared to natural immunity. Indeed, many believe the reverse is true. 102 Source: GISAID, via CoVariants.org as presented by Our World in Data up to 11 July 2022 https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases The Time of Covid 40 14.3. In acknowledgement of the important role of n atural immunity, even Bill Gates, perhaps the most prominent vaccine proponent, speak ing at the Munich Security Conference reported 23 February 2022103, admitted that \"the virus itself, particularly the variant c alled Omicron, is a type of vaccine\" . 14.4. The important role of natural immunity from b oth a personal and societal point of view needs to be recognised. This societal natural immu nity was commonly referred to as 'herd immunity ' and was initially widely considered important to l imit the impact of the virus. 14.5. Conventional wisdom suggests that natural imm unity following COVID-19 infection provides a high level of durable protection from re -infection in many ways superior to \"vaccination\" because natural immune r esponse is a multifaceted immune response directed against a number of components including t he envelope, the membrane, the nucleocapsid and the spike within the virus - unlike the immune response produced by gene- based 'vaccines' which only direct the pro duction of specific antibodies only towards the virus Spike Protein. 14.6. It has been likely that hundreds of millions of people have recovered from COVID-19. Numerous scientists have found that natural immunit y offers a decreased risk of re- infection and extremely low rates of hospitalisatio n in relation to repeat infection104. 14.7. A study in Qatar found that 'natural infection appears to elicit strong protecti on against reinfection with an efficacy ~95% for at least seven months '105. 14.8. The UK study by Hall et al, with funding from the UK Government, reported a similar level of protection due to natural immunity106. 14.9. A study in Austria found that the frequency o f re-infection from COVID-19 caused hospitalisation in only five out of 14,840 (0.03%) p eople and death in one out of 14,840 (0.01%)107. 14.10. In many ways, natural immunity protection wi ll be superior to the protection afforded by gene-based COVID- 19 'vaccines'. In such circumstances, voluntary or mandatory 103 Published in Locke (johnlocke.org) - Mitch Kokai, (23 February 2022): Bill Gates Gives Omicron More Credit Than Vaccines in Battling COVID. https://www.johnlocke.org/bill- gates-gives-omicron-more-credi Op-Ed: Quit Ignoring Natur al COVID Immunity \u2014 Antibody testing and proof of prior infection can allow more people to return to norm al Medpage Today, 28 May 2021. www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/92836 ; 150 Plus Research Studies Affirm Naturally Acquired Immunity to Covi d-19: Documented, https://brownstone.org/articles/79-research-studies-affirm-natural ly-acquired-immunity- SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positivity protects against reinfection for at l east seven months with 95% efficacy. eClinicalMedicine, Part of The Lancet Discovery Science, Vol 35, M ay 2021, 100861 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100861 106 Hall, V.

There is no scientific theoretical ba sis or reliable evidence to suggest that a person with natural immunity might benefit from a dministration of a Provisionally Approved gene-based COVID- 19 'vaccine' while the 'vaccine' itself has significant adverse effects and no long-term safety data to sup port its use. 14.11. A retrospective observational study of 124,5 00 individuals, conducted during the Delta wave of SARS-CoV-2 compared two groups: people who had not been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and received a 2-dose regi men of the Pfizer COVID- 19 \"vaccine\" and previously infected individuals who had not bee n vaccinated108. Individuals who had been vaccinated had a 13-fold g reater chance of breakthrough infection compared to re-infection in the non-vacci nated group. 14.12. The conclusion of the authors was: 'Naturally acquired immunity confers stronger protection against infection and symptomatic diseas e caused by the Delta variant of SARS -CoV-2, compared to the BNT162b2-2 [Pfizer COVID- 19 'vaccine'] dose vaccine-induced immunity '. 14.13. While the current SARS-CoV-2 variant is Omicr on, in the absence of data to the contrary, these data provide a compelling case to s upport the importance of natural immunity in protecting against SARS-CoV-2 infection . 14.14. The Swedish drug regulator is regarded as on e of the most respected regulatory agencies and they have recently reversed its recomm endation on the administration of COVID- 19 'vaccines' to adolescent children as they do not see any clear benefit in COVID-19 vaccination. According to a Reuters news release in Stockholm on 27 January 2022, Sweden decided against recommending C OVID- 19 'vaccines' for children aged 5-11, the Swedish Health Agency said that the benefits did not outweigh the risks: 'With the knowledge we have today, with a low risk for serious disease for kids, we don't see any clear benefit with vaccinati ng them '109. 14.15. It is reported that children in the populati on are at a substantially lower risk of developing COVID- 19.110 14.16. In addition, it has been suggested that a hi gh proportion of children in the population have acquired natural immunity which offers better protection from infection as compared to vaccination. As above, a large study d uring the Delta wave found vaccinated individuals had a 13-fold greater chance of breakthrough infection than unvaccinated individuals had of being re-infected. 108 Gazit, S et al (2022) Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (S ARS-CoV-2) Naturally Acquired Immunity versus Vaccine-induced Immunity, Reinfections versus Brea kthrough Infections: A Retrospective Cohort Study.

Nature Biotechnology: Vol 40, March 2022, 319-324 s://doi.org/10 The Time of Covid 42 Conclusion The introduction and worldwide use of COVID-19 gene -based 'vaccines ' has been associated, in the short term, with far more deaths , illnesses, injuries, and disabilities than any other therapeutic agent in the history of medicine. Due to the total lack of any long-term safety data, the potential future iat rogenic effects (including neurological, immunological and carcinogenic effect s) may be even more devasting. Despite initial claims, the COVID-19 gene-based 'vaccines ' have now been shown to possess disappointing clinical efficacy - they neit her prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection nor do they prevent transmission of the virus; any immunological protection wanes rapidly and, coincident with the emergence of the O micron variant, evidence of negative vaccine efficacy is being reported in many countries including Australia. In light of widely reported emerging and compelling evidence, t here appears to be little scientific or clinical justification to support vac cine mandates as a health policy. The latest hospital admission statistics do not sup port the claim that unvaccinated individuals are more at risk of serious COVID-19 di sease, hospitalisation or death. Excess non-COVID-19 related deaths coincident with the introduction of the gene- based 'vaccines ' are now being reported by many countries, and sugg est a surge in heart attack and stroke among both the young, adole scents and middle age individuals (especially males). Advocating the worldwide use of a new class of seri ous COVID-19 gene-based 'vaccines ' never before deployed, and advocated for use in he althy individuals of all ages regardless of clinical status (eg. natural imm unity, pregnancy etc), with relatively little short-term safety data and no long-term safe ty data, is neither prudent or necessary and defies the Precautionary Principle. The knowledge that the synthetic mRNA in both the Pfize r and Moderna vaccines can enter the nucleus of human liver cells in culture, raises the serious questions about genotoxicity and carcinogenicity, and adverse impac t on future generations. Disturbing safety signals regarding fertility and miscarriages are emerging. Given the statistically or virtually nil risk of se rious COVID-19 in general affecting children aged 6 months to 11 or 12 years of age and the clear and significant risk of serious adverse effects including myocarditis, peri carditis and death in this age group - there seems to be little benefit to be gained by v accinating these children. Considerable scientific, clinical and statistical e pidemiological data and understanding has been acquired since the introduction (on a prov isional basis only) of the investigational COVID-19 gene- based \"vaccines\" . Many of the initial ambitious claims and assumed perceptions regarding the safety and effica cy of these serious therapeutics have now been invalidated and it is no w time to review and reconsider the utility of these products in light of the known unprecedented level of serious adverse reactions and death attributed to their use . The urgency for this review cannot be overestimated given the current and potential future impact on the health and wellbeing of all Au stralians. Phillip M. Altman The Time of Covid 43 Appendix A Abbreviated Curriculum Vitae - Dr Phillip Altman Dr Phillip Altman has expertise in the areas of clinical medical research and pharmaceutical drug regulatory affairs in Australia. Holding the degrees Bachelor of Pharmacy (Hons), and Master of Science an d Doctor of Philosophy, Phillip's doctorate concerned the development new of cardioton ic drugs with lower intrinsic toxicity, compared to existing drugs including their chemical synthesis and testing in various animal models. Phillip has worked primarily within the Australian pharmaceutical industry since 1 974 in relation to clinical trial design, management, and reporting in relation to obtaining new dr ug approvals, deali ng with the Secretary of the Department of Health, and the Therapeutic Goo ds Administration ( TGA ). After many years working within multinational pharmaceutical companies, Philli p later became a senior industry pharmaceutical consultant through his contract research company, Pharmaco Pty Ltd., which provided both clinical trial and regulatory consultant services to the Au stralian pharmaceutical industry, which focussed his experience in critically evaluating clinical trial safety and efficacy data, as submitted in complex new drug dossiers for international r egulatory purposes. This work saw Phillip consulted by more than half of the multinational pharma ceutical companies in Australia, in various capacities, with a focus on drug regulatory affairs. Phillip founded the Association of Regulatory and Clinical Scientists (ARCS), which includes more than 2,000 scientists, clinicians, and associated health professionals involved in both clinic al trial and regulatory affairs, in Australia and New Zealand, where ARCS contin ues to be the foremost educational forum for both industry and government (including the TGA ) personnel, involved in clinical trials and regulatory affairs. Phillip's experience involves more than 100 clinical trials (covering Phases I,II, III a nd IV, i.e. from first administration to animals, then man, to post-approval trials), and a similar number of new drug applications, TGA appeals, and applications to modify existing approvals. In co llaboration with the TGA and on behalf of pharmaceutical companies, Phillip also directed 2 major drug with drawals in relation to public safety. More recently Phillip has been a senior clinical trial and regulatory affairs advisor to an Australian company which has developed a live virus for the treatment of m elanoma.

The TGA reports record that there were: a 1,470 Adverse Events in 5-11 year olds following 2.2M doses of Pfizer Va ccine. The report https://www.tga.gov.au/periodic/covid- 19-vaccine-weekly-safety- report- b 129,995 Adverse Events in all ages following 59,431,403 doses of Covid-19 V accines.

Adverse events include side effects to medicines and vac- cines, and problems or incidents involving medical devices. b) Examples of adverse events are any unfavourable and unintended si gn, symptom or dis- ease associated with the use of a therapeutic good. c) All Adverse events referred to in this document relate to vaccines. d) Adverse Events reported to the TGA have been classified by MedDRA cla ssification which includes Organ affected and type of reaction. One Adverse Ev ent case can affect many organs and reaction types can include many MedDRA Classifications. e) Adverse events are defined by the Australian institute of Health and Welfare as 'incidents in which harm resulted to a person receiving health care' . There is no definition included on the TGA web site. f) Importantly, an adverse event is not always caused by the therapeutic good itself. The occurrence of an adverse event does not necessarily mean that there is something wrong with the therapeutic good. Ages: Children: Individuals whose ages are 5-11 years. Babies/infants: 0-4years Unspecified: Age is left blank or marked with a hyphen - Adolescents: 12-18 Adults 19 years and over Covid-19 Vaccines: There are 4 vaccines that are being administered in Australi a. They include: Pfizer Comirnaty Covid-19 vaccine Covid-19 Vaccine DAENs database record for Covid-19 Vaccine Type Not Specifi ed. The Time of Covid 46 *In searches up to 31 Dec 2021, I have searched for 4 vaccines onl y, because Novavax, or Nuvaxovid has only been approved for use in Australia from 20 Jan 2022 for people 18 years and over. On 25 July the provisional approval was extended to 12-17year olds . Database of Adverse Event Notifications (DAEN) : \"The TGA receives Adverse Event reports associated with medicines and medical devices. These reports come from a wide range of sources, including members of the public, general practitioners, nurses , other health professionals and the therapeutic goods industry and are\" stored in an online database. Source: https://www.tga.gov.au/database-adverse-event-notifications-daen Deaths : Associated with the TGA reporting, this refers to the number of c ases where death was a reported outcome following immunisation from the DAEN website. It should be noted that this does not necessarily imply causality. Also, to determine de aths in TGA DAENs website is quite a convoluted process because the death MedDRA item category ha s been removed and so one cannot simply search for deaths. MedDRA Classification : The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) is an internationally used set of terms relating to medical conditions, medi cines and medical devices. Refer to some items below for reference: Please find a complete listing of MedDRA items using the followi ng link . https://1drv.ms/b/s!Al71AGIGLVVzgUj3L1lBYHafccTF?e=sKvJS2 Pfizer Vaccine: is the Comirnaty Covid-19 Vaccine as described in DAENs for all age groups. The Pfizer Vaccine was provisionally approved Covid-19 Vaccine for 5- 11 year olds. It was approved by the TGA on 5 December 2021. Roll out of the Pfizer Vaccine for 5-11 year olds commenced on or about 10 January 2022.

KEY POINTS TO NOTE 3.1 In SECTION 1, all the questions relating to the COVID-19 vaccines ask for figures for each COVID vaccine type from date of approval to the report date. While the work underlying this report was begun by me around 6 Januar y 2022, the data I collected was for 2021, and as such, I have a hard end to the year 20 21 (31 Dec 2021). Further, it appears that when the database is searched for eac h vaccine type from date of approval to end of 2021, and then when one adds the results, I do not get the same answer as I do when I search the entire database, all at once, using all 4 vaccines and the dates 1 Jan 2021 and 31 Dec 2021. For simplicity, I have used this search as my master data sear ch. All the COVID results will balance to that master data (I cannot explain why this phenomenon exists but suffice it to say, it goes to data integrity). I will demonstrate this in the following report. A search for Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna and unspecified, reve als the following information: Pfizer 25/01/2021 to 31/12/2021 No. of cases 52,695 No. of cases with a single suspected medicine 51,641 No. of cases where death was a reported outcome 264 Source: Appendix 2.2 - DAEN Results for Individual COVID Vaccines (Including Unspecified T ype) with Index, page 2- 10 AstraZeneca 16/02/201 to 31/12/2021 No. of cases 43,874 No. of cases with a single suspected medicine 43,108 No. of cases where death was a reported outcome 439 The Time of Covid 48 Source: Appendix 2.2 - DAEN Results for Individual COVID Vaccines ( Including Unspecified Type) with Index, page 11-19 Moderna (Spikevax) 09/08/2021 to 31/12/2021 No. of cases 3,234 No. of cases with a single suspected medicine 3,180 No. of cases where death was a reported outcome 7 Source: Appendix 2.2 - DAEN Results for Individual COVID Vaccines ( Including Unspecified Type) with Index, page 20-28 Unspecified COVID vaccines 01/01/2021 to 31/12/2021 No. of cases 465 No. of cases with a single suspected medicine 446 No. of cases where death was a reported outcome 25 Source: Appendix 2.2 - DAEN Results for Individual COVID Vaccines ( Including Unspecified Type) with Index, page 29-37 Total for all COVID vaccines plus unspecified COVID vaccines is: No. of cases 100,268 No. of cases with a single suspected medicine 98,375 No. of cases where death was a reported outcome 735 It is important to note that when I search for all COVID vaccines including unspecifi ed for the period 01/01/2021 to 31/12/2021 I get: No. of cases: 100,180 No. of cases with a single suspected medicine 98,399 No. of cases where death was a reported outcome 733 The Time of Covid 49 Source: Appendix 2.1 - DAEN Results for COVID Vaccine (Including Unspe cified Type), page 1 So, I have elected to use this as our master COVID data. 3.2 In the entirety of this report, whenever I refer to deaths ass ociated with the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) reporting, I am referring to the number of c ases where death was a reported outcome from the Database of Adverse Event Notifications ( DAEN) website. 3.3 In Section 2 of this report: a The data in this report is dated from 1 February 2021 when the Covid-19 Vaccines became available until to 8 June 2022, being the last date the DEANs da ta was updated and when I was briefed to provide this further report. b The data was extracted by me from the TGA DAENs system over thre e days: Wednesday 22 June 2022; Thursday 23 June 2022; and Friday 24 June 2022. c Despite the TGA website stating that its numbers are up to da te as at 8 June 2022, which is 2 weeks before 22 June (first day of data extraction), and 9 J une (second day of data extraction), the same search of the data on Wednesday 22 June and the n Thursday 23 June produces different numbers. This is an issue I have identified i n my previous reports. d The TGA safety reports contain further information than the DAENs da tabase, such as vaccine doses. I also used the TGA safety reports to cross check the r esults obtained from DAENs. e The TGA safety report as at 9 June 2022 includes data predominantly up t o the 5 June 2022. The numbers in DAENs and those in the TGA safety report for Adve rse Events are comparable, I summarise the TGA safety report Adverse Events by vaccine doses further in my response under Item 5 below. 3.4 All questions that I have answered have been advised by a letter of instruction from the instructing legal experts. The questions are integrated into the document. 3.5 Underreporting. a) As reporting to the TGA Daen's database is voluntary there is a qu estion regarding data coverage. The Time of Covid 50 b) It is globally accepted that there is significant underreporting of adverse events to all voluntary and spontaneous reporting systems. However, the true extent of underre- porting is not known. c) Whilst not perfect, the suspected underreporting to the DAEN system c an be approxi- mately validated by referring to the Ausvax website and then using their publicly availa- ble information on the number of adverse events that they are reporting within 3-7 days of vaccines being administered. Source: Ausvax - https://ausvaxsafety.org.au (Monitors adverse events that occur within 3-7 days after vaccination) d) The comparison above suggests that underreporting to the DAEN websit e is at least 90%: that is, they are reporting a maximum of 10% of adverse eve nts and not reporting some 90% of adverse events (as a minimum). 3.6 Appendices. Throughout this document you will see many references to append ices. These appendices amount to many hundreds of pages and as such are not include d with this document.

The Time of Covid 51 SECTION 1: A COMPARISON OF ADVERSE EVENTS RELATED SPECIFICALLY TO THE COVID- 19 VACCINES AND NON-COVID-19 VACCINES FROM 1 JAN 1971 TO 31 DEC 2021. Pa ges 4-19 of original document. The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) receives reports of adver se events associated with medicines and medical devices in Australia. That data it collects is accessible via the Database of Adverse Event Notifications (DAEN) on the TGA website. Please use the DAEN data, and only that data, to answer the following questions, except where otherwise sta ted. In answering the below questions, please indicate the relevant pages of the DAEN data which you have used in order to answer each question: 1.

For the three following vaccines which have been provisionally approved by the TGA in relation to Covid-19, being; a. Pfizer; b. AstraZeneca; and c. Moderna; i) How many reports of adverse events were made between the date eac h vaccine was provisionally approved and the date of your report? Please set out the proces s by which you have come to your view. My Answer: Initially, I started searching by COVID vaccine type, howeve r, I soon realized that searching by individual COVID vaccine type from date of provi sional approval, to the end of 2021, and adding them up did not give the same result as the search if all were done together and I used the blanket dates 1 Jan 2021 t o 31 Dec 2021. I determined to go with the 4 vaccine types and the blanket dates a s our master data (as per intro to report). The number of adverse events in total for the 4 vaccines from 1 Jan 2021 to 31 Dec 2021 was 100,180 cases, no of cases with a single suspect ed medicine were 98,399 and no of deaths were 733. (You can see that the i nformation from each vaccine type is incomplete. It is also inconsistent with the 4-vaccine approach). See search results below: The Time of Covid 53 Source: Appendix 2.1 - DAEN Results for COVID Vaccine (Including Unspe cified Type) COMIRNATY COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer): 52,934 reports of adverse events COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca: 43,912 reports of adverse events Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna): 3,386 reports of adverse events The Time of Covid 54 Sources: DAEN Search Engine: https://apps.tga.gov.au/PROD/DAEN/daen-report.aspx Appendix 1 - DAEN Bundle (System Organ Class) with Index 20.01.22 On the DAEN search engine, select the vaccine on the \"medicine\" field. Adjust the date range accordingly. Here, I am using the 31st of December 2021 as t he end date and the start date is the date of provisional approval for t he Covid-19 vaccine in question. ii) How many reports of death were made between the date each vaccine w as provision- ally approved and the date of your report? Please set out the process by which you have come to your view. My Answer: COMIRNATY COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer): 265 cases where death was a reported outcome COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca: 439 cases where death was a reported outcome Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna): 7 cases where death was a reported out- come The data was taken from Appendix 1 and totals 711 cases where death was a reported outcome. Note that this is for the three (3) aforementioned vaccines only. However, as per the DAEN search engine, there is a fourth type of COVID vaccine, medicine name: COVID-19 Vaccine (TNS) .This stands for Type Not Specified. I included this upon pulling out information and found a total of 733 cases where death was a reported outcome, as opposed to the total of 711 which is th e sum of only three (3) COVID vaccines. Actually, I also ran the unspecified vaccine by itself and I found that when I added that to the above individual vaccines I re ported 735 deaths, and not 733. I have elected to use the 733 as our master data.

Has there been a significant increase in adverse event re ports when comparing all other vaccines in the DAEN to Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna? Please set out the process by which you have come to your view. My Answer: Yes, there has been a significant increase in adverse ev ents. Comparing the search results on DAEN, the non- COVID vaccines are at 19,330 adverse events from 1971 until 2021 (50-year range), whereas the COVID-vaccines in the year 2021 alone already had a tot al of 100,180 reported adverse events. Refer to Appendix 2 - DAEN results for COVID Vaccine (includin g Unspecified type). Refer to search results presented in questions 1 and 2.

Has there been a significant increase in reports of death when comparing all other vaccines in the DAEN to Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna? Please set out the proc ess by which you have come to your view. My Answer: Yes, there has been a significant increase in cases where de ath was a reported outcome. Comparing the search results on DAEN, the non-COVID vaccines are at 59 case s where death was a reported outcome from 1971 until 2021 (50-year range), whereas the COVID-vacci nes in the calendar year 2021 alone already had a total of 733 cases where death was a reported outcome. Refer to search resu lts presented in questions 1 and 2. I present this data in t he following chart from 2010: Sources: Appendix 1 - DAEN Bundle (System Organ Class) with Index 20.01.22 Appendix 2.1 - DAEN results for COVID Vaccine (including Unspecified type) Appendix 3 - Annual Tally of Non-COVID Adverse Events and Deaths 1971-2021 The Time of Covid 57 5. How much more likely is it for an adverse event to be reported t o the TGA from Pfizer, AstraZeneca and/or Moderna than it is from all other vaccines in the DAEN comb ined? Please set out the process by which you have come to your view. My Answer: From 2010 to 2020 the likelihood of someone having an Adverse Event as the result of a vaccine was of the order of 1 in every 10,000 doses. It is 1.1 number of do ses using the incomplete number of doses data (see Graph 1) and 0.9 using an estimate for total do ses (see Graph 2). In 2021 as the result of COVID vaccinations, I can now expect 23 Adverse Events in every 10, 000 doses. I set this data out in the below charts: Graph 1 - Labelled data is based on incomplete data for total non-COVID cases Sources: No. of adverse events: Appendix 3 - Annual Tally of Non-COVID Adverse Events and Deaths 1971-2021 No of COVID vaccine doses: Appendix 6 - No. of COVID Doses by Vaccine No of non-COVID vaccine doses: Surveillance of Adverse Events following immunization, annual reports for 2010 to 2019 The Time of Covid 58 Graph 2 - Labelled data uses an estimate for total non-COVID doses Sources: No. of adverse events: Appendix 3 - Annual Tally of Non-COVID Adverse Events and Deaths 1971-2021 No of COVID vaccine doses: Appendix 6 - No. of COVID Doses by Vaccine No of non-COVID vaccine doses: Appendix 5 - Surveillance of Adverse Events following immunization, annual reports for 2010 to 2019 Refer to search results presented in questions 1 and 2. Note that the non-COVID vaccine adverse events are from 1971 to 2021, while COVID vaccine adverse events are for t he year 2021 only. 6. How much more likely is it for a death to be reported to the TGA f rom Pfizer, AstraZeneca and/or Moderna than it is from all other vaccines in the DAEN combined? Pleas e set out the process by which you have come to your view. My Answer: The number of cases where death was a reported outcome to th e TGA, associated with a non-COVID vaccine from 2010 to 2021 was 29, or an average of 2.4 deaths p er annum vs 733 in 2021 associated with COVID vaccines. This is an increase of 30,442%. It is represe nted by the below chart. The Time of Covid 59 Sources: No. of deaths: Appendix 3 - Annual Tally of Non-COVID Adverse Events and Deat hs 1971- 2021 Given the size of the increase reported above, another source of deaths associated with vaccines has been located. The Surveillance of Adverse Events following Imm unisation in Australia, Annual Reports from 2010 to 2019, report 31 deaths associated with vaccines ov er 10 years which is an average of 3.1 deaths per annum. (Author: The Department of Health, Aus tralian Federal Government) It would appear that the TGA reports of death and the annual rep ort referred to above are inconsistent in the no. of deaths that they report. (Both are, however, reporting on the deaths as a result of adverse events and claim to use the DAEN TGA website as their source of information.) From 2010 to 2021, the likelihood of death from an adverse rea ction to a vaccine was 0.22 to 0.27 per million doses (approx. 1 death every 4 million doses). As a result of COVID doses in 2021, I have had 17 deaths per million doses. As a consequence, COVID vaccines are 69 times more likely to result in death as a reported outcome than traditional vaccines. (If I use the death figures from the Surveillance of Adverse Events after immunisation in Australia, annual report s from 2010 to 2019, referred to previously, this shows around 0.463 deaths per million do ses or 1 death every 2 million doses. This makes the covid vaccines 36 times more likely to result in d eaths as aa reported outcome than traditional vaccines).

How do deaths reported to the TGA from Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna compare to deaths recorded in association with Covid-19 itself? You may also refer to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics to answer this question. Please set out the process by which you have come to your view. My Answer: The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reports 773 deaths from COVID from January to October 2021 albeit 2 months short of the entire year. In the last 2 w eeks of January 2022,when this report was being written, the number of cases where death was a reported outcome, associated with a COVID vaccine in 2021 have increased from 704 to 733. This is reported in th e below chart: The Time of Covid 61 Sources: Appendix 1 - DAEN Bundle (System Organ Class) with Index 20.01.22 . See page 1400 which indicates that 1671 people died from covid Jan 202 to 31 Oct 2021.Refer below to ABS sourc e Appendix 2.1 - DAEN Results for COVID Vaccine (Including Unspecified Type) The ABS reports that the total deaths from COVID Jan 2020 to Oct 2021 were 1671. They also report that the total deaths from COVID in 2020 were 832. Therefore, the total deaths from COVID Jan 2021 to Oct 2021 were 773.

What are the most significant categories, or types, of advers e events reported to the TGA for all vaccines except for Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna from 1971 to t he date of this report? Please set out the process by which you have come to your view. My Answer: The top 5 Categories of Deaths by Organ reported to the TGA from 1971 to 2021 non-COVID were General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions, Nervous System Disorders, Infections and Infestations, Investigations (undefined by TGA), Respiratory T horacic and Mediastinal. The top 5 represent 57% of all Deaths by Organ reports. This is represen ted in the chart below: The Time of Covid 63 Source: Appendix 4 - Instructions_TGA DAEN Download (*note: to create the above cha rt, I had to work out how to download the data into a format that allowed us to analyse it; the steps I took are in Appendix 4; the data was sourced from DAEN TGA website on Tue, 25th of Jan 2022) 9. What are the most significant categories, or types, of adverse events reported to the TGA for Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna? How many more categories, or types, of adver se event reports have been reported to the TGA in relation to Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moder na than have been reported for all other vaccines combined? Please set out the process by which you have c ome to your view. My Answer: The Top 5 Categories of Deaths by Organ reported to the T GA for 2021 related to Covid vaccines were Nervous System Disorders, General Disorders and Administrative Sit e Conditions, Respiratory Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders, Cardiac Disorders and Injury Poison ing and Procedural complications. These categories account for 58.8% of all Death by organ repo rts. This is represented in the chart below: The Time of Covid 64 Source: Appendix 4 - Instructions_TGA DAEN Download (*note: to create the above cha rt, I had to work out how to download the data into a format that allowed us to analyse it; the steps I took are in Appendix 4; the data was sourced from DAEN TGA website on Tue, 25th of Jan 2022) 10. Have there been any significant increases in categories, or t ypes, of adverse event reports to the TGA since the provisional approval of Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna? My Answer: The number of adverse events reported to the TGA in 2021 i s 100,180 relating to COVID vaccines. In summarizing these adverse events by disease type, one event can be reported as many diseases/conditions. I now have a list of 3,122 disease types, more than double the number of different conditions that were reported prior to COVID vaccines. See table b elow: The Time of Covid 65 Source: Appendix 4 - Instructions_TGA DAEN Download (*note: to create the above char t, I had to work out how to download the data into a format that allowed us to analyse it; the steps I took are in Appendix 4; the data was sourced from DAEN TGA website on Tue, 25th of Jan 2022) The number of non-COVID adverse events reported to the TG A from 1971 to 2021 was 19,330. In summarizing these adverse events by disease type, one event can be reported as many diseases/conditions. For the last 20 years, I have bee n able to incorporate all conditions in a list of 1,492 different conditions. See table below: Source: Appendix 4 - Instructions_TGA DAEN Download (*note: to create the above char t, I had to work out how to download the data into a format that allowed us to analyse it; the steps I took are in Appendix 4; the data was sourced from DAEN TGA website on Tue, 25th of Jan 2022) The Specific Reaction types associated with Adverse Events of Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, Immune Thrombocytopenia, Thrombosis with Thrombocytop enia Syndrome, and Abortions and Spontaneous miscarriages have been analysed to compare their frequency for non-COVID 1971 to 2021 and Covid 2021 vaccines. All categories increased signifi cantly.

Do you have any final observations on comments to make as the result of undertaking this analysis. As a final remark, I note that in addition to generating m ore adverse events and generating more disease types, COVID vaccines are generating more Reaction Report s than seen before by traditional vaccines. In fact, the TGA is seeing more Adverse Event Reaction reports in 2021, than they have seen in the entire 50 years since 1971. (This is separate and different to Adverse Event Cases. It says that each Non-Covid 1971 to 2021 Adverse Event Case would have included on average of 2.27 Med DRA reactions per event. Covid Vaccines 2021 include an average of 3.26 reactions per event . Refer table above for examples of Major Organ classes and Adverse Event Reaction Types.)

Section 6 onwards. The Time of Covid 69 6.0 ITEM 1 Since 10 January 2022, how many Deaths are reported in DAENs in 5-11 yea r olds following Covid- 19 Vaccines? 6.1 Since 10 January 2022, 135 deaths following Covid-19 Vaccines are r ecorded on the DAENs database for all ages. 6.2 Since 10 January 2022, 5 Deaths were reported in children 5-11 in DAENs since the roll-out of Covid-19 Vaccines began for this age group. 6.3 Details of these Deaths are set out in Table 1 below. Five s creenshots are included in Schedule B to this report. These screenshots are from the DAENs we bsite for each death reported in the 5-11 age cohort since the roll out of the Pfizer Vac cine began. Each screenshot (on the left hand side) confirms \"death as a reported outcome\" from \"a single medicine\", namely a Covid -19 Vaccine.

At the time of producing this report, 90 of the 135 Deaths sampled (14 or 15.6%) had no age specified. It is possible that some of these Deaths where the age is not specified m ay also fall within the age cohort 5-11 years. I have included a further discussion of these Deaths in my response to Item 3 (below). The Time of Covid 70 7.0 ITEM 2 Since 10 January 2022, how many Adverse Events were reported in the D AENs associated with 5- 11 year olds following Covid-19 Vaccines? 7.1 Since 10 January 2022, 27,742 Adverse Events were reported following C ovid-19 Vaccines in all ages. This number includes the 135 Death reports reported in Item 1 (6.1) above (in all ages). 7.2 In 5-11 year olds, 1,390 Adverse Events have been reported by DAENs follow ing Covid- 19 Vaccines. 7.3 Table 2 below shows breakdown of Adverse Events from 10 January 2022 to 8 J une 2022 by Covid-19 Vaccine type for 5-11 year olds (and includes Deaths). The Pfizer and Spikevax (Maderna) Vaccine are the only provisionally approved Covid-19 Vaccines for the 5-11 and 6- 11 year old group, respectively. I am not able to explain why there are 5-11 year olds that received Covid-19 Vaccines not provisionally approved for their age. Vaccine Type Number of Reports (Cases) Adverse Events Number of cases with a single suspected medicine Number of cases where Death was a reported outcome Pfizer Comirnaty 1371 N/A 5 Astra N/A 0 Nuvaxovid - 0 Total 1390 N/A 5 Table 2: number reports of Adverse Events in 5-11 year olds foll owing Covid-19 Vaccines since 10 January 2022 7.4 DAENs also records 28 Adverse Events in 5-11 year olds prior to 10 Ja nuary 2022, when the Covid-19 Vaccines were rolled out to this age group. I have included detai ls about these 28 reports in Schedule C to this report. These reports begin at 29 Septemb er 2021. I cannot explain why children received the Covid-19 Vaccines before they were provisionally approved and rolled out to this age group. Nor can I explain why they received Covi d-19 Vaccines not provisionally approved for this age group. 7.5 Note, since 10 January 2022 there are 5,221 Adverse Events in DAENs where no age range is specified. Absent that detail from the DAENs database, it is not possible for me to say whether there are more Adverse Events in the 5-11 year old age cohort. I have de alt with this further under Item 4 below.

The DAENs Adverse Event Database does not advise which events are seri ous. The TGA does report on serious adverse events in their weekly reports. The specific adver se events which are considered serious are not specifically identified. As such, in absence of information from the TGA, I have assessed and interpret the following reaction types to be potentially serious. This is my assessment as this detail is not information provided in DAENs or by the TGA.

The Time of Covid 74 8.0 ITEM 3 Since 1 February 2021, how many Deaths were reported in the DAENs in adolescents and adults following Covid-19 Vaccines? 8.1 Since 1 February 2021, 884 Deaths have been reported in the DAENs databa se following Covid- 19 Vaccines (all ages). 8.2 After removal of the Deaths in 5-11 year olds, that leaves 879 Deaths reported in DAENs. 8.3 As mentioned, in Item 1 above, there are a number of reports of Dea th in DAENs where no age is specified. I have reviewed in excess of 90% of these deat hs and 147 of them had no age detailed against them. That is 17.6% of the Deaths did not have an a ge specified, so I have extrapolated that to be 156 Deaths out of the total 884 Deaths (a ll ages) where no age is specified.

I do not use this number for my analysis. 9.3 Separately, I have reviewed the Adverse Events by Covid-19 Vacci ne and have set these figures out in Table 7 below.

This number is different to the number of Adverse Events I tallied up by each Covid- 19 Vaccine type by 393 events. From the data, I am not able to explain this difference. 9.5 The number of Deaths I tallied up by Covid-19 Vaccine type is 885 and is also different to the number of Deaths reported on the DAENs website (884) (screenshot 1 above). From the data, I am not able to explain this difference. 9.6 Of the 132,384 Adverse Events reported since 1 February 2021 in DAENs, ther e were 22,007 Adverse Events that were unspecified in terms of age. I have set these out in Table 8.

These Adverse Events therefore could cover any age . 9.8 Links to the original source data set to derive unspecified Adverse Ev ents follows.

This includes the 28 Adverse Events in 5- 11 year olds which occurred prior to 10 January 2022 (as detailed in Schedule C to this report). Removing the Adverse Events in 5-11 year olds prior to roll out of Covid-19 Vaccine s to this age group, leaves 108,542 and 108,935 Adverse Events in adolescents and adults. The Time of Covid 78 9.11 There are no COVID-19 Vaccines that have been provisionally approved or otherwise for children <5, therefore I am unable to explain why there are a number of Adverse Events reported in 0-4 year olds. The Time of Covid 79 10.0 ITEM 5 Where the TGA safety report numbers differ from DAENs, I have also be en asked to comment on the reporting in the TGA safety reports for Adverse Events following Covid- 19 Vaccines with respect children 5-11 and all ages. 10.1 In my previous reports, I have compared reporting of Adverse Events in NON -covid Vaccines to Covid-19 Vaccines. On 31 January 2022, the likelihood of someone ha ving an Adverse Event as the result of a NON-Covid Vaccine (between 2010-2020) was 1 i n every 10,000 doses. With Covid-19 Vaccines the likelihood of someone having an Adverse Events as the result of the vaccine was 23 Adverse Events per 10,000 doses as at 31 January 20 22. This is highlighted in Table 10 below. 10.2 Using the TGA's more up to date data, the likelihood now of someone having a n adve rse event as the result of a Covid-19 vaccine as at 5 June 2022 is 21.87 Adverse Events per 10,000 doses. This is 20 times worse than Non-covid times and is reasonably consist ent with the Adverse Events I was reporting on at the end of January 2022.
