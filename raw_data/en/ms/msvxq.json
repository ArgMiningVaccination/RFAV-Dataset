Your world effectively becomes a breeding ground for illness. Hopefully, you'll skate through the holiday season cold free, but in case you come down with a bout of the flu, here are nine natural remedies to help you heal: 1) Wash your hands - often!

You can also mix ground mustard seed with water to make a paste. Rub it on your chest to break up congestion. 6) Prepare this lemon, honey and ginger mixture to store away before your cold hits. All three ingredients have serious healing power and when combined, make for a fabulous therapeutic tea. 7) Heat up with a [humidifier](http://www.besthealthmag.ca/best-you/home-remedies/natural-home-remedies-colds-and-flu/).
