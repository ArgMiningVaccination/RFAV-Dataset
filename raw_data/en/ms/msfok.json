Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-1 INTRODUCTION TO EPIDEMIOLOGY Recently, a news story described an inner-city neighborhood's concern about the rise in the number of children with asthm a. Another story reported the revised recommendations for who should receive influenza vaccine this year. A third story discussed the extensive disease-monitoring strategies being implemented in a city recently affected by a massive hurricane. A fourth story describe d a finding published in a leading medical journal of an association in workers expo sed to a particular chemical and an increased risk of cancer. Each of these ne ws stories included interviews with public health officials or researchers who called themselves epidemiologists. Well, who are these epidemiologists, and what do they do? What is epidem iology? This le sson is intended to answ er those questions by describing what epidem iology is, how it has evolve d and how it is used today, and what som e of the key m ethods and concepts are. The focus is on epidem iology in public health practice, that is, the kind of epidem iology that is done at health departm ents. Objectives After studying this lesson and answering the questions in the exercises, you will be able to: ! Define epidemiology ! Summarize the historical evolution of epidemiology ! Name some of the key uses of epidemiology ! Identify the core epidemiology functions ! Describe primary applications of epidemiology in public health practice ! Specify the elements of a case definition and state the effect of changing the value of any of the elements ! List the key features and uses of descriptive ep idemiology ! List the key features and uses of analytic epidemiology ! List the three components of the epidemiologic triad ! Describe the different modes of transmi ssion of communicable di sease in a population Major Sections Definition of 1-52 Natural History and Spectrum of Disease .................................................................................. 1-59 Chain of Infection 1 Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-2 Students of journalism are taught that a good news story, whether it be about a bank robbery , dramatic rescue, or presidential candidate's speech, must include the 5 W's: what, who, where, when and why (sometime s cited as why/how). The 5 W's are the essential components of a news story becau se if any of the five are missing, the story is incomplete. The same is true in characterizing epidemiologic events, whether it be an outbreak of norovirus among cruise ship passengers or the use of mammograms to detect early breast cancer. The difference is that epidemiologists tend to use synonyms for the 5 W's: diagnosis or health event (what), person (who), place (where), time (when), and causes, risk factors, and modes of transmission (why/how). Definition of Epidemiology The word epidemiology comes from the Greek words epi, meaning on or upon, demos , meaning people, and logos , meaning the study of. In other words, the word epidem iology has its roots in the study of what befalls a popu lation. Many d efinition s have been pro posed, but the following definition capture s the underlying principles and public health spirit of epidem iology: Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and deter minants of health-related states or events in specified populations , and the application of this study to the control of health problems.1 Key terms in this definition reflect some of the important principles of epidemiology. Study Epidem iology is a scientific disc ipline with s ound methods of scientific inquiry at its founda tion. E pidem iology is data-driven and relies on a system atic and unbi ased approach to the collection, analysis, and interpretation of da ta. Basic epidem iologic methods tend to rely on careful observat ion and use of valid com parison groups to assess whether what was observed, such as the num ber of cases of disease in a particular area during a particular time period or the frequency of an exposure am ong persons with disease, differs from what might be expected. However, epidem iology also draws on methods from other scientific fields, including biostatistics and inform atics, with biologic, econom ic, social, and behavioral sciences. In fact, epidem iology is often de scribed as the basic science of public health, and for good reason. F irst, epidem iology is a quantitative discipline that relies on a working knowledge of probability, statistics, and sound research m ethods. Second, epidem iology is a m ethod of causal reasoning based on developing and testing hypotheses grounded in such scientific fields as biology, behavioral sciences, physic s, and ergonom ics to explain health-related behaviors, st ates, and events. However, epidemiology is not just a research activity but an integral component of public health, provi ding the foundation for directing practical and appropriate public h ealth action based on this science and causal reasoning.2 Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-3 Distribution Epidem iology is concerned with the frequency and pattern of health events in a population: Frequency refers not only to the number of health events such as the number of cases of meningitis or diabetes in a population, but also to the relationship of that num ber to the size of the population. Th e resulting rate allows epidemiologists to compare disease occurrence across different populations. Pattern refers to the occurrence of health-related events by time, place, and person. Time patterns may be annual, seasonal, weekly, daily, hourl y, weekday versus weekend, or any other breakdown of time that may influence disease or injury occurrence. Place patterns include geographic variation, urban/rural differences, and location of work sites or schools. Persona l characteristics in clude demographic factors which may be related to risk of illness, injury, or disability such as age, sex, marital status, and socioeconom ic status, as well as behaviors and environm ental exposures. Characterizing health events by time, place, and person are activities of descriptive epidemiology, discussed in more detail later in this lesson. Determinant: any factor, whether event, characteristic, or other definable entity, that brings about a change in a health condition or other defined charact eristic.1 Determi nants Epidem iology is also used to search for determinants , which are the causes and other factors that influence the occurrence of disease and other health-related events. Epidemiologists assume that illness does not occur randomly in a population, but happens only when the right accum ulation of risk factors or determ inants exists in an individual. To search for these determinants, epidemiologists use analytic epidem iology or epidem provide the \"Why\" and \"How\" of suc h events. They assess whether groups with different rates of disease differ in their demographic characteristics, genetic or immunologic make-up, behaviors, environm ental exposures , or other so-called potential risk factors. Ideally, the findings provide sufficient evidence to direct prom pt and effective public health control and prevention measures. Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-4 Healt h-related states or event s Epidemiology was originally focused exclusively on epidemics of communicable diseases3 but was subsequently expanded to address endem ic communicable diseases and non-communicable infectious diseases. By the middle of the 20th Century, additional epidemiologic methods had been developed and applied to chronic diseases, injuries, birth defects, maternal-child health, occupational health, and environmental health. Then epidemiologists began to look at behaviors related to health and well-being, such as amount of exercise and seat belt use. Now, with the recent explosion in molecular methods, epidemiologists can m ake important strides in examining genetic markers of disease risk. Indeed, the term health- related states or events may be seen as anything that affects the well-being of a population. Nonetheless, m any epidem iologists still use the term \"disease\" as shorthand for the wide range of health -related states and events that are studied. Specified populations Although epidem iologists and di rect health-care providers (clinicians) are both concerned with occurrence and contro l of disease, they differ greatly in how they view \"the patient.\" The clinician is concerned about the health of an individual; the epidem iologist is concerned about the collective health of the people in a comm unity or popula tion. In other words, the clinician's \"patient\" is epidemiologist's \"patient\" efore, the clinician and the epidem iologist have different responsibilities when faced with a person with illness. For example, when a patient with diarrheal disease presents, both are interested in establishing the correct diagnosis. However, while the clinician usually focuses on treating and caring for the individual, the epidemiologist focuses on identifying the exposure or source that caused the illness; the number of other persons who m ay have been similarly exposed; the potential for further spread in the community; and interventions to prevent additional cases or recurrences. Application Epidem iology is not just \"the study of\" health in a population; it also involves applying the knowle dge gained by the studies to community-based practice. Like the practice of medicine, the practice of epidem iology is both a science and an art. To m ake the proper diagnosis and prescribe appropriate treatment for a patient, the clinician combines medica l (scientific) knowledge with experience, clinical judgment, and understanding of the patient. Similarly, the epidemiologist uses the scientific methods of Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-5 descriptive and analytic epidem iology as well as experience, epidemiologic judgment, and understanding of local conditions in \"diagnosing\" the health of a comm unity and proposing appropriate, practical, and acceptable public health interventio ns to control and prevent disease in the community. Summary Epidemiology is the study (scientific, system atic, data-driven) of the distribution (frequency, pattern) and determ inants (causes, risk factors) of health-related states and events (not just diseases) in specified populations (patient is community, individuals view ed collectively), and the application of (sin ce epidemiology is a discipline w ithin public health) this study to th e control of health problems.

The contributions of some of these early and more recent thinkers are described below.5 Circa 400 B.C. Epidemiol ogy's roots are nearly 2500 years old. Hippocrates attempted to explain disease occurrence from a rational rather than a supernatural viewpoint. In his essay entitled \"On Airs, Waters, and Places,\" Hippocrates suggested that environmental and host factors such as behaviors might influence the developm ent of dise ase. 1662 Another early contributor to epidem iology was John Graunt , a London haberdasher and councilm an who published a landm ark analysis of mortality data in 1662. This publication was the first to quantify patterns of birth, deat h, and disease occurrence, noting disparities between m ales and fe males, high infant m ortality, urban/rural differences, and seasonal variations.5 1800 William Farr built upon Graunt's work by systematically collecting and analyzing Britain's mortality statistics. Farr, considered the father of modern vital statistics and surveillance, developed many of the basic practices used today in vital statistics and disease class ificatio n. He concentrated his efforts on collecting vital statistics, assem bling and evalua ting those data, and reporting to responsible health authorit ies and the general public.4 1854 In the m id-1800s, an anesthesiologist nam ed John Snow was conducting a series of investigations in London that warrant his being considered the \"f ather of field epidemiology.\" Twenty years before the developm ent of the m icroscope, Snow conducted studies of cholera outbreaks both to discover the cause of disease and to prevent its recurrence. Because his work illustrates the classic sequence from descriptive epidem iology to hypothesis generation to hypothesis testing (analytic epidem iology) to application, two of his investigations will be described in detail. Snow conducted one of his now fa mous studies in 1854 when an epidemic of cholera erupted in the Golden Square of London.5 He Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-8 began his investigation by determining where in this area persons with cholera lived and w orked. He marked each residence on a map of the area, as show n in Figure 1.1. Today, this type of map, showing the geographic distribution of cases, is called a spot map. Figure 1.1 Sp ot map of deaths f rom cholera in Gold en Sq uare area, Lond on, 1854 (redrawn from original) Source: Snow J. Snow on cholera. London: Humphrey Milford: Oxford University Press; 1936. Because Snow believed that water was a source of infection for cholera, he marked the location of water pumps on his spot map, then looked for a relationship between the distribution of households with cases of cholera and the location of pumps. He noticed that more case households clustered around Pum p A, the Broad Street pum p, than around Pump B or C. When he questioned residents who lived in the Golden Square area, he was told that they avoided Pump B because it was grossly contaminated, and that Pum p C was located too inconveniently for most of them. From this infor mation, Snow concl uded that the Broad Street pump (Pump A) was the primary source of water and the most likely source of infection for most persons with cholera in the Golden Square area. He noted with curi osity, however, that no cases of cholera had occurred in a two-bloc k area just to the east of the Broad Street pum p. Upon inve stigating, Snow found a brewery located there with a deep well on the premises. Brewery workers got their water from this well, and also received a daily portion of Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-9 malt liquor. Access to these uncontaminated rations could explain why none of the brewery's em ployees contracted cholera. To confirm that the Broad Street pump was the source of the epidem ic, Snow gathered inform ation on where persons with cholera had obtained their water. Consum ption of water from the Broad Street pum p was the one common factor among the cholera patients. After Snow presented his findings to m unicipal officials, the handle of the pump was removed and the outbreak ended. The site of the pump is now marked by a plaque mounted on the wall outside of the appropriately nam ed John Snow Pub. Figure 1.2 John Snow Pub, London Source: The John Snow Society [Internet]. London: [updated 2005 cited 2006 http://www.johnsnowsociety.org/. Snow's r eexam ined data from 1854 cholera outbreak in London. During a cholera epidem ic a few years earlier, Snow had noted that districts with the highest death rates were serviced by two water companies: the Lambeth Com pany and the Southwark and Vauxhall Company. At that tim e, both com panies obtained water from the Thames River at intake points that were downstream from London and thus susceptible to contamination from London sewage, which was discharged directly into the Tham es. To avoid contam ination by London sewage, in 1852 the Lambeth Com pany m oved its intake water works to a site on the Tham es well upstream from London. Over a 7-week period during the summ er of 1854, Snow com pared cholera mortality among districts that received water from one or the other or both water companies. The results are shown in Table 1.1. Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-10 Table 1.1 Mortality from Cholera in the Districts of London Supplied by the Southw ark and Vauxhall and the Lambeth Companies, July 9-August 26, 1854 Distri cts with Water Popula tion Numb er of Dea ths Cholera Death Rate Supplied By: (1851 Census) from Cholera per 1,000 Population Southwark and Vauxhall Only 167,654 844 5.0 Lambeth Only 19,133 18 0.9 Both Companies 300,149 652 2.2 Source: Snow J. Snow on cholera. London: Humphrey Milford: Oxford University Press; 1936. The data in Table 1.1 show that the cholera death rate was more than 5 times higher in districts served only by the Southwark and Vauxhall Company (intake downstr eam from London) than in those served only by the Lambeth Company (intake upstream from London). Interestingly, the mortality rate in districts supplied by both companies fell between the rates for districts served exclusively by either company. These data were consistent with the hypothesis that water obtained from the Tham es below London was a source of cholera. Altern atively, the populations supplied by the two companies m ay have differe d on other factors that affected their risk of cholera. To test his water supply hypothesis, Snow focused on the districts served by both companies, because the households within a district were generally comparable except for the water supply company. In these districts, Snow identified the water supply com pany for every house in which a death from cholera had occurred during the 7-week period. Table 1.2 shows his findings. Table 1.2 Mortality from Cholera in London Related to the Water Supply of Individual Houses in Districts Served by Both the Southwark and Vauxhall Company and the Lambeth Company, July 9- August 26, 1854 Water Supply of Population Number of Deaths Cholera Death Rate Individual House (1851 Census) from Cholera per 1,000 Population Southwark and Vauxhall Only 98,862 419 4.2 Lambeth Only 154,615 80 0.5 Source: Snow J. Snow on cholera. London: Humphrey Milford: Oxford University Press; 1936. This study, demonstrating a higher death rate from cholera among households served by the Southwark and Vauxhall Com pany in the mixed districts, added support to Snow's hypothesis. It also established the sequence of steps used by current-day epidemiologists to investigate outbreaks of disease. Based on a characterization of the cases and population at risk by time, place, and person, Snow developed a testab le hypothesis. He then tested his hypothesis with a m ore rigorously designed study, ensuring that the groups to be com pared were comparable. After this study, Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-11 efforts to control the epidemic were directed at changing the location of the water intake of the Southwark and Vauxhall Com pany to avoid sources of contamination. Thus, with no knowledge of the existence of microorganisms, Snow demonstrated through epidemiologic studies that water could serve as a vehicle for transmitting cholera and that epidemiologic inform ation could be used to direct prom pt and appropriate public health action. 19th and 20th centuries In the mid- and late-1800s, epidemiological methods began to be applied in the investigation of disease occurrence. At that time, most investigators focused on acute infectious diseases. In the 1930s and 1940s, epidem iologists extended their m ethods to noninfectious diseases. T he period since W orld War II has seen an explosion in the developm ent of research methods and the theoretical underpinni ngs of epidem iology. Epidem iology has been applied to the entire range of health-related outcom es, behaviors, and even knowledge and attitudes. The studies by Doll and Hill linking lung cancer to smoking6and the study of cardiovascular disease among residents of Framingham, Massachusetts7 are two exam ples of how pioneering researchers have applied epidemiologic methods to chronic disease since World War II. During the 1960s and early 1970s health workers applied epidemiologic methods to eradicate naturally occurring smallpox worldwide.8 This was an achievem ent in applied epidem iology of unpreceden ted proportio ns. In the 1980s, epidem iology was extende d to the studies of injuries and violence. In the 1990s, the re lated fields of m olecular and genetic epidemiology (expansion of epidemiology to look at specific pathways, molecules and genes that influence risk of developing disease) took root. Meanwhile, infectious diseases continued to challenge epidem iologists as new infectious agents emerged (Ebola virus, Hum an Immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/ Acquired Im munodeficiency Syndrom e (AIDS)), were identified (Legionella, Severe Acute Syndrom e (SARS)), or changed (drug-resistant Mycob acterium tuberculosis, Avian influenza). Beginning in the 1990s and accelerating after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, epidem iologists have had to consider not only natural transmission of infectious organism s but also deliberate spread through biologic warfare and bioterrorism. Today, public health workers th rough out the world accept and use epidemiology regularly to characterize the health of their communities and to solve day-to-day problems, large and small. Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-12 Uses Epidemiology and the information generated by epidemiologic methods have been used in many ways.9 Som e common uses are described below. Assessing the community's health Public health officials responsible for policy developm ent, implementation, and evaluation use epidemiologic information as a factual framework for decision m aking. To assess the health of a population or comm unity, relevant sources of data m ust be identified and analyzed by person, place, and time (descriptive epidemiology). ! What are the actual and p otential health problems in the community? ! Where are they occurring? ! Which populations are at increased risk? ! Which problem s have declined over tim e? ! Which ones are increasing or have the potential to increase? ! How do these patterns relate to the level and distribution of public health services available? More detailed data m ay need to be collected and analyzed to determine whether health services are available, accessible, effective, and efficient. For exam ple, public health officials used epidemiologic data and methods to identify baselines, to set health goals for the nation in 2000 and 2010, and to m onitor progress toward these goals.10-12 Making individual decisions Many individuals m ay not realize that they use epidem iologic information to make daily decisions affecting their health. When persons decide to quit smoking, climb the stairs rather than wait for an elevator, eat a salad rather than a cheeseburger with fries for lunch, or use a condom , they may be influenced, consciously or unconsciously, by epidem iologists' assessm ent of risk. Since World War II, epidemiologists have provided inform ation related to all those decisions. In the 1950s , epidemiologists reported the increased risk of lung cancer am ong sm okers. In the 1970s, epidemiologists documented the role of exercise and proper diet in reducing the risk of heart disease. In the mid-1980s, epidemiologists identified the increased risk of HIV infection associated with certain sexual and drug-related behaviors. These and hundreds of other epidem iologic findings are directly relevant to the cho ices people m ake every day , choices that affect their health over a lifetime. Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-13 Completing the clinical picture When investigating a disease out break, epidem iologists rely on health-care providers and laborat orians to establish the proper diagnosis of individu al patients. But epidemiologists also contribute to physicians' understandi ng of the clinical picture and natural history of disease. For exam ple, in late 1989, a physician saw three patients with unexplai ned eosinophilia (an increase in the num ber of a specific type of white blood cell called an eosinophil) and myalgias (sever e muscle pains). Although the physician could not m ake a definiti ve diagnosis, he notified public health authorities. Within weeks, epidemiologists had identified enough other cases to characterize the spectrum and course of the illness that came to be known as eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome.13 More recently, epidemiologists, clinicians, and researchers around the world have collaborated to ch aracterize SARS, a diseas e caused by a new type of coronavirus that emerged in China in late 2002.14 Epidem iology has also been instrum ental in characterizing many non-a cute diseases, such as the numerous conditions associated with cigarette smoking \u2014 fro m pulmonary and heart disease to lip, throat, and lung cancer. Searching for causes Much epidemiologic research is devoted to searching for causal factors that influence one's risk of disease. Id eally, the goal is to identify a cause so that appropria te public health action might be taken. One can argue that epidem iology can never prove a causal relationship between an exposure and a disease, since much of epidem iology is based on ecologic reasoning. N evertheless, epidemiology often provides enough information to support effective action. Exam ples date from the rem oval of the handle from the Broad St. pump following John Snow's investigation of cholera in the Golden Square area of London in 1854,5 to the withdrawal of a vaccine against rotavirus in 1999 after epidem iologists found that it increased the risk of intussusception, a potentially life-threatening condition.15 Just as often, epidem iology and laboratory scie nce converge to provide the evidence needed to establish causation. For example, epidemiologists were able to identify a variety of risk factors during an outbreak of pneum onia among persons attending the American Legion Convention in Philadelphia in 1976, even though the Legionnaires' bacillus was not identified in the laboratory from lung tissue of a person who had di ed from Legionnaires' disease until almost 6 months later.16 Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-14 Exercise 1.2 In August 1999, epidemiologists learned of a cluster of cases of encephalitis caused by West Nile virus infection among residents of Queens, New York. West Nile virus infection , transmitted by mosquitoes, had never before been ident ified in North Ameri ca. Describe how this information might be used for each of the followin g: 1. Assessing the community's health 2. Making decisions about individu al patients 3. Documenting the clinical picture of the illness 4. Search ing for cause s to prevent future outbre aks Check your answers on page 1-81 Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-15 Core Epidemiologic Functions In the mid-1980s, five major tasks of epidemiology in public health practice were identified: public health surveillance, field investigation, analytic studies, evaluation, and linkages.17 A sixth task, policy development, was recently added. These tasks are described below. Public health surveil lance Public health surveillance is the ongoing, system atic collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissem ination of health data to help guide public health decision m aking and action. Surveillance is equivalent to monitoring the pulse of the community. The purpose of public health surveillance, which is sometimes called \"inform ation for action,\"18 is to portray the ongoing patterns of disease occurrence and disease potential so that investigation, control, and prevention measures can be applied efficiently and effectively. This is accomplished through the system atic collection and evaluation of morbidity and m ortality reports and other relevant health inform ation, and the dissemination of these data and their interpretation to those involved in disease control and public health decision making. Figure 1.3. Surveillance Cycle Morbidity and mortality repor ts are common sources of surveillance data for local and state health departments. These reports generally are submitted by health-care providers, infection control practitioners, or laboratories that are required to notify the health department of any patient with a reportable disease such as pertussis, meningococcal meningitis, or AIDS. Other sources of health-related data that are used for surveillance include reports from investigations of individual cases and disease clusters, public Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-16 health program data such as immunization coverage in a community, disease registri es, and health surveys. Most often, surveillance relies on simple systems to collect a limited amount of information about each case. Although not every case of disease is reported, health officials regularly review the case reports they do receive and look for patterns among them. These practices have proven inva luable in detecting problems, evaluating program s, and gui ding public health action. While public health surveillance traditionally has focused on communicable diseases, surveillance systems now exist that target injuries, chronic diseases, geneti c and birth defects, occupational and potentially environm entally-related diseases, and health behaviors. S ince September 11, 2001, a variety of systems that rely on electronic reporting have been developed, including those that report daily emergency department visits, sales of over-the-counter medicines, and worker absenteeism .19,20 Because epidemiologists are likely to be called upon to design and use these and other new surveillance systems, an epidemiologist's core competencies must include design of data collection instrum ents, data m anage ment, descriptive methods and graphi ng, interpretation of data, and scientific writing and presentation. Field investigation As noted above, surveillance provid es information for action. One of the first actions that results from a surveillance case report or report of a cluster is investigation by the public health departm ent. The investigation m ay be as lim ited as a phone call to the health- care provider to confirm or clar ify the circumstances of the reported case, or it m ay involve a field investigation requiring the coordinated efforts of dozens of people to characterize the extent of an epidem ic and to identify its cause. The objectiv es of such investigations also vary. Investigations often lead to the identification of additional unreported or unrecognized ill persons who might otherwise continue to spread infection to others. For exam ple, one of the hallmarks of investigations of persons with se xually transmitted disease is the identification of sexual partners or contacts of patients. When interviewed, many of these contacts are found to be infected without knowing it, and are given treatm ent they did not realize they needed. Identification and treatm ent of these contacts prevents further spread. For som e diseases, investigations m ay identify a source or vehicle of infection that can be controlled or eliminated. For example, the Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-17 investigation of a case of Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection usually focuses on trying to iden tify the vehicle, often ground beef but sometimes something more unusual such as fruit juice. By identifying the vehicle, investigat ors may be able to determ ine how many other persons m ight have already been exposed and how many continue to be at risk. When a commercial product turns out to be the culprit, public announcem ents and recalling the product may prevent many additional cases. Symbol of EIS Occasionally, the objective of an investigation may simply be to learn m ore about the natural histor y, clinical spectrum , descriptive epidem iology, and risk f actors of the disease before determ ining what disease intervention methods might be appropriate. Early investigations of the epidem ic of SARS in 2003 were needed to establish a case definition based on the clinical presentation, and to characterize the populations at risk by tim e, place, and person. As more was learned about the epidemiology of the disease and communicability of the virus, appropriate recomm endations regarding isolation and quarantine were issued.21 Field investigations of the type described above are som etimes referred to as \"shoe leather epidemiology,\" conjuring up images of dedicated, if haggard, epidem iologists beating the pavem ent in search of additional cases and clues regarding source and mode of transmission. This approach is commemorated in the symbol of the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS), CDC's training program for disease detectives \u2014 a shoe with a hole in the sole. Analytic studies Surveillance and field investigations are usually sufficient to identify causes, m odes of transm ission, and appropriate control and prevention measures. But sometimes analytic studies employing more rigorous m ethods are needed. Often the methods are used in combination \u2014 with surveillance and field investigations providing clues or hypotheses about causes and modes of transm ission, and analytic studies evaluating the credibility of those hypotheses. Clusters or outbreaks of disease frequently are investigated initially with descriptive epidem iology. The descriptive approach involves the study of disease incidence and distribution by time, place, and person. It includes the calculation of rates and identification of parts of the population at higher risk than others. Occasionally, when the association between expos ure and disease is quite strong, the investigation m ay stop when descriptive epidem iology is complete and control measures may be implemented immediately. John Snow's 1854 investigation of cholera is an example. More Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-18 frequently, descriptive studies, like case investigations, generate hypotheses that can be tested with analytic studie s. While some field investigations are conducte d in response to acute health problem s such as outbreaks, m any others are planned studies. The hallmark of an analytic epidemiologic study is the use of a valid comparison group. Epidemiologists must be skilled in all aspects of such studies, including design, conduct, analysis, interpretation, and communication of findings. ! Design includes determining the appropriate research strategy and study design , writing justifications and protocols, calculating sample sizes, deciding on criteria for subject selection (e.g., deve loping case definitions), choosing an appropriate comparison group, and designing questionnaires. ! Conduct involves securing appropriate clearances and approvals, adhering to appropr iate ethical principles, abstracting records, track ing down and interviewing subjects, collecting and handling specim ens, and managing the data. ! Analysis begins with describing th e characteristics of the subjects. It progresses to calcu lation of rates, creation of comparative tables (e.g., two-by-two tables), and computation of measures of association (e.g., risk ratios or odds ratios), tests of signifi cance (e.g., chi-square test), confidence intervals, and the like. Many epidemiologic studies require more advanced analytic techniques such as stratified analysis, regression, and modeling. ! Finally, interpretation involves putting the study findings into perspective, identifying the key take-hom e messages, and making sound recommendati ons. Doing so requires that the epidem iologist be knowledgeable about the subject matter and the strengths and weaknesses of the study. Evaluation Epidemiologists, who are accustomed to using systematic and quantitative approaches, have come to play an important role in evaluation of public health services and other activities. Evaluation is the process of determining, as system atically and objectively as possible, the relev ance, effectiven ess, efficiency, and impact of activities with respect to established goals.22 ! Effectiveness refers to the ability of a program to produce the intended or expected result s in the field; effectiveness differs fro m efficacy, which is the ability to produce results under ideal conditions. ! Efficiency refers to the ability of the program to produce Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-19 the intended results with a minimum expenditure of time and resources. The evaluation itself m ay focus on plans (form ative evaluation), operations (process evaluation), im pact (summ ative evaluation), or outcom es \u2014 or any combination of these. Evaluation of an immunization program, for example, might assess the efficiency of the operations, the proportion of the target population immunized, and the apparent impact of the program on the incidence of vaccine-preventable dis eases. Sim ilarly, ev aluation of a surveillance system might address operations and attributes of the system, its ability to detect cases or outbreaks, and its usefulness.23 Linkages Epidem iologists working in public health settings rarely act in isolation. In fact, field epidem iology is often said to be a \"team sport.\" During an investigati on an epidem iologist usually participates as either a member or the leader of a multidisciplinary team. Other team members may be laboratorians, sanitarians, infection control personnel, nurse s or other clinical staff, and, increasingly, com puter infor mation specialists. Many outbreaks cross geographical and jurisdictiona l lines, so co-investigators m ay be from local, state, or federal levels of government, academic institutions, clinical facilities, or the private sector. To prom ote current and future collaboration, the epidemiologists need to maintain relationships with staff of other agencies and institutions. Mechanisms for sustaining such linkages include official memoranda of understanding, sharing of published or on-line information for public health audiences and outside partners, and informal networking that takes place at professional meetings. Policy development The definition of epidem iology ends with the following phrase: \"...and the application of this study to the control of health problems.\" While some academically minded epidemiologists have stated that epidem iologists should stick to research and not get involved in policy developm ent or even m ake recommendations,24 public health epidemiologists do not have this luxury. Indeed, epidemiologists who understand a problem and the population in which it occurs are often in a uniquely qualified position to recomm end appropriate interventions. As a result, epidem iologists working in public health regularly provide input, testim ony, a nd recomm endations regarding disease control strategies, disease regul and health-care policy.

Counts ! Divides ! Compares The Epidemiologic Approach As with all scientific endeavors, the practice of epidem iology relies on a system atic approach. In very simple terms, the epidemiologist: ! Counts cases or health events, and describes them in term s of time, place, and person; ! Divides the number of cases by an appropriate denominator to calculate rates; and ! Compares these rates over tim e or for different groups of people. Before counting cases, however, the epidem iologist must decide what a case is. This is done by developing a case definition. Then, using this case definition, the epidemiologist finds and collects information about the case-patients. The epidem iologist then performs descriptive epidemiology by characterizing the cases collectively according to time, place, and person. To calculate the disease rate, the epidemiologist divides the number of cases by the size of the population. Finally, to determine whether this rate is greater than what one would norm ally expect, and if so to identify factors contributing to this increase, the epidemiologist compares the rate from this population to the rate in an appropriate comparison group, using analytic epidem iology techniques. T hese epidemiologic actions are described in more detail below. Subsequent tasks, such as repor ting the results and recomm ending how they can be used for public health action, are just as important, but are beyond the scope of this lesson. Defining a case Before counting cases, the epidem iologist must decide what to count, that is, what to call a case. For that, the epidem iologist uses a case definition. A case definition is a set of standard criteria for classifying whether a person has a particular disease, syndrom e, or other health condition. Some case definitions, p articularly tho se used for national surveillance, have been developed and adopted as national standards that ensure co mparability. Use of an agreed- upon standard case definition ensures that every case is equivalent, regardless of when or where it occurred, or who identified it. Furtherm ore, the num ber of cases or rate of disease identified in one time or place can be compared with the number or rate from another time or place. For example, with a standard case definition, health officials cou ld compare the n umber of cases of listeriosis that occurred in Forsyth County, North Carolina in 2000 with the number that occurred there in 1999. Or they could compare the rate of listeriosis in Fors yth County in 2000 with the national rate in Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-22 that same year. When everyone uses the same standard case definition and a difference is obser ved, the difference is likely to be real rather than the result of variation in how cases are classified. To ensure that all health departm ents in the United States use the same case definition s for surveillance, the Council of State an d Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), CDC, and other interested parties have adopted standard case definitions for the notifiable infectious diseases25. These definitions are revised as needed. In 1999, to address the need for common definitions and methods for state-level chronic d isease surveillan ce, CSTE, the Associatio n of State and Territorial Chronic Dise ase Program Directors, and CDC adopted standard definitions fo r 73 chronic disease indicators29. Other case definitions, particularly those used in local outbreak investigations, are often tailor ed to the local situation. For example, a case definition developed for an outbreak of viral illness might require laboratory confirmation where such laboratory services are available, but likely would not if such services were not readily available. Components of a case definitio n for outbreak investigations A case definition consists of clinical criteria and, sometimes, limitations on time, place, and person. The clinical criteria usually include confirmatory laboratory tests, if available, or combinations of sym ptoms (subjective com plaints), signs (objective physical findings), and other findings. Ca se definitions used during outbreak investigations are more likely to specify limits on time, place, and/or person than those used for surveillance. Contrast the case definition used for surveillan ce of listeriosis (see box below) with the case definition used during an investigation of a listeriosis outbreak in North Carolina in 2000.25,26 Both the national surveillance case definition and the outbreak case definition require a clinically compatible illness and laboratory confirm ation of Listeria monocytogenes from a normally sterile site, but the outbreak case definiti on adds restrictions on time and place, reflecting the scope of the outbreak. Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-23 Listeriosis \u2014 Surveillance Case Definition Clinical description Infection caused by Listeria monocytogenes , which may produce any of several clinical syndromes, including stillbirth, listeriosis of the newborn, meningitis, bacteriemia, or localized infections Laboratory cr iteria for diag nosis Isolation of L. monocytogenes from a normally sterile site (e.g., blood or cerebrospinal fluid or, less commonly, joint, pleural, or pericardial fluid) Case classif ication Confirmed : a clinically compati ble case that is laboratory confirmed Source: Cente rs for Disease Control and Preventio n.

Many case definitions, such as that shown for listeriosis, require laboratory confirm ation. This is no t always necessary, however; in fact, som e diseases have no distinctive laboratory findings. Kawasaki syndrome, for example, is a childhood illness with fever and rash that has no known cause and no specifically distinctive laboratory findings. Notice that its case definition (see box below) is based on the presence of fever, at least four of five specified clinical findings, and the lack of a m ore reasonable explanation. Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-24 Kawasaki Syndrome \u2014 Case Definition Clinical description A febrile illness of greater than or equal to 5 days' duration, with at least four of the five following physical findings and no other more reasonable explanation for the observed clinical findings: !

Criteria in case definitions A case definition m ay have severa l sets of criteria, depending on how certain the diagnosis is. For example, during an investigation of a possible case or outbreak of m easles, a person with a fever and rash might be classified as having a suspected, probable, or confirm ed case of m easles, depending on what evidence of m easles is present (see box below). Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-25 A case might be classified as suspected or probable while waiting for the laboratory results to become available. Once the laboratory provides the report, the case can be reclassified as either confirmed or \"not a case,\" depending on the laboratory results. In the midst of a large outbreak of a disease caused by a known agent, som e cases may be permanently classified as suspected or probable because officials may feel that running laboratory tests on every patient with a consistent clinical pictur e and a history of exposure (e.g., chickenpox ) is unnecessary and even wasteful. Case definitio ns Measles (Rubeola) \u2014 1996 Case Definition Clinical description An illness characterized by all the following: ! A generalized rash lasting greater than or equal to 3 days ! A temperature greater than or equal to 101.0 \u00b0F (greater than or equal to 38.3\u00b0C) ! Cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis Laboratory cr iteria for nosis ! Positive serologic test for measle s immunoglobulin M antibody, or ! Significant rise in measles antibody level by any standard serologi c assay, or ! Isolation of measles virus from a clinical specimen Case classif ication Suspected: Any febrile illness accompanied by rash Probable: A case that meets the clinical case definitio n, has noncontributo ry or no serologic or virologic testing, and is not epidemiolog ically linked to a confirmed case Confirmed : A case that is laboratory confirme d or that meets the clinical case definition and is epidemiologi cally linked to a confirmed case. (A laboratory-c onfirmed case does not need to meet the clinical case definition.) Comment: Confirmed cases should be reported to National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System. An imported case has its source outside the country or state. Rash onset occurs within 18 days after entering the jurisdiction, and illness cannot be linked to local transmission. Imported cases should be classified as: ! Internatio nal. A case that is imported from another country ! Out-of-State. A case that is imported from another state in the United States. The possibility that a patient was exposed within his or her state of residence should be exclud ed; therefore, the patient either must have been out of state continuo usly for the entire period of possible expos ure (at least 7-18 days before onset of rash) or have had one of the following types of exposure while out of state: a) face-to- face contact with a person who had either a probable or confirmed case or b) attendance in the same institution as a person who had a case of measles (e.g., in a school, classroo m, or day care center). An indigenous case is defined as a case of measles that is not imported . Cases that are linked to imported cases should be classified as indigenous if the exposure to the imported case occurred in the reporting state. Any case that cannot be proved to be impor ted should be classified as indigenous. Source: Centers for Disea se Control and Prevention.

Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-26 should not rely on laboratory culture results alone, since organism s are sometimes present without causing disease. Modifying case definitions Case definitions can also change over time as more information is obtained. The first case definiti on for SARS, based on clinical symptoms and either contact with a case or travel to an area with SARS transm ission, was published in CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMW R) on March 21, 2003 (see box below).27 Two weeks later it was modified slightly. On March 29, after a novel coronavirus was determ ined to be the causative agent, an interim surveillance case definition was published that included laboratory criteria for evidence of infection with the SARS- associated coronavirus. By June, the case definition had changed several more times. In anticipation of a new wave of cases in 2004, a revised and much more complex case definition was published in December 2003.28 CDC Preliminary Case Definition for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) \u2014 March 21, 2003 Suspected case Respiratory illness of unknown etiology with onset since February 1, 2003, and the following criteria: ! Documented temperature > 100.4\u00b0F (>38.0\u00b0C) ! One or more symptoms with respiratory illness (e.g., cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breath ing, or radiographic findings of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome) ! Close contact* within 10 days of onset of symptoms with a person under investigation for or suspected of having SARS or travel within 10 days of onset of symptoms to an area with documented transmission of SARS as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) * Defined as having cared for, having lived with, or having had direct contact with respirator y secretions and/or body fluids of a person suspected of having SARS. Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome-worldwide, 2003. MMWR 2003:52:226-8. Variation in case definitions Case definitions may also vary according to the purpose for classifying the occurrences of a disease. For example, health officials need to know as soon as possible if anyone has sym ptoms of plague or anthrax so that they can begin planning what actions to take. For such rare but potentially severe communicable diseases, for which it is important to identify every possible case, health officials use a sensitive case definition. A sensitive case definition is one that is broad or \"loose,\" in the hope of capturing Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-27 most or all of the true cases. For example, the case definition for a suspected case of rubella (Germ an measles) is \"any generalized rash illness of acute onset.\"25 This definition is quite broad, and would include not only all cases of rubella, but also m easles, chickenpox, and rashes due to other causes such as drug allergies. So while the advantage of a sensitive case definition is that it includes m ost or all of the true cases, the disadvantage is that it sometimes includes other illnesses as well. On the other hand, an investigator studying the causes of a disease outbreak usually wants to be certa in that any person included in a study really had the diseas e. That investigator will prefer a specific or \"strict\" case definition. Fo r instance, in an outbreak of Salmonella Agona infection, the investigators would be m ore likely to identify the source of the infection if they included only persons who were confirm ed to have been infected with that organism, rather than including anyone with acute diarrhea, because some persons may have had diarrhea from a different cause. In this setting, the only disadvantages of a strict case definition are the requirem ent that everyone with symptoms be tested and an underestim ation of th e total number of cases if some people with salm onellosis are not tested. Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-28 Exercise 1.4 Investigat ors of an outbreak of trichinosi s used a case definition with the following categories: Clinical Criteria Confirmed case: Signs and symptoms plus laboratory confirmati on Probab le case: Acute onset of at least three of the follow ing four features : myalgia, fever, facial edema, or eosino phil count greate r than 500/mm3 Possible case: Acute onset of two of the four features plus a physici an diagnosi s of trichinosis Suspect case: Unexplained eosinophilia Not a case: Failure to fulfill the criteria for a confirmed, probable, possible, or suspect case Time: Onset after October 1, 2004 Place: Metropolita n Atlanta Person : Any Using this case definition, assign the approp riate classification to each of the persons included in the line listing below.

These counts, us ually derived from case reports submitted by health-care workers and laboratories to the health departm ent, allow public health officials to determ ine the extent and patterns of disease occurrence by tim e, place, and person. They m ay also indicate clusters or outbreaks of disease in the community. Counts are also valuable for health planning. For example, a health official might use counts (i.e., numbers) to plan how many infection control isolation units or doses of vaccine m ay be needed. Rate: the number of cases divided by the size of the population per unit of time However, simple counts do not provide all the information a health department needs. For some purposes, the counts must be put into context, based on the population in which they arose. Rates are measures that relate the numbers of cases during a certain period of time (usually per year) to the size of the population in which they occurred. For exam ple, 42,745 new cases of AIDS were reported in the United States in 2002.30 This number, divided by the estim ated 2002 population, results in a rate of 15.3 cases per 100,000 population. Rates are particular ly useful for comparing the frequency of disease in different locations whose populations differ in size. For exam ple, in 2003, Pennsylvania had over twelve times as many births (140,660) as its neighboring state, Delaware (11,264). However, Pennsylvania has nearly ten times the population of Delaware. So a m ore fair way to compare is to calculate rates. In fact, the birth rate was greater in Delaware (13.8 per 1,000 wom en aged 15-44 years) than in Pennsylvania (11.4 per 1,000 women aged 15-44 years).31 Rates are also useful for comparing disease occurrence during different periods of tim e. For exam ple, 19.5 cases of chickenpox per 100,000 were reported in 2001 compared with 135.8 cases per 100,000 in 1991. In addition, rates of disease among different subgroups can be com pared to identify those at increased risk of disease. These so-called high risk groups can be further assessed and targeted for special interven tion. High risk groups can also be studied to identify risk factors that cause them to have increased risk of disease. W hile som e risk factors such as age and fam ily history of breast cancer may not be modifiable, others, such as smoking and unsafe sexual practices, are. Individuals can use knowledge of the modifiable risk factors to guide decisions about behaviors that influence their health. Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-31 The 5W's of descriptive epidemiology: ! What = health issue of concern ! Who = person ! Where = place ! When = time ! Why/ho w = causes, risk factors, modes of transmission Descriptive Epidemiology As noted earlier, every novice news paper reporter is taught that a story is incomplete if it does not describe the what, who, where, when, and why/how of a situati on, whether it be a space shuttle launch or a house fire. Epidemiologists strive for similar comprehensiveness in characterizing an epidemiologic event, whether it be a pandem ic of influe nza or a local increase in all- terrain vehicle crashes. Howeve r, epidem iologists tend to use synonyms for the five W's listed above: case definition, person, place, time, and causes/risk factors/modes of transm ission. Descriptive epidemiology covers time, place, and person . Com piling and analyzin g data by tim e, place, and person is desirable for several reasons. ! First, by looking at the data carefully, the epidemiologist becomes very familiar with the data. He or she can see what the data can or cannot reveal based on the variables available, its limitations (for example, the number of records with missing information for each important variable), and its eccentricities (for example, all cases range in age from 2 months to 6 years, plus one 17-year- old.). ! Second, the epidem iologist learns the extent and pattern of the public health problem be ing investigated \u2014 which months, which neighborhoods, and which groups of people have the most and least cases. ! Third, the epidemiologist creates a detailed description of the health of a population that can be easily communicated with tables, graphs, and maps. ! Fourth, the epidemiologist can identify areas or groups within the population that have high rates of disease. This information in turn provides important clues to the causes of the disease, and these clues can be turned into testable hypotheses. Time The occurrence of disease changes o ver tim e. Som e of these changes occur regularly, while others are unpredictable. Two diseases that occur during the same season each year include influenza (winter) and West Nile virus infection (August- September). In contrast, diseases such as hepatitis B and salmonellosis can occur at any time. For diseases that occur Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-32 seasonally, health officials can anticipate their occurrence and implement control and prevention measures, such as an influ enza vaccination campaign or mosquito spraying. For diseases that occur sporadically, investigators can conduct studies to identify the causes and modes of spread, and then develop appropriately targeted actions to control or prevent further occurrence of the disease. In either situation, displaying the patterns of disease occurrence by time is critical for monitoring disease occurrence in the community and for assessing whether the public health interventions made a difference. Time data are usually displayed w ith a two-dim ensional graph. The vertical or y-axis usually shows the number or rate of cases; the horizontal or x-axis shows the time periods such as years, m onths, or days. The num ber or rate of cas es is plotted over time. Graphs of disease occurrence over tim e are usually plotted as line graphs (Figure 1.4) or histograms (Figure 1.5). Figure 1.4 Reported Cases of Salmonellosis per 100,000 Population, by Year- United States, 1972-2002 Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Summary of notifiable diseases-United States, 2002. Published April 30, 2004, for MMWR 2002;51(No. 53): p. 59.

In: Surveillance Summaries, January 24, 2003. MMWR 2003;52(No. SS-1):1-26. Sometimes a graph shows the timing of events that are related to disease trends being displayed. For example, the graph may indicate the period of exposure or the date control measures were implemented. Studying a graph that notes the period of exposure may lead to insights into what may have caused illness. Studying a graph that notes the timing of control measures shows what impact, if any, the measures may have had on disease occurrence. As noted above, tim e is plotted along the x-axis. Depending on the disease, the time scale may be as broad as years or decades, or as brief as days or even hours of the day. For som e conditions \u2014 many chronic diseases, for example \u2014 epidemiologists tend to be interested in long-term trends or pa tterns in the number of cases or the rate. For other conditions, such as foodborne outbreaks, the relevant time scale is likely to be days or hours. Some of the common types of tim e-related graphs are further described below. These and other graphs are descri bed in more detail in Lesson 4. Secular (long-term) trends. Graphing the annual cases or rate of a disease over a period of years show s long-term or secular trends in the occurrence of the disease (Figure 1.4). Health officials use these graphs to assess the pr evailing direction of disease occurrence (increasing, decreasing, or essentially flat), help them Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-34 evaluate programs or make policy decisions, infer what caused an increase or decrease in the occurrence of a disease (particu larly if the graph indicates when related events took place), and use past trends as a predictor of future incidence of disease. Seasonality. Disease occurrence can be graphed by week or month over the course of a year or more to show its seasonal pattern, if any. Some diseases such as influe nza and West Nile infection are known to have characteristic seasonal distributions. Seasonal patterns m ay suggest hypotheses about how the infection is transmitted, what behavioral factors increase risk, and other possible contributors to the disease or condition. Figure 1.6 shows the seasonal patterns of rubella, influenza, and rotavirus. All three diseases display consistent season al distributions, but each disease peaks in different m onths - rubell a in March to June, influenza in Nove mber to March, and rotavirus in February to April. The rubella graph is striking for the epidem ic that occurred in 1963 (rubella vaccine was not available until 1969), but this epidemic nonetheless followed the seasonal pattern.

Seasonal Variation in Host Susceptibility and Cycles of Certain Infectious Diseases. Emerg Infect Dis. 2001;5:369-74. Day of week and time o f day. For som e conditions, displaying data by day of the week or tim e of day may be informative. Analysis at these shorter tim e periods is partic ularly appropriate for conditions related to occupational or environmental exposures that tend to occur at regularly scheduled inte rvals. In Figure 1.7, farm tractor fatalities are displayed by days of the week.32 Note that the number of farm tractor fatalities on Sundays was about half the number on the other days. The pattern of farm tractor injuries by hour, as displayed in Figure 1.8 peaked at 11:00 a.m., dipped at noon, and peaked again at 4:00 p.m . These patterns m ay suggest hypotheses and possible explanations that could be evaluated with further study.

To show the tim e course of a disease outbreak or epidemic, epidemiologists use a graph called an epidemic curve. As with the other graphs presented so far, an epidem ic curve's y- axis shows the number of cases, while the x-axis shows time as either date of symptom onset or date of diagnosis. Depending on the incubation period (the lengt h of time between exposure and onset of symptom s) and routes of transm ission, the scale on the x- axis can be as broad as weeks (for a very prolonged epidem ic) or as narrow as minutes (e.g., for food poisoning by chemicals that cause symptoms within minutes). Conventionally, the data are displayed as a histogram (which is similar to a bar chart but has no gaps between adjacent columns). Sometimes each case is displayed Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-37 as a square, as in Figure 1.10. The shape and other features of an epidemic curve can suggest hypotheses about the time and source of exposure, the mode of transmission, and the causative agent. Epidem ic curves are discussed in m ore detail in L essons 4 and 6.

Place Describing the occurrence of disease by place provides insight into the geographic extent of the prob lem and its geographic variation. Characterization by place refers no t only to place of residence but to any geographic location relevant to disease occurrence. Such locations include place of diagnosis or report, birt hplace, site of employm ent, school district, hospi tal unit, or recent travel destinations. The unit m ay be as large as a continent or country or as sm all as a street address, hospital wing, or operating room. Sometimes place refers not to a specific location at all but to a place category such as urban or rural, domestic or foreign, and institutional or noninstitutional. Consider the data in Tables 1.3 and 1.4. Table 1.3 displays SARS data by source of report, and reflects where a person with possible SARS is likely to be quarantined and treated.33 In contrast, T able 1.4 displays the same data by where the possible SARS patients had traveled, and reflects where transm ission may have occurred.

Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-39 Although place data can be shown in a table such as Table 1.3 or Table 1.4, a map provides a more striking visual display of place data. On a map, different num bers or rates of disease can be depicted using different shadings, colors, or line patterns, as in Figure 1.11. Figure 1.11 Mortality Rates for Asbestosis, by State, United States, 1968-1981 and 1982-2000 Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Changing patterns of pneumoconiosis mortality-United States, 1968-2000. MMWR 2004;53:627-32. Another type of map for place data is a spot map, such as Figure 1.12. Spot maps generally are used f or clusters or outbreaks with a limited number of cases. A dot or X is placed on the location that is most relevant to the disease of interest, usually where each victim lived or worked, just as John Snow did in his spot m ap of the Golden Square area of London (Figure 1.1). If known, sites that are relevant, such as probable lo cations of exposure (water pum ps in Figure 1.1), are usually noted on the map. Figure 1.12 Spot Map of Giardia Cases Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-40 Analyzing data by place can identify communities at increased risk of disease. E ven if the data canno t reveal why these people have an increased risk, it can help gene rate hypotheses to test with additional studies. For exam ple, is a community at increased risk because of characteristics of the people in the community such as genetic susceptibility, lack of immunity, ri sky behaviors, or exposure to local toxins or contam inated food? Can the increased risk, particularly of a communicable disease, be attributed to characteristics of the causative agent such as a particularly virulent strain, hospitable breeding sites, or availability of the vector that transmits the organism to humans? Or can the increased risk be attributed to the environment that brings the agent and the host together, such as crowding in urba n areas that increases the risk of disease transm ission from person to person, or more homes being built in wooded areas close to deer that carry ticks infected with the organism that causes Lyme disease? (More techniques for graphic presentation are discussed in Lesson 4.) \"Perso n\" attributes include age, sex, ethnicity/race, and socioeconomic status. Person Because personal cha racteristics m ay affect illne ss, organiz ation and analysis of data by \"person\" may use inherent characteristics of people (for example, age, sex, race), biologic characteristics (imm une status), acqu ired characteri stics (marital status), activities (occupation, leisure activities, use of medications/tobacco/drugs), or the conditions under which they live (socioeconom ic status, access to medical care). Age and sex are included in almost all data sets and are the two most commonly analyzed \"person\" characteristics. However, depe nding on the disease and the data available, analyses of other pers on variables are usually necessary. Usually epidemiologists begin the analysis of person data by looking at each variable separate ly. Sometimes, two variables such as age and sex can be examined simultaneously. Person data are usually displayed in tables or graphs. Age. Age is probably the single most important \"person\" attribute, because almost every health-related event varies with age. A number of factors that also vary with age include: susceptibility, opportunity for exposure, latenc y or incubation period of the disease, and physiologic respons e (which affects, among other things, disease development). When analyzing data by age, epid emiologists try to use age groups that are narrow enough to detect any age-related patterns that may be present in the data. For som e diseases, particularly chronic diseases, 10-year age groups m ay be adequate. For other diseases, 10-year and even 5-year age groups conceal important variations in disease occurrence by age. Consider the graph of pertussis Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-41 occurrence by standard 5-year age groups shown in Figure 1.13a. The highest rate is clearly among children 4 years old and younger. But is the rate equally high in all children within that age group, or do som e children have highe r rates than others? Figure 1.13a Pertussis by 5-Year Age Groups Figure 1.13b Pertussis by <1, 4-Year, Then 5-Year Age Groups To answer this question, differe nt age groups are needed. Exam ine Figure 1.13b, which shows the sam e data but displays the rate of pertussis for children under 1 year of age separately. Clearly, infants account for most of the high rate among 0-4 year olds. Public health efforts should thus be f ocused on children less than 1 year of age, rather than on the entire 5-year age group. Sex. Males have higher rates of illness and death than do females for many diseases. For some diseases , this sex-related difference is because of g enetic, hormonal, anato mic, or other inherent differences between the sexes. These inheren t differences affect susceptibility or physiologic responses. For example, premenopausal women have a lower risk of heart disease than men of the same age. This difference has been attributed to higher estrogen levels in wom en. On the other hand, the sex-related differences in the occu rrence of m any diseases reflect differences in opportunity or levels of exposure. For exam ple, Figure 1.14 shows the differences in lung cancer rates over time among men and women.34 The difference noted in earlier years has been attributed to the higher prevalence of sm oking a mong m en in the past. Unfortunately, prevalen ce of smoking am ong wom en now equals that among men, and lung cancer rates in women have been climbing as a result.35 Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-42 Figure 1.14 Lung Cancer Rates in the United States, 1930-1999 Data Source: America n Cancer Society [Internet]. Atlanta: The American Cancer Society, Inc. Available from: http://www.cancer.org/docroot/PRO/content/PRO_1_1_ Cancer_ Statistics_2005_Presentation.asp. Ethnic and racial groups. Sometimes epidemiologists are interested in analyzing person data by biologic, cultural or social groupings such as race, nationalit y, religion, or social groups such as tribes and other geographically or socially isolated groups. Differences in racial, ethnic, or other group variables may reflect differences in susceptibility or exposure, or differences in other factors th at influence the risk of disease, such as socioecono mic status and access to health care. In Figure 1.15, infant mortality rates for 2002 are shown by race and Hispanic origin of the mother.

QuickStats: Infant mortality rates*, by selected racial/ethnic populations\u2014United States, 2002, MMWR 2005;54(05):126. Socioeconomic status. Socioeconom ic status is difficult to quantify. It is m ade up of m any variables such as occupation, family income, educational achievement or census track, living conditions, and social standing. The variables that are easiest to measure may not accurately reflect the overall concept. Nevertheless, epidem iologists commonly use occupation, family income, and educational achievement, while recognizing that these variables do not measure socioeconom ic status precisely. The frequency of many adverse health conditions increases with decreasing socioeconom ic status. For exam ple, tuberculosis is more common among persons in lower socioeconom ic strata. Infant mortality and time lost from work due to disability are both associated with lower income. These patterns may reflect more harmful exposures, lower resistance, and less access to health care. Or they may in part reflect an interdependent relationship that is impossible to untangle: Does low socioeconomic status contribute to disability, or does disability contribute to lower socioeconom ic status, or both? What accounts for the disproportionate prevalence of diabetes and asthm a in lower socioeconom ic areas?36,37 A few adverse health conditions occur m ore frequently am ong persons of higher socioeconom ic status. Gout was known as the \"disease of kings\" because of its association with consum ption of rich foods. Other conditions associ ated with higher socioeconom ic Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-44 status include breast cancer, Kawa saki syndrom e, chronic fatigue syndrome, and tennis elbow. Differences in exposure account for at least some if not most of the differences in the frequency of these conditions. Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-45 Exercise 1.6 Using the data in Tables 1.5 and 1.6, describe the death rate patterns for the \"Unusu al Event.\" For exam ple, how do death rates vary between men and women overall, among the different socioeconom ic classes, among men and women in different socioeconomic classes, and among adults and children in differ ent socioecon omic classes?

From these observations, epidem iologist s develop hypotheses about the causes of these patterns and about the factors that increase risk of disease. In other words, epidemiologists can use descriptive epidem iology to generate hypotheses, but only rarely to test those hypotheses. For that, epidem iologi sts must turn to analytic epidemiology. Key feature of analytic epidemiology = Comparison group The key feature of analytic ep idem iology is a com parison group. Consider a large outbreak of hepatitis A that occurred in Pennsylvania in 2003.38 Investigators found almost all of the case- patients had eaten at a particular restaurant during the 2-6 weeks (i.e., the typical incubation period for hepatitis A) before onset of illness. While the investigators were able to narrow down their hypotheses to the restaurant and were able to exclude the food preparers and servers as the source, they did not know which particular food may have been contam inated. The investigators asked the case-patients which restau rant foods they had eaten, but that only indicated which foods were popular. The investigators, therefore, also enrolled and interviewed a comparison or control group \u2014 a group of persons who had eaten at the restaurant during the sam e period but who did not get sick. Of 133 item s on the restaurant's m enu, the most striki ng difference between the case and control groups was in the proportion that ate salsa (94% of case-patients ate, compared with 39% of controls). Further investigation of the i ngredients in the salsa implicated green onions as the source of infection. Shor tly thereafter, the Food and Drug Adm inistration issued an advisory to the public about green onions and risk of hepatitis A. T his action w as in direct response to the convincing results of the analyt ic epidem iology, which com pared the exposure history of case-patient s with that of an appropriate comparison group. When investigators find that persons with a particular characteristic are more likely than those without the characteristic to contract a disease, the characteristic is said to be associated with the disease. The characteristic may be a: ! Demographic factor such as age, race, or sex; ! Constitutional factor such as blood group or immune status; ! Behavior or act such as smoki ng or having eaten salsa; or ! Circumstance such as living near a toxic waste site. Identifying factors associated with disease help health officials Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-47 appropriately target public health prevention and control activities. It also guides additional research into the causes of disease. Thus, analytic epidem iology is concerned with the search for causes and effects, or the why and the how. Epidemiologists use analytic epidem iology to quan tify the associ ation between exposures and outcom es and to test hypotheses about causal relationships. It has been said that epidem iology by itself can never prove that a particular exposur e caused a particular outcome. Often, howe ver, epidem iology provide s sufficient evidence to take appropriate control and prevention measures. Epidemiologic studies fall into two categories: experimental and observational. Experimental studies In an experimental study, the investigator determ ines through a controlled process the exposure for each individual (clinical trial) or comm unity (comm unity trial), an d then tracks the individuals or communities over tim e to detect th e effects of the exposure. For example, in a clinical trial of a new vaccine, the investigator may randomly assign some of the participants to receive the new vaccine, while others receive a p lacebo shot. The investigato r then tracks all participants, observes who gets the disease that the new vaccine is intended to prevent, and compares the two groups (new vaccine vs. placebo) to see whether the vaccine group has a lower rate of disease. Sim ilarly, in a trial to prevent onset of diabetes among high-risk individuals, investigators random ly assigned enrollees to one of three groups \u2014 placebo, an an ti-diabetes d rug, or lifestyle intervention. At the end of the follow-up period, investigators found the lowest incide nce of diabetes in the lifestyle intervention group, the next lowest in the anti-diabetic drug group, and the highest in the placebo group.39 Observational studies In an observational study, the epidem iologist simply observes the exposure an d disease status of each study particip ant. John Sn ow's studies of cholera in London were observational studies. The two most common types of observationa l studies are cohort studies and case-control studies; a third type is cross-sectional studies. Cohort study. A cohort study is sim ilar in concept to the experim ental study. In a cohort study the epidem iologist records whether each study participant is exposed or not, and then tracks the participants to see if they develop the disease of interest. Note that this differs from an experimental study because, in a cohort Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-48 study, the investigator observes rather than determ ines the participants' exposure status. After a period of tim e, the investigator compares the disease rate in the exposed group with the disease rate in the unexposed group. The unexposed group serves as the com parison group, providing an estim ate of the baseline or expected am ount of disease occurrence in the community. If the disease rate is substantively different in the exposed group compared to the unexposed group, the exposure is said to be associated with illness. The length of follow-up varies considerably. In an attempt to respond quickly to a public health concern such as an outbreak, public health departments tend to conduct relatively brief studies. On the other hand, research and academic organizations are more likely to conduct studies of cancer , cardiovascular disease, and other chronic diseases which m ay last for years and even decades. The Framingham study is a well-known cohort study that has followed over 5,000 residents of Fram ingha m, Massachusetts, since the early 1950s to establish the rates and risk factors for heart disease.7 The Nurses Health Study and the Nurses Health Study II are cohort studies established in 1976 and 1989, respectively, that have followed over 100,000 nurses each and have provided useful information on oral contraceptives, diet, and lifestyle risk factors.40 These studies are sometimes called follow-up or prospective cohort studies, because participants are enrolled as the study begins and are then followed prospectively over time to identify occurrence of the outcomes of interest. An alternative type of cohort study is a retrospective cohort study. In this type of study both the exposure and the outcom es have already occurred. Just as in a prospective cohort study, the investigator calculates and compares rates of disease in the exposed and unexposed groups. Retrospective cohort studies are commonly used in investigations of disease in groups of easily identified people such as worker s at a particular factory or attendees at a wedding. For exam ple, a retrospective cohort study was used to determine the source of infection of cyclosporiasis, a parasitic disease that caused an outbreak among members of a residential facility in Pennsylvania in 2004.41 The investigation indicated that consum ption of s now peas was implicated as the vehicle of the cyclosporiasis outbreak. Case-control study. In a case-control study, investigators start by enrolling a group of people with disease (at CDC such persons are called case-patients rather than cases, because case refers to occurrence of disease, not a person). As a comparison group, the Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-49 investigator then enrolls a group of people without disease (controls). Investigator s then compare previous exposures between the two groups. The control gr oup provides an estim ate of the baseline or expected am ount of e xposure in that population. If the amount of e xposure among the case group is substantially higher than the amount you would expect based on the control group, then illness is said to be associated with that exposure. The study of hepatitis A traced to green onions, d escrib ed abo ve, is an ex ample of a case-control study. The key in a case-control study is to identify an appropriate control group, comparable to the case group in most respects, in order to provide a reasonable estimate of the baseline or expected exposure. Cross-sectional study. In this third type of observational study, a sample of pe rsons from a population is enrolled and their exposures and health outcom es are m easured simultaneously. The cross-sectional study tends to assess the presence (prevalence) of the health outcom e at that point of time without regard to duration. For example, in a cross-sectional study of diabetes, som e of the enrollees with diabetes m ay have lived with their diabetes for many years, while others m ay have been recently diagnosed. From an ana lytic viewpoint the cross-sectional study is weaker than either a cohort or a case-control study because a cross- sectional study usually cannot disentangle risk factors for occurrence of disease (incidence) from risk factors for survival with the disease. (Incidence and prevalence are discussed in more detail in Lesson 3.) On the other hand, a cross-sectional study is a perfectly fine tool for descri ptive epidem iology purposes. Cross- sectional studies are used routinely to document the prevalence in a community of health behaviors (prevalence of smoking), health states (prevalence of vaccinati on against m easles), and health outcom es, particularly chronic cond itions (hypertension, diabetes). In summ ary, the purpose of an analytic study in epidem iology is to identify and quantify the relati onship between an exposure and a health outcom e. The hallm ark of su ch a study is the presence of at least two groups, one of which serves as a com parison group. In an experim ental study, the investigat or determines the exposure for the study subjects; in an obser vational study, the subjects are exposed under more natural conditions. In an observational cohort study, subjects are enrolled or grouped on the basis of their exposure, then are followed to document occurrence of disease. Differences in disease rates be tween the exposed and unexposed groups lead investigators to conclu de that exposure is associated with disease. In an observationa l case-control stu dy, subjects are Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-50 enrolled according to whether they have the disease or not, then are questioned or tested to determ ine their prior exposure. Differences in exposure prevalence between the case and control groups allow investigators to conclude that the exposure is associated with the disease. Cross-sectional studies measure exposure and disease status at the same time, and are better suited to descriptive epidem iology than causation.

Check your answers on page 1-83 Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-52 Concepts of Disease Occurrence A critical prem ise of epidem iology is that disease and other health events do not occur randomly in a population, but are m ore likely to occur in some members of the population than others because of risk factors that m ay not be di stributed random ly in the population. As noted earlier, one im portant us e of epidem iology is to identify the factors that place some members at greater risk than others. Causation A number of models of disease causation have been proposed. Among the simplest of these is the epidemiologic triad or triangle, the traditional model for infectious disease. The triad consists of an external agent , a susceptible host, and an environment that brings the host and agent together . In this model, disease results from the interaction between the agent and the susceptible host in an environment that supports transmission of the agent from a source to that host. Two ways of depicting this model are shown in Figure 1.16. Agent, host, and environm ental factors interrelate in a variety of complex wa ys to produce disease. Different diseases require different balances and interactio ns of these three components. Development of appropriate, practical, and effective public health measures to control or prevent disease usually requires assessm ent of all three components and their interactions. Figure 1.16 Epidemiologic Triad Agent originally referred to an infectious m icroorganism or pathogen: a virus, bacterium , parasite, or other microbe. Generally, the agent must be present for disease to occur; however, presence of that agent alone is not always sufficient to cause disease. A variety of factors influen ce whet her exposure to an organism will result in disease, including the or ganism 's pathogenicity (ability to cause disease) and dose. Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-53 Over tim e, the concept of agent has been broadened to include chem ical and physical causes of disease or injury. These include chemical contaminants (such as the L-tryptophan contaminant responsible for eosinophilia-m yalgia syndrome), as well as physical forces (such as repetitive mechanical forces associated with carpal tunnel syndrome). While the epidemiologic triad serves as a useful model for many diseas es, it has proven inadequate for cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other diseases that appear to have m ultiple contributin g causes without a sing le necessary o ne. Host refers to the hum an who can ge t the disease. A variety of factors intrinsic to the host, sometimes called ris k factors, can influence an individual's exposure, susceptibility, or response to a causative agent. Opportunities fo r exposure are often influenced by behaviors such as sexual practi ces, hygiene, and other personal choices as well as by age and sex. Susceptibility and response to an agent are influenced by factors such as genetic composition, nutritional and immunologi c status, anatom ic structure, presence of disease or medications, and psychological m akeup. Environment refers to extrinsic factors that affect the agent and the opportunity for exposure. Environm ental factors include physical factors such as geology and clim ate, biologic factors such as insects that transmit the agent, and socioeconomic factors such as crowding, sanitation, and the availability of h ealth services. Component causes and causal pies Because the agent-host-environment model did not work well for many non-infectious diseases, severa l other models that attempt to account for the multifactorial nature of causation have been proposed. One such m odel was proposed by Rothm an in 1976, and has come to be known as the Causal Pies.42 This model is illustrated in Figure 1.17. An individual factor that contributes to cause dis ease is shown as a piece of a pie. After all the pieces of a pie fall into place, the pie is complete \u2014 and disease occurs. The individual factors are called component causes. The complete pie, which m ight be considered a causal pathway, is called a sufficient cause . A disease m ay have m ore than one sufficient cause, with each sufficient cause being composed of several component causes that may or may not overlap. A component that appears in every pie or pathway is called a necessary cause, because without it, disease does not occur. Note in Figure 1.17 that com ponent cause A is a necessary cause because it appears in every pie. Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-54 Figure 1.17 Rothman's Causal Pies Source: Rothman KJ. Causes. Am J Epidemiol 1976;104:587-592. The component causes may include intrinsic host factors as well as the agent and the environmental factors of the agent-host- environm ent triad. A single com ponent cause is rarely a sufficient cause by itself. For example, even exposure to a highly infectious agent such as measles virus does not invariably result in measles disease. Host susceptibility and ot her host factors also may play a role. At the other extreme, an agent that is usually harmless in healthy persons m ay cause devastating di sease under differe nt conditions. Pneumocystis carinii is an organism that harm lessly colonizes the respiratory tract of som e healthy persons, but can cause potentially lethal pneumonia in persons whose immune system s have been weakened by hum an immunodeficien cy virus (HIV). Presence of Pneumocystis carinii organism s is therefor e a necessary but not sufficient cause of pneumocystis pneumonia. In Figure 1.17, it would be represented by component cause A. As the m odel indicates, a particular disease m ay result from a variety of different sufficient causes or pathways. For exam ple, lung cancer may result from a sufficient cause that includes smoking as a component cause. Smoking is not a sufficient cause by itself, however, because not all smokers develop lung cancer. Neither is smoking a necessary cause, because a small fraction of lung cancer victims have never smoked. Suppose Component Cause B is smoking and Com pone nt Cause C is asbestos. Sufficient Cause I includes both smoking (B) and asbestos (C). Sufficient Cause II includes asbestos without sm oking, and Sufficient Cause C includes sm oking without asbestos. But because lung cancer can develop in persons who have never been exposed to either sm oking or asbestos, a proper model for lung cancer would have to show at leas t one more Sufficient Cause Pie that does not include either component B or component C. Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-55 Note that public health action does not depend on the identification of every component cause. Disease prevention can be accomplished by blocking any single component of a sufficient cause, at least through that pathway. For exam ple, elimination of smoking (component B) would prev ent lung cancer from suffi cient causes I and II, although some lung cancer would still occur through sufficient cause III.

Anthrax is an acute infectious disease that usually occurs in animals such as livestock, but can also affect huma ns. Human anthrax comes in three forms, depending on the route of infectio n: cutaneo us (skin) anthrax, inhalation anthrax, and intestinal anthra x. Symptoms usually occur within 7 days after exposure. Cutaneous: Most (about 95%) anthrax infections occur when the bacterium enters a cut or abrasion on the skin after handling infect ed livestock or contaminated animal produc ts. Skin infection begins as a raised itchy bump that resembles an insect bite but within 1-2 days develops into a vesicle and then a painless ulcer, usually 1-3 cm in diameter, with a characteri stic black necrotic (dying) area in the center. Lymph glands in the adjacent area may swell. About 20% of untreated cases of cutaneous anthrax will result in death. Deaths are rare with appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Inhalation: Initial symptoms are like cold or flu symptoms and can include a sore throat, mild fever, and muscle aches. After several days, the symptoms may progress to cough, chest discomfort, severe breathing problems and shock. Inhalation anthrax is often fatal. Eleven of the mail-related cases were inhala tion; 5 (45%) of the 11 patients died. Intestinal: Initial signs of nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, and fever are followed by abdominal pain, vomiting of blood, and severe diarrhea. Intestinal anthrax results in death in 25% to 60% of cases. While most human cases of anthrax result from contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products, anthrax also can be used as a biolog ic weapon. In 1979, dozens of resident s of Sverdlovsk in the former Soviet Union are thought to have died of inhalation anthra x after an unintentional release of an aerosol from a biologi c weapon s facility. In 2001, 22 cases of anthrax occurred in the United States from letters containing anthrax spores that were mailed to members of Congress, television networks, and newspaper companies. What causes anthrax? Anthrax is caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis . The anthrax bacteri um forms a protective shell called a spore. B. anthracis spores are found naturally in soil, and can survive for many years. How is anthrax diagnosed? Anthrax is diagnosed by isolating B. anthracis from the blood, skin lesion s, or respiratory secretion s or by measu ring specific antibodies in the blood of persons with suspected cases. Is there a treatment for anthrax? Antibiotics are used to treat all three types of anthrax. Treatment should be initiated early because the disease is more likely to be fatal if treatment is delaye d or not given at all. How common is anthrax and where is it found? Anthrax is most common in agricultural regions of South and Central America, Southern and Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and the Middle East, where it occurs in animals. When anthrax affects humans, it is usually the result of an occupational exposure to infected animals or their products. Naturally occurring anthrax is rare in the United States (28 reported cases between 1971 and 2000), but 22 mail-related cases were identified in 2001. Infections occur most commo nly in wild and domestic lower vertebrates (cattle, sheep, goats, camels, antelopes, and other herbivores), but it can also occur in humans when they are exposed to infected animals or tissue from infected animals. How is anthrax transmitte d? Anthrax can infect a person in three ways: by anthrax spores entering through a break in the skin, by inhaling anthrax spores , or by eating contaminate, undercooked meat. Anthrax is not spread from person to person. The skin (\"cutaneous\") form of anthrax is usually the result of contact with infected livestock, wild animals, or contaminated animal products such as carcasses, hides, hair, wool, meat, or bone meal. The inhalation form is from breathing in spores from the same sources. Anthrax can also be spread as a bioterroris t agent. Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-58 Anthrax Fact Sheet (Continued) Who has an increased risk of being exposed to anthrax? Susceptibility to anthrax is universal. Most naturally occurring anthrax affect s people whose work brings them into contact with livestock or products from livestock. Such occupations include veterinarians, animal handlers, abattoir workers, and laboratorians. Inhalation anthrax was once called Woolsorter's Disease because workers who inhaled spores from contaminated wool before it was cleaned developed the disease. Soldiers and other potential targets of bioterror ist anthrax attacks might also be considered at increased risk. Is there a way to prevent i nfection? In countries where anthrax is common and vaccination levels of animal herds are low, humans should avoid contact with livestock and animal products and avoid eating meat that has not been properly slaughtered and cooked. Also, an anthrax vaccine has been licensed for use in humans. It is reported to be 93% effective in protecting against anthrax. It is used by veterina rians, laborator ians, soldiers, and others who may be at increased risk of exposure, but is not available to the general public at this time. For a person who has been exposed to anthrax but is not yet sick, antibiotics combined with anthrax vaccine are used to prevent illness.

Dept. of Public Health, August 2002. Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-59 Natural History and Spectrum of Disease Natural history of disease refers to the progression of a disease process in an individual over time, in the absence of treatm ent. For exam ple, untreated infection with HIV causes a s pectrum of clinical problem s beginning at the time of seroconversion (prim ary HIV) and term inating with AIDS and usually death. It is now recognized that it m ay take 10 year s or m ore for AIDS to develop after seroconversion.43 Many, if not m ost, diseases have a characteristic natural history, alt hough the tim e frame and specific manifestations of disease may vary from individual to individual and are influenced by preventive and therapeutic measures. Figure 1.18 Natural History of Disease Timeline Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Principle s of epidemiology, 2nd ed. Atlanta: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services;1992. The process begins with the appropriate exposure to or accumulation of factors sufficient for the disease process to begin in a susceptible host. For an inf ectious disease, the exposure is a microorganism. For cancer, the exposure may be a factor that initiates the process, such as asbestos fibers or com ponents in tobacco smoke (for lung cancer), or one that promotes the process, such as estrogen (for endometrial cancer). After the disease process has been triggered, pathological changes then occur without the individual being aware of them . This stage of subclinical disease, extending from the tim e of exposure to onset of disease sym ptoms, is usually called the incubation period for infectious diseases, and the laten cy period for chronic diseases. During this stage, disease is said to be asymptomatic (no symptoms) or inapparent. This period may be as brief as seconds for hypersensitivity and toxic reactions to as long as decades for certain chronic diseases. Even for a single disease, the characteristic incubation period has a range. For exam ple, the typical incubation period for hepat itis A is as long as 7 weeks. The Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-60 latency period for leukem ia to becom e evident among survivors of the atomic bomb blast in Hiroshima ranged from 2 to 12 years, peaking at 6-7 years.44 Incubation periods of selected exposures and diseas es varying from minutes to decades are displayed in Table 1.7. Table 1.7 Incubation Periods of Selected Exposures and Diseases Expos ure Clinical Eff ect Incu batio n/Latency minutes-30 minutes toxins from shellfish (tingling, numbness around lips and fingertips, giddiness, incoherent speech, respiratory paralysis, sometimes death) Organophosphorus Nausea, vomiting, cramp s, few minutes-few hours ingestion headache , nervousness, blurred vision, chest pain, confusion, twitching, convulsions Salmonella Diarrhea, often with fever and cramps usually 6-48 hours SARS-as sociated Severe Acute Respiratory corona virus Syndrome (SARS) 3-10 days, usually 4-6 days Varicella-zoster pallidum Syphilis 10-90 days, usually 3 weeks Hepatitis A virus Hepatitis 14-50 days, average 4 weeks Hepatitis B virus Hepatitis 50-180 days, usually 2-3 months Human immunodeficiency virus AIDS <1 to 15+ years Atomic bomb radiation (Japan) Leukemia 2-12 years Radiation (Japan, Chernobyl) Thyroid cancer 3-20+ years Radium (watch dial painters) Bone cancer 8-40 years Although disease is not apparent during the incubation period, some pathologic changes m ay be detectable with laboratory, radiographic, or other screening methods. Most screening programs attempt to identify the disease process during this phase of its natural history, since interven tion at this early stage is likely to be more effective than treatment given after the disease has progressed and becom e symptomatic. The onset of symptoms marks the transition from subclinical to clinical disease. Most diagnoses are made during the stage of clinical disease. In som e people, however, the disease process m ay Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-61 never progress to clinically apparent illness. In others, the disease process may result in illness that ranges from mild to severe or fatal. This range is called the spectrum of disease. Ultimately, the disease process ends either in recovery, disability or death. For an infectious agent, infectivity refers to the proportion of exposed persons who becom e infected. Pathogenicity refers to the proportion of infected individuals who develop clinically apparent disease. Virulence refers to the proportion of clinically apparent cases that are severe or fatal. Because the spectrum of disease can include asymptomatic and mild cases, the cases of illness diagnosed by clinicians in the community often represent only the tip of the iceberg. Many additional cases may be too early to diagnose or may never progress to the clinical stage. Unfortunately, persons with inapparent or undiagnosed infectio ns may nonetheless be able to transmit infection to others. Such persons who are infectious but have subclinical disease are called carriers. Frequently, carriers are persons with incubating disease or inapparent infection. Persons with measles, hepatitis A, and several other diseases becom e infectious a few days before the onset of symptoms. However carriers may also be persons who appear to have recovered from their clinical illness but remain infectious, such as chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus, or persons who never exhibited symptom s. The challenge to public health workers is that these carriers, unaware that they are infected and infectious to others, are sometimes more likely to unwittingly spread infection than are people with obvious illness. Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-62 Chain of Infection As described above, the traditional epidemiologic triad model holds that infectious diseases re sult from the interaction of agent, host, and environment. More specifically, transmission occurs when the ag ent leaves its reservoir or host through a portal of exit, is conveyed by some mode of transmission , and enters through an appropriate portal of entry to infect a susceptible host. This sequence is som etimes called the chain of infection. Figure 1.19 Chain of Infection Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Principle s of epidemiology, 2nd ed. Atlanta: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services;1992. Reservoir The reservoir of an infectious agent is the habitat in which the agent normally lives, grows, and multiplies. Reservoirs include humans, animals, and the environment. The reservoir m ay or m ay not be the source from which an agent is transferred to a host. For example, the reservoir of Clostridium botulinum is soil, but the source of most botulism infec tions is improperly canned food containing C. botulinum spores. Human reservoirs . Many common infectious diseases have hum an reservoirs. Diseases that are transm itted from person to person without intermediaries include the sexually transmitted diseases, measles, mumps, streptococcal infection, and many respiratory pathogens. Because humans were the only reservoir for the smallpox virus, naturally occurri ng smallpox was eradicated after the last human case was identified and isolated.8 Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-63 Human reservoirs may or may not show the effects of illness. As noted earlier, a carrier is a person with inapparent infection w ho is capable of transm itting the pathoge n to others. Asymptomatic or passive or healthy carriers are those who never experience symptoms despite being infected. Incubatory carriers are those who can transmit the agent during the incubation period before clinical illness begins. Convalesc ent carriers are those who have recovered from their illness but remain capable of transmitting to others. Chronic carriers are those who continue to harbor a pathogen such as hepatitis B virus or Salmonella Typhi, the causative agent of typhoid fever, for months or even years after their initial infection. One notori ous carrier is Mary Mallon, or Typhoid Mary, who was an asym ptom atic chronic carrier of Salmonella Typhi. As a cook in New York City and New Jersey in the early 1900s, she unintentionally infected dozens of people until she was placed in isolation on an island in the East River, where she died 23 years later.45 Carriers commonly transmit disease because they do not realize they are infected, and consequently take no special precautions to prevent transmission. Symptomatic persons who are aware of their illness, on the other hand, may be less likely to transmit infection because they are either too sick to b e out and abo ut, take precautions to reduce transmission, or receive treatment that limits the disease. Animal reservoirs . Humans are also subject to diseases that have animal reservoirs. Many of these diseases are transmitted from animal to animal, with humans as incidental hosts. The term zoonosis refers to an infectious disease that is transmissible under natural conditions from vertebrate anim als to hum ans. Long recognized zoonotic diseases include brucellosis (cows and pigs), anthrax (sheep), plague (rodents), trichinellosis/trichinosis (swine), tularem ia (rabbits), and rabies (bats, raccoons, dogs, and other mammals). Zoonoses newly emergent in North America include West Nile encephalitis (birds ), and monkeypox (prairie dogs). Many newly recognized infectious diseases in humans, including HIV/AIDS, Ebola infection and SARS, are thought to have emerged from animal hosts, although those hosts have not yet been identified. Environmental reservo irs. Plants, soil, and water in the environm ent are also reservoirs for som e infectious agents. Many fungal agents, such as those that cause histoplasm osis, live and multiply in the soil. Outbreaks of Legionnaires disease are often traced to water supplies in cooling towers and evaporative Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-64 condensers, reservoirs for the causative organism Legionella pneumophila. Portal of exit Portal of exit is the path by which a pathogen leaves its host. The portal of exit usually corresponds to the site where the pathogen is localized. For example, influenza viruses and Mycobacterium tuberculosis exit the respiratory tract, schistosom es through urine, cholera vibrios in feces, Sarcoptes scabiei in scabies skin lesions, and enterovirus 70, a of he morrhagic conjunctivitis, in conjunctival secretions. Some bloodborne agents can exit by crossing the placenta from mother to fetus (rubella, syphilis, toxoplasm osis), while others exit through cuts or needles in the skin (hepatitis B) or blood-sucking arthropods (m alaria). Modes of transmission An infectious agent may be transmitted from its natural reservoir to a susceptible host in different ways. There are different classifications for modes of transm ission. Here is one classification: ! Direct Direct contact Droplet spread ! Indirect Airborne Vehicleborne Vectorborne (m echanical or biologic) In direct transmission, an infectious agent is transferred from a reservoir to a susceptible host by direct contact or droplet spread. Direct contact occurs through skin-to-skin contact, kissing, and sexual intercourse. Direct contact also refers to contact with soil or vegetation harbor ing infectious organism s. Thus, infectious m ononucleosi s (\"kissing disease\") and gonorrhea are spread from person to person by direct contact. Hookwor m is spread by direct contact with contaminated soil. Droplet spread refers to spray with relatively large, short-range aerosols produced by sneezing, coughing, or even talking. Droplet spread is classified as direct because transmission is by direct spray over a few feet, before the droplets fall to the ground. Pertussis and meningococcal infection are examples of diseases transmitted from an infectious patient to a susceptible host by droplet spread. Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-65 Indirect transmission refers to the transfer of an infectious agent from a reservoir to a host by suspended air particles, inanimate objects (vehicles), or animate intermediaries (vectors). Airborne transmission occurs when infectious agents are carried by dust or droplet nucle i suspended in air. Airborne dust includes material that has settled on surfaces and become resuspended by air currents as well as infectious particles blown from the soil by the wind. Droplet nuclei are dried residue of less than 5 microns in size. In contrast to droplets that fall to the ground within a few feet, droplet nuclei may remain suspended in the air for long periods of time and m ay be blown over great distances. Measles, for example, has occurred in children who came into a physician's office after a child with measles had left, because the measles virus remained suspended in the air.46 Vehicles that may indirectly transmit an infectious agent include food, water, biologic products (blood), and fomites (inanim ate objects such as handkerchiefs, bedding, or surgical scalpels). A vehi cle may passively carry a pathogen \u2014 as food or water m ay carry hepatitis A virus. Alternatively, the vehicle m ay provide an environment in which the agent grows, multiplies, or produces toxin \u2014 as improperly canned foods provide an environment that supports production of botulinum toxin by Clostridium botulinum. Vectors such as mosquitoes, fleas, and ticks may carry an infectious agent through purely mechanical means or may support growth or changes in the agent. Exam ples of mechanical transmission are flies carrying Shigella on their appendages and fleas carrying Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, in their gut. In contrast, in biologic transmission, the causative agent of malaria or guinea worm disease undergoes maturation in an interm ediate host before it can be transm itted to hum ans (Figure 1.20). Portal of entry The portal of entry refers to the m anner in which a pathogen enters a susceptible host. The portal of entry m ust provide access to tissues in which the pathogen can multiply or a toxin can act. Often, infectious agents use the same portal to enter a new host that they used to exit the source host. For exam ple, influenza virus exits the respiratory tract of the source host and enters the respiratory tract of the new host. In contrast, many pathogens that Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-66 cause gas troenteritis follow a so-called \"fecal-o ral\" rou te because they exit the source host in feces, are carried on inadequately washed hands to a vehicle such as food, water, or utensil, and enter a new host through the mouth. Other portals of entry include the skin (hookw orm), mucous membranes (syphilis), and blood (hepatitis B, hum an immunodeficiency virus). Figure 1.20 Complex Life Cycle of Dracunculus medinensis (Guinea worm) Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Principle s of epidemiology, 2nd ed. Atlanta: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services;1992. Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-67 Host The final link in the chain of infection is a susceptible host. Susceptibility of a host depends on genetic or constitutional factors, specific imm unity, and nons pecific factors that affect an individual's ability to resist infection or to limit pathogenicity. An individual's genetic makeup may either increase or decrease susceptibility. For example, persons with sickle cell trait seem to be at least partially protected from a particular type of malaria. Specific immunity refers to protective antibodies that are directed against a specific agent. Such antibodies may develop in response to infection, vaccine, or toxoid (toxin that has been deactivated but retains its capacity to stimulate production of toxin antibodies) or may be acquired by transplacental transfer from mother to fetus or by injection of antitoxin or immune globulin. Nonspecific factors that defend against infection include the skin, mucous membranes, gastric acidity, cilia in the respir atory tract, the cough reflex, and nonspecific immune response. Factors that may increase susceptibility to infection by di srupting host defenses include malnutrition, alcoholism, and disease or therapy that impairs the nonspecific immune response. Interventions are directed at: ! Controlling or eliminating agent at source of transmission ! Protecting portals of entry ! Increasing host's defenses Implications for public health Knowledge of the portals of exit and entry and m odes of transmission provides a basis for determining appropriate control measures. In general, control m easures are usually directed against the segment in the infection chain that is most susceptible to intervention, unless practical issues dictate otherwise. For some diseases, the most appropriate intervention m ay be directed at controlling or elim inating the agent at its source. A patient sick with a communicable disease m ay be treated with antibiotics to eliminate the infection. An asymptomatic but infected person m ay be treated bot h to clear the infection and to reduce the risk of transmission to others. In the comm unity, soil may be decontaminated or covered to prevent escape of the agent. Some interventions are directed at the mode of transmission. Interruption of direct transmission may be accomplished by isolation of someone with infecti on, or counseling persons to avoid the specific type of contact associated with transmission. Vehicleborne transm ission may be interrupted by elimination or decontamination of the vehicle. To prevent fecal-oral transmission, efforts often focus on rearrangi ng the environment to reduce the risk of contam ination in the future and on changing behaviors, such as promoting handwashing. Fo r airborne diseases, strategies may be directed at m odifying ve ntilation or air pressure, and Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-68 filtering or treating the air. To interrupt vectorborne transmission, measures may be directed toward controlling the vector population, such as spraying to reduce the m osquito population. Some strategies that protect portals of entry are simple and effective. For exam ple, bed nets are used to protect sleeping persons from being bitten by mosquitoes that may transmit malaria. A dentist's mask and gloves are intended to protect the dentist from a patient's blood, secre tions, and droplets, as well to protect the patient from the dent ist. Wearing of long pants and sleeves and use of insect repellent are recommended to reduce the risk of Lyme disease and West Nile virus infection, which are transmitted by the bite of ticks and mosquitoes, respectively. Some interventions aim to increase a host's defen ses. Vaccin ations promote development of specific antibodies that protect against infection. On the other hand, prophylactic use of antimalarial drugs, recommended for visitors to malaria-endemic areas, does not prevent exposure through m osquito bites, but does prevent infection from taking root. Finally, some interventions atte mpt to prevent a pathogen from encountering a susceptible host. The concept of herd immunity suggests that if a high enough proportion of individuals in a population are resistant to an agent, then those few who are susceptible will be protected by the resistant majority, since the pathogen will be unlikely to \"f ind\" those few susceptible individuals. The degree of herd immunity necessary to prevent or interrupt an outbreak varies by disease. In th eory, herd immunity means that not everyone in a community needs to be resistant (immune) to prevent disease spread and occurrence of an outbreak. In practice, herd immunity has not prevented outbreaks of measles and rubella in populations with imm unization levels as high as 85% to 90%. One problem is that, in highly immunized populations, the relatively few susceptible persons are often clustered in subgroups defined by socioeconomic or cultural factors. If the pathogen is introdu ced into one of these subgroups, an outbreak may occur.

Dengue is an acute infectious disease that comes in two forms: dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever. The principal symptoms of dengue are high fever, severe headache, backache, joint pains, nausea and vomiting, eye pain, and rash. Generally, younger children have a milder illness than older children and adults. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a more severe form of dengue. It is characterized by a fever that lasts from 2 to 7 days, with general signs and symptoms that could occur with many other illnesses (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and headache). This stage is followed by hemorrhagic manifestations, tendency to bruise easily or other types of skin hemorrhages, bleeding nose or gums, and possibly internal bleeding. The smallest blood vessels (capillaries) become excess ively permeable (\"leaky\"), allowing the fluid component to escape from the blood vessels. This may lead to failure of the circulato ry system and shock, followed by death, if circulatory failure is not corrected. Although the average case-fatality rate is about 5%, with good medical manageme nt, mortality can be less than 1%. What causes dengue? Dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever are caused by any one of four closely related flaviviruses, designated DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, dengue infectio n requires laboratory confirmati on, either by isolating the virus from serum within 5 days after onset of symptoms, or by detecting convalescent-phas e specific antibodies obtained at least 6 days after onset of symptoms. What is the treatment for dengue or de ngue hemorrhagic fever? There is no specific medication for treatment of a dengue infection. Persons who think they have dengue should use analgesics (pain relievers) with acetaminoph en and avoid those containing aspirin. They should also rest, drink plenty of fluids, and consult a physician. Persons with dengue hemorrhagic fever can be effectiv ely treated by fluid replacement therapy if an early clinical diagnosis is made, but hospitalization is often required. How common is dengue and where is it found? Dengue is endemic in many tropical countries in Asia and Latin America, most countries in Africa, and much of the Caribbean, including Puerto Rico. Cases have occurred sporadically in Texas. Epidemics occur periodically. Globally, an estimated 50 to 100 million cases of dengue and several hundred thousand cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever occur each year, depending on epidemic activity. Between 100 and 200 suspected cases are introduced into the United States each year by travelers. How is dengue transmitted? Dengue is transmitted to people by the bite of an Aedes mosquito that is infected with a dengue virus. The mosquito becomes infected with dengue virus when it bites a person who has dengue or DHF and after about a week can transmit the virus while biting a healthy person. Monkeys may serve as a reservoir in some parts of Asia and Africa. Dengue cannot be spread directly from person to person. Who has an increased risk of being exposed to dengue? Susceptibility to dengue is universal. Residents of or visitors to tropical urban areas and other areas where dengue is endemic are at highest risk of becoming infected. While a person who survives a bout of dengue caused by one serotype develops lifelong immunity to that serotype, there is no cross-protection against the three other serotypes. Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-71 Dengue Fac t Sheet (Co ntinued) What can be done to reduce the risk of acquiring dengue? There is no vaccine for preventing dengue. The best preven tive measure for residents living in areas infested with Aedes aegypti is to eliminate the places where the mosquito lays her eggs, primarily artificial containers that hold water. Items that collect rainwater or are used to store water (for example, plastic containers, 55-gallon drums, buckets, or used automobile tires) should be covered or properly discarded. Pet and animal watering containers and vases with fresh flowers should be emptied and scoured at least once a week. This will eliminate the mosquito eggs and larvae and reduce the number of mosquitoes present in these areas. For travelers to areas with dengue, as well as people living in areas with dengue, the risk of being bitten by mosquitoes indoors is reduced by utilization of air condit ioning or windows and doors that are screened. Proper application of mosquito repell ents containing 20% to 30% DEET as the active ingredient on exposed skin and clothing decreases the risk of being bitten by mosquitoes. The risk of dengue infectio n for internatio nal travelers appears to be small, unless an epidemic is in progress. Can epidemic s of dengue h emorrhagic fever be prevented? The emphasis for dengue prevention is on sustainable, community-based, integrated mosq uito control, with limited reliance on insecticides (chemical larvicides and adulticides). Preventing epidemic disease requires a coordinated community effort to increase awareness about dengue/DHF , how to recognize it, and how to control the mosquito that transmits it. Residents are responsible for keeping their yards and patios free of sites where mosquitoes can be produced. Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet]. Dengue Fever.

Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-72 Epidemic Disease Occurrence Level of disease The amount of a particular disease that is usually present in a community is referred to as the baseline or endemic level of the disease. This level is not necessa rily the desired level, which may in fact be zero, but rather is th e observed level. In the absence of intervention and assum ing that the level is not high enough to deplete the pool of susceptible persons, the disease m ay continue to occur at this level indefinitely. Thus, the baseline level is often regarded as the expected level of the disease. While some diseases are so rare in a given population that a single case warrants an epidemiologic investigation (e.g., rabies, plague, polio), other diseases occur m ore commonly so that only deviations from the norm warrant investigation. Sporadic refers to a diseas e that occurs infre quently and irregularly. Endemic refers to the constant presence and/or usual prevalence of a disease or infectious agent in a populat ion within a geographic area. Hyperendemic refers to persistent, high levels of disease occurrence. Occasionally, the am ount of disease in a comm unity rises ab ove the expected level. Epidemic refers to an increase, often sudden, in the number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected in that population in that area. Outbr eak carries the same definition of epidemic, but is often used for a more limited geographic area. Cluster refers to an aggregation of cases grouped in place and time that are suspected to be greater than the number expected, even though the expect ed number may not be known. Pandemic refers to an epidem ic that has spread over several countries or continents, usually affecting a large num ber of people. Epidemics occur when an agent and susceptible hosts are present in adequate numbers, and the agent can be effectively conveyed from a source to the susceptible hosts. More specifically, an epidemic may result from: ! A recent increase in amount or virulence of the agent, ! The recent introduction of the agent into a setting where it has not been before, ! An enhanced mode of transmission so that more susceptible persons are exposed, ! A change in the susceptibility of the host response to the agent, and/or ! Factors that increase host exposure or involve introduction Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-73 through new portals of entry.47 The previous description of epidem ics presum es only infectious agents, but non-infectious diseases such as diabetes and obesity exist in epidemic proportion in the U.S.51,52 Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-74 Exercise 1.10 For each of the followin g situati ons, identify whether it reflects : A.

Common-source ! Point ! Continuous ! Intermittent ! Propagated ! Mixed ! Other A common-source outbreak is one in which a group of persons are all exposed to an infectious agent or a toxin from the same source. If the group is exposed over a relatively brief period, so that everyone who becomes ill does so within on e incubation period, then the common-source outbreak is further classified as a point- source outbreak. The epidem ic of leukem ia cases in Hirosh ima following the atom ic bomb blast and the epidem ic of hepatitis A among patrons of the Pennsylvania restaurant who ate green onions each had a point source of exposure.38, 44 If the number of cases during an epidemic were plotted over time, the resulting graph, called an epidem ic curve, would typically have a steep upslope and a more gradual downslope (a so-called \"log-norm al distribution\"). Figure 1.21 Hepatiti s A Cases by Date of Onset, Nove mber-Decem ber, 1978 Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Unpublished data; 1979. In some common-source outbreaks, case-patients may have been exposed over a period of days, weeks, or longer. In a continu ous common-so urce outbreak , the range of exposures and range of incubation periods tend to flatte n and widen the peaks of the Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-76 epidemic curve (Figure 1.22) The epidemic curve of an intermitten t common -source outbreak often has a pattern reflecting the intermittent nature of the exposure. Figure 1.22 Diarrheal Illness in Cit y Residents b y Date of Onset and Character of Stool, December 1989-January 1990 Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Unpublished data; 1990. A propagated outbreak results from transmission from one person to another. Usually, transm ission is by direct person-to-person contact, as with syphilis. Transmission may also be vehicleborne (e.g., transm ission of hepatitis B or HIV by sharing needles) or vectorborne (e .g., transm ission of yellow fever by mosquitoes). In propagated outbreaks, cases occur over more than one incubation period. In Figure 1.23, note the peaks occurring about 11 days apart, consistent with the incubation period for measles. The epidemic usually wanes after a few generations, either because the number of susceptible persons falls below some critical level requi red to sustain transm ission, or because intervention measures become effective.

Introduction to ics have fe atures of both common-source epidem ics and propagated epidem ics. The pattern of a common-source outbreak followed by secondary person-to-person spread is not uncommon. These are called mixed epidemics. For example, a common-source epidemic of shig ellosis occurred am ong a group of 3,000 wom en attending a national music festival (Figure 1.24). Many developed sym ptoms after returning hom e. Over the next few weeks, several state health departm ents detected subsequent generations of Shigella cases propagated by person-to-person transmission from festival attendees.48 Figure 1.24 Shigella Case s at a Music F estival by Day of Onset, August 1988 Adapted from: Lee LA, Ostroff SM, McGee HB, Johnson DR, Downes FP, Cameron DN, et al. An outbreak of shigellosis at an outdoor music festival. Am J Epidemiol 1991;133:608-15. Finally, some epidemics are neither comm on-source in its usual sense nor propagated from person to person. Outbreaks of zoonotic or vectorborne disease may result from sufficient prevalence of infection in host species, sufficient presence of vectors, and sufficient hum an-vector interaction. E xamples (Figures 1.25 and 1.26) include the epidemic of Lym e disease that emerged in the northeastern United States in the late 1980s (spread from deer to human by deer ticks) and the outbrea k of West Nile encephalitis in the Queens section of New York City in 1999 (spread from birds to humans by mosquitoes).49,50 Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-78 Figure 1.25 Number of Reported Case s of Lyme Disease by Year-United States, 1992-2003.

Epidemiologists us e a system atic approach to assess the What, Who, Where, When, and Why/How of these health states or events. Two essential concepts of epidem iology are population and comparison. Core epidemiologic tasks of a public health epidemiologist include public health surveillance, field invest igation, research, evaluation, and policy developm ent. In carrying out these tasks, th e epidem iologist is almost always part of the team dedicated to protecting and promoting the public's health. Epidemiologists look at differences in disease and injury occurre nce in different populations to generate hypotheses about risk factors and cause s. They generally use cohort or case-control studies to evaluate these hypothe ses. Knowledge of basic princi ples of disease occurrence and spread in a population is essent ial for implementing effective control and prevention measures.

Having identified a cluster of cases never before seen in the area, public health officials must seek additional information to assess the community's health. Is the cluster lim ited to persons who have just returned f rom traveling where W est Nile virus infection is common, or was the infection acquired locally, indica ting that the community is truly at risk? Officials could check whether hospitals have seen more patients than usual for encephalitis. If so, officials could document when the increase in cases began, where the patients live or work or travel, and personal characteristics such as age. Mosqui to traps could be placed to catch mosquitoes and test for presence of the West Nile virus. If warranted, officials could conduct a serosurvey of the community to docum ent the extent of infection. Results of these efforts would help officials assess the community's burden of disease and risk of infection. 2. West Nile virus infection is spread by mosquitoes. Persons who spend tim e outdoors, particularly at times such as dusk when mosquitoes may be most active, can make personal decisions to reduce their own risk or not. Knowing that the risk is present but may be small, an avid gardener might or might not decide to curtail the time spent gardening in the evening, or use insect repellent containing DEET, or wear long pants and long- sleeve shirts even though it is August, or empty the bird bath where m osquitoes breed. 3. What proportion of persons infected with West Nile virus actually develops encephalitis? Do some infected people have milder symptoms or no symptoms at all? Investigators could conduct a serosurvey to assess infection, and ask about symptoms and illness. In addition, what becomes of the persons who did develop encephalitis? What proportion survived? Did they recover com pletely or did som e have continuing difficulties? 4. Although the cause and mode of transm ission were known (West Nile virus and m osquitoes, respectively), public health officials asked many questions regarding how the virus was introduced (mosquito on an airp lane? wayward bird? bioterrorism ?), whether the virus had a reservoir in the area (e.g., birds), what types of mosquitoes could transmit the virus, what were the host risk factors for infection or encephalitis, etc. Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-82 Exercise 1.3 1.

Person -to-person Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-90 Answers to Self-Assessment Quiz 1. A, B, C. In the definitio n of epidem iology, \"distribution\" refers to descriptive epidemiol to analytic epide miology. So \"distributi on\" covers time (when) , place (where) , and person (who), whereas \"determ inants\" covers causes, risk factors, modes of transmission (why and how). 2. A, B, D, E. In the defini tion of epidemiolo gy, \"determ inant s\" general ly includes the causes (including agents), risk factors (including exposure to sources), and modes of transmission, but does not include the resulting public health action. 3. A, C, D. Epidemiolog y includes assessmen t of the distribution (including describing demograp hic characteri stics of an affected population) , determinants (including a study of possible risk factors), and the applic ation to control health problems (such as closing a restaurant) . It does not generally include the actual treatment of individuals, which is the responsibility of health-care providers. 4. A, B, D, E. John Snow's investigatio n of choler a is considered a model for epidem iologic field investigations because it included a biologically plausib le (but not popular at the time) hypothesis that cholera was water-bo rne, a spot map, a compar ison of a health outcome (death) among exposed and unexpos ed group s, and a recommendation for public health action. Snow's elegant work predated multivariate analysis by 100 years. 5. B, C, D. Public health surveillance includes collection (B), analysis (C), and dissemination (D) of public health information to help guide public health decision making and action, but it does not include individu al clinical diagnosis, nor does it include the actual public health actions that are developed based on the inform ation . 6. A. The hallmark feature of an analytic epidemi ologic study is use of an appro priate compari son group. 7. A. A case definition for a field inves tigation should include clinical criteria, plus specificatio n of time, place, and person. The case definitio n shoul d be independen t of the exposure you wish to evaluate. Depending on the availability of laboratory confirm ation, certainty of diagnosis, and other factors, a case definition may or may not be developed for suspect cases. The nationall y agreed standa rd case definition for disease reporting is usually quite specific, and usual ly does not include suspect or possible cases. 8. A, D. A specific or tight case definiti on is one that is likely to include only (or mostly) true cases, but at the expense of excluding milde r or atypical cases. 9. C. Rates assess risk. Numbers are generally preferred for identifying individual cases and for resource planning. 10. B. An epide mic curve, with date or time of onset on its x-axis and number of cases on the y-axis , is the classic graph for displaying the time course of an epidemic. 11. A, B, C. \"Place\" includ es location of actual or suspected exposure as well as location of residence, work, school, and the like. Introduction to Epidemiol ogy Page 1-91 12. A, C. \"Person\" refers to demograp hic characteri stics. It generally does not include clinical features characteristics or exposures. 13. D. Epidemiologists tailor descrip tive epidemiology to best describe the data they have. Because different diseases have different age distrib utions , epidemiologists use different age breakdowns appropriate for the disease of interest. 14. A, E. A study in which subjects are random ized into two intervention groups and monitored to identify health outco mes is a clinical trial, which is type of experime ntal study. It is not a cohort study, because that term is limited to observ ational studie s. 15. B, C. A study that assesses (but does not dictat e) exposu re and follows to documen t subsequent occurrence of disease is an observat ional cohort study. 16. B, D. A study in which subjects are enrolled on the basis of having or not having a health outcome is an observational case-control study . Source: Smeeth L, Cook C, Fombonne L, Rodrigues LC, Smith PG, Hall AJ. MMR vaccination and pervasive developmental disorders. Lancet 2004;364:963-9. 17. A. The key difference between a cohort and case-control study is that, in a cohort study, subjects are enrolled on the basis of their expos ure, whereas in a case-c ontrol study subjects are enrolled on the basis of whether they have the disease of interest or not. Both types of studies assess exposu re and disease status. While some cohort studies have been condu cted over several years, others, particularly those that are outbreak- related, have been conducted in days. Eithe r type of study can be used to study a wide array of health problems, includ ing infectiou s and non-infectious. 18. A, C, D. A cross-sectiona l study or survey provi des a snapshot of the health of a populati on, so it assesse s prevalenc e rather than incidence. As a result, it is not as useful as a cohort or case-c ontrol study for analytic epidemiolog y. However, a cross-sectio nal study can easily measure prevalence of exposu res and outcomes. 19. A. The epidemiolog ic triad of disease causation refers to agent-host-en vironment. 20. C Onset of symptoms D Usual time of diagnosis A Exposure 21. A, B, C, D. A reservoi r of an infectious agent is the habitat in which an agent normally lives, grows, and multip lies, which may include humans , animals, and the environ ment. 22. B, C, D. Indirect transmi ssion refers to the trans mission of an infectious agent by suspended airborne particles, inanimate object s (vehicles, food, water ) or living intermedia ries (vectors such as mosquitoes). Droplet spread is genera lly considered short- distance direct transmis sion. 23. A, B, D, E. Disease control measu res are generally directed at eliminating the reservoir or vector, interrupting transmiss ion, or protecting (but not eliminating! ) the host.

First, a case of hepatitis B is reported to the health departm ent. The patient, a 40-year-old man, denies having either of the two common risk factors for the disease: he has never used injection drugs and has been in a monogamous relationship w ith his wife for twelve years. However, he remembers going to the dentist for some bridge work approximately three months earlier. Hepatitis B has occas ionally been transmitted between dentist and patients, particularly before dentists routinely wore gloves. Question : What proportion of other persons with new onset of hepatitis B reported recent exposure to the same dentist, or to any dentist during their likely period of exposure? Then, in the following week, the health depart ment receives 6 1 death certificates. A new employee in the Vital Statistics office wonders how many death certificates the health departm ent usually receives each week. Question: What is the average number of death certificates the health department receives each week? By how much does this numb er vary? What is th e range over th e past year? If you were given the appropriate raw data, would you be able to answer these two questions confidently? The materials in this lesson will allow you do so \u2014 and m ore. Objectives After studying this lesson and answering the questions in the exercises, you will be able to: ! Construct a frequency distribution ! Calculate and interpret four measures of central location: m ode, median, arithmetic mean, and geometric mean ! Apply the most appropriate measure of centr al location for a frequency distribution ! Apply and interpret four measures of spread: range, interquartile range, standard deviation, and confidence interval (for mean) Major Sections Organizing Data ................................................................................................................ ........... 2-2 Types Data ................................................................................................. 2-14 Measures of Spread ............................................................................................................. ....... 2-35 Choosing the of Spread .................................................. 2-52 Summ ary........................................................................................................................ ............ 2-582 1 Summarizing Data Page 2-2 Organizing Data Whether you are conducting routine surveillance, i nvestigating an outbreak, or conducting a study, you must first compile inform ation in an organized m anner. One common m ethod is to create a line list or line listing . Table 2.1 is a typical line listing from an epidemiologic investigation of an apparent cluster of hepatitis A. A variable can be any characteristic that differs from person to person, such as height, sex, smallpox vaccination status, or physical activity pattern. The value of a variable is the number or descriptor that applies to a particular person, such as 5'6\" (168 cm), female, and never vaccinated. The line listing is one type of epidem iologic database, and is organized like a spreadsheet with rows and columns. Typically, each row is called a record or observation and represents one person or case of disease. Each column is called a variable and contains information about one characteristic of the individual, such as race or date of birth. The first colum n or variable of an epidemiologic database usually contains the person's name, initials, or identification number. Other columns might contain demographic information, clinical details, and exposures possibly related to illness.

Such small line listings are sometimes maintained by hand on a single sheet of paper. Other databases, such as birth or death records for the entire country, might have thousands of records and hundreds of variables and are best handled with a computer. However, even when records are computerized, a line listing with key variables is often printed to facilitate review of the data. Icon of the Epi Info computer software developed at CDC One computer software package that is widely used by epidemiologists to manage data is Epi Info, a free package developed at CDC. Epi I nfo allows the user to design a questionnaire, enter data right into the questionnaire, edit the data, and analyze the data. Two versions are available: Epi Info 3 (formerly Epi Info 2000 or Epi Info 2002) is Windows-based, and continues to be supported and upgraded. It is the recommended version and can be downloaded from the CDC we bsite: http://www.cdc.go v/epiinfo/downloads.htm. Epi Info 6 is DOS-based, widely used, but being phased out. This lesson includes Epi Info commands for creating frequency distributions and calculating som e of the measures of central location and spread described in the lesson. Since Epi Info 3 is the recomm ended version, only comm ands for this version are provided in the text; corresponding comm ands for Epi Info 6 are offered at the end of the lesson. Types of Variables Look again at the variables (colum ns) and values (individual entries in each colum n) in Table 2.1. If you were asked to summarize these data, how would you do it? First, notice that for certain variables, the values are numeric ; for others, the values are descriptive . The type of values influence the way in which the variables can be summarized. Variables can be classified into one of four type s, depending on the type of scale used to characterize their values (Table 2.2). Summarizing Data Page 2-4 Table 2.2 Types of Variables Scale Example Values Nomina l \\ \"categ orical\" or disease status yes / no Ordinal / \"qualitative\" ovarian cancer Stage I, II, III, or IV Interval \\ \"continuous\" or date of birth any date from recorded time to current Ratio / \"quantitative\" tuberculin skin test 0 - ??? of induration ! A nominal-scale variab le is one whose values are categories without any numerical ranking, such as county of residence. In epidem iology, nom inal variables with only two categories are very comm on: alive or dead, ill or w ell, vaccinated or unvaccinated, or did or did not eat the potato salad. A nominal variable with two mutually exclusive categories is sometimes called a dichotomous variable. ! An ordinal-scale variab le has values that can be ranked but are not necessarily evenly spaced, such as stage of cancer (see Table 2.3). ! An interval-scale variable is m easured on a scale of equally spaced units, but without a true zero point, such as date of birth. ! A ratio-scale variable is an interval variable with a true zero point, such as height in centimeters or duration of illness. Nominal- and ordinal-scale variables are considered qualitative or categorical variables, whereas interval- and ratio-scale variables are considered quantitative or continuous variables. Sometimes the same variable can be measured using both a nom inal scale and a ratio scale. For example, the tuberculin skin tests of a group of persons potentially exposed to a co -worker with tuberculosis can be m easured as \"positive\" or \"negative\" (nom inal scale) or in millimeters of induration (ratio scale). Table 2.3 Example of Ordi nal-Scale Variable: Stages of Breast Cancer* Stage Tumor Size Lymph Node I nvolvem ent Metasta sis (Spread) I II III IV Less than 2 cm Between 2 and 5 cm More than 5 cm Not applicable No No or in same side of breast Yes, on same side of breast Not applicable No No No Yes * This table describes the stages of breast cancer. Note that each stage is more extensive than the previous one and generally carries a less favorable prognosis, but you cannot say that the difference between Stages 1 and 3 is the same as the differe nce between Stages 2 and 4. Summarizing Data Page 2-5 Exercise 2.1 For each of the variables listed below from the line listing in Table 2.1, identify what type of variable it is. A. Nominal B. Ordinal C. Interval D. Ratio _____ 1. Date of diagnosis _____ 2. Town of residence _____ 3. Age (years) _____ 4. Sex _____ 5. Highest alanine aminotransferase (ALT) Check your answers on page 2-59 Summarizing Data Page 2-6 Frequency Distributions Look again at the data in Table 2.1. How m any of the cases (or case-patients) are male? When a database contains only a lim ited num ber of records, you can easily pick out the infor mation you need directly from the raw data. By scanning the 5th column, you can see that 12 of the 20 case-patients are male. With larger databases, however, picking out the desired information at a glance becomes increasingly difficult. To facilitate the task, the variables can be summarized into tables called frequency distributions . A frequency distribution displays the values a variable can take and the number of persons or records with each value. For exam ple, suppose you have data from a study of wom en with ovarian cancer and wish to look at parity, that is, the number of times each woman has given birth. To construct a frequency distribution that displays these data: ! First, list all the values that the variable parity can take, from the lowest possible value to the highest. ! Then, for each value, record the num ber of wom en who had that number of births (twins and other multiple-birth pregnancies count only once). Table 2.4 displays what the result ing frequency distribution would look like. Notice that the frequenc y distribution includes all values of parity between the lowest and highest observed, even though there were no wom en for som e values. Notice also that each column is clearly labeled, and that the total is given in the bottom row.

Table 2.4 displays the frequenc y distribution for a continuous variable. Continuous variables are often further summ arized with measures of central location and measures of spread. Distributions for ordinal and nominal variables are illustrated in Tables 2.5 and 2.6, respectively. Categorical variables are usually further summarized as ratios, proportions, and rates (discussed in Lesson 3).

Epi Info Demonstration: C reating a Frequency Distribution Scenario: In Oswego, New York, numerous people became sick with gastroenteritis after attending a church picnic. To identify all who became ill and to determine the source of illness, an epidemiologist administered a questionnaire to almost all of the attendees. The data from these questionnaires have been entered into an Epi Info file called Oswego. Question: In the outbreak that occurred in Oswego , how many of the participants became ill? Answ er: In Epi Info: Select Analyzin g Data. Select Read (Import). The default data set should be Samp le.mdb. Under Views, scroll down to view OSWEGO, and double click, or click once and then click OK. Select Frequen cies. Then click on the down arrow beneath Frequency of, scroll down and select ILL, then click OK. The resulting frequency distribution should indicate 46 ill persons, and 29 persons not ill. Your Turn: How many of the Oswego picnic attendees drank coffee? [Answer: 31] Summarizing Data Page 2-9 Exercise 2.2 At an influenza immu nization clinic at a retirement community, residents were asked in how many previous years they had received influenza vaccin e. The answers from the first 19 residents are listed below. Organize these data into a frequency distribution. 2, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 4, 8, 1, 3, 3, 12, 1, 6, 2, 5, 1 Check your answers on page 2-59 Summarizing Data Page 2-10 Graphing will be covered in Lesson 4 Properties of Frequency Distributions The data in a frequency distribut ion can be graphed. We call this type of graph a histogram. Figur e 2.1 is a graph of the number of outbreak-related salm onellosis case s by date of illness onset. Figure 2.1 Number of Outbreak-Related Salmonellosis Cases by Date of Onset of Illness-United States, June-July 2004 Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Outbreaks of Salmonella infections associated with eating Roma tomatoes-United States and Canada, 2004. MMWR 54;325-8. Even a quick look at this graph reveals three features: ! Where the distribution has its peak (central location), ! How widely dispersed it is on both sides of the peak (spread ), and ! Whether it is more or less symmetrically distributed on the two sides of the peak Central location Note that the data in Figure 2.1 seem to cluster around a central value, with progressively fewer persons on either side of this central value. This type of symm etric distribution, as illustrated in Figure 2.2, is the classic bell-s haped curve \u2014 also known as a norm al distribution. The clustering at a particular value is known as the central location or central tendency of a frequency distribution. The central location of a distribution is one of its most important properties. Sometimes it is cited as a single value that summarizes the entire distribution. Figure 2.3 illustrates the graphs of three frequency distributions identical in shape but with different central locations. Summarizing Data Page 2-11 Figure 2.2 Bell-Shaped Curve Figure 2.3 Three Identical Curves with Different Cen tral Locations Three measures of central location are comm only used in epidemiology: arithmetic mean , median, and mode. Two other measures that are used less often are the midrange and geometric mean. All of these m easures will be discussed later in this lesson. Depending on the shape of the frequency distribution, all m easures of central location can be identical or different. Additionally, measures of central location can be in the m iddle or off to one side or the other. Summarizing Data Page 2-12 Spread A second property of fre quency distribution is spread (also called variation or dispersion). Spread refers to the distribution out from a central value. Two measures of spread commonly used in epidemiology are range and standard deviation . For most distributions seen in epidem iology, the spread of a frequency distribution is independent of its central location. Figure 2.4 illustrates three theoretical frequency distributions that have the same central location but different amounts of spread. Measures of spread will be discusse d later in this lesson. Figure 2 .4 Three Distributi ons w ith Sam e Central Location but Diff erent Spreads Skewness refers to the tail, not the hump. So a distribution that is skewed to the left has a long left tail. Shape A third property of a fre quency distribution is its shape . The graphs of the three th eoretical frequency dist ributions in Figure 2.4 were completely symmetrical . Frequency distributions of som e characteristics of human populations tend to be symm etrical. On the other hand, the data on parity in Figure 2.5 are asymmetrical or more commonly referred to as skewed. Summarizing Data Page 2-13 Figure 2.5 Distribution of Case-Subjects by Parity, Ovarian Cancer Study, CDC Data Sources: Lee NC, Wingo PA, Gwinn ML, Rubin GL, Kendrick JS, Webster LA, Ory HW.

Oral contraceptive use and the risk of ovarian cancer. JAMA 1983;249:1596-9. A distribution that has a central location to the left and a tail off to the right is said to be positively skew ed or skewed to the right. In Figure 2.6, distribution A is skewed to the right. A distribution that has a central location to the right and a tail to the left is said to be negatively skew ed or skewed to the left. In Figure 2.6, distribution C is skewed to the left. Figure 2.6 Three Distributi ons with Different Skewn ess Summarizing Data Page 2-14 Question: How would you describe the parity data in F igure 2.5? Answer: Figure 2.5 is skewed to the right. Skew ing to the right is common in distributions that begi n with zero, such as number of servings consum ed, number of sexual partners in the past month, and number of hours spent in vigorous exercise in the past week. One distribution deserves special m ention \u2014 the Normal or Gaussian distribution . This is the classic symmetrical bell-shaped curve like the one shown in Figure 2.2. It is defined by a mathematical equation and is very important in statistics. Not only do the mean, median, and mode coincide at the central peak, but the area under the curve helps determine measures of spread such as the standard deviation and confidence interval covered later in this lesson. Methods for Summarizing Data Knowing the type of variable helps you decide how to summa rize the data. Table 2.7 displays the wa ys in which dif ferent variables might be summarized. Table 2.7 Methods for Summarizing Different Types o f Variables Ratio or Measure of Measure of Scale Proporti on Central Locatio n Spread Nominal yes no no Ordinal yes no no Interval yes, but might need yes yes to group first Ratio yes, but might need yes yes to group first Summarizing Data Page 2-15 Measure of central location: a single, usually central, value that best represents an entire distribution of data. Measures of Central Location A measure of central location provides a single value that summarizes an entire distributi on of data. Suppose you had data from an outbreak of gastroenter itis affecting 41 persons who had recen tly attended a wedding. If your superviso r asked you to describe the ages of the affected persons, you could simply list the ages of each person. Alternatively, y our superv isor m ight prefer one summary number \u2014 a measure of central location. Saying that the mean (or average) age was 48 years rather than reciting 41 ages is certainly m ore efficient, and most likely more meaningful. Measures of central location include the mode, median, arithmetic mean , midrange , and geometric mean . Selecting the best measure to use for a given distribution depends largely on two factors: ! The shape or skewness of the distribution, and ! The intended use of the measure. Each m easure \u2014 what it is, how to calculate it, and when best to use it \u2014 is described in this section. Mode Definition of mode The mode is the value that occurs most often in a set of data. It can be determined simply by tallying the number of times each value occurs. Consider, for example, the num ber of doses of diphtheria- pertuss is-tetanus (DPT) vaccine each of seventeen 2-year-old children in a particular village received: 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4 Two children received no doses; two children received 1 dose; three received 2 doses; six received 3 doses; and four received all 4 doses. Therefore, the mode is 3 doses, because more children received 3 doses than any other num ber of doses. Method for identifying the mode Step 1. Arrange the observations into a frequency distribution, indicating the values of the variable and the frequency with which each value occurs. (Alternatively, for a data set with only a few values, arrange the actual values in ascending order, as was done with the DPT vaccine doses above.) Step 2. Identify the value that occurs most often. Summarizing Data Page 2-16 EXAMPLES: Identifying the Mode Example A : Table 2.8 (on page 2-17) provides data from 30 patients who were hospitalized and received antibiotics. For the variable \"length of stay\" (LOS) in the hospital, identify the mode. Step 1. Arrang e the data in a frequency distribution. LOS Frequency LOS Frequency LOS Frequency 0 1 10 5 20 0 1 0 11 1 21 0 2 1 12 3 22 1 3 1 13 1 . 0 4 1 14 1 . 0 5 2 15 0 27 1 6 1 16 1 . 0 7 1 17 0 . 0 8 1 18 2 49 1 9 3 19 1 Alternatively, arrange the values in ascending order. 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 11, 12, 12, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 18, 19, 22, 27, 49 Step 2. Identify the value that occurs most often. Most values appear once, but the distribution includes 2 5s, 3 9s, 5 10s, 3 12s, and 2 18s. Because 10 appears most frequently, the mode is 10. Example B: Find the mode of the following incubation periods for hepatitis A: 27, 31, 15, 30, and 22 days. Step 1. Arrange the values in ascendi ng order. 15, 22, 27, 30, and 31 days Step 2. Identify the value that occurs most often. None Note: When no value occurs more than once, the distribution is said to have no mode. Example C : Find the mode of the following incubation periods for Bacillus cereus food poisoning: 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 11, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 14, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21 hours Step 1. Arrange the values in ascendi ng order. Done Step 2. Identify the values that occur most often. Five 3s and five 12s Example C illustrates the fact that a frequenc y distribution can have more than one mode. When this occurs, the distribution is said to be bi-modal. Indeed, Bacillus cereus is known to cause two syndro mes with different incubation periods: a short-incubati on-period (1-6 syndrome characterized by vomiting; and a long- incubation-period (6-24 hours) syndrome characterized by diarrhea.

Thus, the best way to identify the mode is to create a histogram and look for the tallest column(s). Select graphs, then choose histogram under Graph Type. The tallest column(s) is(are) the mode(s). NOTE: The Means command provides a mode, but only the lowest value if a distribution has more than one mode. Properties and uses of the mode ! The m ode is the easiest m easure of c entral location to understand and explain. It is also the easiest to identify, and requires no calculations. ! The mode is the preferred measure of central location for addressing which value is the most popular or the m ost common. For exam ple, the m ode is used to describe which day of the week people most prefer to come to the influenza vaccination clinic, or the \"typical\" number of doses of DPT the children in a particular comm unity have received by their second birthday. ! As de monstrated, a distributi on can have a single mode. However, a distribution has more than one mode if two or more values tie as the most frequent values. It has no m ode if no value appears m ore than once. ! The mode is used almost exclusively as a \"descriptive\" measure. It is almost never used in statistical manipulations or analyses. ! The m ode is not typically affected by one or two extrem e values (outliers). Summarizing Data Page 2-19 Exercise 2.3 Using the same vaccination data as in Exercise 2.2, find the mode. (If you answered Exercise 2.2, find the mode from your frequency distribution.) 2, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 4, 8, 1, 3, 3, 12, 1, 6, 2, 5, 1 Check your answers on page 2-59 Summarizing Data Page 2-20 To identify the median from a data set in Analysis Module: Click on the Means command under the Statistics folder. In the Means Of drop- down box, select the variable of interest ! Select Variable Click OK ! You should see the list of the frequency by the variable you selected. Scroll down until you see the Median among other data. Median Definition of median The median is the middle value of a set of data that has been put into rank order. Similar to the median on a highway that divides the road in two, the statistical median is the value that divides the data into tw o halves, with one half of the observations being smaller than the median value and the other half being larger. The median is also the 50th percentile of the distribution. Suppose you had the following ages in years for patients with a particular illness: 4, 23, 28, 31, 32 The median age is 28 years, because it is the middle value, with two values smaller than 28 and two values larger than 28. Method for identifying the median Step 1. Arrange the observations into increasing or decreasing order. Step 2. Find the middle position of the distribution by using the following form ula: Middle position = (n + 1) / 2 a. If the number of observations (n) is odd, the middle position falls on a single observation. b. If the num ber of observations is even, the middle position falls between two observations. Step 3. Identify the value at the middle position. a. If the number of observations (n) is odd and the middle position falls on a single observation, the median equals the value of that observation. b. If the num ber of observations is even and the middle position falls between two observations, the median equals the average of the two values. Summarizing Data Page 2-21 EXAMPLES: Identifying the Median Example A: Odd Number of Observations Find the median of the followi ng incubation periods for hepatitis A: 27, 31, 15, 30, and 22 days. Step 1. Arrange the values in ascendi ng order. 15, 22, 27, 30, and 31 days Step 2. Find the middle position of the distribution by using (n + 1) / 2. Middle position = (5 + 1) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3 Therefore, the median will be the value at the third observa tion. Step 3. Identify the value at the middl e position. Third observation = 27 days Example B: Even Number of Observations Suppose a sixth case of hepat itis was reporte d. Now find the median of the followi ng incubation periods for hepatitis A: 27, 31, 15, 30, 22 and 29 days. Step 1. Arrange the values in ascendi ng order. 15, 22, 27, 29, 30, and 31 days Step 2. Find the middle position of the distribution by using (n + 1) / 2. Middle location = 6 + 1 / 2 = 7 / 2 = 3\u00bd Therefore, the median will be a value halfwa y between the values of the third and fourth observations. Step 3. Identify the value at the middl e position. The median equals the averag e of the values of the third (value = 27) and fourth (value = 29) observations: Median = (27 + 29) / 2 = 28 days Summarizing Data Page 2-22 Properties and uses of the median ! The median is a good descriptive measure, particularly for data that are skewed, because it is the central point of the distribution. ! The median is relatively easy to identify. It is equal to either a single observed value (if odd number of observations) or the average of two observed values (if even number of observations). ! The median, like the mode, is not generally affected by one or two extreme values (outliers). For example, if the values on the previous page had been 4, 23, 28, 31, and 131 (instead of 31), the m edian would still be 28. ! The median has less-than-ideal statistical properties. Therefore, it is not often used in statistical m anipulations and analyses.

The arithmetic mean is the value that is closest to all the other values in a distribution. Method for calculating the mean Step 1. Add all of the observed va lues in the distribution. Step 2. Divide the sum by the number of observations. EXAMPLE: Finding the Mean Find the mean of the followi ng incubation periods for hepatitis A: 27, 31, 15, 30, and 22 days. Step 1. Add all of the observed values in the distribution. 27 + 31 + 15 + 30 + 22 = 125 Step 2. Divide the sum by the number of observations. 125 / 5 = 25.0 Therefore, the mean incubatio n period is 25.0 days. To identify the mean from a data set in Analysis Module: Click on the Means command under the Statistics folder In the Means Of drop- down box, select the variable of interest ! Select Variable Click OK ! You should see the list of the frequency by the variable you selected. Scroll down until you see the Mean among other data. Properties and uses of the arithmetic mean ! The mean has excellent statistical properties and is comm only used in add itional s tatistical manipulations and analyses. One such property is called the centering property of the mean. When the mean is subtracted from each observation in the data set, the sum of these differences is zero (i.e., the negative sum is equal to the positive sum). For the data in the previous hepatitis A exam ple: Value minu s Mean Differen ce 15 22 - 25.0 -3.0 27 - 25.0 + 2.0 30 - 25.0 + 5.0 31 - 25.0 + 6.0 125 - 125.0 = 0 + 13.0 - 13.0 = 0 Summarizing Data Page 2-25 Mean: the center of gravity of the distribution This demonstrates that the mean is the arithmetic center of the distribution. ! Because of this centering property, the mean is sometimes called the center of gravit y of a frequency distribution. If the frequency distribution is plotte d on a graph, and the graph is balanced on a fulcrum, the point at which the distribution would balance would be the mean. ! The arithmetic mean is the best descriptive measure for data that are normally distributed. ! On the other hand, the mean is not the m easure of choice for data that are severely skewed or have extrem e values in one direction or another. Because the arithmetic mean uses all of the observations in the distri bution, it is affected by any extreme value. Suppose that the last value in the previous distribution was 131 instead of 31. The mean would be 225 / 5 = 45.0 rather than 25.0. As a result of one extremely large value, the mean is much larger than all values in the distribution except the extreme value (the \"outlier\"). Epi Info Demons tration: Finding the Mean Question: In the data set named SMOKE, what is the mean weight of the participants? Answ er: In Epi Info: Select Analyze Data. Select Read (Import).

[Answer: 17] Summarizing Data Page 2-26 Exercise 2.5 Determine the mean for the same set of vaccination data. 2, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 4, 8, 1, 3, 3, 12, 1, 6, 2, 5, 1 Check your answers on page 2-60 Summarizing Data Page 2-27 The midrange (midpoint of an interval) Definition of midrange The m idrange is the half-way point or the m idpoint of a set of observations. The m idrange is usually calculated as an intermediate step in determining other measures. Method for identifying the midrang e Step 1. Identify the smallest (minimum) observation and the largest (maximum) observation Step 2. Add the m inimum plus the m aximum, then divide by two. Exception: Age differs from most ot her variables because age does not follow the usual rules fo r rounding to the nearest integer. Someone who is 17 years and 360 da ys old cannot claim to be 18 year old for at least 5 m ore days. Thus, to identify the m idrange for age (in years) data, you must add the smallest (minimum) observation plus the largest (maximum) observation plus 1, then divide by two. Midrange (most types of data) = (minimum + maximum) / 2 Midrange (age data) = (m inimum + m aximum + 1) / 2 Consider the following exam ple: In a particular pre-school, chil dren are assigned to room s on the basis of age on September 1. Room 2 holds all of the children who were at least 2 years old but not yet 3 years old as of September 1. In other words, every child in room 2 was 2 years old on September 1. What is the midrange of ages of the children in room 2 on September 1? For descriptive purposes, a reasonab le answer is 2. However, recall that the midrange is usually calculated as an intermediate step in other calculations. Therefore, more precision is necessary. Consider that children born in A ugust have just turned 2 years old. Others, born in Septem ber the prev ious year, are almost but not quite 3 years old. Ignoring seasonal trends in births and assum ing a very large room of children, birthdays are expected to be uniformly distributed throughout the year. The youngest child, born on Septem ber 1, is exactly 2.000 years old. The oldest child, whose birthday is September 2 of the previous year, is 2.997 years old. Summarizing Data Page 2-28 For statistical purposes, the mean and m idrange of this theoretical group of 2-year-olds are both 2.5 years. Properties and uses of the midrange ! The midrange is not commonl y reported as a measure of central location. ! The midrange is more commonly used as an intermediate step in other calculations, or f or plotti ng graphs of data collected in intervals. EXAMPLES: Identifying the Midrange Example A: Find the midrange of the followi ng incubation periods for hepatitis A: 27, 31, 15, 30, and 22 days. Step 1. Identify the minimum and maximum values. Minimum = 15, maximum = 31 Step 2. Add the minim um plus the maximum, then divide by two. Midrange = 15 + 31 / 2 = 46 / 2 = 23 days Example B: Find the midran ge of the grouping 15-24 (e.g., number of alcoholic beverages consume d in one week). Step 1. Identify the minimum and maximum values. Minimum = 15, maximum = 24 Step 2. Add the minim um plus the maximum, then divide by two. Midrange = 15 + 24 / 2 = 39 / 2 = 19.5 This calculation assumes that the grouping 15-24 really covers 14.50-24.49.... Since the midrange of 14.50-24.49... = 19.49..., the midrange can be reported as 19.5. Example C: Find the midrange of the age group 15-24 years. Step 1. Identify the minimum and maximum values. Minimum = 15, maximum = 24 Step 2. Add the minim um plus the maximum plus 1, then divide by two. Midrange = (15 + 24 + 1) / 2 = 40 / 2 = 20 years Age differs from the majority of other variables because age does not follow the usual rules for rounding to the nearest integer . For most variables, 15.99 can be rounded to 16. However, an adolescent who is 15 years and 360 days old canno t claim to be 16 years old (and hence get his driver's license or learner's permit) for at least 5 more days. Thus, the interval of 15-24 years really spans 15.0-24.99... years. The midrange of 15.0 and 24.99... = 19.99... = 20.0 years. Summarizing Data Page 2-29 To calculate the geometric mean, you need a scientific calcul ator with log and yx keys. Geometric mean Definition of geometric mean The geometric mean is the mean or average of a set of data measured on a logarithmic scale. The geometric mean is used when the logarithm s of the obser vations are distributed normally (symmetrically) rather than the observations themselves. The geom etric mean is particularly us eful in the laboratory for data from serial dilution assays (1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, etc.) and in environmental sampling data. More About Logarithms A logarithm is the power to which a base is raised. To what power would you need to raise a base of 10 to get a value of 100? Because 10 times 10 or 102 equals 100, the log of 100 at base 10 equals 2. Similarly, the log of 16 at base 2 equals 4, because 24 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 16. 20 = 1 (anything raised to the 0 power is 1) 21 = 2 = 2 22 = 2 x 2 = 4 23 = 2 x 2 x 2 = 8 24 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 16 25 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 32 26 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 64 27 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 128 and so on. 100 = 1 (Anyt hing raised to the 0 power equals 1) 101 = 10 102 = 100 103 = 1,000 104 = 10,000 105 = 100,000 106 = 1,000,00 0 107 = 10,000,0 00 and so on. An antilog raises the base to the power (logarithm ). For example, the antilog of 2 at base 10 is 102, or 100. The antilog of 4 at base 2 is 24, or 16. The majority of titers are reported as multiples of 2 (e.g., 2, 4, 8, etc.); therefore, base 2 is typically used when dealing with titers. Method for calculating the geometric mean There are two methods for calculating the geom etric m ean. Method A Step 1. Take the logarithm of each value. Step 2. Calculate the m ean of the log values by summing the log values, then dividing by the number of observations. Step 3. Take the antilog of the mean of the log values to get the geometric mean. Method B Step 1. Calculate the product of the values by multiplying all of the values together. Step 2. Take the nth root of the product (whe re n is the number of observations) to get the geometric mean. Summarizing Data Page 2-30 EXAMPLES: Calculating the Geometric Mean Example A: Using Method A Calculate the geometric mean from the following set of data. 10, 10, 100, 100, 100, 100, 10,000, 100,000, 100,000, 1,000,000 Because these values are all multiples of 10, it makes sense to use logs of base 10. Step 1. Take the log (in this case, to base 10) of each value. log10(xi) = 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 5, 5, 6 Step 2. Calculate the mean of the log values by summing and dividing by the number of observations (in this case, 10). Mean of log10(xi) = (1+1+2+2+2+2+4+5+5+6) / 10 = 30 / 10 = 3 Step 3. Take the antilog of the mean of the log values to get the geometric mean. Antilog10(3) = 103 = 1,000. The geometric mean of the set of data is 1,000. Example B: Using Method B Calculate the geometric mean from the following 95% confidence intervals of an odds ratio: 1.0, 9.0 Step 1. Calculate the product of the values by multiplying all values together. 1.0 x 9.0 = 9.0 Step 2. Take the square root of the product. The geometric mean = square root of 9.0 = 3.0. Summarizing Data Page 2-31 Scientific Calculator Tip On most scientific calculators, the sequence for calculating a geometric mean is: ! Enter a data point. ! Press either the <Log> or <Ln> function key. ! Record the result or store it in memory. ! Repeat for all values. ! Calculate the mean or average of these log values. ! Calculate the antilog value of this mean (<10x> key if you used <Log> key, <ex> key if you used <Ln> key). Practice: Find the geometric mean of 10, 100 and 1000 using a scientific calculator. Calculat or Enter: Displays: 10 10 LOG 1 + 1 100 100 LOG 2 + 3 1000 1000 LOG 3 = 6 3 3 = 2 10x 100 Properties and uses of the geometric mean ! The geometric mean is the average of logarithmic values, converted back to the base. The geom etric m ean tends to dampen the effect of extreme values and is always smaller than the corresponding arithmetic mean. In that sense, the geom etric mean is less sensitive than the arithmetic mean to one or a few extreme values. ! The geometric mean is the measure of choice for variables measured on an exponential or logarithmic scale, such as dilutional titers or assays. ! The geometric mean is often used for environmental samples, when levels can range over several orders of m agnitude. For exam ple, levels of coliform s in sa mples taken from a body of water can range from less than 100 to more than 100,000. Summarizing Data Page 2-32 Exercise 2.6 Using the dilution titers shown below, calculate the geometric mean titer of convalesc ent antibodies against tularemi a among 10 residents of Martha's Vineyard. [Hint: Use only the second number in the ratio, i.e., for 1:640 , use 640.] # your answers on page 2-60 Summarizing Data Page 2-33 Selecting the appropriate measure Measures of central location are single values that summarize the observed values of a distributi on. The m ode provides the m ost common value, the m edian provi des the central value, the arithmetic mean provides the average value, the midrange provides the midpoint value, and the geometric mean provides the logarithmic average. The mode and median are useful as descriptive measures. However, they are not often used for further statistical manipulations. In contrast, the m ean is not only a good descriptive measure, but it also has good statistical properties. The m ean i s used m ost often in additional statistical m anipulations. While the arithmetic mean is the measure of choice when data are normally distributed, the median is the measure of choice for data that are not norm ally distributed. Because epidem iologic data tend not to be norm ally distributed (incubation periods, doses, ages of patients), the median is often preferred. The geometric mean is used m ost comm only wi th laborato environm ental sampling data. The arithmetic mean uses all the data, which makes it sensitive to outliers. Although the geom etric m ean also uses all the data, it is not as sensitive to outliers as th e arithm etic mean. The midrange, which is based on the m inimum and m aximum values, is m ore sensitive to outliers than any other measures. The mode and median tend not to be affected by outliers. In summary, each measure of central location \u2014 mode, median, mean, midrange, and geom etric mean \u2014 is a single value that is used to represent all of the obser ved values of a distribution. Each measure has its advantages and limitations. The selection of the most appropriate measure requires judgm ent based on the characteristics of the data (e.g., norm ally distributed or skewed, with or without outliers, arithm etic or log scale) and the reason for calculating the measure (e.g., for descriptive or analytic purposes).

Just as m easures of central location describe where the peak is located, measures of spread describe the dispersion (or variation) of values from that pe ak in the distribution. Measures of spread include the range , interquartile range , and standard deviation. Range Definition of range The range of a set of data is the difference between its largest (maximum) value and its smallest (minimum) value. In the statistical world, the range is reported as a single num ber and is the result of subtracting the maximum from the minimum value. In the epidemiologic community, the range is usually reported as \"from (the minimum) to (the maximum),\" that is, as two numbers rather than one. Method for identifying the range Step 1. Identify the smallest (minimum) observation and the largest (maximum) observation. Step 2. Epidemiologically, report the minimum and maximum values. Statistically, subtr act the minimum from the maximum value. EXAMPLE: Identifying the Range Find the range of the followin g incubation periods for hepatitis A: 27, 31, 15, 30, and 22 days. Step 1. Identify the minimum and maximum values. Minimum = 15, maximum = 31 Step 2. Subtract the minimum from the maximum value. Range = 31-15 = 16 days For an epidemio logic or lay audience, you could report that \"incubatio n periods ranged from 15 to 31 days.\" Statistically, that range is 16 days. Summarizing Data Page 2-36 Percentiles Percentiles divide the data in a distribution into 100 equal parts. The Pth percentile (P ranging from 0 to 100) is the value that has P percent of the observations falling at or below it. In other words, the 90th percentile has 90% of the obs ervations at or below it. The median, the halfway point of the distribution, is the 50th percentile. The m aximum value is the 100th percentile, because all values fall at or below the m aximum. Quartiles Sometimes, epidemiologists group data into four equal parts, or quartiles. Each quartile includes 25% of the data. The cut-off for the first quartile is the 25th percentile. The cut-off for the second quartile is the 50th percen tile, which is the m edian. The cut-off for the third quartile is the 75th percentile. And the cut-off for the fourth quartile is the 100th percentile, which is the maximum. Interquartile range The interquartile range is a m easure of spread used most commonly with the m edian. It repres ents the central portion of the distribution, from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile. In other words, the interquartile range includes the second and third quartiles of a distribu tion. The interquartile range thus includes approxim ately one half of the obser vations in the set, leaving one quarter of the observations on each side. Method for determining the interquartile range Step 1. Arrange the observations in increasing order. Step 2. Find the position of the 1st and 3rd quartiles with the following form ulas. Divide the sum by the num ber of observations. Position of 1st quartile (Q1) = 25th percentile = (n + 1) / 4 Position of 3rd quartile (Q3) = 75th percentile = 3(n + 1) / 4 = 3 x Q 1 Step 3. Identify the value of the 1st and 3rd quartiles. a. If a quartile lies on an observation (i.e., if its position is a whole number), the value of the quartile is the value of that observation. For example, if the position of a quartile is 20, its value is the value of the 20th observation. Summarizing Data Page 2-37 b. If a quartile lies betw een observations , the value of the quartile is the value of the lower observation plus the specified fraction of the difference between the observations. For exam ple, if the position of a quartile is 20\u00bc, it lies between the 20th and 21st observations, and its value is the value of the 20th observation, plus \u00bc the difference between the value of the 20th and 21st observations. Step 4. Epidem iologically, report the values at Q 1 and Q 3. Statistically, calculate the interquartile range as Q3 minus Q 1. Figure 2.7 The Middle Half of the Observations in a Frequency Distribution Lie within the Interquartile Range Summarizing Data Page 2-38 EXAMPLE: Finding the Interquartile Range Find the interquartile range for the length of stay data in Table 2.8 on page 2-17. Step 1. Arrange the observations in increasing order. 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 11, 12, 12, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 18, 19, 22, 27, 49 Step 2. Find the position of the 1st and 3rd quartiles. Note that the distribution has 30 observations. Position of Q1 = (n + 1) / 4 = (30 + 1) / 4 = 7.75 Position of Q3 = 3(n + 1) / 4 =3(30 + 1) / 4 = 23.25 Thus, Q1 lies \u00be of the way between the 7th and 8th obser vations, and Q3 lies \u00bc of the way between the 23rd and 24th observations. Step 3. Identify the value of the 1st and 3rd quartiles (Q1 and Q3). Value of Q1: The position of Q1 is 7\u00be; theref ore, the value of Q1 is equal to the value of the 7th observation plus \u00be of the differenc e between the values of the 7th and 8th observations: Value of the 7th observation: 6 Value of the 8th observation: 7 Q1 = 6 + \u00be(7 ! 6) = 6 + \u00be(1) = 6.75 Value of Q3: The position of Q3 was 23\u00bc; thus, the value of Q3 is equal to the value of the 23rd observation plus \u00bc of the differenc e between the value of the 23rd and 24th observations: Value of the 23rd observation: 14 Value of the 24th observation: 16 Q3 = 14 + \u00bc(16 ! 14) = 14 + \u00bc(2) = 14 + (2 / 4) = 14.5 Step 4. Calculate the interquartile range as Q3 minus Q1. Q3 = 14.5 Q1 = 6.75 Interquartile range = 14.5!6.75 = 7.75 As indicated above, the median for the length of stay data is 10. Note that the distance between Q1 and the median is 10 - 6.75 = 3.25. The distance between Q3 and the median is 14.5 - 10 = 4.5. This indicates that the length of stay data is skewed slightly to the right (to the longer lengths of stay). Summarizing Data Page 2-39 Properties and uses of the interquartile range ! The interquartile range is genera lly used in conjunction with the median. Together, they are useful for characterizing the central location and spread of any frequency distribution, but particularly those that are skewed. ! For a more complete characterization of a frequency distribution, the 1st and 3rd quartiles are sometimes used with the m inimum value, the m edian, and the m aximum value to produce a five-num ber summ ary of t he distribution. For example, the five-number summary for the length of stay data is: Minimum value = 0, Q1 = 6.75, Median = 10, Q3 = 14.5, and Maximum value = 49. ! Together, the five values provi de a good description of the center, spread, and shape of a distribution. These f ive values can be used to draw a graphical illustration of the data, as in the boxplot in Figure 2.8. Epi Info Demonstration: Finding the Interquartile Range Question: In the data set named SMOKE, what is the interquartile range for the weight of the participants? Answ er: In Epi Info: Select Analyze Data . Select Read (Import). The default data set should be Sample.mdb. Under Views, scroll down to view SMOKE , and double click, or click once and then click OK. Click on Select. Then type in weight < 770, or select weigh t from available values, then type < 770, and click on OK. Select Means . Then click on the down arrow beneath Means of, scroll down and select WEIGHT, then click OK. Scroll to the bottom of the output to find the first quartile (25% = 130) and the third quartile (75% = 180). So the interqua rtile range runs from 130 to 180 pounds, for a range of 50 pounds.

The cumulative percentage, which represents the percentage of observations at or below that value, gives you the percentile (see Table 2.10).

This shortcut m ethod gives slightly different results than those you would calculate by hand, but usua lly the differences are m inor. For exam ple, the output in Ta ble 2.10 indicates that the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles correspond to lengt hs of stay of 7, 10 and 14 days, not substantially differe nt from the 6.75, 10 and 14.5 days calculated above.

Earlier, the centering property of the mean was described \u2014 subtracting the mean from each observation and then summing the differences adds to 0. This concept of subtracting the mean from each observation is the basis for the standard deviation. Howe ver, the difference between the mean and each observation is squared to elim inate negative numbers. Then the average is calculated and the square root is taken to get back to the original units. Method for calculating the standard deviation Step 1. Calculate the arithmetic mean. Step 2. Subtract the mean from each observation. Square the difference. Step 3. Sum the squared differences. Step 4. Divide the sum of the squared differences by n - 1. Step 5. Take the square root of the value obtained in S tep 4. The result is the standard deviation . To calculate the standard deviation from a data set in Analysis Module: Click on the Means command under the Statistics folder In the Means Of drop-down box, select the variable of interest ! Select Variable Click OK ! You should see the list of the frequency by the variable you selected. Scroll down until you see the Standard Deviation (Std Dev) and other data. Properties and uses of the standard deviation ! The num eric value of the standard deviation does not have an easy, non-statistical interpretation, but similar to other measures of spread, the standard deviation c onveys how widely or tightly the observations are distributed from the center. From the previous example, the mean incubation period was 25 days, with a standard deviation of 6.6 days. If the st andard deviation in a second outbreak had been 3.7 days (with the same mean incubation period of 25 days), you could say that the incubation periods in the second outbreak showed less vari ability than did the incubation periods of the first outbreak. ! Standard deviation is usually ca lculated only when the data are more-or-less \"norm ally distributed,\" i.e., the data fall into a typical bell-shaped curve. For normally distributed data, the arithmetic mean is the recommended measure of central location, and the standard deviation is the recommended measure of spread. In fact, means should never be reported without their associated standard deviation. Summarizing Data Page 2-44 EXAMPLE: Calculating the Standard Deviation Find the mean of the followin g incubation periods for hepatitis A: 27, 31, 15, 30, and 22 days. Step 1. Calculate the arithmetic mean. Mean = (27 + 31 + 15 + 30 +22) / 5 = 125 / 5 = 25.0 Step 2. Subtract the mean from each observation. Square the difference. Value Minus Mean Difference Difference Squared 27 - 25.0 + 2.0 4.0 31 - 25.0 + 6.0 36.0 15 - 25.0 -10.0 100.0 30 - 25.0 + 5.0 25.0 22 - 25.0 - 3.0 9.0 Step 3. Sum the squared differences. Sum = 4 + 36 + 100 + 25 + 9 = 174 Step 4. Divide the sum of the squared differences by (n - 1). This is the variance. Variance = 174 / (5 - 1) = 174 / 4 = 43.5 days squared Step 5. Take the square root of the variance. The result is the standard deviation. Standard deviation = square root of 43.5 = 6.6 days Summarizing Data Page 2-45 Areas included in normal distribution: +1 SD includes SD includes 95.5% +3 SD includes 99.7% Consider the normal curve illustrated in Figure 2.9. The mean is at the center, and data are equally di stributed on either side of this mean. The points that show \u00b11, 2, and 3 standard deviations are marked on the x axis. For normally distributed data, approximately two-thirds (68.3%, to be exact) of th e data fall within one standard deviation of either side of the m ean; 95.5% of the data fall within two standard deviations of the mean; and 99.7% of the data fall within three standard deviations . Exactly 95.0% of the data fall within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean.

However, the two are not the same. The standard deviation describes variability in a set of data. The standard error of the mean refers to variability we m ight expect in the arithm etic m eans of repeated samples taken from the same population. The standard error assum es that the data you have is actually a sample from a larger populati on. According to the assum ption, your sam ple is just one of an in finite number of possible samples that could be taken from the source population. Thus, the m ean for your sam ple is just one of an in finite number of other sample means. The standard error quantifie s the variation in those sample means. Method for calculating the standard error of the mean Step 1. Calculate the standard deviation. Step 2. Divide the standard deviati on by the square root of the number of observations (n). EXAMPLE: Finding the Standard Error of the Mean Find the stand ard error of the mean for the length-of-stay data in Table 2.10, given that the standard deviation is 9.1888. Step 1. Calculate the standard deviation. Standard deviation (given) = 9.188 Step 2. Divide the standard deviation by the square root of n. n = 30 Standard error of the mean = 9.188 / \"30 = 9.188 / 5.477 = 1.67 Properties and uses of the standard error of the mean ! The primary practical use of the standard error of the mean is in calculating confidence interv als around the arithm etic m ean. (Confidence intervals are addressed in the next section.) Summarizing Data Page 2-48 Confidence limits (confidence interval) Definition of a confiden ce interval Often, epidem iologists conduct studies not only to measure characteristics in the subjects studied, but also to make generalizations about the larger population from which these subjects cam e. This process is called inference. For example, political pollsters use samples of perhaps 1,000 or so people f rom across the country to make inferences about which presidential candidate is likely to win on Election Day. Usually, the inference includes some consideration about the precision of the measurement. (The results of a political poll may be reported to have a m argin of error of, say, pl us or m inus three points.) In epidemiology, a common way to indicate a measurement's precision is by providing a confidence interval. A narrow confidence interval indicates high precision; a wide confidence interval indicates low precision. Confidence intervals are calcu lated for some but not all epidemiologic measures. The two measures covered in this lesson for which confidence intervals are often presented are the mean and the geometric mean. Confidence intervals can also be calculated for some of the epidemiologic measures covered in Lesson 3, such as a proportion, risk ratio, and odds ratio. The confidence interval for a m ean is based on the m ean itself and some multiple of the standard error of the mean. Recall that the standard error of the mean refers to the variability of means that might be calculated from repeated samples from the sam e population. Fortunately, regardless of how the data are distributed, means (particularly from large samples) tend to be normally distributed. (This is from an argum ent known as the Central Lim it Theorem). So we can use Figure 2.9 to show that the range from the mean minus one standard deviation to the mean plus one standard deviation includes 68.3% of the area under the curve. Consider a population-based sam ple survey in which the m ean total cholesterol level of adult females was 206, with a standard error of the mean of 3. If this survey were repeated m any times, 68.3% of the m eans would be expected to fall between the m ean minus 1 standard error and the mean plus 1 standard error, i.e., between 203 and 209. One m ight sa y that the investigators are 68.3% confident those lim its cont ain the actual mean of the population. Summarizing Data Page 2-49 In public health, investigators generally want to have a greater level of confidence than that, and usually set the confidence level at 95%. Although the statistical defi nition of a confidence interval is that 95% of the confidence intervals from an infinite num ber of similarly conducted samples would include the true population values, this definition has little meaning for a single study. More commonly, epidem iologists interpret a 95% confidence interval as the range of values consistent with the data from their study. Method for calculating a 95% confidence interval for a mean Step 1. Calculate the mean and its standard error. Step 2. Multip ly the standard error by 1.96. Step 3. Lower limit of the 95% confidence interval = mean minus 1.96 x standard error. Upper limit of the 95% confidence interval = mean plus 1.96 x standard error. EXAMPLE: Calculating a 95% Confidence Interval for a Mean Find the 95% confidence interval for a mean total choles terol level of 206, standard error of the mean of 3. Step 1. Calculate the mean and its error. Mean = 206, standard error of the mean = 3 (both given) Step 2. Multiply the standard error by 1.96. 3 x 1.96 = 5.88 Step 3. Lower limit of the 95% confidence interv al = mean minus 1.96 x standard error. 206 - 5.88 = 200.12 Upper limit of the 95% confidence interv al = mean plus 1.96 x standard error. 206 + 5.88 = 211.88 Rounding to one decimal, the 95% confidence interval is 200.1 to 211.9. In other words, this study's best estimate of the true popula tion mean is 206, but is consistent with values ranging from as low as 200.1 and as high as 211.9. Thus, the confidence interval indicates how precise the estimate is. (This confidence interval is narrow, indicating that the sampl e mean of 206 is fairly precise.) It also indicates how confident the researchers should be in drawing inferences from the sample to the entire population. Properties and uses of confidence intervals ! The mean is not the only measure for which a confidence interval can or should be calcu lated. Confidence intervals are also comm only calculated for pr oportions, rates, risk ratios, Summarizing Data Page 2-50 odds ratios, and other epidemiologic measures when the purpose is to draw inferences from a sample survey or study to the larger population. ! Most epidemiologic studies are not performed under the ideal conditions required by the theory behind a confidence interval. As a result, most epidem iologists take a common-sense approach rather than a strict statistical approach to the interpretation of a confidence interval, i.e., the confidence interval represents the range of values consistent with the data from a study, and is simply a guide to the variability in a study. ! Confidence intervals for means, proportions, risk ratios, odds ratios, and other m easures all are calculated using different formulas. The for mula for a confidence interval of the m ean is well accepted, as is the formula for a confidence interval for a proportion. However, a number of different formulas are available for risk ratios and odds ratios. Since dif ferent formulas can som etimes give di fferent results, this supports interpreting a confidence interval as a guide rather than as a strict range of values. ! Regardless of the measure, the interpretation of a confidence interval is the same: the narrower the interval, the more precise the estimate; and the range of values in the interval is the range of population values m ost consistent with the data from the study. Demonstration: Using Confidence Intervals Imagine you are going to Las Vegas to bet on the true mean total cholesterol level among adult women in the United States. Question: On what numb er are you going to bet? Answ er: On 206, since that is the number found in the samp le. The mean you calculated from your sample is your best guess of the true population mean. Question: How does a confidence interval help? Answ er: It tells you how much to bet! If the confide nce interval is narrow, your best guess is relatively precise, and you might feel comfortable (confident) betting more. But if the confidence interval is wide, your guess is relatively imprecise, and you should bet less on that one number, or perhaps not bet at all!

Check your answers on page 2-62 Summarizing Data Page 2-52 Choosing the Right Measure of Central Location and Spread Measures of central location and sp read are useful for summarizing a distribution of data. They also f acilitate the comparison of two or more sets of data. However, not every m easure of central location and spread is well suited to every set of data. For example, because the norm al distribution (or bell -shaped curve) is perfectly symmetrical, the mean, median, and mode all have the same value (as illustrated in Figure 2.10). In practice, however, observed data rarely approach this ideal shape. As a result, the m ean, m edian, and mode usually differ. Figure 2.10 Effect of Skewness on Mean, Median, and Mode How, then, do you choose the m ost appropriate measures? A partial answer to this question is to select the measure of central location on the basis of how the da ta are distributed, and then use the corresponding m easure of sp read. Table 2.11 summarizes the recommended measures. Summarizing Data Page 2-53 Table 2.11 R ecommended Measures of Central Location and Spread by Type of Data Type of Measure of Measure of Distri bution Central Locatio n Spread Normal Arithmetic mean Standard deviation Asymmetrical or skewed Median Range or interquartile range Exponential or logarithmic Geometric mean Geometric standard deviation In statistics, the arithmetic mean is the most commonly used measure of c entral location, and is the m easure upon which the majority of statistical tests and analytic techniques are based. The standard deviation is the measur e of s pread m ost comm only used with the m ean. But as noted previously, one disadvantage of the mean is that it is affected by the presence of one or a few observations with extremely high or low values. The m ean is \"pulled\" in the direction of the extrem e values. You can tell the direction in which the data are skewed by com paring the values of the mean and the median; the mean is pulled away from the median in the direction of the extreme values. If the mean is higher than the m edian, the distribution of data is skewed to the right. If the mean is lower than the median, as in the right side of Figure 2.10, the distribution is skewed to the left. The advantage of the median is that it is not affected by a few extrem ely high or low observations. Therefore, when a set of data is skewed, the median is more representative of the data than is the mean. For descriptive purposes, and to avoid m aking any assumption that the data are norm ally distributed, many epidemiologists routinely present the m edian for incubation periods, duration of illness, and age of the study subjects. Two m easures of spread can be used in conjunction with the median: the range and the interquartile range. Although many statistics books recommend the inte rquartile range as the preferred measure of spread, most practicing epidemiologists use the simpler range instead. The mode is the least useful measure of central location. Som e sets of data have no mode; others have m ore than one. The m ost common value may not be anywhe re near the center of the distribution. Modes generally cannot be used in more elaborate statistical calculations. N onethele ss, even the m ode can be helpful Summarizing Data Page 2-54 when one is interested in the most common value or most popular choice. The geometric mean is used for exponential or logarithm ic data such as laboratory titers, and for environm ental sam pling data whose values can span several orders of magnitude. The measure of spread used with the geometric mean is the geometric standard deviation. Analogous to the geometric mean, it is the antilog of the standard deviation of the log of the values. The geometric standard deviation is substituted for the standard deviation when incorporating logarithms of numbers. Examples include describing environmental particle size based on m ass, or variability of blood l ead concentrations.1 Sometimes, a combination of these measures is needed to adequately describe a set of data.

Almos t three-fourths of the students , representing the mode, do not smoke at all. Separating the 58 smokers from the 142 nonsmokers yields a more informative summary of the data.

Cairo: Field Epidemiology Training Program, 1999. Summarizing Data Page 2-58 Summar y Frequency distributions, measures of central location, and measures of spread are effective tools for summarizing numerical variables including: ! Physical characteristics such as height and diastolic blood pressure, ! Illness characteristics such as incubation period, and ! Behavioral characteristics such as number of lifetim e sexual partners. Some characteristics, su ch as IQ, follow a norm al or symmetrical bell-shaped distribution in the population. Other characteristics have distributions that are skew ed to the right (tail toward higher values) or skewed to the left (tail toward lower values). Some characteristics are mostly norm ally distributed, but have a few extrem e values or outliers. Some characteristics, particularly laboratory dilution assays, follow a logarithm ic pattern. Finally, other char acteristics follow other patterns (such as a uniform distribution) or app ear to follow no apparent pattern at all. The distribution of the data is the most important factor in selecting an appropriate measure of central location and spread. Measures of central lo cation ar e single values that represen t the center of the observed distribution of values. The different measures of central location represent the center in different ways. The arithmetic mean represents the balance point for all the data. The median represents the middle of the data, with half the observed values below the median and half the observed values above it. The mode represents the peak or most prevalent value. The geometric mean is comparable to the arithmetic mean on a logarithmic scale. Measures of spread describe the spread or variability of the o bserved distribution. Th e range measures the spread from the smallest to the largest value. T he standard deviation, usually used in conjunction with the arithmetic mean, reflects how closely clustered the observed values are to the mean. For normally distributed data, 95% of the data fall in the range from -1.96 st andard deviations to +1.96 standard deviations. The in terquartile range, used in conjunction with the median, includes data in the range from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile, or approximately the middle 50% of the data. Data that are norm ally distributed are usually su mmarized with the arithmetic mean and standard deviation. Data that are skewed or have a few extreme values are usually summarized with the median and range, or with the median and interquartile range. Data that follow a logarithmic scale and data that span severa l orders of magnitude are usually summ arized with th e geom etric mean. Summarizing Data Page 2-59 Exercise Answers Exercise 2.1 1.

Create frequency distribution ( done in Exercise 2.2, above) 2. Identify the value that occurs most often. Most common value is 1, so mode is 1 previous vaccination. Exercise 2.4 1. Arrange the observations in increasing order. 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12 2. Find the middle position of the distribution with 19 observations. Middle position = (19 + 1) / 2 = 10 Summarizing Data Page 2-60 3. Identify the value at the middle position. 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, *2*, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12 Counting from the left or right to the 10th position, the value is 2. So the median = 2 previous vaccinations. Exercise 2.5 1. Add all of the observed va lues in the distribution. 2 + 0 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 12 + 1 + 6 + 2 + 5 + 1 = 57 2. Divide the sum by the number of observations 57 / 19 = 3.0 So the mean is 3.0 previous vaccinations Exercise 2.6 Using Method A: 1. Take the log (in this case, to base 2) of each value.

Calculate the mean of the log values by summi ng and dividing by the number of observations (10). Mean of log 2(xi) = (9 + 9 + 7 + 9 + 10 + 10 + 11 + 7 + 12 + 10) / 10 = 94 / 10 = 9.4 3. Take the antilog of the mean of the log values to get the geometric mean. Antilog2(9.4) = 29.4 = 675.59. Therefore, the geom etric mean dilution titer is 1:675.6.

Note that the distribution has 19 observations. Position of Q1 = (n + 1) / 4 = (19 + 1) / 4 = 5 Position of Q3 = 3(n + 1) / 4 =3(19 + 1) / 4 = 15 3. Identify the value of the 1st and 3rd quartiles. Value at Q1 (position 5) = 1 Value at Q3 (position 15) = 4 4. Calculate the interquartile range as Q3 minus Q1. 4. Interquartile range = 4 - 1 = 3 5. The median (at position 10) is 2. Note that the distance between Q1 and the m edian is 2 - 1 = 1. The distance between Q 3 and the median is 4 - 2 = 2. This indicates that the vaccination data is skewed slightly to the right (tail points to greater number of previous vaccin ations). Summarizing Data Page 2-62 Exercise 2.9 1.

Line list or line listing . A line listing is a table in which each row typical ly repre sents one person or case of disease, and each column represents a variable such as ID, age, sex, etc. 2. Sex A, D, F Age B, G, H Lymphocyte count B, G, H Sex is a nominal variable, meaning that its categories have names but not numerical value. Nominal variable s are qualitative or categorical variables. Age and lymphocyt e count are ratio variables because they are both numeric variable with true zero points. Ratio variables are continuous and quantitative variables. 3. A. Because the centers of each distribution line up, they have the same measure of central location. But because each distribution is spread differently, they have different measures of spread . 4. B, C, E. Right/left skewness refers to the tail of a distribution. Because the \"hump \" of this distribution is on the left and the tail is on the right, it is said to be skewed positively to the right. A skewed distribution is not symmetrical. 5. C. For a distri bution such as that shown in Figure 2.12, with its hump to the left, the mode will be smaller than either the median or the mean. The long tail to the right will pull the mean upward, so that the sequence will be mode < median < mean. 6. B. The mode is the value that occurs most often. 7. C. The median is the value that has half the observations below it and half above it. 8. D. The mean is the value that is statistically closest to all of the values in the distribution 9. D. The geometric mean is the value that is statistically closest to all of the values in the distribution on a log scale. 10. C, E. The mode is the value that occurs most often. A distribution can have one mode, more than one mode, or no mode. In this distribution, both 38.0\u00b0 C and 38.5\u00b0 C appear 3 times. 11. D. The median is the value that has half the observations below it and half above it. For a distrib ution with an even number of values, the median falls between 2 observation s, in this situation between the 7th and 8th values. The 7th value is 38.2\u00b0 C and the 8th value is 38.5\u00b0 C, so the median is the averag e of those two value s, i.e., 38.35\u00b0C. 12. C. The mean is the average of all the values. Given 14 temp eratures that sum to 531.6, the mean is calculated as 531.6 / 14, which equals 37.97\u00b0C, which should be rounded to 38.0\u00b0C. Summarizing Data Page 2-71 13. A. The midrange is halfway between the smallest and largest values. Since the lowest and highest temperatures are 35.1\u00b0 C and 39.6\u00b0 C , the midrange is calculate d as 35.1 + 39.6 / 2, or 37.35 \u00b0C. 14. B. In epide miology, the measure of central location generally preferred for summarizing skewed data such as incubation periods is the median. 15. A. The measure of central location generally preferred for additional statistical analysis is the mean, which is the only measu re that has good statistical prope rties. 16. A, C, D, E. Interquartile range, range, standa rd deviation, and variance are all meas ures of spread. A percentile identifies a particular place on the distribution, but is not a measure of spread. 17. B. The range is the difference between the extreme values on either side, so it is most directl y affected by those values. 18. B. The interquartile range covers the central 50% of a distribution. 19. C. The interquartile range usually accompanies the median, since both are based on percentiles. The interquartile range covers from the 25th to the 75th percentile, while the median marks the 50th percentile. 20. A. The standard deviation usually accom panies the arithm etic mean. 21. A. The standard deviation is the square root of the varianc e. 22. A, D. Use of the mean and standa rd deviation are usuall y restricted to data that are more- or-less norm ally distribu ted. Calcul ation of the standard deviation requires squaring differences and then taking the square root, so you need a calculator that has a square- root functio n. 23. B. Distributions A, B, and C all range from 1 to 39 and have two central values of 20. Considering the eight values other than the smallest and largest, distribution C has values close to 20 (from 15 to 25), Distribut ion A has values from 10 to 30, and Distrib ution B has values from 3 to 37. So Distrib ution B has the broadest spread among the first 3 distribution s. Distribution D has larger values than the first 3 distributions (41-49 rather than 1-39), but they cluster rather tightly aroun d the central value of 45. 24. A and E. The area from the 2.5th percentile to the 97.5th percentile includes 95% of the below the curve, which corre sponds to \u00b1 1.96 stand ard deviation s along the x-axis. 25. A. The primary use of the standar d error of the mean is in calculating a confidenc e interval. Summarizing Data Page 2-72 References 1. Griffin S., Marcus A., Schulz T., Walker S.

Measures of Risk Page 3-1 MEASURES OF RISK Lesson 2 described m easures of centr al location and spread, which are useful for summarizing continuous vari ables. However, m any variables used by field epidem iologists are categor ical variables, som e of which have only two categories \u2014 exposed yes/no, test positive/negative, case/control, and so on. These variables have to be summ arized with frequency m easures such as ratios, proportions, and rates. Incidence, prevalence, and m ortality rates are three frequency measures that are used to characterize the occurrence of health even ts in a population. Objectives After studying this lesson and answering the questions in the exercises, you will be able to: ! Calculate and interpret the following epidemiologic measures: - Ratio - Proportion - Incidence proportion (attack rate) - Incidence rate - Prevalence - Mortality rate ! Choose and apply the appropriate m easures of a ssociation and measures of public health impact Major Sections Frequency Measures ............................................................................................................. ...........3-2 Morbidity F requency ..........3-38 Measures of Association ..........3-38 Measures of Public Health Im pact............................................................................................... ....3-47 Summ ary........................................................................................................................ ..................3-503133 Measures of Risk Page 3-2 Numerator = upper portion of a fraction Denominator = lower portion of a fraction Frequency Measu res A measure of central location provides a single value that summarizes an entire distribution of data. In contrast, a frequency measure characterizes on ly part of the distribution. Frequency measures compare one part of the distribution to another part of the distribution, or to the entire distribution. Comm on frequency measures are ratios, proportions , and rates. All three frequency measures have the same basic form: numerator denominator x 10n Recall that: 100 = 1 (anything raised to the 0 pow er equals 1) 101 = 10 (anything raised to the 1st power is the value itself) 102 = 10 x 10 = 100 103 = 10 x 10 x 10 = 1,000 So the fraction of (numerator/denominator) can be multiplied by 1, 10, 100, 1000, and so on. This multiplier varies by measure and will be add ressed in each section. Ratio Definition of ratio A ratio is the relative magnitude of two quantities or a com parison of any two values. It is calcul ated by dividing one interval- or ratio-scale variable by the other. The numerator and denominator need not be related. Therefore, one could com pare apples with oranges or apples with number of physician visits. Method for calculating a ratio Number or rate of events, items, persons, etc. in one group Number or rate of events, items, persons, etc. in another group After the num erator is divided by the denom inator, the result is often expressed as the result \"to one\" or written as the result \":1.\" Note that in certain ratios, the numerator and denominator are different categories of the sam e variable, such as m ales and females, or persons 20-29 years and 30-39 years of age. In other ratios, the numerator and denominator are completely different Measures of Risk Page 3-3 variables, such as the number of hospitals in a city and the size of the population living in that city. EXAMPLE: Calculating a Ratio \u2014 Different Categories of Same Variable Between 1971 and 1975, as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surve y (NHANES), 7,381 persons ages 40-77 years were enrolled in a follow-up study.1 At the time of enrollment, each study participant was classified as having or not having diabetes. During 1982-19 84, enrollees were documented either to have died or were still alive. The results are summarized as follows. Original Enrollment Dead at Follow- Up (1971-1975) (1982-1984) Diabetic men 189 100 Nondiabetic men 3,151 811 Diabetic wome n 218 72 Nondiabetic women 3,823 511 Of the men enrolled in the NHANES follow-up study, 3,151 were nondiabeti c and 189 were diabetic. Calculate the ratio of non-diabetic to diabetic men. Ratio = 3,151 / 189 x 1 = 16.7:1 Properties and uses of ratios ! Ratios are comm on descriptive m easures, used in all fields. In epidemiology, ratios are used as both descriptive measures and as analytic tools. As a descriptive measure, ratios can describe the male-to-female ratio of participants in a study, or the ratio of controls to cases (e.g., two controls per case). As an analytic tool, ratios can be calculated for occurrence of illness, injury, or death between two groups. Th ese ratio measures, including risk ratio (relative risk), rate ratio, and odds ratio, are described later in this lesson. ! As noted previously, the numerators and denom inators of a ratio can be related or unrelated. In other words, you are free to use a ratio to compare the number of males in a population with the number of fe males, or to compare the number of residents in a population with the number of hospitals or dollars spent on over-the-counter m edicines. ! Usually, the values of both the numerator and denom inator of a ratio are divided by the value of one or the other so that either the num erator or the denom inator equals 1.0. So the ratio of non-diabetics to diabetics cited in the previous exam ple is more likely to be reported as 16.7:1 than 3,151:189. Measures of Risk Page 3-4 EXAMPLES: Calculating Ratios for Different Variables Example A: A city of 4,000,000 persons has 500 clinics. Calculate the ratio of clinics per person. 500 / 4,000,000 x 10n = 0.000125 clinics per person To get a more easily understo od result, you could set 10n = 104 = 10,000. Then the ratio becomes: 0.000125 x 10,000 = 1.25 clinics per 10,000 persons You could also divide each value by 1.25, and express this ratio as 1 clinic for every 8,000 persons. Example B: Delaware's infant mortality rate in 2001 was 10.7 per 1,000 live births.2 New Hampshire's infant mortality rate in 2001 was 3.8 per 1,000 live births. Calculate the ratio of the infant mortality rate in Delaware to that in New Hampshire. 10.7 / 3.8 x 1 = 2.8:1 Thus, Delawar e's infant mortality rate was 2.8 times as high as New Hampshire's infant mortality rate in 2001. A commonly used epidemiologic ratio: death-to-case ratio Death-to-case ratio is the number of deaths attributed to a particular disease during a specifi ed period divided by the number of new cases of that disease iden tified during the same period. It is used as a measure of the severity of illness: the death-to-case ratio for rabies is close to 1 (that is, almost everyone who develops rabies dies from it), whereas the death-to-case ratio for the common cold is close to 0. For exam ple, in the United States in 2002, a total of 15,075 new cases of tuberculosis were reported.3 During the same year, 802 deaths were attributed to tuberc ulosis. The tuberc ulosis death-to- case ratio for 2002 can be calcu lated as 802 / 15,075. Dividing both numerator and denominator by the numerator yields 1 death per 18.8 new cases. Dividing both num erator and denom inator by the denominator (and multiplying by 10n = 100) yields 5.3 deaths per 100 new cases. Both expressions are correct. Note that, presum ably, many of those who died had initially contracted tuberculosis years earlier. Thus many of the 802 in the numerator are not among the 15,075 in the denominator. Therefore, the death-to-case ratio is a ratio, but not a proportion. Proportion Definition of proportion A proportion is the comparison of a part to the whole. It is a type Measures of Risk Page 3-5 of ratio in which the numerator is included in the denom inator. You might use a proportion to describe what fraction of clinic patients tested positive for HIV, or what percentage of the population is younger than 25 years of age. A proportion m ay be expressed as a decimal, a fraction, or a percentage. Method for calculating a proportion Number of persons or events with a particular characteristic Total number of persons or events, of which the numerator is a subset x 10n For a proportion, 10n is usually 100 (or n=2) and is often expressed as a percentage. EXAMPLE: Calculating a Proportion Example A: Calculate the proportion of men in the NHANES follow-up study who were diabetics. Numerator = 189 diabetic men Denominator = Total number of men = 189 + 3,151 = 3,340 Proportion = (189 / 3,340) x 100 = 5.66% Example B: Calculate the proportion of deaths among men. Numerator = deaths in men = 100 deaths in diabetic men + 811 deaths in nondiabetic men = 911 deaths in men Notice that the numerator (911 deaths in men) is a subset of the denomina tor. Denominator = all deaths = 911 deaths in men + 72 deaths in diabetic wome n + 511 deaths in nondiabetic women = 1,494 deaths Proportion = 911 / 1,494 = 60.98% = 61% Your Turn: What proportion of all study participants were men? (Answer = 45.25%) Properties and uses of proportions ! Proportions are comm on descrip tive measures used in all fields. In epidem iology, proporti ons are used most often as descriptive measures. For example, one could calculate the proportion of persons enrolled in a study am ong all those eligible (\"participation rate\") , the proportion of children in a village vaccinated against m easle s, or the proportion of persons who developed illness among all pa ssengers of a cruise ship. ! Proportions are also used to describe the am ount of disease that can be attributed to a particular exposure. For exam ple, on the Measures of Risk Page 3-6 basis of studies of sm oking and lung cancer, public health officials have estim ated that greater than 90% of the lung cancer cases that occur are attributable to cigarette sm oking. ! In a proportion, the numerator must be included in the denominator. Thus, the number of apples divided by the number of oranges is not a proportion, but the number of apples divided by the total number of fruits of all kinds is a proportion. Remember, the numerator is always a subset of the denominator. ! A proportion can be expressed as a fraction, a decim al, or a percentage. The statements \"one fifth of the residents became ill\" and \"twenty percent of the residents became ill\" are equivalent. ! Proportions can easily be converted to ratios. If the numerator is the number of women (179) who attended a clinic and the denominator is all the clinic attendees (341), the proportion of clinic attendees who are women is 179 / 341, or 52% (a little more than half). To convert to a ratio, subtract the num erator from the denominator to get the number of clinic patients who are not women, i.e., the number of men (341 - 179 = 162 men.)Thus, ratio of women to men could be calculated from the proportion as: Ratio = 179 / (341 - 179) x 1 = 179 / 162 = 1.1 to 1 female-to-m ale ratio Conversely, if a ratio's numerator and denom inator together make up a whole population, the ratio can be converted to a proportion. You would add the ratio's num erator and denom inator to form the denominator of the proportion, as illustrated in the NHANE S follow-up study exam ples (provide d earlier in this lesson). A specific type of epidemio logic proportion: proportionate mortality Proportionate mortality is the proportion of death s in a specified population during a period of tim e that are attributable to different causes. Each cause is expressed as a percentage of all deaths, and the sum of the causes adds up to 100%. These proportions are not rates because the denominator is all deaths, not the size of the population in which the deaths occurred. Table 3.1 lists the primary causes of death in the United States in 2003 for persons of all ages and for persons aged 25-44 years, by number of deaths, proportionate mortality, and rank.

Hyattsville, MD: National Center for Health Statistics 2005: p. 15, 27. As illustrated in Table 3.1, the proportionate mortality for HIV was 0.5% am ong all age groups, and 5.3% am ong those aged 25-44 years. In other words, HIV infection accounted f or 0.5% of all deaths, and 5.3% of deaths am ong 25-44 year olds. Rate Definition of rate In epidem iology, a rate is a m easure of the frequency with which an event occurs in a defined popul ation over a specified period of time. Because rates put disease frequency in the perspective of the size of the population, rates are pa rticularly useful for com paring disease frequency in different locations, at different tim es, or among diffe rent groups of persons with potentially different sized populations; that is, a rate is a m easure of risk. To a non-epidem iologist, rate m eans how fast som ething is happening or going. The speedom eter of a car indicates the car's speed or rate of travel in miles or kilom eters per hour. This rate is always reported per some unit of time. Some epidemiologists restrict use of the term rate to similar measures that are expressed per unit of time. For these epidem iologists, a rate describes how quickly disease occurs in a population, for example, 70 new cases of breast cancer per 1,000 wom en per year. This measure conveys Measures of Risk Page 3-8 a sense of the speed with which di sease occurs in a population, and seems to imply that this pattern has occurred and will continue to occur for the foreseeable future. This rate is an incidence rate, described in the next section, starting on page 3-13. Other epidemiologists use the term rate more loosely, referring to proportions with case counts in the num erator and size of population in the denominator as rates. Thus, an attac k rate is the proportion of the population that develops illness during an outbreak. For exam ple, 20 of 130 pe rsons developed diarrhea after attending a picnic. (An alternative and more accurate phrase for attack rate is incidence proportion.) A prevalence rate is the proportion o f the population that ha s a health condition at a point in tim e. For exam ple, 70 influenza case-patients in March 2005 reported in County A. A case-fatality rate is the proportion of persons with the disease who die from it. For example, one death due to meningitis among County A's population. All of these measures are proportions, and none is expressed per units of time. Therefore, these measures are not considered \"true\" rates by some, although use of the term inology is widespread. Table 3.2 summarizes som e of the common epidem iologic measures as ratios, proportions, or rates.

In practice, m orbidity en compasses disease, injury, and disability. In addition, although for this lesson the term refers to the num ber of persons who are ill, it can also be used to describe the periods of illness that these persons experienced, or the duration of these illnesses.4 Measures of morbidity frequenc y characterize th e num ber of persons in a population who become ill (incidence) or are ill at a given tim e (prevalence). Commonl y used measures are listed in Table 3.3. Table 3.3 Frequently Use d Measures of Morbidity Measure Numerat or Denomina tor Incidence proportion (or attack rate or risk) Number of new cases of disease during specified time interval Population at start of time interval Secondary attack rate Number of new cases among contacts Total number of contacts Inciden ce rate (or person -time rate) Number of new cases of disease during specified time interval Summed person-years of observation or average population during time interval Point preva lence Number of current cases (new and preexisting) at a specified point in time Population at the same specified point in time Period prevalen ce Number of current cases (new and preexisting) over a specified period of time Average or mid-interval population Incidence refers to the occurrence of new cases of disease or injury in a population over a specified period of tim e. Although some epidemiologists use incidence to mean the number of new cases in a community, others use incidence to mean the number of new cases per unit of population. Two types of incidence are comm only used \u2014 incidence proportion and incidence rate. Measures of Risk Page 3-11 Synonyms for incidence proportion ! Attack rate ! Risk ! Probability of developing disease ! Cumulative incidence Incidence proportion or risk Definition of incidence proportion Incidence proportion is the proportion of an initially disease-free population that develops disease, becom es injured, or dies during a specified (usually limited) period of time. Synonym s include attack rate, risk, probability of getting disease, and cumulative incidence. Inciden ce proportion is a proporti on because the persons in the numerator, those who develop disease, are all included in the denom inator (the entire population). Method for calculating incidence proportion (risk) Number of new cases of disease or injury during specified period Size of population at start of period EXAMPLES: Calculating Incidence Proportion (Risk) Example A: In the study of diabetics, 100 of the 189 diabetic men died during the 13-year follow-up period. Calculate the risk of death for these men. Numerator = 100 deaths among the diabetic men Denominator = 189 diabetic men 10n = 102 = 100 Risk = (100 / 189) x 100 = 52.9% Example B: In an outbreak of gastroen teritis amon g attendees of a corporate picnic, 99 persons ate potato salad, 30 of whom developed gastroenteritis. Calculate the risk of illness among persons who ate potato salad. Numerator = 30 persons who ate potato salad and developed gastroenteritis Denominator = 99 persons who ate potato salad 10n = 102 = 100 Risk = \"Food -specific attack rate\" = (30 / 99) x 100 = 0.303 x 100 = 30.3% Properties and uses of incidence proportions ! Incidence proportion is a m easure of the risk of disease or the probability of developing the disease during the specified period. As a measure of incidence, it includes only new cases of disease in the numerator. The denom inator is the num ber of persons in the population at the start of the observation period. Because all of the persons with new cases of disease (numerator) are also represented in the denominator, a risk is also a proportion. Measures of Risk Page 3-12 More About Denominators The denominator of an incidence proportion is the number of person s at the start of the observation period. The denominator should be limited to the \"population at risk\" for developing disease, i.e., persons who have the potential to get the disease and be included in the numerator. For example, if the numerator represents new cases of cancer of the ovaries, the denominator should be restricted to women, because men do not have ovaries. This is easily accomplished because census data by sex are readily availab le. In fact, ideally the denominator should be restricted to women with ovaries, excluding women who have had their ovaries removed surgically (often done in conjunctio n with a hysterectomy), but this is not usually practical. This is an example of field epidemiologists doing the best they can with the data they have. ! In the outbreak setting, the term attack rate is often used as a synonym for risk. It is the risk of getting the disease during a specified period, such as the duration of an outbreak. A variety of attack rates can be calculated. Overall attack rate is the total number of new cases divided by the total population. A food-specific attack rate is the number of persons who ate a specified food and became ill divided by the total number of persons who ate that food, as illustrated in the previous potato salad exam ple. A secondary attack rate is sometimes calculated to docum ent the difference between community transm ission of illness versus transmission of illness in a household, barracks, or other closed popul ation. It is calculated as: Number of cases among contacts of primary cases Total number of contacts x 10n Often, the total number of contacts in the denominator is calculated as the total populati on in the households of the prim ary cases, minus the number of primary cases. For a secondary attack rate, 10n usually is 100%. EXAMPLE: Calculating Secondary Attack Rates Consider an outbreak of shigel losis in which 18 persons in 18 different households all became ill. If the population of the community was 1,000, then the overall attack rate was 18 / 1,000 x 100% = 1.8%. One incubation period later, 17 persons in the same house holds as these \"primary\" cases developed shigellosis. If the 18 households included 86 persons, calculate the secondary attack rate. Secondary attack rate = (17 / (86 - 18)) x 100% = (17 / 68) x 100% = 25.0% Measures of Risk Page 3-13 Incidence rate or person-time rate Definition of incidence rate Incidence rate or person-time rate is a measure of incidence that incorporates time directly into the denom inator. A person-tim e rate is generally calculated from a long-term cohort follow-up study, wherein enrollees are followed over time and the occurrence of new cases of disease is documented. Typically, each person is observed from an established starting time until one of four \"end points\" is reached: onset of disease, death, migration out of the study (\"lost to follow-up\"), or the end of the study. Sim ilar to the incidence proportion, the numerator of the incidence rate is the number of new cases identified during the period of observation. However, the denom inator differs. The denom inator is the sum of the tim e each person was observed, totaled for all persons. Th is denom inator represents the total time the population was at risk of and being watched for disease. Thus , the incidence rate is the ratio of the number of cases to the total time the population is at risk of disease. Method for calculating incidence rate Number of new cases of disease or injury during specified period Time each person was observed, totaled for all persons In a long-term follow-up study of morbidity, each study participant may be followed or observed for several years. One person followed for 5 years without de veloping disease is said to contribute 5 person-years of follow-up. What about a person followed for one year before being lost to follow-up at year 2? Many researchers assum e that persons lost to follow-up were, on average, disease-free for half the year, and thus contribute \u00bd year to the denom inator. Therefore, the person followed for one year before being lost to follow-up contributes 1.5 person-years. The sam e assum ption is made for participants diagnosed with the disease at the year 2 examination \u2014 s ome may have developed illness in m onth 1, and others in months 2 through 12. So, on average, they devel oped illness halfway through the year. As a result, persons diagnosed with the disease contribute \u00bd year of follow-up during the year of diagnosis. The denominator of the person-time rate is the sum of all of the person-years for each study participant. So, someone lost to Measures of Risk Page 3-14 follow-up in year 3, and someone diagnosed with the disease in year 3, each contributes 2.5 years of disease-free follow-up to the denominator. Properties and uses of incidence rates ! An incidence rate describes how quickly disease occurs in a population. It is based on pe rson-time, so it has some advantages over an incidence proportion. Because person-tim e is calculated for each subject, it can accommodate persons coming into and leaving the study. As noted in the previous exam ple, the denom inator accounts for study participants who are lost to follow-up or who die during the study period. In addition, it allows enrollees to enter the study at different times. In the NHANES follow-up study, some participants were enrolled in 1971, others in 1972, 1973, 1974, and 1975. ! Person-time has one important drawback. Person-time assumes that the probability of disease during the study period is constant, so that 10 persons followed for one year equals one person follo wed for 10 years. Becau se the risk of m any chronic diseases increases with age, this assumption is often not valid. ! Long-term cohort studies of the type described here are not very comm on. However, epidem iologists far m ore commonly calculate incidence rates based on a numerator of cases observed or reported, and a denom inator based on the m id-year population. This type of incide nt rate turns out to be comparable to a person-time rate. ! Finally, if you report the incidence rate of, say, the heart disease study as 2.5 per 1,000 person-years, epidem iologists might understand, but most others will not. Person-time is epidemiologic jargon. To convert this jargon to something understand able, simply replace \"person-years\" with \"persons per year.\" Reporting the result s as 2.5 new cases of heart disease per 1,000 persons per year sounds like E nglish rather than jargon. It also conveys the sense of the incidence rate as a dynam ic process, the speed at which new cases of disease occur in the population. Measures of Risk Page 3-15 EXAMPLES: Calculating Incidence Rates Example A: Investigators enrolled 2,100 women in a study and followed them annually for four years to determine the incidence rate of heart disease. After one year, none had a new diagno sis of heart disease, but 100 had been lost to follow-up. After two years, one had a new diagnosis of heart disease, and another 99 had been lost to follow-up. After three years, another seven had new diagnoses of heart disease, and 793 had been lost to follow-u p. After four years, another 8 had new diagnoses with heart disease, and 392 more had been lost to follow-up. The study results could also be describe d as follows: No heart disease was diagnosed at the first year. Heart disease was diagnosed in one woman at the second year, in seven women at the third year, and in eight women at the fourth year of follow-up. One hundred women were lost to follow-up by the first year, another 99 were lost to follow- up after two years, another 793 were lost to follow-up after three years, and another 392 women were lost to follow- up after 4 years, leaving 700 women who were followed for four years and remained disease free. Calculate the incidence rate of heart disease among this cohort. Assume that persons with new diagnose s of heart disease and those lost to follow-up were disease-free for half the year, and thus contribute \u00bd year to the denominato r. Numerator = number of new cases of heart disease = 0 + 1 + 7 + 8 = 16 Denominator = person-years of observation = (2,000 + \u00bd x 100) + (1,900 + \u00bd x 1 + \u00bd x 99) + (1,100 + \u00bd x 7 + \u00bd x 793) + (700 + \u00bd x 8 + \u00bd x 392) = 6,400 person-years of follow-up or Denominator = person-years of observation = (1 x 1.5) + (7 x 2.5) + (8 x 3.5) + (100 x 0.5) + (99 x 1.5) + (793 x 2.5) + (392 x 3.5) + (700 x 4) = 6,400 person-years of follow-up Person-time rate = Number of new cases of disease or injury during specified period Time each person was observed, totaled for all persons = 16 / 6,400 = .0025 cases per person-year = 2.5 cases per 1,000 person-years In contrast, the incidence proportion can be calculated as 16 / 2,100 = 7.6 cases per 1,000 population during the four-year period, or an averag e of 1.9 cases per 1,000 per year (7.6 divided by 4 years). The incidence proportion underestimates the true rate because it ignores persons lost to follow-up, and assumes that they remained disease- free for all four years. Example B: The diabetes follow-up study included 218 diabetic women and 3,823 nondi abetic women. By the end of the study, 72 of the diabetic women and 511 of the nondiabetic women had died. The diabetic women were observed for a total of 1,862 person-years; the nondiabeti c women were observed for a total of 36,653 person-years. Calculate the incidence rates of death for the diabetic and non-diabetic women. For diabetic women, numerator = 72 and denominator = 1,862 Person-time rate = 72 / 1,862 = 0.0386 deaths per person-year = 38.6 deaths per 1,000 person-years For nondiabetic women, numerat or = 511 and denominator = 36,653 Person-time rate = 511 / 36,653 = 0.0139 deaths per person-year = 13.9 deaths per 1,000 person-years Measures of Risk Page 3-16 Example C: In 2003, 44,232 new cases of acquired immu nodeficien cy syndrome (AIDS) were reported in the United States.5 The estimated mid-year population of the U.S. in 2003 was approximately 290,80 9,777.6 Calculate the incidence rate of AIDS in 2003. Numerator = 44,232 new cases of AIDS Denominator = 290,809,777 estimated mid-year population 10n = 100,000 Incidence rate = (44,232 / 290,809,777) x 100,000 = 15.21 new cases of AIDS per 100,000 population Prevalence Definition of prevalence Prevalence, sometimes referred to as prevalence rate, is the proportion of persons in a population who have a particular disease or attribute at a specified point in time or over a specified period of time. Prevalence differs from incidence in that prevalence includes all cases, both new and preex isting, in the population at the specified time, whereas incidence is limited to new cases only. Point prevalence refers to the prevalence measured at a particular point in time. It is the proporti on of persons with a particular disease or attribute on a particular date. Period prevalence refers to prevalence measured over an interval of time. It is the proportion of persons with a particular disease or attribute at any time during the interval. Method for calculating prevalence of disease All new and pre-existing cases during a given time period Population during the same time period x 10n Method for calculating prevalence of an attribute Persons having a particular attribute during a given time period Population during the same time period x 10n The value of 10n is usually 1 or 100 for comm on attributes. The value of 10n might be 1,000, 100,000, or even 1,000,000 for rare attributes and for most diseases. Measures of Risk Page 3-17 EXAMPLE: Calculating Prevalence In a survey of 1,150 women who gave birth in Maine in 2000, a total of 468 reported taking a multivita min at least 4 times a week during the month before becoming pregnant.7 Calculate the prevalence of frequent multivitamin use in this group. Numerator = 468 multivitamin users Denominator = 1,150 women Prevalence = (468 / 1,150) x 100 = 0.407 x 100 = 40.7% Properties and uses of prevalence ! Prevalence and incidence are frequently confused. Prevalence refers to proportion of persons who have a condition at or during a particular tim e period, wh ereas incidence refers to the proportion or rate of persons who develop a condition during a particular tim e period. So prevalen ce and incidence are similar, but prevalence includes new and pre-existing cases whereas incidence includes new cases only. The key difference is in their numerators. Numerator of incidence = new cases that occurred during a given time period Numerator of prevalence = all cases present during a given time period ! The num erator of an incidence pr oportion or rate consists only of persons whose illness began during the specified interval. The numerator for prevalence includes all persons ill from a specified cause during the specified interval regardless of when the illness began . It includes not only new cases, but also preexisting cases representing persons who remained ill during some portion of the specified interval. ! Prevalence is based on both incidence and duration of illness. High prevalence of a disease w ithin a population m ight reflect high incidence or prolonged su rvival without cure or both. Conversely, low prevalence might indicate low incidence, a rapidly fatal process, or rapid recovery. ! Prevalence rather than incidence is often measured for chronic diseases such as diabetes or osteoarthritis which have long duration and dates of onset th at are difficult to pinpoint.Measures of Risk Page 3-18 EXAMP LES: Incidence versus Prevalence Figure 3.1 represents 10 new cases of illness over about 15 months in a population of 20 persons. Each horizontal line represents one person. The down arrow indicates the date of onset of illness. The solid line represents the duration of illness. The up arrow and the cross represent the date of recovery and date of death, respectively. Figure 3.1 New Cases of Illness from October 1, 2004 through September 30, 2005 Example A: Calculate the incidence rate from October 1, 2004, to September 30, 2005, using the midpoint population (population alive on April 1, 2005) as the denom inator. Express the rate per 100 population. Incidence rate numerator = number of new cases between October 1 and September 30 = 4 (the other 6 all had onsets before October 1, and are not included) Incidence rate denominator = April 1 population = 18 (persons 2 and 8 died before April 1) Incidence rate = (4 / 18) x 100 = 22 new cases per 100 population Example B: Calculate the point prevalence on April 1, 2005. Point prevalen ce is the numb er of persons ill on the date divided by the population on that date. On April 1, seven persons (persons 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 10) were ill. Point prevalence = (7 / 18) x 100 = 38.89% Example C: Calculate the period prevalence from October 1, 2004, to September 30, 2005. The numerator of period prevalence includes anyone who was ill any time during the period. In Figure 3.1, the first 10 persons were all ill at some time during the period. Period prevalence = (10 / 20) x 100 = 50.0% Measures of Risk Page 3-19 Exercise 3.2 For each of the fractions shown below, indicate whether it is an incidence propo rtion, incidence rate, prevalen ce, or none of the three.

Morbidity and mortality measures are often the same mathematically; it's just a matter of what you choose to measure, illness or death. The formula for the mortality of a defined population, over a specified period of time, is: Deaths occurring during a given time period Size of the population among which the deaths occurred x 10n When m ortality rates are based on vital statistics (e.g., counts of death certificates), the denominator most commonly used is the size of the population at the middle of the time period. In the United States, values of 1,000 and 100,000 are both used for 10n for most types of mortality rates. Table 3.4 summarizes the formulas of frequently used mortality measures. Table 3.4 Frequently Use d Measures of Mortality Measure Numerator Denominator 10n Crude death rate Total number of deaths during a given time interval Mid-interval population 1,000 or 100,000 Cause-specific death rate Number of deaths assigned to a specific cause during a given time interval Mid-interval population 100,000 Proportionate mortality Number of deaths assigned to a specific cause during a given time interval Total number of deaths from all causes during the same time interval 100 or 1,000 Death-to-case ratio Number of deaths assigned to a specific cause during a given time interval Numb er of new cases of same disease reported during the same time interval 100 Neonata l mortality rate Number of deaths among children < 28 days of age during a given time interval Number of live births during the same time interval 1,000 Postneonatal mortality rate Number of deaths among children 28-364 days of age during a given time interval Number of live births during the same time interval 1,000 Infant mortality rate Number of deaths among children < 1 year of age during a given time interval Number of live births during the same time interval 1,000 Maternal mortality rate Number of deaths assigned to pregnancy -related causes during a given time interval Number of live births during the same time interval 100,000 Measures of Risk Page 3-21 Crude mortality rate (crude death rate) The crude mortality rate is the mortality rate from all causes of death for a population. In the Un ited States in 2003, a total of 2,419,921 deaths occurred. The estim ated population was 290,809,777. The crude mortality rate in 2003 was, therefore, (2,419,921 / 290,809,777) x 100,000, or 832.1 deaths per 100,000 population.8 Cause-specific morta lity rate The cause-specific mortality rate is the mortality rate from a specified cause for a population. The num erator is the num ber of deaths attributed to a specific cause. The denom inator remains the size of the population at the midpoint of the time period. The fraction is usually expressed per 100,000 population. In the United States in 2003, a total of 108,256 deaths were attributed to accidents (unintentional injuries), yielding a cause-specific mortality rate of 37.2 per 100,000 population.8 Age-specific mortality ra te An age-specific mortality rate is a mortality rate limited to a particular age group. The numerator is the number of deaths in that age group; the denominator is the number of persons in that age group in the population. In the Unite d States in 2003, a total of 130,761 deaths occurred am ong pers ons aged 25-44 years, or an age-specific mortality rate of 153.0 per 100,000 25-44 year olds.8 Some specific types of age-specific mortality rates are neonatal, postneonatal, and infant mortalit y rates, as described in the following sections. Infant mortality rate The infant mortality rate is perhaps the most commonly used measure for comparing health status among nations. It is calculated as follows: Number of deaths among children < 1 year of age reported during a given time period Number of live births reported during the same time period x 1,000 The infant mortality rate is gene rally calculated on an annual basis. It is a widely used measure of health status because it reflects the health of the m other and infant during pregnancy and the year thereafter. The health of the mother and infant, in turn, reflects a wide variety of factors, incl uding access to prenatal care, prevalence of prenatal m aternal he alth behaviors (such as alcohol Measures of Risk Page 3-22 or tobacco use and proper nutri tion during pregnancy, etc.), postnatal care and behaviors (i ncluding childhood immunizations and proper nutrition), sanita tion, and infection control. Is the infant mortality rate a ratio? Yes. Is it a proportion? No, because some of the deaths in the numerator were among children born the previous year. Consider the infant mortality rate in 2003. That year, 28,025 infants died and 4,089,950 children were born, for an infant mortality rate of 6.951 per 1,000.8 Undoubtedly, some of the deaths in 2003 occurred am ong children born in 2002, but the denom inator includes only children born in 2003. Is the infant mortality rate truly a rate? No, because the denominator is not the size of the mid-year population of children < 1 year of age in 2003. In fact, the age-specific death rate for children < 1 year of age for 2003 was 694.7 per 100,000.8 Obviously the infant mortality rate and the age-specific death rate for infants are very sim ilar (695.1 versus 694.7 per 100,000) and close enough for most purposes. They are not exactly the same, however, because the estim ated numb er of infants residing in the United States on July 1, 2003 was slightly larger than the number of children born in the United States in 2002, presum ably because of immigration. Neonatal mortality rate The neonatal period covers birth up to but not including 28 days. The numerator of the neonatal mortality rate therefore is the number of deaths among children under 28 days of age during a given time period. The denominator of the neonatal mortality rate, like that of the infant mortality rate, is the num ber of live births reported during the same time period. The neonatal mortality rate is usually expressed per 1,000 live births. In 2003, the neonatal mortality rate in the United St ates was 4.7 per 1,000 live births.8 Postneonatal mortality rate The postneonatal period is defined as the period from 28 days of age up to but not including 1 year of age. The num erator of the postneonatal mortality rate therefore is the num ber of deaths among children from 28 days up to but not including 1 year of age during a given time period. The denominator is the number of live births reported during the same time period. The postneonatal mortality rate is usually expre ssed per 1,000 live births. In 2003, the postneonatal m ortality rate in the United States was 2.3 per 1,000 live births.8 Measures of Risk Page 3-23 Maternal mortality rate The maternal mortality rate is really a ratio used to measure mortality associated with pregnanc y. The numerator is the number of deaths during a given time period am ong women while pregnant or within 42 days of term ination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and the site of the pregna ncy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its manage ment, but not from accidental or incidental causes. The denominator is the number of live births reported during the same time period. Maternal mortality rate is usually expressed per 100,000 live births. In 2003, the U.S. maternal mortality rate was 8.9 per 100,000 live births.8 Sex-specific mortality ra te A sex-specific mortality rate is a mortality rate among either males or females. Both numerator and denominator are limited to the one sex. Race-specific mortality rate A race-specific mortality rate is a mortality rate related to a specified racial group. Both numerator and denominator are limited to the specified race. Combinations of specific mortality rates Mortality rates can be further st ratified by combinations of cause, age, sex, and/or race. For exam ple, in 2002, the death rate from diseases of the heart among wo men ages 45-54 years was 50.6 per 100,000.9 The death rate from diseases of the heart among men in the same age group was 138.4 per 100,000, or more than 2.5 times as high as the comparable rate for women. These rates are a cause-, age-, and s ex-specific rates, be cause they refer to one cause (diseases of the heart), one ag e group (45-54 years), and one sex (female or male). Measures of Risk Page 3-24 EXAMPLE: Calculating Mortality Rates Table 3.5 provides the number of deaths from all causes and from accidents (unintentional injuries) by age group in the United States in 2002. Review the following rates. Determ ine what to call each one, then calculate it using the data provided in Table 3.5. a. Unintentio nal-injury- specific mortality rate for the entire population This is a cause-specific mortality rate. Rate = number of unintentio nal injury deaths in the entire populatio n x 100,000 estimated midyear population = (106,742 / 288,357,000) x 100,000 = 37.0 uninten tional-injury-rela ted deaths per 100,000 population b. All-cause mortality rate for 25-34 year olds This is an age-specific mortality rate. Rate = number of deaths from all causes among 25-34 year olds x 100,000 estimated midyear population of 25-34 year olds = (41,355 / 39,928,000) x 100,000 = 103.6 deaths per 100,000 25-34 year olds c. All-cause mortality among males This is a sex-specific mortali ty rate. Rate = number of deaths from all causes among males x 100,000 estimated midyear popula tion of males = (1,199,264 / 141,656,000) x 100,000 = 846.6 deaths per 100,000 males d. Unintentio nal-injury- specific mortality among 25- to 34-year-old males This is a cause-specific, age-s pecific, and sex-specific mortality rate Rate = number of unintentional injury deaths among 25-34 year old males x 100,000 estimated midyear population of 25-34 year old males = (9,635 / 20,203,000) x 100,000 = 47.7 uninten tional-injury-relate d deaths per 100,000 25-34 year olds Measures of Risk Page 3-25 Table 3.5 All-Cause and Unintentional Injury Mortality and Estimated Population by Age Group, For Both Sexes and For Males Alone, United States, 2002 All Race s, Bot h Sexe s All Race s, Male s Age group All Unin tentional Estima ted All Unin tentional Estima ted (years) Causes Injuries Pop.

Age-adjusted mortality rates Mortality rates can be used to compare the rates in one area with the rates in another area, or to compare rates over time. However, because m ortality rates o bviously increase with age, a higher mortality rate am ong one population than am ong a nother m ight simply reflect the fact that the first population is older than the second. Consider that the mortality rates in 2002 for the states of Alaska and Florida were 472.2 and 1,005.7 per 100,000, respectively (see Table 3.6). Should everyone from Florida move to Alaska to reduce their risk of death? No, the reason that Alaska's mortality rate is so much lower than Florid a's is that Alaska's population is considerably younger. Indeed, fo r seven age groups, the age- specific mortality rates in Alaska are actually higher than F lorida's. To eliminate the distortion caused by different underlying age distributions in differe nt populations, statistica l techniques are used to adjust or standardize the rates among the populations to be compared. These techniques take a weighted average of the age- specific mortality rates, and eliminate the effect of different age distributions among the different populations. Mortality rates computed with these techniques are age-adjusted or age-standardized mortality rates. Alaska's 2002 age-adjusted mortality rate (794.1 per 100,000) was higher than Florida's (787.8 per 100,000), which is not surpri sing given that 7 of 13 age- specific mortality rates were higher in Alaska than Florida. Death-to-case ratio Definition of death-to-case ratio The death-to-case ratio is the number of deaths attributed to a particular disease during a speci fied time period divided by the number of new cases of that di sease identified during the same time period. The death-to-case ratio is a ratio but n ot necessarily a proportion, because some of the deaths that are counted in the numerator might have occurred among persons who developed disease in an earlier period, and are therefore not counted in the denominator.

Check your answers on page 3-52 Measures of Risk Page 3-30 Case-fatality rate The case-fatality rate is the proporti on of persons with a particular condition (cases) who die from that condition. It is a measure of the severity of the condition. The formula is: Number of cause-specific deaths am ong the incident cases Number of incident cases x 10n The case-fatality rate is a proportion , so the numerator is restricted to deaths among people included in the denom inator. The time periods for the num erator and the denom inator do not need to be the same; the denominator could be cases of HIV/AIDS diagnosed during the calendar year 1990, a nd the numerator, deaths among those diagnosed with HIV in 1990, could be from 1990 to the present. EXAMPLE: Calculating Case-Fatality Rates In an epidemic of hepatitis A traced to green onions from a restaurant, 555 cases were identified. Three of the case- patients died as a result of their infections. Calculate the case-fatality rate. Case-fatality rate = (3 / 555) x 100 = 0.5% The case-fatality rate is a proporti on, not a true rate. As a result, some epidemiologists prefer the term case-fatality ratio. The concept behind the case-fatali ty rate and the death-to-case ratio is similar, but the formulations are different. The death-to- case ratio is simply the number of cause-specific deaths that occurred during a specified tim e divided by the num ber of new cases of that disease that occu rred during the same tim e. The deaths included in the numerator of the death-to-case ratio are not restricted to the new cases in the denom inator; in fact, for m any diseases, the deaths are among persons whose onset of disease was years earlier. In contrast, in the case-fatality rate, the deaths included in the numerator are restricted to the cases in the denominator. Proportionate mortality Definition of proportionate mortality Proportionate mortality describes the proportion of deaths in a specified population over a period of time attributable to different causes. Each cause is expressed as a percentage of all deaths, and Measures of Risk Page 3-31 the sum of the causes must add to 100%. These proportions are not mortality rates, becaus e the denom inator is all deaths rather than the population in which the deaths occurred. Method for calculating proportionate mortality For a specified population over a specified period, Deaths caused by a particular cause Deaths from all causes x 100 The distribution of prim ary causes of death in the United States in 2003 for the entire population (all ages) and for persons ages 25- 44 years are provided in Table 3.1. As illustrated in that table, accidents (unintentional injuries) accounted for 4.3% of all deaths, but 21.6% of deaths am ong 25-44 year olds.8 Sometimes, particularly in occupational epidem iology, proportionate mortality is used to compare deaths in a population of interest (say, a workplace) with the proportionate mortality in the broader population. This comparison of two proportionate mortalities is called a proportionate mortality ratio , or PMR for short. A PMR greater than 1.0 indi cates that a particular cause accounts for a greater proportion of deaths in the population of interest than you m ight expect. Fo r exam ple, construction workers may be more likely to die of injuries than the general population. However, PMRs can be misleadi ng, because they are not based on mortality rates. A low cause-spe cific mortality rate in the population of interest can elevate the proportionate m ortalities for all of the other causes, because they must add up to 100%. T hose workers with a high injury-relate d proportionate mortality very likely have lower proportionate m ortalities for chronic or disabling conditions that keep people out of the workforce. In other words, people who work are m ore likely to be healthier than the population as a whole \u2014 this is known as the healthy worker effect.

Check your answers on page 3-52 Measures of Risk Page 3-33 Years of potential life lost Definition of years of potential life lost Years of potential life lost (YPLL) is one measure of the impact of premature mortality on a population. Additional measures incorporate disability and other m easures of quality of life. YPLL is calculated as the sum of the differences between a predeterm ined end point and the ages of death for those who died before that end point. The two most commonly used end points are age 65 years and averag e life expectancy. The use of YPLL is affected by this calculation, which implies a value system in which more wei ght is given to a death when it occurs at an earlier age. Thus, deaths at older ages are \"devalued.\" However, the YPLL before age 65 (YPLL 65) places much more emphasis on deaths at early ages than does YPLL based on remaining life expectancy (YPLL LE). In 2000, the rem aining life expectancy was 21.6 years for a 60-year-old, 11.3 years for a 70- year-old, and 8.6 for an 80-year-old. YPLL 65 is based on the fewer than 30% of deaths that occur among persons younger than 65. In contras t, YPLL for life expectancy (YPLL LE) is based on deaths among persons of all ages, so it more closely resembles crude mortality rates.10 YPLL rates can be used to com pare YPLL a mong populations of different sizes. Because differe nt po pulations may also hav e different age distributions, YPLL ra tes are usually age-adjusted to eliminate the effect of differing age distributions. Method for calculating YPLL from a line listing Step 1. Decide on end point (65 year s, average life expectancy, or other). Step 2. Exclude records of all persons who died at or after the end point. Step 3. For each person who died before the end point, calculate that person's YPLL by subtracting the age at death from the end point. YPLLindividual = end point - age at death Step 4. Sum the individual YPLLs. YPLL = ! YPLLindividual Measures of Risk Page 3-34 Method for calculating YPLL from a frequency Step 1. Ensure that age groups break at the identified end point (e.g., 65 years). Eliminate all age groups older than the endpoint. Step 2. For each age group younger than the end point, identify the midpoint of the age group, where midpoint = age group's youngest age in years + oldest age + 1 2 Step 3. For each age group younger than the end point, identify that age group's YPLL by subtracting the m idpoint from the end point. Step 4 . Calculate age-specific YPLL by multiplying the age group's YPLL times the number of persons in that age group. Step 5. Sum the age-specific YPLL's. The YPLL rate represents years of poten tial life lost per 1,000 population below the end-point age, such as 65 years. YPLL rates should be used to compare premature mortality in different populations, because YPLL does not take in to account differences in population sizes. The for mula for a YPLL rate is as follows: Years of potential life lost Population under age 65 years x 10n Measures of Risk Page 3-35 EXAMPLE: Calculating YPLL and YPLL Rates Use the data in Tables 3.9 and 3.10 to calculate the leukem ia-related mortality rate for all ages, mortality rate for persons under age 65 years, YPLL, and YPLL rate. 1. Leukemia-related mortality rate, all ages = (21,498 / 288,357,000) x 100,000 = 7.5 leukemia deaths per 100,000 population 2. Leukemia-related mortality rate for persons under age 65 years = 125 + 316 + 472 + 471 + 767 + 1,459 + 2,611 = x 100,000 + 26,602) = 6,221 / 252,755,000 = x 100,000 = 2.5 leukemia deaths per 100,000 persons under age 65 years 3. Leukemia-related YPLL a. Calculate the midpoint of each age interval. Using the previously shown formula, the midpoint of the age group 0-4 years is (0 + 4 + 1) / 2, or 5 / 2, or 2.5 years. Using the same formula, midpoints must be determined for each age group up to and including the age group 55 to 64 years (see column 3 of Table 3.10). b. Subtract the midpoint from the end point to determine the years of potential life lost for a particular age group. For the age group 0-4 years, each death repres ents 65 minus 2.5, or 62.5 years of potential life lost (see column 4 of Table 3.10). c. Calculate age-specific years of potential life lost by multiplying the number of deaths in a given age group by its years of potential life lost. For the age group 0-4 years, 125 deaths x 62.5 = 7,812.5 YPLL (see column 5 of Table 3.10). d. Total the age-specific YPLL. The total YPLL attribut ed to leukemia in the United States in 2002 was 117,033 years (see Total of column 5, Table 3.10). 4. Leukemia-related YPLL rate = YPLL 65 rate = YPLL divided by population to age 65 = (117,033 / 252,755,000) x 1,000 = 0.5 YPLL per 1,000 population under age 65 Measures of Risk Page 3-36 Table 3 .9 Deaths Attribut ed to HI V or Leukemia by Age Group, United States, 2002 Age group Popula tion Numb er of Numb er of (Years) (X 1,000) HIV Deaths Leukemia Deaths 0-4 19,597 12 125 5-14 14,095 21,498 Data Source: Web-based System (WISQARS) [online database] Atlanta; National Center for Injury Prevention and Control.

Occasionally you m ight observe an incidence rate among a population that seem s high and wonder whether it is actually higher than what should be expected based on, say, the incidence rates in other communities. Or, you might observe that, am ong a group of case- patients in an outbreak, several report having eaten at a particular restaurant. Is the restaurant just a popular one, or have m ore case- patients eaten there than would be expected? The way to address that concern is by com paring the observed group with another group that represents the expected level. A measure of association quan tifies the relationship between exposure and disease among the two groups. Exposure is used loosely to mean not only exposure to foods, m osquitoes, a partner with a sexually transm issible disease, or a toxic waste dum p, but also inherent characteristics of persons (for example, age, race, sex), biologic characteristic s (imm une status), acquired characteristics (marital status), activities (occupation, leisure activities), or conditions under which they live (socioeconom ic status or access to m edical care). The m easures of association described in the following section compare disease occurrence among one group with disease Measures of Risk Page 3-39 occurrence in another group. Exam ples of measures of association include risk ratio (relative risk), rate ratio, odds ratio, and proportionate mortality ratio. Risk ratio Definition of risk ratio A risk ratio (RR), also called relati ve risk, compares the risk of a health event (disease, injury, risk factor, or death) am ong one group with the risk am ong another group. It does so by dividing the risk (incidence proportion, attack rate) in group 1 by the risk (incidence proportion, attack rate) in group 2 . The two groups are typically differentiated by such demographic factors as sex (e.g., males versus fe males) or by exposure to a suspected risk factor (e.g., did or did not eat potato salad). Often, the group of primary interest is labeled the exposed group, and the comparison group is labeled the unexposed group. Method for Calculating risk ratio The formula for risk ratio (RR) is: Risk of disease (incidence proportion, attack rate) in group of primary interest Risk of disease (incidence proportion, attack rate) in comparison group A risk ratio of 1.0 indicates identical risk among the two groups. A risk ratio greater than 1.0 indica tes an increased risk for the group in the num erator, usually the exposed group. A risk ratio less than 1.0 indicates a decreased risk for the exposed group, indicating that perhaps exp osure actually protects ag ainst d isease occurrence. Measures of Risk Page 3-40 EXAMPLES: Calculating Risk Ratios Example A: In an outbrea k of tuberculosis among prison inmates in South Carolina in 1999, 28 of 157 inmates residing on the East wing of the dormitory developed tuberculosis, compared with 4 of 137 inmates residing on the West wing.11 These data are summarized in the two-by-two table so called because it has two rows for the exposure and two columns for the outcome. Here is the general format and notation. Table 3.12A General Format and Not ation for a Two- by-Two Table Ill Well Total Exposed a b a + b = H1 Unexposed c d c + d = H0 Total a + c = V1 b + d = V0 T In this example , the exposure is the dormitor y wing and the outcome is tuberculosis ) illustrated in Table 3.12B. Calculate the risk ratio. Table 3.12B Incidence of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Infection Among Congregated, HIV-Infected Prison Inmates by Dormitory Wing, South Carolina, 1999 Developed t uberculo sis? Yes No Total East wing a = 28 b = 129 H1 =157 West wing c = 4 d = 133 H0=137 Total 32 262 T=294 Data source: McLaughlin Drociuk D, Pozsik CJ, Onorato I. Extensive transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis among congregated, HIV-infected prison inmates in South Carolina, United States. Int J Tuberc Lung Dis 2003;7:665-672. To calculate the risk ratio, first calculate the risk or attack rate for each group. Here are the formulas: Attack Rate (Risk) Attack rate for exposed = a / a+b Attack rate for unexposed = c / c+d For this example: Risk of tuberculosis among East wing residents = 28 / 157 = 0.178 = 17.8% Risk of tuberculosis among West wing residents = 4 / 137 = 0.029 = 2.9% The risk ratio is simply the ratio of these two risks: Risk ratio = 17.8 / 2.9 = 6.1 Thus, inmates who resided in the East wing of the dormitor y were 6.1 times as likely to develop tuberculosis as those who resided in the West wing. Measures of Risk Page 3-41 EXAMPLES: Calculating Risk Ratios Example B: In an outbrea k of varicella (chickenpox) in Oregon in 2002, varicella was diagnosed in 18 of 152 vaccinated children compared with 3 of 7 unvaccinated children. Calculate the risk ratio. Table 3.1 3 Incidence of Varicella Among Schoolchildren in 9 Af fected Classrooms, Oregon, 2002 Varicella Non-case Total Vaccinated a = 18 b = 134 152 Unvaccinated c = 3 d = 4 7 Total 21 138 159 Data Source: Tugwell BD, Lee LE, Gillette H, Lorber EM, Hedberg K, Cieslak PR. Chickenpox outbreak in a highly vaccinated school population. Pediatrics 2004 Mar;113(3 Pt 1):455-459. Risk of varicella among vaccinated children = 18 / 152 = 0.118 = 11.8% Risk of varicella among unvaccinated children = 3 / 7 = 0.429 = 42.9% Risk ratio = 0.118 / 0.429 = 0.28 The risk ratio is less than 1.0, indicating a decreased risk or protective effect for the exposed (vaccinated) children. The risk ratio of 0.28 indicates that vaccinate d children were only approximatel y one-fourth as likely (28%, actually) to develop varicella as were unvaccinated children. Rate ratio A rate ratio compares the incidence rates, person-time rates, or mortality rates of two groups. As w ith the risk ratio, the two groups are typically differentiated by de mographic factors or by exposure to a suspected causative agent. The rate for the group of primary interest is divided by the rate for the comparison group. Rate for group of primary interest Rate ratio = Rate for comparison group The interpretation of the value of a rate ratio is similar to that of the risk ratio. That is, a rate ratio of 1.0 indicates equal rates in the two groups, a rate ratio greater than 1.0 indicates an increased risk for the group in the num erator, and a rate ratio less than 1.0 indicates a d ecreased ris k for the group in the numerator. Measures of Risk Page 3-42 EXAMPLE: Calculating Rate Ratios Public health officials were called to investigate a perceived increase in visits to ships' infirmaries for acute respiratory illness (ARI) by passengers of cruise ships in Alaska in 1998.13 The officials compared passenger visits to ship infirmaries for ARI during May-August 1998 with the same period in 1997. They recorded 11.6 visits for ARI per 1,000 tourists per week in 1998, compar ed with 5.3 visits per 1,000 tourists per week in 1997. Calculate the rate ratio. Rate ratio = 11.6 / 5.3 = 2.2 Passengers on cruise ships in Alaska during May-August 1998 were more than twice as likely to visit their ships' infirmaries for ARI than were passengers in 1997. (Note: Of 58 viral isolates identified from nasal cultur es from passengers, most were influenza A, making this the largest summertime influenza outbreak in North America.)

Check your answers on page 3-53 Measures of Risk Page 3-44 Odds ratio An odds ratio (OR) is another measure of association that quantifies the relationship between an exposure with two categories and health outcom e. Refe rring to the four cells in Table 3.15, the odds ratio is calculated as a cOdds ratio =(b)(d)= ad / bc where a = number of persons exposed and with disease b = number of persons exposed but without disease c = number of persons unexposed but with disease d = number of persons unexposed: and without disease a+c = total number of persons with disease (case-patien ts) b+d = total number of persons without disease (controls) The odds ratio is sometimes called the cross-product ratio because the numerator is based on multiplying the value in cell \"a\" times the value in cell \"d,\" whereas the denominator is the product of cell \"b\" and cell \"c.\" A line from cell \"a\" to cell \"d\" (for the numerator) and another from cell \"b\" to cell \"c\" (for the denominator) creates an x or cross on the two-by-two table. Table 3.15 Exposure and Disease in a Hypothetical Population of 10,000 Persons Disease No Disease Total Risk Exposed a=100 b=1,900 2,000 5.0% Not Exposed c=80 d=7,920 8,000 1.0% 180 9,820 10,000 Measures of Risk Page 3-45 EXAMPLE: Calculating Odds Ratios Use the data in Table 3.15 to calculate the risk and odds ratios. 1. Risk ratio 5.0 / 1.0 = 5.0 2. Odds ratio (100 x 7,920) / (1,900 x 80) = 5.2 Notice that the odds ratio of 5.2 is close to the risk ratio of 5.0. That is one of the attractive features of the odds ratio \u2014 when the health outcome is uncommon , the odds ratio provides a reason able approximation of the risk ratio. Another attractive feature is that the odds ratio can be calculated with data from a case-control study, whereas neither a risk ratio nor a rate ratio can be calculated. In a case-con trol study, investigators enroll a group of case-patients (distributed in cells a and c of the two-by-two table), and a group of non-cases or contro ls (distributed in cells b and d). The odds ratio is the m easure of c hoice in a case-control study (see Lesson 1). A case-con trol study is based on enrolling a group of persons with disease (\"case-pati ents\") and a comparable group without disease (\"controls\"). The nu mber of persons in the control group is usually decided by the investigator. Often, the size of the population from which the case-pa tients cam e is not known. As a result, risks, rates, risk ratios or rate ratios cannot be calculated from the typical case-control study. However, you can calculate an odds ratio and interpret it as an approxim ation of the risk ratio, particularly when the disease is uncommon in the population. Measures of Risk Page 3-46 Exercise 3.8 Calculate the odds ratio for the tuberculosis data in Table 3.12. Would you say that your odds ratio is an accurate approximati on of the risk ratio? (Hint: The more common the disease, the further the odds ratio is from the risk ratio.) Check your answers on page 3-54 Measures of Risk Page 3-47 Measures of Publi c Health Impact A measure of public health impact is used to place the association between an exposure and an outco me into a m eaningful public health context. Whereas a measure of association quantifies the relationship between exposure and disease, and thus begins to provide insight into causal relations hips, m easures of public health impact reflect the burden that an exposure contributes to the frequency of disease in the popul ation. Two measures of public health impact often used are the attributable proportion and efficacy or effectiveness. Attributable proportion Definition of attributable proportion The attributable proportion, also known as the attr ibutable risk percent, is a measure of the public health impact of a causative factor. The calculation of this m easure assum es that the occurrence of disease in the unexposed group represents the baseline or expected risk for that disease. It further assumes that if the risk of disease in the exposed group is higher than the risk in the unexposed group, the difference can be attributed to the exposure. Thus, the attributable proportion is the amount of disease in the exposed group attributable to the exposure. It represents the expected reduction in disease if the exposure could be removed (or never existed). Appropriate use of attributable proportion depends on a single risk factor being responsible for a condition. When multiple risk factors may interact (e.g., physical activity a nd age or health status), this measure may not be appropriate. Method for calculating attributable proportion Attributable proportion is calculated as follows: Risk for exposed group - risk for unexposed group Risk for exposed group x 100% Attributable proportion can be calcu lated for rates in the same way. Measures of Risk Page 3-48 EXAMPLE: Calculating Attributable Proportion In another study of smoking and lung cancer, the lung cancer mortality rate among nonsmokers was 0.07 per 1,000 persons per year.14 The lung cancer mortality rate among persons who smoked 1-14 cigarettes per day was 0.57 lung cancer deaths per 1,000 persons per year. Calculate the attributable proportion. Attributable proportion = (0.57 - 0.07) / 0.57 x 100% = 87.7% Given the proven causal relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer, and assuming that the groups are comparable in all other ways, one could say that about 88% of the lung cancer among smokers of 1-14 cigarettes per day might be attributable to their smoking. The remaining 12% of the lung cancer cases in this group would have occurred anyway. Vaccine efficacy or vaccine effectiveness Vaccine efficacy and vaccine effectiveness m easure the proportionate reduction in cases am ong vaccinated persons. Vaccine efficacy is used when a study is carried out under ideal conditions, for example, during a clinical trial. Vaccine effectiveness is used when a study is carried out under typical field (that is, less than perfectly controlled) conditions. Vaccine efficacy/effectiveness (VE) is m easured by calcu lating the risk of disease am ong vacci nated and unvaccinated person s and determ ining the percentage reduction in risk of disease among vaccinated persons relative to unvaccinated persons. The greater the percentage reduction of illness in the vaccinated group, the greater the vaccine efficacy/effectiven ess. T he basic formula is written as: Risk among unvaccinated group - risk among vaccinated group Risk among unvaccinated group OR: 1 - risk ratio In the first formula, the numerator (risk among unvaccinated - risk among vaccinated) is sometimes called the risk difference or excess risk. Vaccine efficacy/effectiveness is interpreted as the proportionate reduction in diseas e among the vaccinated group. So a VE of 90% indicates a 90% reduction in disease occurrence among the vaccinated gro up, or a 90% reduction from the number of cases you would expect if they have not been vaccinated. Measures of Risk Page 3-49 EXAMPLE: Calculating Vaccine Effectiveness Calculate the vaccine effectiveness from the varicella data in Table 3.13. VE = (42.9 - 11.8) / 42.9 = 31.1 / 42.9 = 72% Alternatively, VE = 1 - RR = 1 - 0.28 = 72% So, the vaccina ted group experienced 72% fewer varicella cases than they would have if they had not been vaccinated. Measures of Risk Page 3-50 Summar y Because many of the variables encou ntered in field epidemiology are nominal-scale variables, frequency measures are used quite comm only in epidem iology. Frequency measures include ratios, proportions, and rates. Ratios and proportions are useful for describing the characteristics of populations. Proportions and rates are used for quantifying morbidity and mortality. These measures allow epidem iologists to infer risk among different groups, det ect groups at high risk, and develop hypotheses about cause s \u2014 that is, why these groups might be at increased risk. The two prim ary m easures of m orbidity are incidence and prevalence. ! Incidence rates reflect the occurrence of new disease in a population. ! Prevalence reflects the presence of disease in a population. A variety of mortality rates describe deaths among specific groups, particularly by age or sex or by cause. The hallmark of epidemiologic analysis is comparison, such as comparison of observed amount of disease in a population with the expected am ount of dis ease. The comparisons can be quantified by using such measures of association as risk ratios, rate ratios, and odds ratios. These measures provide evidence regarding causal relationships between exposures and disease. Measures of public health impact place the association between an expos ure and a disease in a public health context. Two such measures are the attribu table proportion and vaccin e efficacy.

D; this is a ratio (heart disease:smokers) Exercise 3.3 1. Homicide-related death rate (males) = (# hom icide deaths among m ales / m ale population) x 100,000 = 15,555 / 139,813,000 x 100,000 = 11.1 homicide deaths / 100,000 population among males Homicide-related death rate (females) = (# homicide deaths among females / female population) x 100,000 = 4,753 / 144,984,000 x 100,000 = 3.3 homicide deaths / 100,000 population among females 2. These are cause- and sex-specific mortality rates. 3. Homicide-mortality rate ratio = homicide death rate (males) / homicide death rate (females) = 11.1 / 3.3 = 3.4 to 1 = (see below, which is the answer to question 4). Measures of Risk Page 3-52 4. Because the homicide rate among males is higher than the homicide rate among females, specific intervention programs need to target m ales and fem ales differently. 5 22.72 The number of new cases and deaths from dipht heria declined dram atically from the 1940s through the 1980s, but remained roughly level at very low levels in the 1990s. The death-to-case ratio was actually higher in the 1980s and 1990s than in 1940s and 1950s. From these data one might conclude that the decline in deaths is a result of the decline in cases, that is, from prevention, rather than from any improvem ent in the treatment of cases that do occur. Exercise 3.5 Proportionate mortality for diseases of heart, 25-44 years = (# deaths from diseases of hear t / # deaths from all causes) x 100 = 16,283 / 128,294 x 100 = 12.6% Proportionate mortality for assault (homicide), 25-44 years = (# deaths from assault (homicide) / # deaths from all causes) x 100 = 7,367 / 128,924 x 100 = 5.7% Exercise 3.6 1. HIV-related mortality rate, all ages = (# deaths from HIV / estim ated population, 2002) x 100,000 = (14,095 / 288,357,000) x 100,000 = 4.9 HIV deaths per 100,000 population 2. HIV-related mortality rate for persons under 65 years = (# deaths from HIV among <65 years year-olds / estimated population < 65 years, 2002) x 100,000 = (12 + 25 + 178 + 1,839 + 5,707 + 4,474 + 26,602) x 100,000 = 13,582 / 252,755,000 x 100,000 = 5.4 HIV deaths per 100,000 persons under age 65 years Measures of Risk Page 3-53 3.

An advocate for HIV funding might use the last four measures, since they highlight HIV deaths am ong younger persons. Exercise 3.7 1. Rate ratio comparing curren t smokers with nonsmokers = rate among current smokers / rate among non-smokers = 1.30 / 0.07 = 18.6 Measures of Risk Page 3-54 2. Rate ratio comparing ex-sm okers who qu it at least 20 years ago with nonsmokers = rate among ex-smokers / rate among non-smokers = 0.19 / 0.07 = 2.7 3. The lung cancer rate among smokers is 18 times as high as the rate among non-smokers. Smokers who quit can lower their rate considerably, but it neve r gets back to the low level seen in never-sm okers. So the public health message might be, \"If you smoke, quit. But better yet, don't start.\" Exercise 3.8 Odds ratio = ad / bc = (28 x 133) / (129 x 4) = 7.2 The odds ratio of 7.2 is som ewhat larger (18% larger, to be precise) than the risk ratio of 6.1. Whether that difference is \"reasonable\" or not is a judgm ent call. The odds ratio of 7.2 and the risk ratio of 6.1 both reflect a very strong associ ation between prison wing and risk of developing tuberculosis.

The population of Community B is, on average, older than that of Community A Measures of Risk Page 3-61 Answers to Self-Assessment Quiz 1. A, B, C, D. Frequency measures of health and disease include those related to birth, death, and morbid ity (incidence and prevalenc e). 2. A, B. All fractions are ratios. This fraction is also a proportion, becaus e all of the deaths from lung cancer in the numerator are included in the denominator. It is not an incidence proportion, because the denominator is not the size of the population at the start of the period. It is not a mortality rate because the denominator is not the estimated midpoint population. 3. A. All fractions are ratios. This fraction is not a proportion , because lung cancer deaths in the numerat or are not included in the denom inator. It is not an inciden ce proportion, because the denominator is not the size of the population at the start of the period. It is not a mortality rate because the denominat or is not the estimated midpoint population. 4. A, D. All fractions are ratios. This fraction is not a proportion, becau se some of the deaths occurred before July 1, so those women are not included in the calculation. It is not an incidence proportion, because the denominat or is not the size of the population at the start of the period. It is a mortal ity rate because the denominator is the estimated midpoint population . 5. A. All fractions, including proportions, are ratios. But only ratios in which the numerator is included in the denominator is a proportions. 6. C. Probability or risk are estimated by the incidence proportion, calculated as the number of new cases during a specified period divided by the size of the popul ation at the start of that period . 7. B. The secondary attack rate is calculated as the number of cases among contact s (4) divided by the number of contacts (10). 8. D. During year 1, 92 returning patients contributed 92 person-years; 8 patients lost to follow-up contributed 8 x \u00bd or 4 years, for a total of 96. During the second year, 78 disease-free patients contributed 78 person -years, plus \u00bd years for the 2 with newly diagnosed eye disease, the 2 who had died, and the 10 lost to follow-up (all events are assumed to have occurr ed randomly during the year, or an average, at the half-yea r point), for a total of 78 + 14 x \u00bd years, for another 85 years. During the third year, returning healthy patien ts contribut ed 60 years; the 3 with eye disease, the 4 who died, and the 11 lost to follow-up contributed 18 x \u00bd years or 9 years , for a total of 69 years during the 3rd year. The total person -years is therefore 96 + 85 + 69 = 250 person -years. 9. C, D. The person-time rate present ed in Question 8 should be reported as 5 cases per 250 person-years. Usual ly person-tim e rates are expressed per 1,000 or 10,000 or 100,000, depending on the rarity of the disease, so the rate in Question 8 could be expressed as 2 cases per 100 person -years of follow-up. One could express this more colloquially as 2 new cases of eye disease per 100 diabetics per year. Measures of Risk Page 3-62 10. A. Measure of risk B. Generally preferred for chronic diseases without clear date of onset A. Used in calculation of risk ratio B. Affected by duration of illness Incidence reflects new cases only; incidence proportion is a measure of risk. A risk ratio is simply the ratio of two incidence proportio ns. Prevalence reflects existing cases at a given point or period of time, so one does not need to know the date of onset . Prevalenc e is influenced by both incidence and duration of disease \u2014 the more cases that occur and the longer the disease lasts, the greater the prevalence at any given time. Ill Well Total Yes 50 3 53 Ate wedding cake? No 4 22 26 Total 54 25 79 11. B, C, D. The fraction 54 / 79 (see bottom row of the table) reflects the overall attack rate among persons who attended the wedding and were interviewed. Attack rate is a synonym for incidenc e propo rtion. 12. D. The fraction 50 / 54 (under the Ill column) is the propo rtion of case-patients who ate wedding cake . It is not an attack rate, because the denominator of an attack rate is the size of the population at the start of the period, not all cases. 13. A, B, C, D. The fraction 50 / 53 (see top row of table) is the propo rtion of weddi ng cake eaters who became ill, which is a food-s pecific attack rate. A food-specific attack rate is a type of attack rate, which in turn is synonym ous with incidence proportion. 14. C. Investig ators were able to interview almost everyone who attended the weddin g, so incidence proportio ns (measure of risk) were calculated. When incide nce propo rtions (risks) can be calculated , the best measure of association to use is the ratio of incidence propo rtions (risks), i.e., risk ratio. 15. A. The risk ratio is calcu lated as the attack rate among cake eaters divided by the attack rate among those who did not eat cake, or (50 / 53) / (4 / 26), or 94.3% / 15.4% , which equals 6.1. 16. D. The attributable proportion is calculated as the attack rate among cake eaters minus the attack rate among non-eaters, divided by the attack rate among cake eaters, or 94.3 - 15.4) / 94.3, which equals 83.7%. This attributable proportio n means that 83.7% of the illness might be attributable to eating the wedding cake (note that some people got sick without eating cake, so the attributable proportion is not 100%). 17. D. A total of 8 cases are present at some time during the month of July. 18. C. Five new cases occurr ed during the month of July. Measures of Risk Page 3-63 19. A, D. The fraction shown is the infant mortality rate. It is a ratio, because all fractions are ratios. It is not a proportion because some of the children who died in early 2004 may have been born in late 2003, so some of those in the numerator are not in the denomin ator. Techn ically, the mortality rate for infants is the number of infants who died in 2004 divided by the estimated midyear population of infants, so the fraction shown is not a mortality rate in that sense. However, the fraction is know n throughout the world as the infant mortality rate, despite the technical inaccuracy. 20. E. The data shown in the table are numbers of deaths. No denomin ators are provi ded from which to calculate rates. Neither is the total number of deaths given, so proportionate mortality cannot be calculated. However, calculation of potential life lost need only the numbers of deaths by age, as shown. 21. C, D. Only crude and cause-specific mortality rates use the estimated total mid-year populati on as its denominator . The denomi nator for an age-specific mortality rate is the estimated mid-ye ar size of that particular age group. The denomin ator for a sex-specific mortality rate is the estimated mid-year male or female population . 22. A, C, D. The fraction is the mortal ity rate due to septicemia (cause) among men (sex) aged 65-74 years (age) . Age-specifi c mortality rates are narrowl y defin ed (in this fraction, limited to 10 years of age), so are generally valid for comparing two populations without any adjustm ent. 23. C. Vaccine efficacy measures the proportionat e reduction in disease among vaccinees. 24. C. The results of this study could be summa rized in a two-by-two table as follows: Cases Contr ols Total Yes a = 32 c = 20 52 Stored maize inside? No b = 8 d = 60 68 Total 40 80 120 The odds ratio is calcul ated as ad/bc, or (32 x 60) / (8 x 20), which equals 1,920 / 160 or 12.0. 25. C. The crude mortality rate reflects the mortal ity experien ce and the age distri bution of a community, whereas the age-adjusted mortality rate eliminates any differences in the age distributio n. So if Community A's age-adju sted mortal ity rate was lower than its crude rate, that indicates that its population is older. Measures of Risk Page 3-64 References 1.

The department must prepare an annual summary of the individual surveillance reports and other public health data from the year that just ended. This summary needs to display trends and patterns in a concise and understandable m anner. You have been selected to prepare this annual summary. What tools might you use to organize and display the data? Most annual reports use a combination of tables , graphs, and charts to summarize and display data clearly and effectively. Tables and graphs can be used to summarize a few dozen records or a few million. They are used every day by epidemiologists to summarize and better understand the data they or others have collected. Th ey can demonstrate distributions, trends, and relationships in the data that are not apparent fr om looking at individual records. Thus, tables and graphs are critical tools for descriptive and an alytic epidemiology. In addition, remembering the adage that a picture is worth a thousand words, you can use tables and graphs to communicate epidemiologic findings to others efficiently and effectively. T his lesson covers tabular and graphic techniques for data display; interpretation was covered in Lessons 2 and 3.

In examining data, one must first determine the data type in order to select the appropriate display form at. The data to be displayed will be in one of the following categories: ! Nominal ! Ordinal ! Discrete ! Continuous Nominal measurements have no intrinsic order and the difference between levels of the variable have no m eaning. In epidem iology, sex, race, or exposure category (yes/no) are examples of nominal measurements. Ordinal variables do have an intrinsic order, but, again, differences between levels are not relevant. Exam ples of ordinal variables are \"low, medium, high\" or perhaps categories of other variables (e.g., age ranges). Discrete variables have values that are integers (e.g., number of ill persons who were exposed to a risk factor). Finally, continuous variables can have any value in a range (e.g., amount of time between meal being served and onset of gastro-intestinal sym ptoms; infant mortality rate). Before constructing any display of epidemiologic data, it is important to first determine the point to be conveyed. Are you highlighting a change from past patterns in the data? Are you showing a difference in inciden ce by geographic area or by some predeterm ined risk factor? What is the interpretation you want the reader to reach? Your answer to these questions will help to determine the choice of display. To analyze data effectively, an epidemiologist must become familiar with the data before applying analytic techniques. The epidemiologist may begin by examining individual records such as those contained in a line listing. This review will be followed by production of a table to summ arize the data. Sometimes, the resulting tables are the only analysis that is needed, particularly when the amount of data is small and relationships are straightforward. When the data are m ore com plex, graphs and charts can help the epidemiologist visualize broader patterns and trends and identify variations from those trends. Variations in data may represent important new findings or only er rors in typing or coding which need to be corrected. Thus, tables and graphs can be helpful tools to aid in verifying and analyzing the data. Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-3 Once an analysis is complete, tables and graphs further serve as useful visual aids for describing th e data to others. When preparing tables and graphs, keep in mind that your primary purpose is to communicate information. Tables and graphs can be presente d using a variety of media. In epidemiology, the most common media are print and projection. This lesson will focus on creating effective and attractive tables and graphs for print and will also offer suggestions for projection. At the end, we present tables that summarize all techniques presented and guidelines for use. If a table is taken out of its original context , it should still convey all the information necessary for the reader to understand the data. Tables A table is a set of data arranged in rows and colum ns. Al most any quantitative information can be organized into a table. Tables are useful for demonstrating pattern s, exceptions, differences, and other relationships. In addition, tables usually serve as the basis for preparing additional visual displays of data, such as graphs and charts, in which some of the details may be lost. Tables designed to present data to others should be as simple as possible.1 Two or three small tables, each focusing on a different aspect of the data, are easier to understand than a single large table that contains many details or variables. A table in a printed publication should be self-explanatory. If a table is taken out of its original context, it should still convey all the inform ation necessary for the reader to understand th e data. To create a table that is self-explanatory, follow the guidelines below. More About Constructing Tables ! Use a clear and concise title that describes person, place and time \u2014 what, where, and when \u2014 of the data in the table. Precede the title with a table number. ! Label each row and each column and include the units of measurement for the data (for example, years, mm Hg, mg/dl, rate per 100,000). ! Show totals for rows and columns, where appropriate. If you show percentage s (%), also give their total (always 100). ! Identify missing or unknown data either within the table (for example, Table 4.11) or in a footnote below the table. ! Explain any codes, abbreviation s, or symbol s in a footnote (for example, Syphilis P&S = primary and secondary syphilis). ! Note exclusions in a footnote (e.g., 1 case and 2 controls with unknown family history were excluded from this analysis). ! Note the source of the data below the table or in a footnot e if the data are not original. Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-4 To create a frequency distribution from a data set in Analysis Module: Select frequencies, then choose variable under Frequencies of. (Since Epi Info 3 is the recommended version, only commands for this version are provided in the text; corresponding commands for Epi Info 6 are offered at the end of the lesson.) One-variable tables In descriptive epidem iology, the m ost basic table is a sim ple frequency distribution with only one variable, such as Table 4.1a, which displays number of reported syphilis cases in the United States in 2002 by age group.2 (Frequency distributions are discussed in Lesson 2.) In this type of frequency distribution table, the first column shows the values or categories of the variable represented by the data, such as age or sex. The second column shows the number of persons or events that fall into each category. In constructing any table, the choice of colum ns results from the interpretation to be made. In Table 4.1a, the point the analyst wishes to make is the role of age as a risk factor of syphilis. Thus, age group is chosen as column 1 and case count as column 2. Often, an additional column lists the percentage of persons or events in each category (see Table 4.1b). The percentages shown in Table 4.1b actually add up to 99.9% rather than 100.0% due to rounding to one decimal place. Rounding that results in totals of 99.9% or 100.1% is com mon in tabl es that show percentages. Nonetheless, the total percentage should be displayed as 100.0%, and a footnote explaining that the difference is due to rounding should be included. The addition of percent to a table shows the relative burden of illness; for example, in Table 4.1b, we see that the largest contribution to illness for any single age category is from 35-39 year olds. T he subsequent addi tion of cum ulative percent (e.g., Table 4.1c) allows the public health analyst to illustrate the impact of a targeted intervention . Here , any intervention effective at preventing syphilis among young people and young adults (under age 35) would prevent almost half of the cases in this population. The one-variable table can be further modified to show cumulative frequency and/or cumulative percentage, as in Table 4.1c. From this table, you can see at a gl ance that 46.7% of the prim ary and secondary syphilis cases occurred in persons younger than age 35 years, meaning that over half of the syphilis cases occurred in persons age 35 years or older. Note that the choice of age- groupings will affect the interpretatio n of your data.3 Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-5 Table 4.1a Reported Cases of Primary and Secondary Syphilis by Age\u2014United States, 2002 Age Group (years) Number of Cases <14 Data Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

To create a two-variable table from a data set in Analysis Module: Select frequencies, then choose variable under Frequencies of. Output shows table with row and column percentages, plus chi-square and p-value. For a two-by-two table, output also provides odds ratio, risk ratio, risk difference and confidence intervals. Note that for a cohort study, the row percentage in cells of ill patients is the attack proportion, sometimes called the attack rate. A two-variable table with data categorized jointly by those two variables is known as a contingency table . Table 4.3 is an example of a special type of contingency table, in which each of the two variables has two categories. This type of table is called a two-by-two table and is a favor ite among epidem iologists. Two- by-two tables are convenient for com paring persons with and without the exposure and those with and without the disease. From these data, epidemiologists can assess the relationship, if any, between the exposure and the disease. Table 4.3 is a two-by-two table that shows one of the key findings from an investigation of carbon m onoxide poisoning followi ng an ice storm and prolonged power failure in Maine.4 In the table, the exposure variable, location of power generator, ha s two categories \u2014 inside or outside the home. Similarly the outcom e variable, carbon monoxide poisoning, has two categories \u2014 cases (num ber of persons who became ill) and controls (number of persons who did not become ill).

Disease status (e.g., ill versus well, sometimes denoted cases vs. controls if a case-control study) is usually designated along the top of the table, and exposure status (e.g., exposed versus not exposed) is designated along the side. The letters a, b, c, and d within the 4 cells of the two-by-two table refer to the number of persons with the disease status indicated above and the exposure status indicated to its left. For example, in Table 4.4, \"c\" represents the number of persons in the study who are ill but who did not have the exposur e being studied. Note that the \"Hi\" represents horizontal totals; H 1 and H0 represent the total number of exposed and unexposed persons, respectively. The \"V i\" represents vertical totals; V1 and V 0 represent the total number of ill and well persons (or cases and controls), respectively. The total number of subjects included in th e two-by-two table is represented by the letter T (or N).

One exception to this rule occurs when a third variable modifies the effect (technically, produces an interaction) of the first two. Table 4.5 is intended to convey the wa y in which race/ethnicity may modify the effect of age and sex on incidence of syphilis. Because Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-8 three-way tables are often hard to understand, they should be used only when ample explanation and discussion is possible.

Composite tables To conserve space in a report or manuscript, several tables are sometimes combined into one. For example, epidemiologists often create simple frequency distri butions by age, sex, and other demographic variables as separate tables, but editors may combine them into one large composite table for publication. Table 4.8 is an example of a composite table from the investigation of carbon monoxide poisoning following the power failure in Maine.4 It is important to realize that this type of table should not be interpreted as for a three-way tabl e. The data in Table 4.8 have not been arrayed to indicate the interr elationship of sex, age, sm oking, and disposition from medical care. Merely, several one variable tables (independently assessing the number of cases by each of these variables) have been concat enated for space conservation . So this table would not help in assessing the modification that smoking has on the risk of illness by age, for example. This difference also explains why portraying total values would be inappropriate and m eaningless for T able 4.8. Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-12 .

Table shells Although you cannot analyze data before you have collected them , epidemiologists anticipate and design their analyses in advance to delineate what the study is going to convey, and to expedite the analysis once the data are collected. In fact, most protocols, which are written before a study can be conducted, require a description of how the data will be analyzed. As part of the analysis plan, you can develop table shells that show how the data will be organized and displayed. Table shells are tabl es that are complete except for the data. They show titles, headi ngs, and categories. In developing table shells that include conti nuous variables such as age, we create more categories than we may later use, in order to disclose any interesting patterns and quirks in the data. The following table shells were designed before conducting a case-control study of fractures related to falls in community- dwelling elderly persons. The re searchers were particularly interested in assessing whethe r vigorous and/or mild physical activity was associated with a lower risk of fall-related fractures. Table shells of epidemiologic studies usually follow a standard sequence from descriptive to anal ytic. The first and second tables in the sequence usually cover clinic al features of the health event and dem ographic characteristics of the subjects. Next, the analyst Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-13 portrays the association of most interest to the researchers, in this case, the association between physical activity and fracture. Subsequent tables may present stratified or ad justed analys es, refinements, and subset analyses. Of course, once the data are available and used for these tables, additional analyses will come to mind and should be pursued. This sequence of table shells provides a system atic and logical approach to the analysis. The first two tables (Table shells 4.9a and 4.9b), describing the health proble m of interest and the population studied, provide the background a re ader would need to put the analytic results in perspective.

Now that the data in Table shells 4.9a and 4.9b have illustrated descriptive characterist ics of cases and contro ls in this study, we are ready to refine the analysis by demonstrating the variability of the data as assessed by statistical confidence intervals. Because of the study design in this exam ple, we have chosen the odds ratio to assess statistical differences (s ee Lesson 3). Table shell 4.9c illustrates a useful display for this information.

Conventional Rounding Rules If a fraction is greater than .5 , round it up (e.g., round 6.6 to 7). If a fraction is less than .5, round it down (e.g., round 6.4 to 6). If a fraction is exactly .5 , it is recommen ded that you round it to the even value (e.g., round both 5.5 and 6.5 to 6). More common and also acceptable is to round it up (e.g., round 6.5 to 7) Creating class intervals If the epidem iologic hypothesis fo r the investiga tion involves variables such as \"gender\" or \"expos ure to a risk factor (yes/no),\" the construction of tables as desc ribed thus far in this chapter should be straightforward. Often, however, the presum ed risk factor may not be so conveniently packaged. We may need to investigate an infection acquired as a result of hospitalization and \"days of hospitalization\" may be relevant; for many chronic conditions, blood pressure is an important factor; if we are interested in the effect of al cohol consum ption on health risk, number of drinks per week may be an important measurement. These examples illus trate relevant variables that have a broader range of possible responses than are easily handled by the methods described earlier in this chapter. One solution in this case is to create class intervals for your data, keeping the following guidelines in mind: ! Class intervals should be mutually exclusive and exhaustive. In plain language, that means that each individual in your data set should fit uniquely into one class interval, and all persons should fit into som e class interval. So, for exam ple, age ranges should not overlap. Most measures follow conventional rounding rules (see sidebar). A general tip is to use a large number of class intervals for the initial analysis to gain an appreciation for the variability of your data. You can combine your categories later. ! Use principles of biologic pl ausibility when constructing categories. F or exam ple, when analyzing infant and childhood mortality, we might use categories of 0-12 months (since neonatal problems are different epidemiologically from those of other childhood problem s), 1-5 years (since these result Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-16 CDC's National Center for Health Statistics uses the following age categorizations : <1 infants 1-4 toddlers 5-14 adolescents 15-24 teens and young adults 25-44 adults 45-64 older adults >65 elderly from causes of death prim arily outside of institutions), and 5- 10 years (since these m ay result fr om risks in school settings). Table 4.10 illustrates age groups th at are sensible for the study of various health conditions that are behaviorally-related. ! A natural baseline group should be kept as a distinct category. Often the baseline group will include those who have not had an exposure, e.g., non-smokers (0 cigarettes per day). ! If you wish to calculate rates to illustrate the relative risk of adverse health events by these categories of risk factors, be sure that the intervals you choos e for the classes of your data are the same as the intervals for the denominators that you will find for readily available data. For exam ple, to compute rates of infant mortality by maternal age, you must find data on the number of live-born infants to women; in determining age groupings, consider what cate gories are used by the United States Census Bureau. ! Always consider a category for \"unknown\" or \"not stated.\" Table 4.10 Age Groupings Used for Different Conditi ons, as Reported in Surveil lance Summaries, CDC, 2003 Overw eight Traumati c Pregna ncy-Related Total Total Total In addition to these guidelines for creating class intervals, the analyst must decide how many intervals to portray. If no natural or standard class intervals are apparent, the strategies below m ay be helpful. Strategy 1: Divide the data into groups of similar size A particularly appropriate approach if you plan to create area maps (see later section on Maps) is to create a number of class intervals, each with the same number of observations. For example, to portray the rates of incidence of lung cancer by state (for men, 2001), one might group the rates into four class intervals, each with 10-12 observations: Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-17 Table 4.11 R ates of Lung Cancer in Men, 2001 by State (and the District of Columbia) Rate Numb er of S tates in the US Cumulat ive Frequency 22.1-48.3 11 11 48.4-53.3 11 22 53.4-58.7 12 34 58.8-73.3 10 44 Missing data 7 51 Data Source: U.S. Cancer Statistics Working Group. United States Cancer Statistics: 2002 Incidence and Mortality. Atlanta: U.S. Department of Health and Human Service s, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Cancer Institute; 2005. Strategy 2: Base intervals on mean and standard deviation With this strategy, you can create thr ee, four, or six class intervals. First, calculate the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of data. (Lesson 2 covers the calc ulation of these m easures.) Then use the mean plus or minus different multiples of the standard deviation to establish the upper limits for the intervals. This strategy is most appropriate for la rge data sets. For example, let's suppose you are investigating a scoring system for preparedness of health departm ents to respond to emerging and urgent threats. You have devised a series of evalua tion questions ranging from 0 to 100, with 100 being highest. You co nduct a survey and find that the scores for health departm ents in your jurisdiction range from 19 to 82; the m ean of the scores is 50, and the standard deviation is 10. Here, the strategy for establishi ng six intervals for these data specifies: Upper limit of interval 6 = maximum value = 82 Upper lim it of interval 5 = 50 + 20 = 70 Upper lim it of interval 4 = 50 + 10 = 60 Upper limit of interval 3 = 50 Upper limit of interval 2 = 50 $ 10 = 40 Upper limit of interval 1 = 50 $ 20 = 30 Lower limit of interval 1 = 19 If you then select the obvious lower limit for each upper limit, you have the six intervals: Interval 6 = 71-82 Interval 3 = 41-50 Interval 5 = 61-70 Interval 2 = 31-40 Interval 4 = 51-60 Interval 1 = 19-30 You can create three or four intervals by com bining som e of the adjacent six-interval limits. Strategy 3: Divide the range into equal class intervals This method is the simplest and most commonly used, and is most readily adapted to graphs. The sele ction of groups or categories is often arbitrary, but must be consistent (for exam ple, age groups by Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-18 5 or 10 years throughout the data set). To use equal class intervals, do the following: Find the range of the values in your data set. That is, find the difference between the maximum value (or some slightly larger convenient value) and zero (or the minimum value). Decide how many class intervals (groups or categories) you want to have. For tables, choose between four and eight class intervals. For graphs and maps, choose betwee n three and six class intervals. The number will depend on what aspects of the data you want to highlight. Find what size of class interval to use by dividing the range by the number of class intervals you have decided on. Begin with the m inimum value as the lower lim it of your first interval and specify class interval s of whatever size you calculated until you reach the maximum value in your data. For example, to display 52 observations, say the percentage of m en over age 40 screened for prostate cancer within the past two years in 2004 by state (including Puerto Rico and the D istrict of Colum bia), you could create five categories, each containing the number of states with percentages of screened m en in the given range.

Cancer Mortality-United States, 1990- 2000. In: Surveillance Summaries, June 4, 2004. MMWR 2004;53 (No. SS-3):23-30. Strategy 1: Divide the data into groups of similar size (Note: If the states in Table 4.13 had been listed alphabetic ally rather than in rank order, the first step would have been to sort the data into rank order by rate. Fortunately, this has already been done.) 1. Divide the list into four equal sized groups of places: 50 states / 4 = 12.5 states per group. Because states can't be cut in half, use two groups of 12 states and two groups of 13 states. Missouri (#13) could go into either the first or second group and Connecticut (#38) could go into either third or fourth group. Arbitrarily putting Missour i in the second category and Connecticut into the third results in the following groups: a. Kentucky throu gh Oklahoma (States 1-12) b. Missouri through Pennsylvania (States 13-25 ) c. Florida through Connecticut (States 26-38) d. New York through Utah (States 39-50) 2. Identify the rate for the first and last state in each group: a. Oklahoma through Kentuck y 89.4-116.1 b. Pennsylvania through Missour i 76.5-88.5 c. Connecticut through Florida 66.4-75.3 d. Utah through New York 39.7-66.2 Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-20 EXAMPLE: Creating Class Interval Categories (Continued) 3. Adjust the limits of each interval so no gap exists between the end of one class interval and beginning of the next. Deciding how to adjust the limits is somewhat arbitrary \u2014 you could split the difference, or use a convenient round number. a. Oklahoma through Kentuck y 89.0-116.1 b. Pennsylvania through Missour i 76.0-88.9 c. Connecticut through Florida 66.3-75.9 d. Utah through New York 39.7-66.2 Strategy 2: Base intervals on mean and standard deviation 1. Calculate the mean and standard deviation (see Lesso n 2 for instructio ns in calculating these measures.): Mean = 77.1 Standard deviation = 16.1 2. Find the upper limits of four intervals a. Upper limit of interval 4 = maximum value = 116.1 b. Upper limit of interval 3 = mean + 1 standard deviation = 77.1 + 16.1 = 93.2 c. Upper limit of interval 2 = mean = 77.1 d. Upper limit of interval 1 = mean - 1 standard deviation = 77.1 - 16.1 = 61.0 e. Lower limit of interval 1 = minimum value = 39.7 3. Select the lower limit for each upper limit to define four full intervals. Specify the states that fall into each interval. (Note: To place the states with the highest rates first, reverse the order of the intervals): a. North Carolina through Kentuc ky (8 states) 93.3-116.1 b. Rhode Island through Georgia (14 states) 77.1-93.2 c. Arizona through Iowa (21 states) 61.1-77.1 d. Utah through Minnesota (7 states) 39.7-61.0 Strategy 3: Divide the range into equal class intervals 1. Divide the range from zero (or the minimum value) to the maximum by 4: (116.1 - 39.7) / 4 = 76.4 / 4 = 19.1 2. Use multiples of 19.1 to create four categories, starting with 39.7: 39.7 through (39.7 + 19.1) = 39.7 through 58.8 58.9 through (39.7 + [2 x 19.1]) = 58.9 through 77.9 78.0 through [3 x 19.1]) = 97.1 19.1]) = 97.1 through 116.1 3. Final categories: a. Arkansas through Kentucky (7 states) 97.1-116.1 b. Delaware through North Carolina (14 states) 78.0-97.0 c. Idaho through Rhode Island (25 states) 58.9-77.9 d. Utah through New Mexico (4 states) 39.7-58.8 4. Alternatively, since 19.1 is close to 20, multiples of 20 might be used to create the four categories that might look cleaner. For example, the final categories could look like: a. Arkansas through Kentucky (7 states) 97.0-116.9 b. Iowa through North Carolina (16 states) 77.0-96.9 c. Idaho through Michigan (23 states) 57.0-76.9 d. Utah through New Mexico (4 states) 37.0-56.9 OR a. Alabama throu gh Kentucky (5 states) 100.0-119.9 b.

Avoid superfluity.\"13 - WS Cleveland Graphs A graph (used here interchangeably with chart) displays numeric data in visual form. It can display patterns, trends, aberrations, similarities, and differences in the data that may not be evident in tables. As such, a graph can be an essential tool for analyzing and trying to make sense of data. In addition, a graph is often an effective way to present data to others less familiar with the data. When designing graphs, the guidelines for categorizing data f or tables also apply. In addition, some best practices for graphics include: ! Ensure that a graphic can stand alone by clear labeling of title, source, axes, scales, and legends; ! Clearly identify variables portrayed (legends or keys), including units of m easure; ! Minimize number of lines on a graph; ! Generally, portray frequency on the vertical scale, starting at zero, and classification variable on horizontal scale; ! Ensure that scales for each axis are appropriate for data presented; ! Define any abbreviations or sym bols; and ! Specify any data excluded. In epidem iology, most graphs have two scales or axes, one horizontal and one vertical, that intersect at a right angle. The horizontal axis is known as the x-axis and generally shows values of the independent (or x) variable , such as tim e or age group. The vertical axis is the y-axis and shows the dependent (or y) variable, which, in epidem iology, is usually a f requency m easure such as number of cases or rate of disease. Each axis should be labeled to show what it represents (both the nam e of the variable and the units in which it is measured) and m arked by a scale of measurement along the line. In constructing a useful graph, the guidelines for categorizing data for tables by types of data also apply. For exam ple, the num ber of reported m easles cases by year of report is technically a nominal variab le, but because of the larg e number of cases when aggregated over the United States, we can treat this variable as a continuous one. As such, a line graph is appropriate to display these data. Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-23 Try It: P lotting a Graph Scenario: Table 4.14 shows the number of measles cases by year of report from 1950 to 2003. The number of measles cases in years 1950 through 1954 has been plotted in Figure 4.1, below. The independent variable, years, is shown on the horizontal axis. The dependent variable, number of cases, is shown on the vertical axis. A grid is included in Figure 4.1 to illustrate how points are plotted. For example, to plot the point on the graph for the number of cases in 1953, draw a line up from 1953, and then draw a line from 449 cases to the right. The point where these lines intersect is the point for 1953 on the graph. Your Turn: Use the data in Table 4.14 to plot the points for 1955 to 1959 and complete the graph in Figure 4.1.

In epidem iology, this type of graph is used to show long series of data and to compare several series. It is the method of choice for plotting rates over time. In an arithm etic-scale line gr aph, a set distance along any axis represents the same quantity anywhere on that axis. In Figure 4.2, for example, the space between tick marks along the y-axis (vertical axis) represents an increase of 10,000 (10 x 1,000) cases anywhere along the axis \u2014 a continuous variable. Furthermore, the distance between any two tick marks on the x- axis (horizontal axis) represents a period of tim e of one year. This represents an example of a discrete variable. Thus an arithmetic- scale line graph is one in which equal distances along either the x- or y- axis portray equal values. Arithmetic-scale line graphs can display numbers, rates, proportions, or other quantita tive measures on the y-axis. Generally, the x-axis for these grap hs is used to portray the time period of data occurrence, co llection, or reporting (e.g., days, weeks, m onths, or years). Thus, th ese graphs are prim arily used to portray an overall trend over time, rather than an analysis of particular observations (single da ta points). For exam ple, Figure 4.2 shows prevalence (of neural tube defects) per 100,000 births.

Here the y-axis is a calcula ted variable, median age at death of people born with Down's syndrome from 1983-1997. Here also, we see the value of showing two da ta series on one graph; we can compare the mortality risk for males and females.

More About the X-axis and the Y-axis When you create an arithmetic-scale line graph, you need to select a scale for the x- and y-axes. The scale should reflect both the data and the point of the graph. For example, if you use the data in Table 4.14 to graph the number of cases of measles cases by year from 1990 to 2002, then the scale of the x-axis will most likely be year of report, because that is how the data are available. Consider, howev er, if you had line-listed data with the actual dates of onset or report that spanned several years. You might prefer to plot these data by week, month, quarte r, or even year, depending on the point you wish to make. The following steps are recommended for creating a scale for the y-axis. Make the length of the y-axis shorter than the x-axis so that your graph is horizontal or \"landscape.\" A 5:3 ratio is often recommended for the length of the x-axis to y-axis. Always start the y-axis with 0. While this recommendation is not followed in all fields, it is the standard practice in epidemiology. Determine the range of values you need to show on the y-axis by identifying the largest value you need to graph on the y-axis and rounding that figure off to a slightly larger number. For example, the largest y-value in Figure 4.3 is 49 years in 1997, so the scale on the y-axis goes up to 50. If median age continues to increase and exceeds 50 in future years, a future graph will have to extend the scale on the y-axis to 60 years. Space the tick marks and their labels to describe the data in sufficient detail for your purposes. In Figure 4.3, five intervals of 10 years each were considered adequate to give the reader a good sense of the data points and pattern.

For exam ple, in the United States, vaccination policies have greatly reduced the incidence of mumps; however, outbreaks can still occur in unvaccinated populations. To portray these competing forces, an arithmetic graph is insufficient without an inset amplifying the problem years (Figure 4.4). Figure 4.4 Mumps by Year\u2014United States, 1978-2003 Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Summary of notifiable diseases-United States, 2003. Published April 22, 2005, for MMWR 2003;52(No. 54):54. An alternative approach to this problem of incompatible scales is to use a logarithmic transformation for the y-axis. Termed a \"semi-log\" graph, this technique is useful for displaying a variable with a wide range of values (as illustrated in Figure 4.5). The x- axis uses the usual arithm etic-scale, but the y-axis is measured on a logarithmic rather than an arithmetic scale. As a result, the distance from 1 to 10 on the y- axis is the same as the distance from 10 to 100 or 100 to 1,000. *Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-28 Another use for the semi-log graph is when you are interested in portraying the relative rate of chan ge of several series, rather than the absolute value. Figure 4.5 show s this application. Note several aspects of this graph: Cycle = order of magnitude That is, from 1 to 10 is one cycle; from 10 to 100 is another cycle. ! The y-axis includes four cycles of the order of magnitude , each a m ultiple of ten (e. g., 0.1 to 1, 1 to 10, etc. ) \u2014 each a constant multiple. ! Within a cycle, the ten tick-marks are spaced so that spaces become smaller as the value increases. Notice that the absolute distance from 1.0 to 2.0 is wider than the distance from 2.0 to 3.0, which is, in turn, wider th an the distance from 8.0 to 9.0. This results from the fact that we are graphing the logarithm ic transform ation of num bers, which, in fact, shrinks them as they become larger. We can still compare series, however, since the shrinking process preserves the relative change between series.

Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-29 Consider the data shown in Table 4.16. Two hypothetical countries begin with a population of 1,000,000 . The population of Country A grows by 100,000 perso ns each year. The population of Country B grows by 10% each year. Figure 4.6 displays data from Country A on the left, and Country B on the right. Arithm etic-scale line graphs are above sem ilog-scale line graphs of the same data. Look at the left side of the figure. Because the population of Country A grows by a constant num ber of perso ns each year, the data on the arithmetic-scale line graph fall on a straight line. However, because the percentage growth in Country A declines each year, the curve on the semilog-scale line graph flattens. On the right side of the figure the population of Country B curves upward on the arithmetic-scale line graph but is a straight line on the semilog graph. In summary, a straight line on an arithm etic-scale line graph represents a constant change in the num ber or amount. A straight line on a semilog-scale line graph represents a constant percent change from a constant rate.

For example, if you want a semilog plot for annual measles surveillance data in a variable called MEASLES, under the VARIABLES section of the Analysis commands: ! Select Define . ! Type logmeas les into the Variable Name box. ! Since your new variable is not used by other programs, the Scope should be Standard . ! Click on OK to define the new variabl e. Note that logmeasles now appears in the pull-down list of Variabl es. ! Under the Variables section of the Analysis commands, select Assign. Types of variables and class intervals are discussed in Lesson 2. Figure 4 .6 Comparison of Arithmetic-sc ale Line Graph and Semilogarithmic-scale Line Graph for Hypothetical Country A (Constant Increase in Number of People) and Cou ntry B (Const ant Increase in Rate of Growth) Consequently, a semilog-scale line graph has the following features: ! The slope of the line indicates the rate of increase or decrease. ! A straight line indicates a constant rate (not amount) of increase or decrease in the values. ! A horizontal line indicates no change. ! Two or more lines following parallel paths show identical rates of change. Semilog graph paper is availabl e commercially, and most include at least three cycles. Histogram s A histogram is a graph of the frequency distribution of a continuous variable, based on class intervals. It uses adjoining columns to represent the number of observations for each class interval in the distribution. The area of each column is proportional to the num ber of observations in that interval. Figures 4.7a and 4.7b show two versions of a histogr am of frequency distributions with equal class intervals. Since all class intervals are equal in this histogram, the height of each column is in proportion to the number of observations it depicts. Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-31 Figures 4.7a, 4.7b, and 4.7c are exampl es of a particular type of histogram that is commonly used in field epidem iology \u2014 the epidemic curve. An epidemic curve is a histogram that displays the number of cases of disease dur ing an outbreak or epidem ic by times of ons et. The y-axis repres ents the number of cases; the x- axis represents date and/or tim e of onset of illness. Figure 4.7a is a perfectly acceptable epidemic curve, but some epidemiologists prefer drawing the histogram as stacks of squares, with each square representing one case (Figure 4.7b). Additional infor mation may be added to the histogram. The rendition of the epidem ic curve shown in Figure 4.7c shades th e individual boxes in each time period to denote which cases have been confirm ed with culture results. Other information such as gender or presence of a related risk factor could be portrayed in this fashion. Conventionally, the numbers on th e x-axis are centered betw een the tick marks of the appropriate interval. The interval of time should be appropriate for the dis ease in question, the duration of the outbreak, and the purpose of the graph. If the purpose is to show the temporal relationship be tween tim e of exposure and onset of disease, then a widely accepted rule of thum b is to use in tervals approximately one-fourth (or between one-eighth and one-third) of the incubation period of the disease shown. The incubation period for salm onellosis is usually 12-36 hours, so the x-axis of this epidem ic curve has 12-hour intervals.

The choice of variable for the x-axis of an epidemic curve is clearly dependent on the point of the display. Figures 4.7a, 4.7b, or 4.7c are constructed to show the natural course of the epidem ic over tim e; Figure 4.8 conveys the burden of the problem of overweight and obesity.

The component of most interest should always be put at the bottom because the upper component usually has a jagged baseline that may make comparison difficu lt. Consider the data on pneum oconi osis in Figure 4.9a. The graph clearly displays a gradual decline in deaths from all pneum oconiosis between 1972 and 1999. It appears that deaths from asbestosis (top subgroup in Figure 4.9a) went against the overa ll trend, by increasing over the same period.

Epidemic curves are discussed in more detail in Lesson 6.Some histograms, particularly those that are drawn as stacks of squares, include a box that indicates how m any cases are represented by each square. While a square usually represents one case in a relatively small outbreak, a square m ay represent five or ten cases in a relatively large outbreak.

It does so by using tw o histograms \u2014 most often one for fe males and one for m ales, each by age group \u2014 turned sideways so the bars are horizontal, and placed base to base (Figures 4.10 and 4.11). Notice the overall pyram idal shape of the population distribution of a developing country with m any births, relatively high infant mortality, and relatively low life expectancy (Figure 4.10). Com pare that with the shape of the population distribution of a more developed country with fewer births, lower infant mortality, and higher life expectancy (Figure 4.11).

While population pyram ids are used most often to display the distribution of a national populati on, they can also be used to display other data such as disease or a health characteristic by age Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-37 and sex. For exam ple, smoking prevalence by age and sex is shown in Figure 4.12. This pyramid clearly shows that, at every age, females are less likely to be current smokers than males.

Cigarette smoking among adults- United States, 2002. MMWR 2004;53:427-31. Freque ncy polygons A frequency polygon, like a histogram, is the graph of a frequency distribution. In a frequency polygon, the number of observations within an interval is marked with a single point placed at the midpoint of the interval. Each point is then connected to the next with a straight line. Figure 4.13 shows an example of a frequency polygon over the outline of a histogram for the same data. This graph makes it easy to identify the peak of the epidem ic (4 weeks). Figure 4.13 C omparison of Frequency P olygon and Histogram Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-38 A frequency polygon contains the same area under the line as does a histogram of the same data. Indeed, the data that were displayed as a histogram in Figure 4.9a are displayed as a frequency polygon in Figure 4.14.

Changing patterns of pneumoconiosis mortality-United States, 1968-2000. MMWR 2004;53:627-31. A frequency polygon differs from an arithm etic-scale line graph in several ways. A frequency polygon (or histogram ) is used to display the entire frequency distri bution (counts) of a continuous variable. An arithmetic-scale line graph is used to plot a series of observed data points (counts or rates), usually over tim e. A frequency polygon m ust be closed at both ends because the area under the curve is representative of the data; an arithm etic-scale line graph simply plots the data points. Com pare the pneum oconi osis m ortality data displayed as a frequency polygon in Figure 4.14 and as a line graph in Figure 4.15.

Compare the interpretations of the two graphs. Check your answers on page 4-77 Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-40 Ogive (pronounced O'-jive) is another name for a cumulative frequency curve. Ogive also means the diagonal rib of a Gothic vault, a pointed arc, or the curved area making up the nose of a projectile. Cumulative frequenc y and survival curves As its name implies, a cumulative frequency curve plots the cumulative frequency rather than the actual frequency distribution of a variable. This type of graph is useful for identifying m edians, quartiles, and other percentiles. The x-axis records the class intervals, while the y-axis shows the cumulative frequency either on an absolute scale (e.g., num ber of cases) or, more comm only, as percentages from 0% to 100%. The median (50% or half-way point) can be found by drawing a horiz ontal line from the 50% tick mark on the y-axis to the cumulative frequency curve, then drawing a vertical line from that spot down to the x-axis. F igure 4.16 is a cumulative frequency grap h showing the num ber of days until smallpox vaccination scab separation among persons who had never received smallpox vaccination previously (primary vaccinees) and among persons who had been previously vaccinated (revaccinees). The median number of days until scab separation was 19 days am ong revaccinees, and 22 days among prim ary vaccinees. Figure 4.16 D ays to Smallpox Vaccination Scab Sep aration Among Primary Vaccinees (n=29) and Colsher P, Haddy L. Symptoms following smallpox vaccination-West Virginia, 2003. Presented at 53rd Annual Epidemi c Intelligence Service Conference, April 19-23, 2004, Atlanta, Georgia. A survival curve can be used with follow-up studies to display the proportion of one or more groups still alive at different tim e periods. Sim ilar to the axes of th e cumulative frequency curve, the x-axis records the time periods, and the y-axis shows percentages, from 0% to 100%, still alive. Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-41 Kaplan-Meier is a well accepted method for estimating survival probabilities.14 The most striking difference is in the plotted curves themselves. While a cumulative frequency starts at zero in the lower left corner of the graph and approaches 100% in the upper right corner, a survival curve begins at 100% in the upper left corner and proceeds toward the lower right corner as members of the group die. The survival cu rve in Fi gure 4.17 shows the difference in survival in the early 1900s, mid-1900s, and late 1900s. The survival curve for 1900-1902 shows a rapid decline in survival during the first few years of life, followed by a relatively steady decline. In contrast, the curve for 1949-1951 is shifted right, showing substantially better su rvival among the young. The curve for 1997 shows im prove d survival among the older population.

Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-42 Other Data Displays Thus far in this lesson, we have covered the m ost comm on ways that epidemiologists and other public health analysts display data in tables and graphs. We now cover some additional graphical techniques that are useful in sp ecific situations. While you may not find yourself constructing these fi gures often, our objective is to equip you to properly interpret these displays when you encounter them. Scatter diagrams A scatter diagram (or \"scattergram\") is a graph that portrays the relationship between two continuous variables, with the x-axis representing one variable and th e y-axis representing the other.15 To create a scatter diagram you must have a pair of values (one for each variable) for each person, group, country, or other entity in the data set, one value for each variable. A point is placed on the graph where the two values intersect. For exam ple, dem ographers may be interested in the relationship between infant mortality and total fertility in various nations. Figure 4.19 plots the total fertility rate (estimated average number of children per woman) by the infant mortality rate in 194 countries, so this scatter diagram has 194 data points. To interpret a scatter diagram, look at the overall pattern made by the plotted points. A fairly com pact pattern of points from the lower left to the upper right indicates a positive correlation, in which one variable increases as the other increases. A compact pattern from the upper left to lowe r right indicates a negative or inverse correlation, in which one variable decreases as the other increases. Widely scattered point s or a relatively flat pattern indicates little correlation. The data in Figure 4.19 seem to show a positive correlation between infant mortality and total fertility, that is, countries with high infant mortality seem to have high total fertility as well. Statistical tools such as linear regression can be applied to such data to quantify the correlation between variables in a scatter diagram. Similarly, scatter diagram s often display correlations that may provoke intriguing hypotheses about causal relationships, but additio nal investigation is almost always needed before any causal hypotheses should be accepted. Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-43 Figure 4 .19 Correlation of I nfant Mo rtality Rate and Total Fertility Rate Among 194 Nations, 1997 Data Source: Population Reference Bureau [Internet]. Datafinder [cited 2004 Dec 13]. Available from: http://www.prb.org/datafind/datafinder7.htm. Bar charts A bar chart uses bars of equal width to display comparative data. Com parison of categories is based on the fact that the length of the bar is proportional to the frequency of the event in that category. Therefore, breaks in the scale could cause the data to be misinterpreted and should not be used in bar charts. Bars for different categories are separated by spaces (unlike the bars in a histogram). The bar chart can be portrayed with the bars either vertical or horizontal. (This choice is usually m ade based on the length of text labels \u2014 long labels fit better on a horizontal chart than a vertical one) The bars are usually arranged in ascending or descending length, or in some other systematic order dictated by any intrinsic order of the categor ies. Appropriate data for bar charts include discrete data (e.g., race or cause of death) or variables treated as though they were discrete (age groups). (Recall that a histogram shows frequency of a continuous variable, such as dates of onset of sym ptoms). Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-44 More About C onstructing B ar Charts Arrange the categories that define the bars or groups of bars in a natural order, such as alphabetical or increasing age, or in an order that will produce increasing or decreasing bar lengths. Choose whether to display the bars vertically or horizontally. Make all of the bars the same width. Make the length of bars in proportion to the frequency of the event. Do not use a scale break, because the reader could easily misinterpret the relative size of different categ ories. Show no more than five bars within a group of bars, if possible. Leave a space between adjacent groups of bars but not between bars within a group (see Figure 4.22). Within a group, code different variables by differences in bar color, shading, cross hatching, etc. and include a legend that interprets your code. The simplest bar chart is used to display the data from a one-variable table (see page 4-4). Figure 4.20 shows the number of deaths am ong persons ages 25-34 ye ars for the six most common causes, plus all other causes groupe d together, in the United States in 2003. Note that this bar chart is aligned horizontally to allow for long labels.

Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-45 Grouped bar charts A grouped bar chart is used to illust rate data from two-variable or three-variable tables. A grouped ba r chart is particularly useful when you want to com pare the subgroups within a group. Bars within a group are adjoining. The bars should be illustrated distinctively and described in a le gend. For example, consider the data for Figure 4.12 \u2014 current smokers by age and sex. In Figure 4.21, each bar grouping represents an age group. Within the group, separate bars are used to represent data for males and females. This shows graphically that regardless of age, m en are more likely to be current smokers than are women, but that difference declines with age. Figure 4.21 Percentage of Persons Aged > 18 Years Who Were Current Smokers, by Age and Se x\u2014United States, 2002 Data Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cigarette smoking among adults- United States, 2002. MMWR 2004;53:427-31. The bar chart in Figure 4.22a shows the leading causes of death in 1997 and 2003 am ong persons ages 25-34 years. The graph is more effective at showin g the diffe rences in causes of death during the same year than in showing differences in a single cause between years. While the decline in deaths due to HIV infection between 1997 and 2003 is quite appa rent, the smaller drop in heart disease is more difficult to see. If the goal of the figure is to compare specific causes between the two years, the bar chart in Figure 4.22b is a better choice.

Available from: http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/wisqars.Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-47 Stacked bar charts A stacked bar chart is used to show the sam e data as a grouped bar chart but stacks the subgroups of the second variable into a single bar of the first variable. It devi ates from the grouped bar chart in that the different groups are differe ntiated not with separate bars, but with different segm ents with in a single bar for each category. A stacked bar chart is more effective than a grouped bar chart at displaying the overall pattern of the first variable but less effective at displaying the relative si ze of each subgroup. The trends or patterns of the subgroup s can be difficult to decipher becau se, except for the bottom categories, the categories do not rest on a flat baseline. To see the difference between grouped and stacked bar charts, look at Figure 4.23. This figure shows th e same data as Figures 4.22a and 4.22b. W ith the stacked bar chart, you can easily see the change in the total number of deaths between the two years; however, it is difficult to see the v alues of each cause of death. On the other hand, with the grouped bar chart, you can more easily see the changes by cause of death.

Available from: http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/wisqars.Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-48 100% component bar charts A 100% component bar chart is a variant of a stacked bar chart, in which all of the bars are pulled to the sam e height (100%) and show the components as percentage s of the total rather than as actual values. This type of chart is useful for comparing the contribution of different subgroups within the categories of the main variable. Figure 4.24 shows a 100% component bar chart that compares lengths of hospital stay by age group. The figure clearly shows that the percentage of peopl e who stay in the hospital for 1 day or less (bottom component) is greatest for children ages 0-4 years, and declines with increasing age. Concom itantly, lengths of stay of 7 or more days increase with age. However, becau se the columns are the same height, you cannot tell from the columns how many people in each age group were hospitalized for traum atic brain injury \u2014 putting num bers above the bars to indicate the totals in each age group would solve that problem.

Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-49 Deviation bar charts While many bar charts show only positive values, a deviation bar chart displays both positive and negative changes from a baseline. (Imagine profit/loss data at different times.) Figure 4.25 shows such a deviation bar chart of sele cted reportable diseases in the United States. A similar chart appears in each issue of CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Repor t. In this chart, the number of cases reported during the past 4 weeks is compared to the average number reported during co mparable periods of the past few years. The deviations to the right for hepatitis B and pertussis indicate increases over historical levels. The deviations to the left for measles, rubella, and most of the other diseases indicate declines in reported cases compared to past levels. In this particular chart, the x-axis is on a logarithmic scale, so that a 50% reduction (one-half of the cases) and a doubling (50% increase) of cases are represented by bars of the sam e length, though in opposite directions. Values beyond historical limits (com parable to 95% confidence limits) are highlighted for special attention.

[cited 2006 Feb 15]. Available from: http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/wisqars. More About Constructing Pie Charts Conventionally, pie charts begin at 12 o'clock. The wedges should be labeled and arranged from largest to smallest, proceeding clockw ise, although the \"other\" or \"unknown\" may be last. Shading may be used to distinguish between slices but is not always neces sary. Because the eye cannot accur ately gauge the area of the slices, the chart should indicate what percentage each slice represents either inside or near each slice. Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-52 Given current technology, pie char ts are almost always generated by computer rather than drawn by hand. But the default settings of many computer program s differ from recomme nded epidem iologic practice. Many com puter program s allow one or more slices to \"explode\" or be pulled out of the pi e. In general, this technique should be limited to situations when you want to place special emphasis on one wedge, particular ly when additional detail is provided about that wedge (Figure 4.27).

In Figure 4.29 the villages using either antibacterial soap or plain soap have lower incidence rates of diarrhea than do the control (no soap) villages.17 Figure 4.29 Incidence of Childhood Diarrhea in Each Neighborhood by Hygiene Intervention Group\u2014Pakistan, 2002-2003 Source: Luby SP, Agboatwalla M, Painter J, Billhimer WL, Hoekstra RM.

A dot plot shows the relationship between a continuous and a categorical variable. The same data could also be displayed in a box plot, in which the data are summarized by using \"box-and- whiskers.\" F igure 4.30 is an exam ple of a box plot. The \"box\" represents values of the middle 50% (or interquartile range) of the data points, and the \"whiskers\" extend to the m inimum and maximum values that the data assume. The m edian is usually Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-55 marked with a horizontal line inside the box. As a result, you can use a box plot to show and com pare the central location (median), dispersion (interquartile range and range), and skewness (indicated by a median line not centered in the box, such as for the cases in Figure 4.30).18 Figure 4.30 Risk Score for Alveolar Echinococcosis Among Cases and Controls\u2014Germany, 1999-2000 Adapted from: Kern P, Ammon A, Kron M, Sinn G, Sander S, Petersen LR, et al.

Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-56 Forest plots A forest plot, also called a confid ence interval plot, is used to display the point estimates and confidence intervals of individual studies assembled for a meta-ana lysis or systematic review.19 In the forest plot, the variable on the x-axis is the prim ary outcom e measure from each stud y (relative risk, treatm ent effects, etc. ). If risk ratio, odds ratio, or another ratio measure is used, the x-axis uses a logarithmic-scale. This is because the logarithm ic transformation of these risk estimates has a more symmetric distribution than do the risk estimates themselves (since the risk estimates can vary from zero to an arbitrarily large num ber). Each study is represented by a horiz ontal line \u2014 reflecting the confidence interval \u2014 and a dot or square \u2014 reflecting the point estim ate \u2014 usually due to study size or some other aspect of study design (Figure 4.31). The shorter the horizontal line, the more precise the study's estimate. Point estimates (dots or squares) that line up reasonably well indicate that the studies show a relatively consistent ef fect. A vertical line indicates where no effect (relative risk = 1 or treatm ent effe ct = 0) falls on the x-axis. If a study's horizontal line does not cross the vertical line, that study's result is statistically significan t. From a forest plot, one can easily ascertain patterns among studies as well as outliers.

Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-57 Phylogenetic trees A phylogenetic tree, a type of dendrogram, is a branching chart that indicates the evolutionary lineage or genetic relatedness of organisms involved in outbreaks of illness. Distance on the tree reflects genetic differences, so or ganisms that are close to one another on the tree are more related than organism s that are further apart. The phylogenetic tree in Figure 4.32 shows that the organisms isolated from patients with restaurant-associated hepatitis A in Georgia and North Carolina were identical and closely related to those from patients in Tennessee.20 Furthermore, these organisms were similar to those typically seen in patients from Mexico. These microbiologic data supported epidemiologic data which implicated green onions from Mexico.

Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-58 Decision trees A decision tree is a branching chart that represents the logical sequence or pathway of a clinic al or public health decision.21 Decision analysis is a system atic m ethod for m aking decisions when outcom es are uncertain. The basic building blocks of a decision analysis are (1) decisions, (2) outcom es, and (3) probabilities. A decision is a choice made by a pe rson, group, or organization to select a course of action from among a set of m utually exclusive alternatives. The decision maker compares expected outcomes of available alternatives and chooses the best am ong them . This choice is represented by a decision node , a square, with branches representing the choices in the decision-tree diagram (for example, see Figure 4.33). For example, after receiving information that a person has a fa mily history of a disease (colorectal cancer for this example), that person may decide (choose) to seek medical advice or choose not to do so. Outcomes are the chance events that occur in response to a decision. Outcomes can be intermediate or final. Intermediate outcom es are followed by more decisions or chance events. For example, if a person decides to seek medical care for colorectal cancer screening, depending on the findings (outcom es) of the screening, his or her physician m ay advise diet or more frequent screenings; some combination of these two; or treatm ent. From the person's perspective, this is a chance outcome; from a health-care provider's perspective, it is a decision. Whether an outcome is intermediate or final may depend on the context of the decision problem. For example, colorectal cancer screening may be the final outcome in a decision analysis focusing on colorectal cancer as the health condition of interest, but it may be an interm ediate outcom e in a decision analysis focusing on more invasive cancer treatment. In a decision tree, outcom es follow a chance node , a circle, with branches representing different outcomes that occur by chance, one and only one of which occurs. Each chance outcom e has a probability by which it can o ccur written below the branch in a decision-tree diagram . The sum of probabilities for all outcom es that can occur at a chance node is one. The building blocks of d ecision analysis -- decisions, outcom es, and probabilities \u2014 can be used to represent and examine complex decision problems.

EpiMap is an application of Epi Info for creating maps and overlaying survey data, and is available for download. Maps Maps are used to show the geographic location of events or attributes. T wo types of m aps commonly used in field epidemiology are spot maps and area maps. Spot maps use dots or other sym bols to show where each case-patient lived or was exposed. Figure 4.34 is a spot m ap of the residences of persons with West Nile Virus encephalitis during the outbreak in the New York City area in 1999 . A spot m ap is useful for showi ng the geographic distribution of cases, but because it does not take the size of the population at risk into account a spot m ap does not sh ow risk of disease. Even when a spot map shows a large number of dots in the same area, the risk of acquiring disease may not be particularly high if that area is densely populated. More About Constructing Maps !

An area map, also called a chloropleth map, can be used to show rates of disease or other health conditions in different areas by using different shades or colors (Figure 4.35). When choosing shades or colors for each category, ensure that the intensity of shade or color reflects increasing disease burden. In Figure 4.35, as mortality rates increase, the shading becomes darker.

GIS can be particularly effective when layers of informatio n or different types of information about place are combined to identify or clarify geographic relationships.

Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-63 Using Computer Technology Many com puter software packages are available to create tables and graphs. Most of these packages are quite usef ul, particularly in allowing the user to redraw a graph with only a few keystrokes. With these packages, you can now quickly and easily draw a number of graphs of different types and see for yourself which one best illustrates the point you wish to make when you present your data.23-28 Many software packages are available for producing all the tables and charts discussed in this chapter. One particularly helpful one is R,29 used by universities and available for no charge around the world. In addition to graphical techniques, R provides a wide variety of statistical techniques (including linear and nonlinear modeling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, and clustering) .On the other hand, these packages tend to have default values that differ from standard epidemiologic practice. Do not let the software package dictate the appearance of the graph. Re member the adage: let the computer do the work, but you still m ust do the thinking. Keep in m ind the prim ary purpose of the graph \u2014 to communicate information to others. For example, many packages can draw bar charts and pie charts that appear three-dim ensional. Will a three-dimensional chart communicate the information better than a two-dimensional one? Com pare and contrast the eff ectiveness of Figure 4.37a and 4.37b in comm unicating inform ation.

Rockville, MD. \"The problem with presenting information is simple - the world is high- dimensio nal, but our displays are not. To address this basic problem, answer 5 questions: 1. Quantitative thinking comes down to one question: Compared to what? 2. Try very hard to show cause and effect. 3. Don't break up evidence by accidents of means of production. 4. The world is multivariant, so the display should be high- dimensio nal. 5. The present ation stands and falls on the quality, relevan ce, and integrity of the content.\"30 - ER Tufte Most observers and analysts would agree that the three- dimensional graph does not communicate the information as effectively as the two-dim ensional graph. For exam ple, can you tell by a glance at the three-dimensional graph that marijuana use declined slightly in the N ortheast in 2004? These differences are more distinct in the two-dim ensional graph. Similarly, does the three-dimensional pie chart in Figure 4.38a provide any more information than the two-dimensional chart in Figure 4.38b? The relative sizes of the com ponents m ay be difficult to judge because of the tilting in the three-dimensional version. From Figure 4.38a, can you tell whether the wedge for heart disease is larger, sm aller, or about the sam e as the wedge for malignant neoplasm s? Now look at Figure 4.38b. The wedge for malignant neoplasms is larger. Remember that communicating the names and relative sizes of the components (wedges) is the primary purpose of a pie chart. Keep the num ber of di mensions as sm all as possible to clearly convey the important points, and avoid using gimm icks that do not add information.Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-65 More About Using Color in Graphs Many people misuse technology in selecting color, particul arly for slides that accompany oral presentations.32 If you use colors, follow these recommendations. Select colors so that all comp onents of the graph \u2014 title, axes, data plots, and legends \u2014 stand out clearly from the background and each plotted series of data can be distinguished from the others. Avoid contrasting red and green, because up to 10% of males in the audience may have some degree of color blindness. Use colors or shades to communicate information, partic ularly with area maps. For example, for an area map in which states are divided into four groups according to their rates for a particular disease, use a light color or shade for the states with the lowest rates and use progre ssively darker colors or shades for the groups with progressively higher rates. In this way, the colors or shades contribute directly to the impression you want the viewer to have about the data.

For instance, suppose you have several variables (x, y, z, etc.) that you have collected on each of n people, and for purposes of this illustration, suppose each variable can have one of 10 possible values. We can let x be eyebrow slant, y be eye size, z be nose length, etc. The f igures below show faces produced using 10 characteristics - head eccentricity, eye size, eye spacing, eye eccentricity, pupil size, eyebrow slant, nose size, m outh shape, mouth size, and mouth opening) - each assigned one of 10 possible values.

From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ChernoffFace.html. To convey the messages of epidemiologic findings, you must first select the best illustration method. Tables are commonly used to display numbers, rates, proportions, and cum ulative percents. Because tables are intended to comm unicate information, most tables should have no more than two variables and no m ore than eight categories (class intervals) for any variable. Printed tables should be properly titled, labeled, and referenced; that is, they should be able to stand alone if separated f rom the text. Tables can be used with either nominal or contin uous ordinal data. Nom inal variables such as sex and state of residence have obvious categories. For continuous variables that do not have obvious categories, class intervals must be created. For some diseases, standard class intervals for age have been adopted. Otherwise a variety of m ethods are available for establishing reasonable class intervals. These include class intervals with an equal number of people or observations in each; class intervals with a constant width; and class intervals based on the mean and standard deviation. Graphs can visually communicate data rapidly. Arithmetic-scale line graphs have traditionally been used to show trends in disease rates ove r time. Semilogarithmic-scale line graphs are Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-67 preferred when the disease rates vary over two or m ore orders of magnitude. Histogram s and frequency polygons are used to display frequency distributions. A special type of histogram known as an epidemic curve shows the number of cases by time of onset of illn ess or tim e of diagnosis during an epidem ic peri od. The cases may be represented by squares that are stacked to form the columns of the histogram; the squares may be shaded to distinguish important characteristics of cases, such as fatal outcom e. Simple bar charts and pie charts are used to display the frequency di stribution of a single variable. Grouped and stacked bar charts can display two or even three variables. Spot maps pinpoint the location of each case or event. An area map uses shading or coloring to show different levels of disease num bers or rates in different areas. The final pages of this lesson provide guidan ce in the selection of illustration methods and construction of tables and graphs. When usi ng each of these methods, it is important to remember their purpose: to summarize and to communicate. Even the best method must be constructed properly or the message will be lost. Glitzy and colorful are not necessarily better; sometimes less is more!

Divide the list into three equal-sized groups of places: 50 states \u00f7 3 = 16.67 states per group . Because st ates can't be cut in thirds, two groups will contain 17 states and one group will contain 16 states. Illinois (#17) could go into either the first or second group, but its rate (80.0) is closer to #16 Maine's rate (80.2) than Texas' rate (79.3), so it makes sense to put Illinois in the first group. Similarly, #34 Verm ont could go into either the second or third group. Arbitrarily putting Illinois into the first category and Vermont into the second results in the following groups: a. Kentucky through Illinois (States 1-17) b. Texas through Verm ont (States 18-34) c. South Dakota through Utah (States 35-50) Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-74 2. Identify the rate for the first and last state in each group: a. Kentucky through Illinois 80.0-116.1 b. Texas through Verm ont 70.2-79.3 c. South Dakota through Utah 39.7-68.1 3. Adjust the limits of each interval so no gap exists between the end of one class interval and beginning of the next. Deciding how to adjust the limits is somewhat arbitrary \u2014 you could split the difference, or use a convenient round number. a. Kentucky through Illinois 80.0-116.1 b. Texas through Verm ont 70.0-79.9 c. South Dakota through Utah 39.7-69.9 Strategy 2: Base intervals on mean and standard deviation 1. Create three categories based on the mean (77.1) and standard deviation (16.1) by finding the upper lim its of three intervals: a. Upper lim it of interval 3 = m aximum value = 116.1 b. Upper lim it of interval 2 = m ean + 1 standard deviation = 77.1 + 16.1= 93.2 c. Upper lim it of interval 1 = m ean - 1 standard deviation = 77.1 - 16.1= 61.0 d. Lower limit of interval 1 = minimum value = 39.7 2. Select the lower limit for each upper limit to define three full intervals. Specify the states that fall into each interval. (Note: To place the states with the highest rates first, reverse the order of the intervals): a. North Carolina through Kentucky (8 states) 93.3-116.1 b. Arizona through Georgia (35 states) 61.1-93.2 c. Utah through Minnesota (7 states) 39.7-61.0 Strategy 3: Divide the range into equal class intervals 1. Divide the range from zero (or the minimum va lue) to the m aximum by 3: (116.1 - 39.7) / 3 = 76.4 / 3 = 25.467 2. Use m ultiples of 25.467 to create th ree categories, starting with 39.7: 39.7 through (39.7 + 1 x 25.467) = 39.7 through 65.2 65.3 through (39.7 + 2 x 25.467) = 65.3 through 90.6 90.7 through (39.7 + 3 x 25.467) = 90.7 through 116.1 3. Final categories: a. Indiana through Kentucky (11 states) 90.7-116.1 b. Nebraska through Oklahom a (29 states) 65.3-90.6 c. Utah through North Dakota (10 states) 39.7-65.2 Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-75 4. Alternatively, since 90 .6 is close to 90 and 65.2 is close to 65.0, the categories could be reconfigured with no change in state assignments. For example, the final categories could look like: a.

The stacked bar chart clearly displays the differences in total number of cases, as reflected by the overall height of each column. The number of cases in the lowest category (age <20 years) is also easy to compare across race-sex groups, because it rests on the x-axis. Other categories might be a little harder to compare because they do not have a consistent baseline. If the size of each category in a given colum n is different enough and the colum n is tall enough, the catego ries within a column can be compared. Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-79 The grouped bar chart clearly d isplays the size of each category within a given group. You can also discern different patterns across the groups. Comparing categories across groups takes work. The 100% com ponent bar chart is best for com paring the percent distribution of categories across groups. You must keep in mind that the distribu tion represents percentages, so while the 30-39 year category in white females appears larger than the 30-39 year category in the other race-sex groups, the actual numbers are much smaller.

B, C, D. Tables and graphs are important tools for summarizing, analyzing, and presenting data. While data are occasional ly collected using a table (for example , counting observatio ns by putting tick marks into particul ar cells in table), this is not a common epidemiologic practice. 2. A, B, C, D. A table in a printed publication should be self-e xplanatory. If a table is taken out of its original context, it should still convey all the information necessary for the reader to understand the data. Therefore, a table should include, in addition to the data, a prope r title, row and column labels, source of the data, and footnote s that explain abbreviations, symbols, and exclusions, if any. Tables generally present the data, while the accom panying text of the report may contain an explanation of key findings. 3. B (False) . Rounding that results in totals of 99.9% or 100.1% is comm on in tables that show percentages. Nonethele ss, the total percentage should be displaye d as 100.0%, and a footnote explaining that the difference is due to rounding shoul d be included. 4. C. In the two-by-two table presented in Question 4, the total number of cases is shown as the total of the left column (labeled \"Cases\" ). That column total number is 25. 5. D. A table shell is the skeleton of a table, complete with titles and labels, but without the data. It is created when designing the analy sis phase of an investigation . Table shells help guide what data to collect and how to analyze the data. 6. B. Creation of table shells should be part of the overall study plan or protocol. Creation of table shells requires the investigator to decide how to analyze the data, which dictates what questi ons should be asked on the question naire. 7. A, B, C, D, E. All of the methods listed are in Question 6 are appro priate and commonly used by epidemiologists 8. B (False) . The number of observati ons with missing values is important when interp reting the data, particularly for making generalizati ons. 9. B (False). The limits of the class intervals must not overlap . For exampl e, would a 70- year-old be counted in the 65-70 category or in the 70-75 category? 10. A (True). In general, before you create a graph, you shoul d observe the data in a table. By reviewing the data in the table, you can anticipate the range of values that must be covered by the axes of a graph . You can also get a sense of the patterns in the data, so you can anticipate what the graph should look 1ike. 11. B, C. On an arithmetic-s cale line graph, the axes and tick marks should be clearly labeled. For both the x- and y-axis, a particul ar distance anywhe re along the axis should represent the same increase in quantity, although the x- and y-axis usually differ in what is measured . The y-axis, measuring frequency, shoul d begin at zero. But the x-axis, which often measu res time, need not start at zero. Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-86 12a. B. One of the key advan tages of a semilogar ithmic-scale line graph is that it can display a wide range of values clearly. 12b. A. A startin g value of, say, 100,000 and a constant rate of change of, say, 10%, would result in observations of 100,000 , 110,000, 121,000, 133,100, 146, 410, 161,051 , etc. The resulting plotted line on an arithmetic-s cale line graph would curve upwards. The resulting plotted line on a semilogarithmic-sc ale line graph would be a straight line. 12c. B. Values of 0.1, 1,10, and 100 represent orders of magnitude typical of the y-axis of a semilogarithmic-scale line graph. 12d. C. Both arithmetic-scal e and semilogarithm ic-scal e line graphs can be used to plot numbers or rates. 13a. B. A bar chart is used to graph the frequency of events of a categorical variable such as sex, or geographic region. 13b. C. The columns of either a histogram or a bar chart can be shaded to distinguish subgroup s. Note that a bar chart with shaded subgroups is called a stacked bar chart. 13c. A. A histogram is used to graph the frequenc y of events of a continu ous variable such as time. 13d. A. An epidemic curve is a particul ar type of histogram in which the number of cases (on the y-axis ) that occur during an outbreak or epidemic are graphed over time (on the x- axis). 14. C. A typical population pyram id usually displays the youngest age group at the bottom and the oldest age group at the top, with males on one side and female s on the other side. A young population would therefore have a wide bar at the bottom with gradually narro wing bars above. 15. A, B. A frequency polygon differs from a line graph in that a frequency polygon represents a frequency distribution, with the area under the curve proportionate to the frequency. Because the total area must represent 100%, the ends of the frequency polygon must be closed. Although a line graph is commonl y used to display frequen cies over time, a frequency polygon can display the frequency distribution of a given period of time as well. Similarly, the y-axis of both types of graph can measu re percentag es. 16a. C. The y-axis of both cumulative frequency curves and survival curves typically display percentages from 0% at the bottom to 100% at the top. The main difference is that a cumulative frequency curve begins at 0% and increases, whereas a survival curve begins at 100% and decreases. 16b. B. Because a survival curve begins at 100%, the plotted curve begins at the top of the y- axis and at the beginni ng time interval (someti mes referre d to as time-zero) of the x- axis, i.e., in the upper left corner. 16c. A. Because a cumulative frequency curve begins at 0%., the plotted curve begins at the base of the y-axis and at the beginn ing time interval (sometimes referr ed to as time- zero) of the x-axis, i.e., in the lower left corner . Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-87 16d. C. Because the y-axis represents proportions, a horizontal line drawn from the 50% tick mark to the plotted curve will indicate 50% survival or 50% cumulative frequency. The median is another name for the 50% mark of a distributio n of data. 17. A, C. A scatter diagra m graphs simultaneous data points of two contin uous variables for individu als or comm unities. Drug levels, infant mortality, and mean annual income are all example s of continu ous variable s. Eye color, at least as presented in the question, is a categorical variable . 18. D. A frequency distribu tion, one-variable table, pie chart, and simple bar chart are all used to display the frequency of categories of a single variable. A scatter diagram requires two variables. 19. B. A scatter diagram graphs simultaneous data points of two continu ous variables for individu als or comm unities; whereas a dot plot graphs data points of a continuous variable according to categories of a second , categorical variable . 20. B (False) . The spots on a spot map usually reflect one or more cases , i.e., numbe rs. The shading on an area map may represe nt numbers, proportions , rates, or other measur es. 21. B (False). Shading should be consistent with frequency. So rather than using different colors of the same intensity, increa sing shades of the same color or family of colors should be used. 22. B (False) . The primary purpose of any visual is to commun icate inform ation clearl y. 3-D columns, bars, and pies may have pizzazz, but they rarely help communicate information , and somet imes they mislead. 23. A (False). The difference between a stacked bar chart and a 100% component bar chart is that the bars of a 100% componen t bar chart are all pulled to the top of the y-axis (100%). The units on the x-axis are the same. 24. D. Any bar chart can be oriented vertically or horizontall y. The creator of the chart can choose, and often does so on the basis of consistency with other graphs in a series, opinion about which orientation looks better or fits better, and whether the labels fit adequately below vertic al bars or need to placed beside horizontal bars. 25a. B, C. Both line graphs and histog rams are commonly used to graph numbers of cases over time. Line graphs are commonl y used to graph secular trends over longer time periods ; histograms are often used to graph cases over a short period of observatio n, such as during an epidemic. 25b. A. A groupe d bar chart (or a stacke d bar chart) is ideal for graphing frequency over two categorical variables . A pie chart is used for a single variable. 25c. D. A pie chart (or a simple bar chart) is used for graph ing the frequenc y of categor ies of a single categorical variab le such as breed of dog. 25d. C. Rates over time are traditional ly plotted by using a line graph. Displaying Public Health Data Page 4-88 References 1. Koschat MA. A case for sim ple tables.

These persons were monitored so that, if the; e@hibited e/idence of disease, the; could be Huarantined to pre/ent spreading the disease to others. In 1J52, the D.-. Communicable Disease Center described its effort to redirect large-scale control progr ams for multiple infecti ous diseases, which had achie/ed their purpose, Mtoward the establishmen t of a continuing sur/eillance program. The obNecti/e of this redirected progr am is to mainta in constant /igilance to detect the presence of serious infectious diseases an;where in the countr;, and when necessar;, to mobiliOe all a/ailable forces to control them.MP In 1J6E at the 21st World (ealth Assembl;, sur/eillance was define d as Mthe s;stematic collection and use of epidemiolog ic information for the planning, implementation, and assessme nt of disease control.M5 In the 1JE0s and 1JJ0s, Thacker3 and others6-E e@panded the term to not Nust disease, but an; outcome, haOard, or e@posure. In fact, the term surveillance is often applied to almost an; effort to monitor, obser/e, or determine health status, diseases, or risk factors within a population . Care should be taken, howe/e r, in appl;ing the term surveillance to /irtuall; an; program for or method of gatherin g information about a populationUs health, because this might lead to disagreement and confusion among public health polic;makers and practitioners.

For each condit ion, list at least one existing source of data that you need for conducting surveillance on the conditi on. What factors make the selected source or data system more appropriate than another? Listeriosis: A serious infection can result from eating food contaminate d with the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. The disease affects primarily pregnant women, newborns, and adults with weakened immune systems. A person with listerios is has fever, muscle aches, and sometimes gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea or diarrhea). If infection sprea ds to the nervous system, such symptoms as headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, or convulsion s can occur. Infected pregnant wome n might experience only a mild influenza-li ke illness; however, infections during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage or stillbirth, premature delivery, or infection of the newborn. In the United States, approximately 800 cases of listeriosis are reported each year. Of those with serious illness, 15% die; newb orns and immunoco mpromise d persons are at greatest risk for serious illness and death. Spinal cord injury: Approximately 11,000 persons sustain a spinal cord injury (SCI) each year in the Unite d States, and 200,00 0 persons in the United States live with a disabilit y related to an SCI. More than half of the person s who sustain SCIs are aged 15-29 years. The leading cause of SCI varies by age. Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of SCIs among persons aged <65 years. Among persons aged !65 years, falls cause the major ity of spinal cord injurie s. Sports and recreation activities cause an estimate d 18% of spinal cord injuries. Lung cancer among nonsmokers: A usual ly fatal cancer of the lung can occur in a person who has never smoked. An estimated 10%-15% of lung cancer cases occur among nonsmokers, and this type of cancer appears to be more comm on among women and persons of East Asian ancestry.

All notifiable disease surveillance data are entered and stored in comput er files at the state and transmitt ed to CDC once each week. CDC publishes these data for all states in the MMWR each week, but healt h depart ment staff do not routin ely review these data in the MMWR. The state has never generated its own set of tables for analysis and disseminat ion, and you believe that it would be valuable to do so to educat e and increase interest among health department staff. A. What three tables might you want to generate by compute r each week for use by health department staff? B. You next decide that it would be a good idea to share these data with health-care providers , as well.

Public (ealth -ur/eillance Page 5-66 Answers to Self-Assessment Quiz 1. A, B, C, D. The term public health surveillance includes data collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination to help guide health officials and programs in directing and conduct ing disease control and prevention activities. However, surveillance does not include control or prevention activit ies them selves. 2. A, B, C, D, E. Current public health surveillance targets health-related condition s among humans , including chronic disease s (e.g., cancer ), comm unicable disea ses (e.g., those on the notifiab le disease list), health- related behaviors, and occup ational ly related conditions (e.g., black lung disease and other pneumoconioses). Surveillance also focuses on indicator s of disease potential (e.g., such diseases among animals as rabies ) or presence of an infectiou s agent among animals or insects (e.g., West Nile virus among mosquitoe s). 3. A. Public health surveill ance can be thought of as one of the methods that a comm unity has available to monitor the health among its population by detecting problems, communicating alerts as needed, guiding the appropriate response, and evaluating the effect of the respon se. Surveillance should not be confused with medical surveill ance, which is monitoring of exposed persons to detec t early evidence of disease. Public health surveillance is the continued watchfulness for public health problems; it is not a data- collection system . 4. B (False). The practice of surveillance is not limited to public health agencies. Hospitals, nursing homes, the military, and other instit utions have long conducted surveil lance of their popul ations. 5. A, B, C, D. Among the uses of surveillance are detecting individual cases of diseases of public healt h importanc e (e.g., malaria), supporting planning (e.g., priority setting ), monitor ing trends and patterns of health-relate d conditio ns (e.g., eleva ted blood lead levels), and supporting evaluation of prevention and contro l measures (e.g., a vaccin ation requirement ). 6. A, C, D. Data collected through vital registration, disease notifications, and population surveys are commonly used for surveillance of health-rel ated problems. Data from random ized clinical trials typicall y cover only a specially selected popul ation and are used to answer specific questions about the effectiveness of a particular treatment. They are not useful for surve illance. 7. B (False) . One of the important uses of surveill ance data and one of the key reaso ns to close the surveillance loop by disseminating surveillance data back to health-care providers , is to provide clinically relevant information about disease occurrence, trends, and pattern s. For exam ple, health department s alert clinicians to the presence of new diseases (e.g., severe acute respira tory syndrome [SARS] ) and provide inform ation so that clinicians can make diagnoses. Health departme nts also advise clinicia ns about changing patterns of antibiotic resistance so that clinicians can choose the right treatment regimen. 8. B. Vital statistics refer to data on birth, death, marri age, and divorce. Therefore , vital Public (ealth -ur/eillance Page 5-67 statistics are the prima ry source of data on mortality, but not on morbidity (illness ), behavior s, injury (other than fatal injuries ), and health-car e usage. Before develop ment of popul ation health surveys and disease registr ies and the use of health -care records to assess morb idity, vital statistics were the primary source of data on the health of populati ons. During recent years , administra tive, financial, and other health-care-related record s have supplemented the inform ation from vital statistics, especially for assessing morbid ity within populations. National, state, and local population-base d health surveys, some of which are conducted on a regul ar or continuing basis, provide another important part of our view of the health of populations . 9. A (True). Vital statistics are usually thought of as an archive of births , deaths, marriages, and divorces. Vital statistics offices in health departments typically are not linked to disease prevention and control activities. However, surveill ance for certain health problems might rely on vital statistics as its primary source of data. When these data undergo timely and systematic analysis, interpretation, and dissemination with the intent of influencing public health decision-making and action, they become surveillance data. 10. B, C, D. Sources of morbidity (illness) data include notifia ble disease reports, laboratory data, hospital discharge data, outpatient health-care data, and surve illance for specific conditions (e.g., cancer ). Vital records are an important source of mortality data, and even though a patient first gets sick from a disease before dying from it, vital records are not regarde d as a source of data for the surveil lance of morbidity from the disease . Environme ntal monito ring is used to evaluate disease potential or risk. 11. B (False) . Notifiable disease surveil lance targets occurrence or death from any of the diseases on the list. 12. B. The list of nationall y notifiable diseases is compiled by the Council of State and Territo rial Epidemiol ogists (CSTE) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevent ion. The list of notifi able diseases that physicians must report to their state or local health department is set by the state, either by the state legislature, the state board of health, the state health department, the state health officer, or the state epidemiolog ist. CSTE votes on the diseases that should be nationally notifiable, but the states have the ultimate authority whether to add any newly voted diseases to their state list. 13. A or B, depending on the state. The agency that a physician shoul d notify is determ ined by the state, just as the list of notifia ble disea ses is set by the state (see answer to question 12). The manner in which notificatio n shoul d occur and how rapidl y reports should be made are also defined by the state and can vary by disea se. For examp le, the state might require that a case of cholera be reported immediately by telephone or fax to the local or state health department, whereas reporting of varicella (chickenpox) might only be required monthly, by using a paper form. Regardless of the disease and reporting requirement s, reporting should proceed through established channels. In certain states, physicians shoul d notify the county health department, which will then notify the state health department, which will notify CDC, which will notify the World Health Organization. In states with no or limited local health departments, physician s are usually required to notify the state health department. The seriousness of the disease might influence how rapidly these communications take place but should not influence the sequence. Public (ealth -ur/eillance Page 5-6E 14a. A. Notifiab le disease surveillance is state-based, with subsequent reporting to CDC. Surveillance for consum er product-related injuries is hospital emergenc y departme nt- based with subsequent reporting to the Consum er Product Safety Comm ission. 14b. A. Notifiable disease surveillance attempts to identify every case of a notifiable disease. Surveillance for consum er product-related injuries relies on a sample of hospital emergency department s to characterize the incidence and types of these injuries. 14c. C. Because surveillance for notifiab le disease s and surve illance for consumer product- related injuries are both ongoing, both can monitor trends over time. 14d. B. Surveillance for consumer product-related injuries is based on a statistical ly valid sample of hospital emergency departments in the United States. Notifiab le disease surveillance covers the entire popul ation. 14e. D. Neither approach to surveillance is perfect. Underrepo rting is a serious problem in the majority of states for notifiable disease surveil lance. Surveil lance for consum er product-rel ated injurie s is based on visits to a sample of emergency departments; therefore, persons who do not seek care at an emergency department are not represented. 15. A, B, D. Evaluation of surveillance for a health-related problem should include review of the purpose and objectives of surveillance, the resources needed to conduct surveillance for the problem, and whether the characteristics of well-conducted surveillance are present. Because surveillance does not have direct responsib ility for the control of the health problem, this is not part of evaluating a survei llance system. Whether effective measures for preventing or controlling a health-relat ed problem are available can be a useful criterion in prioritizin g disease s for surve illance. 16. A, B, D. The incidence of, public concern about, and social and economic impact of a health problem are all important in assess ing its suitab ility for surveill ance. Althou gh previous studies of the problem might have helped to characterize its natural history, cause, and impact, the number of such studies is not used as a criterion for prioritization. 17a. C (Both). Surveillance based on specific case definition for a disease attempts to identify individu al cases of disease of public health importance, and syndromic surveillan ce, depending on its purpose, might also attem pt to identify cases of disease of public health importance. In certain situations, the goal of syndromic surveill ance might be to identify clusters or outbreaks (more cases than expected) of disease rather than individu al cases. 17b. C (Both). Both syndromic surveil lance and surveillance based on a specific case definition for a disease can be used to watch for diseases caused by acts of biologic or chemical terrori sm. Which appro ach is used depends on the disease and the setting. 17c. B. Syndromic surveil lance that targets sales of over-the-co unter medic ations, calls to hotlines, and school or work absenteeism all watch for disease before a patient seeks care from a health-care provider . Surveillance based on a specific case definition for a disease is usually based on reporting by a health -care provid er. Public (ealth -ur/eillance Page 5-6J 17d. D. Neither type of surveillance can function properly without attention and effort on the part of the health department. Health department staff shoul d revie w the case report forms and conduct follow-up of cases reported through surveillance based on specific case definitions for diseases. Health departmen t staff shoul d review the cases identified by syndro mic surveillan ce and determine whether they reflect true outbreaks or not. Additionally, health department staff should compile and communicate the results. These tasks are a minimum. 18. A, B, D, E. Analysis by time often includes comp arison with previous weeks and previous years. Analysis by place can include analys is of both number s and rates. Routine analysis by person includes age and sex, but a three-variable table of age by race and sex is probabl y too much stratification for routine analysis . 19. A, B, C, D, E. An increas e in case reports during a single week might represent a true increase in disease (i.e., an outbrea k). However, the increase can also represent an increase in the popul ation (e.g., from an influx of tourists , migrant workers, refuge es, or students) ; reporting of cases in a batch, particularly after a holiday season; duplicate reports of the same case; laboratory or comput er error; a new clinic or health-care provider that is more likely to make a particul ar diagno sis or is more conscientious about reporting; or other sudden changes in the metho d of conduc ting surveill ance. 20. B. The primary purpose of prepar ing and distributing surveil lance summ aries is to provide timely information about disease occurrence to those in the community who need to know. The report also serve s to motivat e those who report by demonstratin g that their efforts are valued and to inform health-care providers and others in the community about health department activities and general public health concerns. 21a. B. Sensitivit y is the ability of surveil lance (or laborator y tests or case definitions) to detect a true case (or, for certain systems, a true outbrea k). Specificit y is the ability of surveillance (or laboratory tests or case definiti ons) to rule out disea se among persons who do not have it. 21b. A. Predictive value positive is the proportion of patients (or outbreaks) detected by surveillance who truly have the disease (or are true outbreaks). Predictive value positive is a functio n of both the sensitivity of surveillance and the prevalence of the disease (or prevalence of real outbreaks ). 22. B (False) . Underrepo rting is a serious problem for surveill ance that relies on notification s. Because the notifiabl e disease surveillance is suppose d to identify individu al cases of disease of public health importance, underrepo rting of even a single case of, for example, hepatitis A in a food handler, can result in an outbreak that should have been prevented. Similarl y, if a limited number of cases are reported at all, even outbreaks can be missed. 23. B, D. Initiating surveill ance for a health-related problem can be justifie d for multip le reasons. These reasons include if a disease is new and surveillance is the most effective means for collecting informatio n on cases to learn more about its clinica l and epidemiol ogic features (e.g., SARS); if a new prevention or control measure is about to be impleme nted and surveillance is the most effective means for assess ing its impact Public (ealth -ur/eillance Page 5-70 (e.g., varice lla vaccinati on regul ations); or if surveillance is needed to guide, monitor, and evaluate prevention or control measures. Surveillance is more difficult to justify if a disease does not occur locally, even if it is a communicable disease with a high case fatality rate (e.g., Ebola or Marburg virus infecti on), or simply because CDC requests it (without funding). 24. B (False). A case definition for surve illance should be clear, understand able, acceptable, and implementable by those who are required to apply it. However, it need not use the same criteri a that are used for clinical purposes. For example, health-care providers might treat patients on the basis of clinical features without laboratory confirmation, whereas a surveillance case definition might require confirmation, or vice versa. 25. C. The most important way to improve notifiab le disease surveil lance is to ensure that everyone who is supposed to report knows ! that they are suppose d to report, ! what to report (i.e., which disea ses are on the list), and ! how, to whom, and how quickly to report. In additi on, they will be more likely to report if they know that the health departm ent is actually doing somethin g with the reports. No data are available that demonstrate that reporting through the Internet improves reporting; in fact, for certain health-care providers , reporting might involve extra work. Requiring more disease-specific forms tends to reduce reportin g, because it requires more time and effort for those reporting. Reducing the number of disease s on the list might be part of a strategy to improve reporting, but it is not the most important way to do so. Public (ealth -ur/eillance Page 9ealth .+allpox.

Someone from a nursing hom e calls to report several cases of pneumonia among its residents. Is the number of cases in either of these situations actually higher than usual? What should be used to estim ate \"usual?\" If it is higher than usual, s hould the health departm ent staff call the situation a cluster, an outbreak, an epidemic? Is a field investigation needed? What criteria should they use to decide? And if they decide that a field investigation is indeed warranted, how do they go about conducting such an investigat ion?

Review routinely collected surveillance data ! Astutely observe single events or clusters by clinicians, infection control practitioners, or laboratorians ! Review reports by one or more patients or members of the public Introduction to Investigating an Outbreak Uncovering outbreaks Outbreaks of disease \u2014 the occurrence of more cases than expected \u2014 occur frequently. Each day, health departm ents learn about cases or outbreaks that require investigation. While CDC recorded over 500 outbreaks of food borne illness alone each year during the 1990s,1 recognized outbreaks of respiratory and other diseases are also comm on, and many more outbreaks may go undetected. So how are outbreaks uncovered? One way is to analyze surveillance data \u2014 reports of cases of communicable diseases that are routinely sent by laboratories and healthcare providers to health departm ents (see Lesson 5). Som e health departm ents regularly review exposure inform ation from individual case reports to look for common factors. For example, health departm ent staff in Oregon uncovered an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in 1997 by noticing that three patients with the infection all had reported drinking raw milk.2 Alternatively, outbreaks may be detected when health departm ent staff conduc t regular, timely analysis of surveillance data that reveals an increase in reported cases or an unusual clustering of cases by tim e and place. For exam ple, by analyzing data from four different syndromic surveillance systems, health departm ent staff in New York City noted a consistent increase in gastroenteritis in the days following a prolonged blackout in August 2003.3 Investigation indicated that the increase in gastroenteritis was probably attr ibutable to the consum ption of meat that had spoiled during the power failure. Review of surveillance data to detect outbreaks is not lim ited to health departm ents. Many hospital infection control practitioners review m icrobiologic isolates from patients by organism and ward each week to detect an increase in the number of, say, surgical wound infections or nosocom ial (hospital-acquired) cases of legionellosis. In the sam e way, staff at CDC regularly review laboratory patterns of organism s and are able to detect clusters of illness caused by the same organism, even if the victims are geographically scattered.4 Nonetheless, most outbreaks come to the attention of health authorities because an alert clinician is concerned enough to call the health department. The emergence of West Nile virus infection in North America in 1999 was unc overed only after the New York Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-3 City health departm ent responde d to a call from a physician who had recently seen two patients with encephalitis.5 Similarly, a single case of inhalational anthrax of suspicious origin in Florida in 2001 resulted in a massive investigation involving multiple government agencies, but it all started with an astute diagnosis and prom pt report to the health departm ent by a physician.6 Epidemic: the occurrence of more cases of disease than expected in a given area or among a specific group of people over a particular period of time. Usually, the cases are presumed to have a common cause or to be related to one another in some way Outbreak: epidemic limited to localized increase in the incidence of disease Cluster: aggreg ation of cases in a given area over a particular period without regard to whether the number of cases is more than expected Another reporting source for appare nt clusters of both infectious and noninfectious disease is patie nts or other members of the community. For exam ple, an individual m ay call the health department and report that she and some friends came down with severe gastroenteritis after at tending a banquet a night or two earlier. S imilarly, a local citizen may call about several cases of cancer diagnosed among his neighbo rs and express concern that these are more than coincidental. Most health departm ents have routine procedures for handling calls from the public regarding potential co mmunicable disease ou tbreaks, and some states have guidelines for how to respond to noninfectious disease cluster reports.7-9 Deciding whether to investigate a possible outbreak Different health departm ents respond to these reports in different ways. The decisions regarding whether and how extensively to investigate a potential ou tbreak depend on a variety of factors. These usually include som e factor s related to the health problem , some related to the health departm ent, and some related to external concerns. Factors related to the problem itself include the severity of the illness, the number of cases, the source, mode or ease of transmission, and the availability of prevention and control measures. Most local health departments are more likely to investigate an apparent outbreak when the num ber of affected (or exposed) persons is large, when the disease is severe (serious illness with high risk of hospitalization, complications, or death), when effective control measures exist, and when the outbreak has the potential to affect others unl ess prompt control measures are taken. For example, a single case of gastroenteritis is unlikely to prom pt a field investigation, but a cluster of cases may. On the other hand, even a single case of botulism is likely to be investigated immediately to identify and eliminate the source, because it is both potentially fatal and preventable, and the source can usually be identified. At the state or national level, the unusual presentation of disease may spur an investigation. Occurrence of a new or rare disease or a change in the pattern of disease in an area is more likely to prom pt an investigation than occurrence of a common disease with w ell-establi shed transm ission patterns and control measures.Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-4 However, field investig ations place a burden on a health department, so the decision also hinges on the availability of staff and resources, and com peting priorities. In addition, som e health departm ents have a practice of aggressively investigating outbreaks and hence have experi ence in doing so, while other health departments may lack such experience. Regardless, field investigations are usually justified for one or more of the following reasons: ! Control or prevention of the health problem ! Opportunity to learn (research opportunity) ! Public, political, or legal concerns ! Public health program considerations ! Training Each of these reasons is discussed in more detail below. Control and prevention The m ost important public health reasons for investigating an outbreak are to help guide disease prevention and control strategies. T hese disease contro l efforts depend on several factors, including knowledge of the agen t, the natural course of the outbreak, the usual transmission mechanism of the disease, and available control measures. For example, if a health department learns of an outbreak of hepatitis A (known agent) in which one of the victim s is a restaurant cook, the departm ent can offer immune globulin to the restaurant patrons to prevent a second wave of cases (control m easure), but only if they are within 14 days of exposure (tim ing). On t he other han d, if an outbreak appears to be almost over, the health agency may not need to implement control measures, but may be interested in identifying factors that contributed to the outbreak in order to develop strategies to prevent similar outbreaks in the future. For that outbreak of hepatitis A, investigators may find that the poor personal hygiene that led to the outbreak was the result of lack of soap or water in the workplace washroom , which could be addressed in public h ealth messages to other worksites. The balance between control measures and further investigation depends on how m uch is known about the cause, the source, and the mode of transm ission of the agent.10 Table 6.1 illustrates how public health emphasis on investigation versus control is influenced by these factors. In particular, if the source and/or mode of transm ission are known, then c ontrol measures that target the source or interrupt transm ission can be implemented. If the source and/or mode of transmission are not known, then you can't know what control measures to implement, so investigation takes priority.

The epidemiologic field investigation: science and judgment in public health practice. Am J Epidemiol 1990;132:9-16. Opportunity to learn (research opportunity) Another im portant objective of m any outbreak investigations is to advance research. For m ost public health problem s, health officials cannot conduct randomized trials. We cannot randomize who eats the undercooked hamburger or sits near the ice resurfacing machine that emits carbon monoxide, nor should we randomize who receives preventive health benefits (e.g., mammogra m screening). However, we can take advantage of what has already happened and learn from it. Som e view an outbreak as an experiment of nature waiting to be analyzed and exploited. For a newly recognized disease, field investigation provides an opportunity to characterize the natural history \u2014 including agent, mode of transm ission, and incuba tion period \u2014 and the clinical spectrum of disease. Investigators also attem pt to characterize the populations at greatest risk and to identify specific risk factors. Acquiring such inform ation was an important motivation for investigators studying such newly recognized diseases as Legionnaires' disease in Philadelphia in 1976, AIDS in the early 1980s, hantavirus in 1993, severe acute respiratory syndrom e (SARS) in 2003, and avian flu in 2005. Even for diseases that are well characterized, an outbreak may provide opportunities to gain additional knowledge by assessing the im pact of control m easures and the usefulness of new epidem iology and laboratory techniques. For example, outbreaks of varicella (chickenpox) in highly immunized communities allowed investigators to determine effectiveness of the new vaccine and immunization recommendations.11,12 An outbreak of giardiasis provided the opportunity to study the appropriateness of a clinical case definition,13 while an outbreak of rotavirus was used to study the performance of a novel diagnostic method.14 With increased access to the Internet and e-mail in the 1990s, outbreak Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-6 investigations were used to ev aluate whether potential controls would respond to e-mail solicitations to participate.15-17 Public, political, or legal concerns Public, political, or legal concerns can be the driving force behind the decision to conduct an investigation. A cluster of cancer cases in a neighborhood m ay prom pt concerned residents to advocate for an investigation. Sometimes the public is concerned that the disease cluster is the result of an environm ental exposure such as toxic waste. Investigations of such clusters almost never identify a causal link between exposure and disease.18,19 Nevertheless, many health departm ents have learned that they must be \"responsibly responsive\" to public concerns, even if they think that an epidemiologic link is unlikely.7,8,20 Similarly, the public m ay fear that an outbreak is the result of an intentional criminal or bioterrorist act. The health depart ment may be able to allay those fears by documenting that the outbreak was the result of an inadvertent or naturally occurring exposure. Some investigations are conducted because they are required by law. For example, CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is required to evaluate the risks to health and safety in a workplac e if requested to do so by a union, three or more workers, or an employer.21 Program considerations Many health departm ents run pr ogram s to control and prevent communicable diseases such as influenza, tuberculosis, vaccine- preventable diseases, and sexually transmitted diseases. An outbreak of a disease targeted by a public health program may reveal a weakness in that program and an opportunity to change or strengthen program effor ts. Inve stigating the outbreak's causes may identify populations that have been overlooked, failures in intervention strategies, or changes in the agent. Using the outbreak to evaluate program effectiveness can help program directors improve fut ure directions and strategies. Training Investigating an outbreak require s a combination of diplomacy, logical thinking, problem-solving ability, quantitative skills, epidemiologic know-how, and judgment. These skills improve with practice and experience. Thus , many investigative teams pair a seasoned epidemiologist with an epidem iologist-in-training. The latter gains valuable on-the-j ob training and experience while providing assistance in the investigation and control of the outbreak. Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-7 Exercise 6.1 During the previou s year, nine residents of a communit y died from cervic al cancer. List at least 4 reasons that might justify an investig ation. Check your answers on page 6-59 Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-8 Steps of an Outbreak Investigation Once the decision to conduct a field investigation of an acute outbreak has been m ade, working quickly is essential \u2014 as is getting the right answer. In other words, epidemiologists cannot afford to conduct an investigation that is \"quick and dirty.\" They must conduct investigations that are \"quick and clean.\"22 Under such circumstances, epidemiologists find it useful to have a systematic approach to follow, such as the sequence listed in Table 6.2. This approach ensures that the investigation proceeds without missing important steps along the way. Table 6.2 Epidemiologic Steps of an Outbreak Investigation 1. Prepare for field work 2. Establish the existence of an outbreak 3. Verify the diagnosis 4. Construct a working case definition 5. Find cases systematically and record information 6. Perform descr iptive epidemio logy 7. Develop hypotheses 8. Evaluate hypotheses epidemiologically 9. As necessary, reconsider, refine, and re-eval uate hypotheses 10. Compare and reconcile with laboratory and/or environmental studies 11. Implement control and prevention measures 12. Initiate or maintain surveillance 13. Communicate findings The steps listed in Table 6.2 are presented in conceptual order; in practice, however, several steps m ay be done at the same time, or the circumstances of the outbreak may dictate that a different order be followed. For example, the order of the first three listed steps is highly variable \u2014 a health departm ent often verifies the diagnosis and establishes the existence of an outbreak before deciding that a field investigation is warranted. Conceptually, control measures come after hypotheses have been confirm ed, but in practice control measures are usually implem ented as soon as the source and mode of transm ission are known, which may be early or late in any particular outbreak investigation. Each of the steps is described below in m ore detail, based on the assum ption that you are the health departm ent staff member scheduled to conduct the next field investigation. Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-9 Step 1: Prepare for field work The numbering scheme for this step is problematic, because preparing for field work often is not the first step. Only occasionally do public health officials decide to conduct a field investigation before confirm ing an increase in cases and verifying the diagnosis. More com monly, o fficials discover an increase in the num ber of cases of a particular disease and then decide that a field investigation is warranted. Sometimes investigators collect enough information to perform descriptive epidemiology without leaving their desks, and decide that a field investigation is necessary only if they cannot reach a convincing conclusion without one. Regardless of when the decision to conduct a field investigation is made, you s hould be well prepared before leaving for the field. The preparations can be grouped into two broad categories: (a) scientific and investigative issues, and (b) managem ent and operational issues. Good preparati on in both categories is needed to facilitate a smooth field experience. Scientific and investigative issues As a field investigator, you must have the appropriate scientific knowledge, supplies, and equipm ent to carry out the investigation before departing for the f ield. Discuss the situation with som eone knowledgeable about the disease and about field investigations, and review the applicable literatu re. In previous similar outbreaks, what have been the sources, m odes of transm ission, and risk factors for the disease? Assemble useful references such as journal articles and sample questionnaires. Before leaving for a field investig ation, consult laboratory staff to ensure that you take the proper laboratory material and know the proper collection, storage, and transportation techniques. By talking with the labora tory staff you are also inform ing them about the outbreak, and they can anticipate what type of laboratory resources will be needed. You also need to know what supplies or equipm ent to bring to protect yourself. Some outbreak investigations require no special equipment while an investigation of SARS or Ebola hemorrhagic fever m ay require personal protective equipm ent such as m asks, gowns, and gloves. Finally, before departing, you shoul d have a plan of action. What are the objectives of this investigation, i.e., what are you trying to Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-10 accomplish? What will you do first, second, and third? Having a plan of action upon which everyone agrees will allow you to \"hit the ground running\" and avoi d delays resulting from misunderstandings. Management and operational issues A good field investigator must be a good manager and collaborator as well as a good epidemiologist, because most investigations are conducted by a team rather than just one individual. The team members must be selected before departure and know their expected roles and responsibilities in the field. Does the team need a laboratorian, veterinarian, tran slator/interpreter, computer specialist, entomologist, or other specialist? What is the role of each? Who is in charge? If you have been invited to participate but do not work for the local health agency, are you expected to lead the investig ation, prov ide consulta tion to the local staff who will conduct the investigation, or simply lend a hand to the local staff? And who are your local contacts? Depending on the type of outbr eak, the number of involved agencies may be quite large. The investigation of an outbreak from an animal source may include state and federal departm ents of agriculture and/or the Food and Drug Adm inistration (FDA). If criminal or bioterrorist intent is suspected, law enforcement agencies an d the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) may be in charge, or at least involved. In a natural disaster (hurricane or flood), the F ederal Em ergency Managem ent Age ncy (FEMA) m ay be the lead. Staff from differe nt agencies have different perspectives, approaches, and prio rities that m ust be reconciled. For example, whereas the public health investigation m ay foc us on identifying a pathogen, source, and mode of transm ission, a criminal investigation is likely to focus on finding the perpetrator. Sorting out roles and responsibilities in such multi-agency investigatio ns is critical to accomplishing the disparate objectives of the different agencies. A comm unications plan must be established. The need for communicating with the public health and clinical comm unity has long been acknowledged, but the need for communicating quickly and effectiv ely with elected officials and the public became obvious during the epidem ics of West Nile Virus encephalitis, SARS, and anthrax. The plan shoul d include how often and when to have conference calls with involved agencies, who will be the designated s pokesperson , who will pr epare health alerts and press releases, and the like. When a fe deral agency is involved in the survey of 10 or m ore individuals, the data collection instrum ent Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-11 must first be cleared by the White House Office of Managem ent and Budget (OMB). In addition, operational and logistical details are important. Arrange to bring a laptop computer, cell phone or phone card, camera, and other supplies. If you are arriving from outside the area, you should arrange in advance when and where you are to meet with local officials and contacts when you arrive in the field. You must arrange travel, lodgi ng, and local transportation. Many agencies and organizations have strict approval processes and budgetary lim its that you m ust follow. If you are traveling to another country, you will need a passport and often a visa. Y ou should also take care of personal matters before you leave, especially if the investigation is likely to be lengthy. Step 2: Establish the existence of an outbreak An outbreak or an epidemic is the occurrence of more cases of disease than expected in a given area or am ong a specific group of people over a particular period of time. Usually, the cases are presum ed to have a common cause or to be related to one another in some way. Many epidemiologists use the terms outbreak and epidemic interchangeably, but the public is more likely to think that epidemic implies a crisis situation. Some epidemiologists apply the term epidemic to situations involving larger numbers of people over a wide geographic area. Indeed, the Dictionary of Epidemiology defines outbreak as an epidemic limited to localized increase in the incidence of diseas e, e.g., village, town, or closed institution.23 In contrast to outbreak and epidem ic, a cluster is an aggregation of cases in a given area over a particular period without regard to whether the number of cases is more than expected. This aggregation of cases seem s to be unusual, but frequently the public (and sometimes the health agency) does not know the denominator. For exam ple, the diagnosis in one neighborhood of four adults with cancer m ay be disturbing to residents but m ay well be within the expected level of cancer occurrence, depending on the size of the population, the types of cancer, and the prevalence of risk factors among the residents. One of the first tasks of the field investigator is to verify that a cluster of cases is indeed an outbrea k. Some clusters turn out to be true outbreaks with a common cause, some are sporadic and unrelated cases of the sam e diseas e, and others are unrelated cases of similar but unrelated diseases. Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-12 Even if the cases turn out to be the same disease, the number of cases may not exceed what the health department normally sees in a comparable time period. Here, as in other areas of epidemiology, the observed is compared with the expected. The expected number is usually the num ber fr om the previous few wee ks or m onths, or from a comparable period during the previous few years. For a notifiable disease, the expected number is based on health department surveillance records. For other diseases and conditions, the expected num ber may be based on locally available data such as hospital discharge records, m ortality statistics, or cancer or birth defect registries. When local data are not available, a health department may use rates from state or national data, or, alternatively, conduct a telephone survey of physicians to determine whether they are seeing more cases of the disease than usual. Finally, a survey of the community m ay be conducted to establish the background or historical level of disease. Even if the current number of reported cases exceeds the expected number, the excess may not necessarily indicate an outbreak. Reporting m ay rise because of changes in local reporting procedures, changes in the case definition, increased interest because of local or national awareness, or improvements in diagnostic procedures. A new physic ian, infection control nurse, or healthcare facility may more consistently report cases, when in fact there has been no change in the actual occurrence of the disease. Some apparent increases are actual ly the result of misdiagnosis or laboratory error. Finally, particul arly in areas with sudden changes in population size such as resort areas, college towns, and migrant farming areas, changes in the num erator (num ber of reported cases) may simply reflect changes in the denom inator (size of the population). Whether an apparent problem should be investigated further is not strictly tied to verifying the existence of an epidem ic (more cases than expected). Sometimes, health agencies respond to small numbers of cases, or even a single case of disease, that m ay not exceed the expected or usual number of cases. As noted earlier, the severity of the illness, the poten tial for spread, availability of control m easures, political c onsiderations, public relations, available resources, and other factor s all influence the decision to launch a field investigation. Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-13 Exercise 6.2 For the month of August , 12 new cases of tuberculosis and 12 new cases of West Nile virus infection were reported to a county health department. You are not sure if either group of cases is a cluster or an outbreak. What addit ional informat ion might be helpful in making this determination? Check your answers on page 6-60 Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-14 Step 3: Verify the diagnosis The next step, verifying the diagnosi s, is closely linked to verifying the existence of an outbreak. In fact, often these two steps are addressed at the same time. Verifying the diagnosis is important: (a) to ensure that the disease has been properly identified, since control measures are often disease-specific; and (b) to rule out laboratory error as the basis for the increas e in reported cases . First, review the clinical findi ngs and laboratory results. If you have questions about the laborator y findings (for exam ple, if the laboratory tests are inconsistent with the clinical and epidemiologic findings), ask a qualified laborator ian to review the laboratory techniques being used. If you need specialized laboratory work such as confirm ation in a refe rence laboratory, DNA or other chem ical or biological fingerp rinting, or polym erase chain reaction, you must secure a sufficient number of appropriate specimens, isolates, and other laboratory material as soon as possible. Second, m any investigators \u2014 clin icians and non-clinicians \u2014 find it useful to visit one or more patients with the disease. If you do not have the clinical background to verify the diagnosis, bring a qualified clinician with you. Talking directly with some patients gives you a better understanding of the clinical features, and helps you to develop a mental image of the disease and the patients affected by it. In add ition, conversations with patients are very useful in generating hypotheses about disease etiology and spread. They may be able to answer some critical questions: What were their exposures before becom ing ill? What do they think caused their illness? Do they know anyone else with the disease? Do they have anything in common with ot hers who have the disease? Third, summ arize the clinical features using frequency distributions. Are the clinical features consistent with the diagnosis? Frequency distributions of the clinical features are useful in characterizing the spectrum of illness, verifying the diagnosis, and developing case definitions. These clinical frequency distributions are consider ed so im portant in establishing the credibility of the diagnosis that they are frequently presented in the first table of an investigation's report or m anuscript. Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-15 A case definition is a standard set of criteria for deciding whether an individual should be classified as having the health condition of interest. Step 4: Construct a working case definition A case definition is a standard set of criteria for deciding whether an individual should be classified as having the health condition of interest. A case definition incl udes clinical criteria and \u2014 particularly in the setting of an outbreak investigation \u2014 restrictions by time, place, and person. The clin ical criteria should be based on simple and objective measures such as \"fever ! 40\u00b0C (101\u00b0F),\" \"three or more loose bowel movements per day,\" or \"myalgias (muscle pain) severe enough to limit the patient's usual activities.\" The case definition may be restricted by time (for exam ple, to persons with onset of illness within the past 2 months), by place (for example, to residents of the nine-co unty area or to employees of a particular plant) and by person (for exam ple, to persons with no previous history of a positive tuberculin skin test, or to prem enopausal wom en). Whatev er the criteria, they must be applied consistently to all persons under investigation. The case definition must not include the exposure or risk factor you are interested in evaluating. This is a comm on m istake. For example, if one of the hypotheses under consideration is that persons who worked in the west wing were at greater risk of disease, do not define a case as \"illness among persons who worked in the west wing with onset between....\" Instead, define a case as \"illness among persons who worked in the facility with onset between....\" Then conduct th e appropriate analysis to determine whether those who worked in the west wing were at greater risk than those w ho worked elsewhere. Diagnoses may be unce rtain, particul arly early in an investigation. As a result, investigators often create different categories of a case definition, such as confirm ed, probable, and possible or suspect, that allow for uncertainty. To be classified as confirmed, a case usually m ust have laboratory ve rification. A case classified as probable usually has typical clinical features of the disease without laboratory confirm ation. A case clas sified as possible usually has fewer of the typical clinical f eatures. For example, in the box on page 6-16, you can see the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) recommended case definition for meningococcal disease.24 Here you can see the different categories that PAHO uses for this diagnosis. Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-16 In the outbreak setting, the inve stigators would need to specify time and place to complete the outbreak case definition. For example, if investigating an epidemic of meningococcal meningitis in Bam ako, the case definition might be the clinical features as described in the box with onset between January and April of this year am ong residents and visitors of Ba mako. Classifications such as confir med-probable-possible are helpful because they provide flexibility to the investigators. A case might be temporarily classified as proba ble or possible while laboratory results are pending. Alternativel y, a case may be permanently classified as probable or possible if the patient's physician decided not to order the confirmatory laboratory test because the test is expensive, difficult to obtain, or unnecessary. For example, while investigating an outbreak of diarrh ea on a cruise ship, investigators usually try to identify the causative organism from stool samples from a few a fflicted persons. If th e tests confirm that all of those case-p atients were infected with the same organism, for example norovirus, the other persons with compatible clinical illness are all presumed to be part of the same outbreak and to be infected with the same organism. Note that while this approach is typical in the United States, some countries prefer to acquire laboratory samples from every affected person, and only those with a positive laboratory test are counted as true cases. A case definition is a tool for classifying som eone as having or not having the disease of interest, bu t few case definitions are 100% accurate in their classifications. Some persons with mild illness may be missed, and some persons with a similar but not identical illness may be included. Generally, epidemiologists strive to ensure that a case definition include s most if not all of the actual cases, but very few or no false -positive cases. However, this ideal Meningococcal Disease \u2014 PAHO Case Definition Clinical case definition An illness with sudden onset of fever (>38.5\u00b0C rectal or >38.0\u00b0C axillary) and one or more of the following: neck stiffness, altered consciousness, other meningeal sign or petechial or puerperal rash. Laboratory cr iteria for diagnosis Positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) antigen detection or positive culture. Case classif ication Suspected: A case that meets the clinical case definition. Probable: A suspected case as defined above and turbid CSF (with or without positive Gram stain) or ongoin g epidemic and epidemiological link to a confirmed case. Confirmed : A suspected or probable case with laboratory confirmation. Source: Pan American Health Organization. Case Definitions Meningococcal Disease. Epidemiological Bulletin 2002; 22(4):14-5. Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-17 is not always m et. For exam ple, case definitions often m iss infected people who have mild or no symptoms, because they have little reason to be tested. More About Case Definitions Early in an investigation, investigator s may use a \"loose\" or sensitive case definitio n that includes confirmed, probable, and possible cases to characterize the extent of the problem, identify the populations affected, and develop hypotheses about possible causes. The strategy of being more inclusive early on is especially useful in investigations that require travel to different hospitals, homes, or other sites to gather information, because collecting extra data while you are there is more efficient than having to return a second time. This illustrates an important axiom of field epidemiology: Get it while you can. Later on, when hypotheses have come into sharper focus, the investigator may tighten the case definition by dropping the \"possible\" and sometimes the \"probable\" category. In analytic epidemiology, inclusion of false-positive cases can produce misleading results. Therefore, to test these hypotheses by using analytic epidemiology (see Step 8), specific or tight case definitions are recommended. Other investigations, particula rly those of a newly recogniz ed disease or syndrome, begin with a relatively specific or narrow case definitio n. For example, acquired immuno deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) both began with relatively specific case definitions. This ensures that persons whose illness meets the case definit ion truly have the disease in question. As a result, investigators could accurately characte rize the typical clinical features of the illness, risk factors for illness, and cause of the illness. After the cause was known and diagnostic tests were developed, investigators could use the laboratory test to learn about the true spectrum of illness, and could broaden the case definition to include those with early infection or mild symptoms. Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-18 Exercise 6.3 In 1989, a worldwid e epidemic of a previou sly unrecogniz ed syndrome occur red. This condition was characterized by sever e myalgias (muscle pains) and an elevat ed number of a particular type of white blood cell called an eosinophil. The illness was given the name eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Public health officials initially used the following case definition:25 Eosinophil count !2,000 cells/mm3 in the absence of any other known cause of eosinophilia (in particular, parasitic or fungal infection, end-stage renal disease, leukemi a, allergic disorder, or drug reaction) Using the information in the line listing below, determin e wheth er or not each should be classi fied as a case, according to the initial case definit ion above.

Check your answers on page 6-60 Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-19 Exercise 6.4 In December 2003, an outbreak of gastroenteri tis occurred among tenth- grade students who had participated in a city-wide field trip. Half of the students traveled from December 2 to December 7 (Tour A); the other half traveled from December 3 to December 8 (Tour B). The itineraries were similar. Although teachers and other adult chaperones accompanied the students on both tours, no adult reported illnes s. In additi on, no illness was reported among students who did not go on the field trip, and no cases of E. coli O157 were reported in the community that week. A line listing of 26 persons with symptoms of abdominal pain and/or diarrhea is presented below. Using the information in the line listing, develop a case definition that you might use for the outbreak investigation.

However, the cases that prom pt the concern are often only a sm all and unrepresentative fraction of th e total number of cases. Public health workers m ust therefore look f or additional cases to determine the true geographic extent of the problem and the populations affected by it. Usually, the first effort to identify cases is directed at healthcare practitioners and facilities \u2014 phys icians' clinics, hospitals, and laboratories \u2014 where a diagnosis is likely to be made. Investigators m ay conduct what is sometimes called stimulated or enhanced passive surveillance by sending a letter describing the situation and asking for reports of similar cases. Alternatively, they may conduct active surveillance by telephoning or visiting the facilities to collect information on any additional cases. In som e outbreaks, public health o fficials may decide to alert the public directly, usually through the local media. In other situations, the m edia may have already spread the word. For exam ple, in an outbreak of listeriosis in 2002 caused by contam inated sliceable turkey deli meat, announcements in the media alerted the public to avoid the implicated product and instructed them to see a physician if they developed symptoms compatible with the disease in question.27 If an outbreak affects a restricted population such as persons on a cruise ship, in a school, or at a work site, and if many cases are mild or asymptomatic and therefore undetected, a survey of the entire population is sometimes conducted to determine the extent of infection. A questionnaire could be distributed to determ ine the true occurrence of clinical sym ptoms, or laboratory specim ens could be collected to determ ine th e number of asymptomatic cases. Finally, investigators should ask case-patients if they know anyone else with the sam e condition. Frequently, one person with an illness knows or hears of others with the same illness. In some investigations, investigators develop a data collection form tailored to the specific details of that outbreak. In others, investigators use a generic case report for m. Regardless of which form is used, the data collection form should include the following types of information about each case. Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-21 ! Identifying information. A name, address, and telephone number is essential if investigators need to contact patients for additional questions and to notify them of laboratory results and the outcom e of the investigation. Nam es also help in checking for duplicate records, while the addresses allow for mapping the geographic extent of the problem . ! Demographic information . Age, sex, race, occup ation, etc. provide the person characteristics of descriptive epidemiology needed to characterize the populations at risk. ! Clinical information. Signs and symptom s allow investigators to verify that the case definition has been met. Date of onset is needed to chart the tim e course of the outbreak. Supplementary clinical information, such as duration of illness and whether hospitalization or death occurred, helps characterize the spectrum of illness. ! Risk factor information. This inform ation must be tailored to the specific disease in question. For exam ple, since food and water are common ve hicles for hepatitis A but not hepatitis B, exposure to food and water sources must be ascertained in an outbr eak of the form er but not the latter. ! Reporter information. The case report must include the reporter or source of the repor t, usually a physician, clinic, hospital, or laboratory. Investigators will sometimes need to contact the reporter, either to seek additional clinical information or report back the results of the investigation. Traditionally, the inform ation de scribed above is collected on a standard case report form, questionn aire, or data abstraction for m. Examples of case report forms are shown in Figure 6.1 (in Exercise 6.5). Investigators then abstract selected critical items onto a form called a line listing (See Lesson 2 for more information on line listings.) An exa mple of the line listing from the 2001 anthrax investigation is shown in Table 6.5.28 In a line listing, each colum n represents an important variable, such as name or identification number, age, sex, case classification, etc., while each row represents a different case.

Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-24 Check your answers on page 6-62 Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-25 Step 6: Perform descriptive epidemiology Conceptually, the next step after identifying and gathering basic information on the persons with the disease is to systematically describe some of the key characteristics of those persons. This process, in which the outbreak is characterized by time, place, and person, is called descriptive epidemiology. It may be repeated several times during the course of an investigation as additional cases are identified or as new information becomes available. This step is critical for several reasons. ! Summ arizing data by key dem ographic variables provides a comprehensive characterization of the outbreak \u2014 trends over time, geographic distribution (place ), and the populations (persons) affected by the disease. ! From this characterization you can identify or infer the population at risk for the disease. ! The characterization often pr ovides clues about etiology, source, and modes of transm ission that can be turned into testable hypotheses (see Step 7). ! Descriptive epidemiology describes the where and whom of the disease, allowing you to begin intervention and prevention measures. ! Early (and continuing) analysis of descriptive data helps you to become familiar with those data, enabling you to identify and correct errors and m issing values. Time Traditionally, a special type of hist ogram is used to depict the time course of an epidem ic. This graph, called an epidemic curve, or epi curve for short, provides a sim ple visual display of the outbreak's magnitude and time trend. The classic epidemic curve, such as the one shown in Figure 6.2a from an outbreak of Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis, graphs the num ber of cases by date or tim e of onset of illness.

The epi curve shows the magnitude of the epidemic over time as a simple, easily understood visual. It permits the investigator to distinguish epidemic from endemic disease. Potentially correlated events can be noted on the graph. ! The shape of the epidemic curve m ay provide clues about the pattern of spread in the population, e.g., point versus intermittent source versus propagated. ! The curve shows where you ar e in the course of the epidemic \u2014 still on the upswing, on the down slope, or after the epidemic has ended. This information forms the basis for predicting whether more or fewer cases will occur in the near future. ! The curve can be used for evaluation, answering questions like: How long did it take for the health departm ent to identify a problem? Are intervention measures working? ! Outliers \u2014 cases that don't fit into the body of the curve \u2014 may provide important clues. ! If the disease and its inc ubation period are known, the epi curve can be used to deduce a probable tim e of exposure and help develop a questionnaire focused on that tim e period. Drawing an epidemic curve. To draw an epidemic curve, you first must know the time of onset of illness for each case. For som e diseases, date of onset is sufficien t. For other diseases, particularly Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-27 those with a relatively short incubation peri od, hour of onset may be more suitable (see Lesson 4). Occasionally, you m ay be asked to draw an epidem ic curve when you don't know either the disease or its incubation time. In that situation, it may be useful to draw several epidem ic curves with different units on the x-axis to find one that best portrays the data. For example, the epidemic curves shown in Figures 6.2b and 6.2c display the same data as in Figure 6.2a; the x-axis is measured in units of 12 hours in Figure 6.2a , 6 hours in Figure 6.2b, and 24 hours (1 day) in 6.2c. Figure 6.2d shows the same data one m ore time, but with stacks of squares that each represent one case.

Presented at 53rd Annual Epidemic Intelligence Service Conference, April 19-23, 2004, Atlanta. Interpreting an epidemic curve . The first step in interpreting an epidemic curve is to consider its overall shape. T he shape of the epidemic curve is determined by the epidemic pattern (for exam ple, common source versus propagated), the period of tim e over which susceptible persons are exposed, and the minimum, average, and maximum incubation periods for the disease. An epidemic curve that has a steep upslope and a more gradual down slope (a so-called log-normal curve) is characteristic of a point-source epidemic in which persons are exposed to the sam e source over a relative brief period. In fact, any sudden rise in the number of cases suggests sudde n exposure to a comm on source one incubation period earlier (Figure 6.3). In a point-source epidemic, all the cases occur within one incubation period. If the durati on of exposure is prolonged, the epidemic is called a continuous common-source epidemic, and the epidemic curve has a plateau instead of a peak. An interm ittent common-source epidemic (in wh ich exposure to the causative agent is sporadic over tim e) usua lly produces an irregularly jagged epidemic curve reflecting the intermittence and duration of exposure and the number of persons exposed. In theory, a propagated epidemic \u2014 one spread from person-to-person with increasing numbers of cases in each generation \u2014 should have a series of progressively taller peak s one incubation period apart, but in reality few produce this classic pattern. Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-29 Figure 6.3 Typical Epi Curv es for Differe nt Types of S pread Adapted from: European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology Training [Internet]. Solna, Sweden: Smittskyddsinstitutet [updated http://www.epiet.org/course/Presentations/2004/04-Outbreak investigation/03- Outbreak Figure 6.4 Number of Cases of Acute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis, By Month and Week of Report\u2014Puerto Rico, August 7-October 30, 2003 Adapted from: Acute hemorr hagic conjunctivitis by Coxsackievirus A24- Rico, MMWR 2004;53:632-4. As noted above, the epidem ic cu rve shows where you are in the natural course of the epidem ic. Consider the epidemic curve of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis in Puerto Rico, shown in Figure 6.4. If you only had data through W eek 35, that is, through point A, you might conclude that the outbreak is still on the upswing, with m ore cases to com e. On the other hand, if you had data through point B, you might judge that the outbreak has peaked and may soon be over. Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-30 The cases that stand apart may be just as informative as the overall pattern. An early case may repres ent a background or unrelated case, a source of the epidem ic, or a person who was exposed earlier than most of the cases (for exam ple, the cook who tasted a dish hours before bringing it to the big picnic). S imilarly, late cases may represent unrelated cases, cases with long incubation periods, secondary cases, or persons exposed later than most others (for exam ple, someone eating leftovers). On the other hand, these outlying cases sometimes represent miscoded or erroneous data. All outliers are worth examining carefully becau se if they are part of the outbreak, they m ay have an easily identifiable exposure that may point directly to the source. In a point-source epidemic of a known disease with a known incubation period, the epidemic curve can be used to identify a likely period of exposure. Knowing the likely period of exposure allows you to ask questions about the appropriate period of tim e so you can identify the source of the epidem ic. To identify the likely period of exposure from an epidemic curve of an apparent point source epidem ic: 1. Look up the average and minimum incubation periods of the disease. This informati on can be found on disease fact sheets available on the Internet or in the Control of Communicable Diseases Manual.29 2. Identify the peak of the outbreak or the median case and count back on the x-axis one average incubation period. Note the date. 3. Start at the earliest case of the epidem ic and count back the minimum incubation period, and note this date as well. Ideally, the two dates will be similar, and represent the probable period of exposure. Since this technique is not precise, widen the probable period of exposure by, say, 20% to 50% on either side of these dates, and then ask about exposures during this widened period in an attempt to identify the source. In a similar fashion, if the time of exposure and the times of onset of illness are known but the cause has not yet been identified, the incubation period can be estimated from the epidemic curve. Subtract the time of onset of the earliest cases from the time of exposure to estim ate the minimum incubation period. Subtract the time of onset of the median case from the time of exposure to estimate the median incubation period. These incubation periods can be compared with a list of incubation periods of known diseases to narrow the possibilities. Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-31 EXAMPLE: Interpreting an Epidemic Curve Consider, for example, the outbreak of hepat itis A illustrat ed by the epidem ic curve in Figure 6.5. The incubation period for hepatitis A ranges from 15 to 50 days (roughly 2 to 7 weeks), with an average incubation period of 28-30 days (roughly one month). Because cases can occur from 15 to 50 days after exposure, all cases from a point source exposure should occur within a span of 50 - 15 = 35 days. Figure 6.5 Hepatitis A from Sub Shop\u2014Massachusetts, 2001 Adapted from: Foodborne transmission of hepatitis A-Massachusetts, 2001. MMWR 2003;52:565-7. Is this epidemic curve consistent with a point-source epide mic? (That is, do all of the cases occur with one incubation period?) Yes. The date of onset of the first case was during the week of October 28. The date of onset of the last known case was during the week of November 18, less than one month later. All of the cases occur within the range of incubation periods expected for a point source exposure. Therefore, the epidemic curve can be used to identify the likely period of exposure. What is the peak of the outbreak or the median date of onset? Both the peak of the outbreak and the median case occurred during the week of November 4. When is the likely date(s) of exposure , based on one averag e incubation period prior to the peak (media n date) of the outbreak? Since both the peak and the median of the outbreak occurred during the week of November 4, the most likely period of exposu re was a month earlier, in early Octob er. When is the beginning of the outbreak? The earliest case occurred during the week of October 28. When is the likely dates of exposure, based on the minimum incubati on period before the first case? Subtracting 2 weeks from the week of October 28 points to the week of October 14. Thus you would look for exposures during the weeks of October 7 and 14, plus or minus a few days. This turned out to be the exact period during which a restaur ant employee, diagnosed with hepatitis A in mid-October, would have been shedding virus while still workin g. In summary, the graph reflects an outbreak (number of cases clearly in excess of usual) beginning during the week of October 28, peaking during the week of November 4, and ending during the week of November 18. Based on these data and knowledge of the incubation period of hepatitis A, the period of expos ure was proba bly in early to mid-October. Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-32 Exercise 6.6 An outbr eak of an acute respiratory disease, coccidioidom ycosis, occurred among volunteer s, group leaders, and archaeol ogists who began working at a Native Ameri can archaeologic al site in Utah on June 18.30 A. Using the dates of onset listed below, draw an epidemic curve. Graph paper is provided at the end of this lesson. Case # Date of Onset Case # Date of Onset 1 6/28 6 6/29 2 6/28 7 6/29 5 6/29 10 B. The average incubat ion period for coccid ioidomycosis is 12 days, with a minimum incubation period of 7 days. Using your epidemic curve and the average and minimum incubati on periods for coccidioidomycos is, identify the likely exposure period . Check your answers on page 6-62 Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-33 Place Assessment of an outbreak by place not only provides information on the geographic extent of a problem, but may also demonstrate clusters or patterns that provide important etiologic clues. A spot map is a simple and useful technique for illustrating where cases live, work, or m ay have been exposed. Some spot maps indicate each patient's residence. If the map shows a cluster or other pattern (such as cases along a road), the investigator must consider possi ble explanations \u2014 perhaps water supplies, wind currents, or proxim ity to a restaurant or grocery. A spot m ap, like that used by John Snow in London in 1854 (see Lesson 1, Figure 1.1), can give cl ues about m ode of spread.31 For exam ple, clustering of cases in a wing of a nursing hom e is consistent w ith either a focal source or person-t o-person spread, whereas scattering of cases throughout the facility is m ore consistent with a widely dissem inated vehicle or a source common to the residents that is not associated with room assignm ent, such as a comm on dining hall or water supply. In an outbreak of pneum ococc al pneum onia in a nursing hom e in New Jersey, cases were m ore comm on in the north wing than in the south wing (Figure 6.6). Nursing hom e staff di d report that the 2 residents of the south wing who developed pneumonia did spend m uch of their time in the north wing.32 Figure 6.6 Cases of Pneumonia by Room, Nursing Home A\u2014New Jersey, 2001 Adapted from: Tan C. A preventable outbreak of pneumococcal pneumonia among unvaccinated nursing home residents in New Jersey during 2001. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2003;24:848-52. Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-34 Often, a spot m ap by site of presumed exposure is m ore informative than one by residence. F igure 6.7 shows the location of staff in two offices in the U. S. Senate's Hart Building who had nasal swabs positive for B. anthracis after an envelope containing anthrax spores was opened in their presence.33 To look for clustering in an outbr eak of surgical wound infections in a hospital, cases m ay be plotted by operating room , recovery room , and ward room . In studying \"sick-building syndrom e\" and other disorders related to air-flow patterns in buildings, cases should be plotted by work location. A spot map may even plot sites of recreational or other outdoor exposures.

Prese nted at 51st Annual Epidemic Intelligence Service Conference, April 22-26, 2004, Atlanta. Spot m aps are useful for dem onstrating cases within a geographic area, but they do not take the si ze of the underlying population into account. To compare incidence between different areas with different population densities, an area m ap showi ng area-specific rates is preferable. Figure 6.8 show s the number of cases of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis by county in W isconsin during 1996- 1998.34 The most cases occurred in Washburn (n=21) and Chippewa (n=17) Counties. By dividing the num ber of cases by the size of the population, county-speci fic rates of ehrlichiosis can be calculated (Figure 6.9). W hile Jackson (n=11) and Rusk (n=9) Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-35 Counties had fewer cases than Chippewa, their populations are much smaller, and they turned out to have higher rates of disease.

Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-36 Person Characterization of the o utbreak by person provides a description of whom the case-p atients ar e and who is at risk. Person characteristics that are u sually described include both host characteristics (age, race, sex, and medical status) and possible exposures (occupation, leisure activities, and use of medications, tobacco, and drugs). Both of th ese influence susceptibility to disease and opportunities for exposure. The two m ost comm only described host characteristics are age and sex because they are easily collected and because they are often related to exposure and to the risk of disease. Depending on the outbreak, occupation, race, or other personal characteristics specific to the disease under investigation and the setting of the outbreak may also be important. For example, investigators of an outbreak of hepatitis B might characterize the cases by intravenous drug use and sexual contacts, two of the high risk exposures for that disease. Investigators of a school-based gastroenteritis outbreak might describe occurren ce by grade or classroom , and by student versus teacher or other staff. Early in an investigation, investigators may restrict the descriptive epidem iology to numbers of cases. However, in many circumstances the investigators also calculate rates (num ber of cases divided by the population or number of people at risk). Numbers indicate the burden of disease and are useful for planning and service delivery. Rates are essential for identifying groups with elevated risk of disease. Summarizing by time, place, and person After characterizing an o utbreak by tim e, place, and person, it is useful to summarize what you know. For exam ple, during an investigation of an outbreak of Le gionnaires' disease in Louisiana, members of the investigative team discussed what they knew based on the descriptive epidem iology.35 Specifically, the epidemic curve indicated that the outbreak was basically over, because no new case had been reported in the prev ious two weeks. The affected population had a greater proportion of persons who were black, female, young, and less likely to sm oke than persons in a typical Legionnaires' outbreak. There appe ared to be no clustering by either residence or worksite, and no connection with exposure to the town's cooling towers. Thus, th e investigators were forced to develop new hypotheses about a source of Legionnaires' disease to explain this outbreak. Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-37 \"Round up the usual suspects.\" - Capt. Renault (Claude Rains) to his policemen after Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) had just shot a Nazi officer, Casablanca, 1942 Step 7: Develop hyp otheses Although the next conceptual st ep in an investigation is formulating hypotheses, in reality, investigators usually begin to generate hypotheses at the tim e of the initial telephone call. Depending on the outbreak, the hypot heses may address the source of the agent, the mode (and vehicle or vector) of transm ission, and the exposures that caused the disease. The hypotheses should be testable, since evaluating hypothese s is the next step in the investigation. In an outbreak context, hypotheses are generated in a variety of ways. First, consider what you know about the disease itself: What is the agent's usual reservoir? How is it usually transmitted? What vehicles are commonly implicat ed? What are the known risk factors? In other words, by being familiar with the disease, you can, at the very least, \"round up the usual suspects.\" Another useful way to generate hypot heses is to talk to a few of the case-patients, as discussed in St ep 3. The conversations about possible exposures should be open-ended and wide-ranging, not necessarily confined to the known sources and vehicles. In som e challenging investigations that yielded few clues, investigators have convened a meeting of several case-patients to search for common exposures. In addition, investigators have som etimes found it useful to vis it the homes of case-patients and look through their refrigerators and shelves for clues to an apparent foodborne outbreak. Just as case-patients may have important insights into causes, so too may the local health departm ent staff. The local staff know the people in the community and their practices, and often have hypotheses based on their knowledge. The descriptive epidem iology m ay provide useful clues that can be turned into hypotheses. If the epidem ic curve points to a narrow period of exposure, what events occurred around that time? Why do the people living in one particul ar area have the highest attack rate? Why are some groups with particular age, sex, or other person characteristics at greater risk than other groups with different person characteristics? Su ch questions about the data may lead to hypotheses that can be tested by appropriate analytic techniques. Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-38 When the epidemiology does not fit the natural pattern, think unnatural, i.e., intentional. Given recent concerns about bioterrorism, investigators should consider intentional dissem ination of an infectious or chemical agent when trying to determ ine the cause of an outbreak. An intentional act, one with either terrorist or criminal intent, should be considered under a variety of circum stances listed in Table 6.6. Investigators of an outbreak of salm onellosis in T he Dalles, Oregon, were stum ped when they were able to im plicate salad bars in several local restaurants, but could not identify any common ingredients or distribution system.36 A year later, a m ember of a local cult admitted that the cult had intentionally contaminated the salads bars with Salmonella organism s. The lesson learned is that when the epidemiology does not fit the usual or natural patterns of transmission, investigators should think about intentional m odes of transmission. Table 6.6 Epidemiologic Clues to Bioterrorism 1.

Epidemiologic clues to bioterrorism. Public Health Reports 2003; 118:92-8. Outliers also can provide important clues. In an outbreak of thyrotoxicosis in 1985, most cases came from Luverne, Minnesota, and the surrounding areas. Only one case was identified in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, 60 m iles away. Did this person ever go to Luverne? Yes. Was she a friend or acquaintance of any of the Luverne cases? Not really . What does she do when she goes to Luverne? Visit my father and buy the locally produced ground beef that he sells in his store . Aha! The hypothesis that the locally produced ground beef was the vehicle could easily be tested by Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-39 asking case-patients and controls (persons without thyrotoxicosis or other thyroid disease) whethe r they ate ground beef from the same source. Case-patients did, controls did not.37 Step 8: Evaluate hypotheses epidemiologically After a hypothesis that might explain an outbreak has been developed, the next step is to evaluate the plausibility of that hypothesis. Typically, hypotheses in a field investigation are evaluated using a combination of environmental evidence, laboratory science, and epidem iology. From an epidemiologic point of view, hypotheses are evalua ted in one of two ways : either by comparing the hypotheses with the established facts or by using analytic epidem iology to quantify relationships and assess the role of chance. The first m ethod is likely to be used when the clinical, laboratory, environmental, and/or epidemiologic evidence so obviously supports the hypotheses that formal hypothesis testing is unnecessary. For exam ple, in an outbreak of hypervitam inosis D that occurred in Massachusetts in 1991, investigators found that all of the case-patients drank milk delivered to their homes by a local dairy. Therefore, investigators hypo thesized that the dairy was the source and the milk was the vehicle. When they visited the dairy, they quickly recognized that the dairy was inadvertently adding far more than the recomm ended dose of vitam in D to the m ilk. No analytic epidemiology was really necessary to evaluate the basic hypothesis in this setting or to implement appropriate control measures, although investigators did conduct additional studies to identify additional risk factors.38,39 In many other investigations, how ever, the circumstances are not as straightforward, and infor mation from the series of cases is not sufficiently compelling or convincing. In such investigations, epidemiologists use analytic epidemiology to test their hypotheses. The key feature of analytic ep idem iology is a com parison group. The comparison group allows epidemiologists to compare the observed pattern am ong case-patients or a group of exposed persons with the expected pattern among noncases or unexposed persons. By comparing the obser ved with expected patterns, epidemiologists can determine whether the observed pattern differs substantially from what should be expected and, if so, by what degree. In other words, epidem iologists can use analytic epidemiology with its hallmark comparison group to quantify relationships between exposures and disease, and to test hypotheses about causal relations hips. The two most common types of analytic epidem iology stud ies used in field investigations Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-40 are retrospective cohort studies and case-control studies, as described in the following sections. Retrospective cohort studies A retrospective cohort study is th e study of choice for an outbreak in a sm all, well-defined populat ion, such as an outbreak of gastroenteritis am ong we dding guests for which a com plete list of guests is available. In a cohort study, the investigator contacts each member of the defined population (e.g., wedding guests), determ ines each person's exposure to possible sources and vehicles (e.g., what food and drin ks each guest consum ed), and notes whether the person later became ill with the disease in question (e.g., gastroenteritis). Method for calculating risk ratio: Attack rate (risk) in exposed group Attack rate (risk) in unexposed group After collecting similar information from each attendee, the investigator calculates an attack rate for those exposed to (e.g., who ate) a particular item and an attack rate for those who were not exposed. Generally, an exposur e that has the following three characteristics or criteria is considered a strong suspect: 1. The attack rate is high among those exposed to the item . 2. The attack rate is low among those not exposed, so the difference or ratio between attack rates is high. 3. Most of the case-p atients were exposed to the item, so that the exposure could \"exp lain\" or acco unt for m ost, if not all, of the cases. Relative and attributable risk. Commonly, the investigator compares the attack rate in the exposed group to the attack rate in the unexposed group to measure the association between the exposure (e.g., the food item ) and disease. This is called the risk ratio or the relative ris k. When the attack rate for the exposed group is the same as the attack rate for the unexposed group, the relative risk is equal to 1.0, and the exposure is said not to be associated with disease. The greater the difference in attack rates between the exposed and unexposed groups, the larger the relative risk, and the stronger the association between exposure and disease. Table 6.7 includes data from an investigation of an outbreak of Salmonella Typhim urium gastroenteritis follow ing a company's holiday banquet in December 2003.40 Approximately 135 persons attended the party, and of 116 who were interviewed, 57 (49%) met the case definition. Food-specifi c attack rates for those who did and did not eat each of 9 items served only at this banquet are presented. Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-41 Scan the column of attack rates among those who ate the specified items and consider the three criteria listed on the previous page. Which item shows the highest attack rate? Is the attack rate low among pers ons not exposed to that item? Were most of the 57 case-patients exposed to that food item ?

Beef, which had the highest attack rate among those who ate it, the lowest attack rate among those who did not eat it, and could account for almost all (53 of 57) of the cases, was indeed the culprit. The data showing the relationship between an exposure and disease are often displayed in a two-by-two table. The following two-by-two table shows the data for beef and gastroenteritis.

A steamship full of trouble: an outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium DT 104 gastroenteritis at a holiday banquet-Virginia, 2003. Presented at 53rd Annual Epidemic Intelligence Service Conference, April 19-23, 2004, Atlanta. The risk ratio is calculated as the ratio of the attack rates or risks, i.e., 65.4% divided by 11.4%, whic h equals 5.7. This risk ratio Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-42 indicates that persons who ate the beef were 5.7 times more likely to become ill than those who did not eat the beef. Method for calculating population attributable risk percent: ( ARP - ARU ) ARP ARP = Attack rate (risk) in total population ARU = Attack rate (risk) in unexposed group Considering the third criterion listed earlier, notice that almost all (53 out of 57) of the cases c ould be accounted for by the beef. Some investigators use a more quantitative approach and calculate a population attributable risk percent for each food. The population attributable risk percent describes the proportion of illness in the entire study population that could be attributable to a given exposure, assuming that those who became ill in the unexposed group and a similar proportion in the exposed group must be attributable to something else. The population attr ibutable risk percent may actually be an underestimate in many outbreaks, since it does not take into account such common occurrences as cross- contam ination of foods or sampling of a spouse's dish. The population attributable risk per cent for beef was 76.7% (see Table 6.8), much higher than that for any other food. Statistical significance testing. When an exposure is found to have a relative risk different from 1.0, many investigators calculate a chi-square or other test of statis tical significance to determine the likelihood of finding an association as large or larger on the basis of chance alone. A detailed descri ption of statistical testing is beyond the scope of this lesson, but the following text presents some key features and form ulas. To test an association for statisti cal significance, assume first that the exposure is not related to dise ase, i.e., the relative risk (RR) equals 1.0. This assum ption is known as the null hypothesis . The alternative hypothesis, which will be adopted if the null hypothesis proves to be implaus ible, is that exposure is associated with disease. Next, compute a m easure of association, such as a risk ratio or odds ratio. Then calculate a chi-square or other statistical test. This test indicates the probability of finding an association as strong as or stronger than the one you have observed if the null hypothesis were really true, that is, if in reality the exposure being tested was not related to the disease. This probability is called the p-value . A very small p-value means that the observed association occurs only rarely if the null hypothesis is true. If the p-value is smaller than some cutoff that has been specified in advance, commonly 0.05 or 5%, you discard or reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. Table 6.9 shows the standard not ation for a two-by-two table . Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-43 Table 6.9 Standard Notation of a Two-By-Two Table Ill Well Total Attac k Rate (Ri sk) Exposed a b a+b = H1 a / a+b Unexposed c / c+d Total a+c=V1 b+d=V2 T V1 / One test: T(ad-bc)2 H1 x H0 x V1 x V2 The most common statistical test for data in a two-by-two table from an outbreak is the chi-square test. To apply this test, calculate the chi-square statistic, then l ook up its correspondi ng p-value in a table of chi-squares, such as Table 6.10. Since a two-by-two table has 1 degree of freedom , a chi-square larger than 3.84 corresponds to a p-value smaller than 0.05. This means that if you planned to reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is less than 0.05, you can do so if your value for chi-square is greater than 3.84. Recognize, however, that the chi-square and similar tests are guides to help you m ake a decision about a hypothesis. W hichever decision you make, you may be right or you may be wrong. You could calculate a p-value that is not less than 0.05 and conse quently fail to reject the null hypothesis, which m ay turn out to be true. This often occurs when a study has relatively few people. The opposite can also occur \u2014 a p-value less than 0.05 can actually be a chance finding rather than the true explanation of the outbreak. Table 6.10 Ta ble of Chi-Squares Degrees Probability of Freedom .50 .20 .10 .05 .02 .01 .001 1 consum ption data presented in Table 6.8. The relative risk is 5.7, which most epidemiologists would deem a \"strong\" association between exposure and disease. In addition, the p-value is exceedingly small, less than 0.001, and far less than the comm only used cutoff of 0.05. So the investigators rejected the null hypothesis (that beef was not associated w ith illness) and adopt ed the alternative hypothesis (that beef was indeed associated with illness). In this outbreak, the Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-44 association between eating beef at the banque t and gastroenteritis was both strong (RR=5.7) and statisti cally significan t (p < 0.001). The chi-square test works well if the num ber of people in the study is greater than about 30. For sm aller studies, a test called the Fisher Exact Test may be more appropriate. Because the Fisher Exact Test is tedious to calculate, let Epi Info or another computer program perfor m the calculations for you. Confidence intervals. An alternative to calculating a p-value is calcu lating a confidence interval. A 95% confiden ce interval, the interval used most commonly by epidem iologists, corresponds to a p=0.05 cut-off. In non-technical term s, a confidence interval for a risk ratio is the range of values of the risk ratio consistent with the data in a study. A wide confidence interval indicates that the study is consistent with a wide range of values, i.e., the study is not very precise in describing the strength of the association (risk ratio) between exposure and disease. A narrow confidence interval indicates that the risk ratio is fairly precise. Consider again the gastroenteritis data in Table 6.8. The 95% confidence interval for the risk ratio of 5.7 ranged from 2.2 to 14.6. This confidence interval indicates that the study is consistent with risk ratios for the beef/gastroenteritis asso ciation in that range. Because a confidence interval provides more information than a p- value does, m any medical and epid emiologic journals now prefer confidence intervals to p-values. However, in the outbreak setting, the difference m ay be irrelevant. If the objective of an outbreak investigation is to identify the cu lprit such as a contam inated food, a relative risk and p-value m ay do just as well as a relative risk and confidence interval. Case-contro l studies A cohort study is feasible only wh en the population is well defined and can be followed over a period of tim e. Howe ver, in m any outbreak settings, the population is not well defined and speed of investigation is im portant. In such settings, the case-control study becom es the study design of choice. In a case-control study, the investig ator asks both case-patients and a comparison group of persons without disease (\"controls\") about their exposures. Using the inform ation about disease and exposure status, the investigator then calculates an odds ratio to quantify the relationship between exposure and disease. Finally, a p-value or confidence interval is calculated to assess statistical sign ifican ce. Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-45 Choosing controls. When designing a case-control study, one of the most important decisions is deciding who the controls should be. The controls must not have the disease being studied, but should represent the population in which the cases occurred. In other words, they should be sim ilar to the cases except that they don't have the disease. The controls provide the level of exposure you would expect to find am ong the case-patients if the null hypothesis were true. If exposur e is much m ore common a mong the case-patients than among the controls, i.e., the observed exposure among case-patients is greater than expected exposure provided by the controls, then expos ure is said to be associated with illness. In practice, choosing who the most appropriate control group is may be quite difficult. In addi tion, investigators must consider logistical issues, such as how to contact potential controls, gain their cooperation, ensure that they are free of disease, and obtain appropriate exposure data from them. In a community outbreak, a random sample of the healthy popu lation may, in theory, be the best control group. In practice, however, persons in a random sample may be difficult to contact and enroll. Nonetheless, many investigators attempt to enroll such \"population-based\" controls through dialing of random telephone numbers in the community or through a household survey. Other common control groups consist of: ! Neighbors of case-patients, ! Patients from the same physician practice or hospital who do not have the disease in question, ! Friends of case-patients. While controls from these groups may be m ore likely to participate in the study than randomly identified population-based controls, they may not be as representative of the population. If the control group is system atically different from the case group in certain ways, a true association between exposure and disease m ay be missed or a spurious association m ay be observed between a non- causal exposure and disease. A system atic difference between cases and controls that results in a mistaken estimate of the association between exposure and disease is called a bias. When designing a case-control stud y, you m ust consider a variety of other issues about controls, including how many to use. Sample size formulas are available to help you m ake this decision. In general, the more subjects (case- patients and controls) in a study, the easier it will be to find a statistically s ignificant association. Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-46 Often, the num ber of case-patients th at can be enrolled in a study is limited by the size of the outbreak. For exam ple, in a hospital, four or five cases may constitute an outbreak. Fortunately, potential controls are usually plentiful. In an outbreak of 50 or m ore cases, one control per case will usually suffice. In sm aller outbreaks, you might use two, three, or four controls per case. Including m ore than four controls per case is rarely worth the effort in terms of increasing the statistical power of your investigation. As an example, consider agai n the outbreak of L egionnaires' disease that occurred in Louisiana described at the end of Step 6. Investigators enrolled 27 case-pa tients into a case-control study. They also enrolled two controls per case, a total of 54 controls. Using descriptive epidem iology, the investigators did not see any connection with the town's various cooling towers. Using analytic epidem iology, the investigato rs determ ined quantitatively that case-patients and controls were about equally exposed to cooling towers. However, case-patients we re far more likely to shop at a particular grocery store, as shown in the following two-by-tw o table.35 Table 6.11 Exposure to Grocery Store A Among Case s and Controls, Legionellos is Outbreak\u2014 Louisiana, 1990 Cases Controls Total Exposed 25 28 53 Unexposed 2 26 28 Data Source: Mahoney FJ, Hoge Legionnaires' disease associated with a grocery store mist machine. J Infect Dis 1992;165:736-9. Method for calculating the odds ratio: Number of exposed cases X Number of unexposed controls Number of exposed controls X Number of unexposed cases OR ad / bc Odds ratios. In most case-control studies, the population is not well defined, and the total num ber of people exposed (or unexposed) to a suspected vehicle or source is not known. W ithout a proper denom inator, attack rate s cannot be calc ulated. In the example above, since the investigators did not know how many community residents did or did not shop at Grocery Store A, they could not calculate attack rates or a risk ratio. For a case-control study, the m easure of association of choice is the odds ratio . Fortunately, for a rare disease such as legionellosis and most other outbreak-associated diseases, the odds ratio from a case-control study approximates the relative risk that would have been found if a cohort study had been feasible. Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-47 The odds ratio for Grocery Store A is calculated as: 25 x 26 / 28 x 2 = 11.6 An odds ratio of 11 is quite large, indicating that shopping at Grocery Store A was strongly associated with developing legionellosis. These data would seem to indicate that persons exposed to Grocery Store A had 11.6 tim es the odds of developing legionellosis than persons not exposed to that store. To test the statistical significance of this finding, a chi-square test can be computed using the formula shown earlier. For Grocery Store A, the chi-square is: = 81 x (25 x 26 - 28 x 2)2 53 x 28 x 27 x 54 = 28,579,716 / 2,163,672 = 13.02 Referring to Table 6.10, a chi-squa re of 13.02 corresponds to a p- value less than 0.001. A p-value this small indicates that the null hypothesis is highly improbable, and the investigators rejected the null hypothesis. The 95% confidence interval ranged from 2.3 to 78.7. Although this confidence interval is quite w ide and includes a wide range of values compatible with the data in the study, it does not include the null hypothesis value of 1.0.

This is particularly true if the hypothe ses were not well founded at the outset. It is an axiom of field epidem iology that if you cannot generate good hypotheses (for exam ple, by talking to som e case- patients or local staff and exam ining the descriptive epidem iology and outliers), then proceeding to analytic epidem iology, such as a case-control study, is likely to be a waste of time. When analytic epidem iology is unrevealing, rethink your hypotheses. Consider convening a meeting of the case-patients to look for common links or visiti ng their homes to look at the products on their shelves. Consid er new vehicles or modes of transmission. An investigation of an outbreak of Salmonella Muenchen in Ohio illustrates h ow a reexamination of hypotheses can be productive. In that investigation, a case-control study failed to implicate any plausible food source as a common vehicle. Interestingly, all case- households but only 41% of control households included persons aged 15-35 years. The investigat ors thus began to consider vehicles of transm ission to which young adults w ere comm only exposed. By asking about drug us e in a second case-control study, the investigators implicated marijuana as the likely vehicle. Laboratory analysts subsequently isolated the outbreak strain of S. Muenchen from several samples of marijuana provided by case- patients.43 Even when an analytic study iden tifies an association between an exposure and disease, the hypothe sis may need to be honed. For exam ple, in the investigation of Legionnaires' disease (T able 6.11), what about Grocery Store A linked it to disease? The investigators asked case-patients and controls how m uch time they spent in the store and where they went in the store. Using the epidemiologic data, the investigators were able to implicate the ultrasonic mist machine that sprayed the fruits and vegetables. This association was confirmed in the laboratory, where the outbreak subtype of the Legionnaires' diseas e bacillus was isolated from the water in the mist machine's reservoir.35 Sometimes a more specific control group is needed to test a more specific hypothesis. For exam ple, in m any hospital outbreaks, investigators use an initial study to narrow their focus. They then conduct a second study, with more closely matched controls, to identify a more specific exposure or vehicle. In a large community outbreak of botulism in Illinois, investigators used three sequential Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-52 case-control studies to identify the vehicle. In the first study, investigators com pared exposures of case-patients and controls from the general public to implicate a restaurant. In a second study they compared restaurant exposures of case-patients and healthy restaurant patrons to identify a specific menu item, a meat and cheese sandwich. In a third st udy, investigators used radio broadcast appeals to identify healthy restaurant patrons who had eaten the implicated sandwich. Compared to case-patients who had also eaten the sandwich, controls were m ore likely to have avoided the onions that came with the sandwich. Type A Clostridium botulinum was then identified from a pan of leftover saut\u00e9ed onions used to make only that particular sandwich.44 Finally, recall that one reason to investigate outbreaks is research. An outbreak may provide an \"experi ment of nature\" that would be unethical to set up deliberately but from which the scientific community can learn when it does happen to occur. For example, the outbreak of W est Nile virus in Queens, New York, in 1999 was promptly investigated to determine the extent of the outbreak and risk factors for disease so appropr iate control measures could be developed and implemented.45 How ever, capitalizing on this unfortunate \"experim ent of nature ,\" investigator s continued to follow the patients to determine the persistence of IgM and the prognosis of patients up to two years after infection.46,47 Thus, the investigations resulted not only in the developm ent of appropriate control and prevention strategies, but also in increased knowledge about a health problem not previ ously seen or studied in the Western hem isphere. When an outbreak occurs, whethe r it is routine or unusual, consider what questions remain unanswered about that particular disease and what kind of study you might do in this setting to answer some of those questions. The circum stances m ay allow you to learn more about the disease, its modes of transm ission, the characteristics of the agent, host factors, and the like. Step 10: Compare and reconcile with laboratory and environm ental studies While epidemiology can implicate vehicles and guide appropriate public health action, laboratory evidence can confirm the findings. The laboratory was essential in both the outbreak of salmonellosis linked to marijuana and in the Legionellosis outbreak traced to the grocery store mist machine. You may recall that the investigation of pneumonia among attendees of an American Legion conference in Philadelphia in 1976 that gave Legionnaires' disease its name Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-53 was not considered complete until a new organism was isolated in the laboratory some six months later.48 Environm ental studies are equall y important in som e settings. They are often helpful in explai ning why an outbreak occurred. For example, in the investigation of the outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 among visitors to a county fair, the epidemiologists were able to identify one very strong risk f actor \u2014 consum ption of beverages with ice purchased from a vendor in zone 6. Environm ental inspection of the fairgrounds identi fied lack of chlorination of the well supplying water to that zone . Furtherm ore, the well was found to be close to the manure pits and a septic tank for the worker's dorm itory. Flourescein dye poured into the bathro om of the dorm found its way into the well water, revealing cross-contam ination. Finally, laboratorians were able to culture E. coli from the well, the supply line, and the tap at zone 6.49 Thus the epidem iologic, environm ental, and laboratory arm s of the investigation complemented one another, and led to an inescapable conclusion that the well had been contaminated and was the source of the outbreak. While you may not be an expert in these other areas, you can help. Use a camera to photograph working or environmental conditions. Coordinate with the laboratory, and bring back physical evidence to be analyzed. Step 11: I mplement control and prevention measures In most outbreak investigations, the primary goal is control of the outbreak and prevention of additional cases. Indeed, although implementing control and prevention measures is listed as Step 11 in the con ceptual s equen ce, in practice control and preventio n activities should be implemented as early as possible. The health departm ent's first responsibility is to protect the public's health, so if appropriate control m easures are known and available, they should be initiated even before an epidemiologic investigation is launched. For example, a child with measles in a community with other susceptible children may prompt a vaccination cam paign before an investigation of how that child became infected. Confidentiality is an important issue in implementing control measures. Healthcare workers need to be aware of the confidentiality issues relevant to collection, managem ent and sharing of data. For example, in th e treatm ent of tuberculosis (TB), the relationship between the patien t and the healthcare worker is extrem ely important because of the serious consequences of treatment failure. If patient information is disclosed to Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-54 unauthorized persons without the patient's perm ission, the patient may be stigmatized or experience rejection from fa mily and friends, lose a job, or be evicted from housing. Moreover, the healthcare worker may lose the trust of the patient, which can affect adherence to TB treatm ent. Therefore, confidentiality \u2014 the responsibility to protect a patient's private inform ation \u2014 is critical in TB control and many other situations.50 In general, control measures are usually directed against one or more segm ents in the chain of tr ansm ission (agent, source, mode of transmission, portal of entry, or host) that are susceptible to intervention. For som e diseases, the most appropriate intervention may be directed at controlling or elim inating the agent at its source. A patient with a communicable disease such as tuberculosis, whether symptom atic or asymptomatic, may be treated with antibiotics both to clear the infection and to reduce the risk of transm ission to others. For an environmental toxin or infectious agent that resides in soil, the soil may be decontaminated or covered to prevent escape of the agent. Some interventions are aimed at blocking the mode of transm ission. Interruption of direct transmission may be accomplished by isolation of someone with infection, or counseling persons to avoid the speci fic type of contact associated with transmission. Similarly, to control an outbreak of influenza- like illness in a nursing home, affected residents could be cohorted, that is, put together in a separate area to prevent transmission to others. Vehicle borne transmission may be interrupted by elimination or decontam ination of the vehicle. For example, contaminated foods should be discarded, and surgical equipment is routinely sterilized to prevent transm ission. Efforts to prevent fecal-oral transm ission often focus on rearranging the environment to reduce the risk of contamination in the future and on changing behaviors, such as promoting hand washing. For airborne diseases, strategies may be directed at modifying ventilation or air pressure, and filtering or treating the air. To interrupt vector borne transm ission, measures may be directed toward controlling the vector population, such as spraying to reduce the mosquito population that may carry West Nile virus. Some simple and effective strategies protect portals of entry. For exam ple, bed nets are used to protect sleeping persons from being bitten by mosquitoes that may transmit malaria. A dentist's mask and gloves are intended to protec t the dentist from a patient's blood, secretions, and droplets, as well to protect the patient from the dentist. Wearing of long pants and sleeves and use of insect Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-55 repellent are recommended to reduce the risk of Lym e disease and West Nile virus infection. Some interventions aim to increase a host's defen ses. Vaccin ations promote development of specific antibodies that protect against infection. Similarly, prophylactic use of antimalarial drugs, recomm ended for visitors to m alaria-endem ic areas, does not prevent exposure through mosquito bites but does prevent infection from taking root. Step 12: Initiate or maintain surveillance Once control and prevention measures have been implemented, they must continue to be monito red. If surveillance has not been ongoing, now is the time to initiat e active surveillance. If active surveillance was initiated as part of case finding efforts, it should be continued. The reasons for conduc ting active surveillance at this time are twofold. First, you must continue to monitor the situation and determine whether the prevention and control measures are working. Is the num ber of new cases slowing down or, better yet, stopping? Or are new cases continui ng to occur? If so, where are the new cases? Are they occurri ng throughout the area, indicating that the interventions are generally ineffective, or are they occurring only in pocke ts, indicating that the interventions m ay be effective but that some areas were missed? Second, you need to know whether the outbreak has spread outside its original area or the area where the interventions were targeted. If so, effective disease control and prevention measures m ust be implemented in these new areas. Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-56 Epi-X is the CDC's Web- based communications solution for public health professionals. Through Epi-X, CDC officials, state and local health departments, poison control centers, and other public health professionals can access and share preliminary health surveillance information quickly and securely. Users can also be actively notified of breaking health events as they occur. Key features of Epi-X include: ! Scientific and editorial support ! Controlled user access ! Digital credentials and authentication ! Rapid outbreak reporting ! Peer-to-peer consultatio n. Step 13: Communicate findings As noted in Step 1, developm ent of a communications plan and communicating with those who need to know during the investigation is critical. The final task is to summarize the investigation, its findings, and its outcom e in a report, and to communicate this report in an effective m anner. This communication usually takes two form s: ! An oral briefing for local authorities . If the field investigator is responsible for the epidemiology but not disease control, then the oral briefing should be attended by the local health authorities and persons responsible for implementing control and prevention measures. Often these persons are not epidemiologists, so findings must be presented in clear and convinc ing fashion with appropriate and justifiable recomm endations for action. This presentation is an opportunity for the investigators to describe what they did, what they found, and what they think should be done about it. They should present their findings in a scientifically objective fashion, and they should be able to defend their conclusions and recommendations. ! A written report . Investigators should also prepare a written report that follows the usual scientific format of introduction, background, methods, results, discussion, and recommendations. By formally presenting recommendations, the report provides a blueprint for action. It also serves as a record of perform ance and a document for potential legal issues. It serves as a reference if the health department encounters a similar situation in the future. F inally, a report that finds its way into the public health literature serves the broader purpose of contributing to the knowledge base of epidem iology and public health. In recent years, the public ha s becom e more aware of and interested in public health. In response, health departm ents have made great strides in attempting to keep the public inform ed. Many health departments strive to communicate directly with the public, usually through the media, both during an investigation and when the investigation is concluded. Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-57 Summar y Outbreaks occur frequently. Not ev ery outbreak comes to light, but of those that do, public health agencies must decide whether to handle them without leaving the office, or spend the time, energy, and resources to conduct field investigations. The m ost im portant reason to investigate is to learn enough about the situa tion to implement appropriate control and prevention measures. Other reasons include taking the opp ortunity to advance knowledge a bout the disease, agent, risk factors, interventions and other scientific issues; responding to public, political, or legal concerns; evaluating a health program 's effectiv eness and w eaknesses; and to provide training. Outbreaks are almost always unexpected events. Sometimes they are the subject of media attention and public concern, so investigators feel pressured to work quickly to find answers. When multiple agencies are involved, coordination and communication become even more essential but are more complicated than usual. Often the investigation takes place in the field, far from the conveniences and routines one counts on in the office. Under these circumstances, it is essential to have a system atic plan for conducting the investigation. The steps listed in Table 6.2 comprise one such plan. Note that the order of the steps is conceptual, and investigators may decide that a different orde r is best suited for any given outbreak. To summarize, these are the steps of an outbreak investigation: ! Planning for field work, establishing the existence of an outbreak, and verifying the diagnosis are usually the first steps, sometimes done in that order, sometimes done in reverse order, sometimes done simultaneously. (Steps 1-3) ! After the diagnosis has been confirmed inves tigators create a workab le case definition, then go out and look for additional cases. Information about these cases is organized either in a line listing or in a com puter database that allows staffers to check for duplicate records, update records as additional information comes in, and perform descriptive epidemiology. (Steps 4-6) ! Descriptive epidemiology \u2014 organizing the data by time, place, and person \u2014 is essential for characterizing the outbreak, identifying populations at risk, developing hypotheses about risk factors, and targeting control/prevention stra tegies. An epidemic curve \u2014 a histogram of number of cases by time of onset of illness \u2014 provides a handy visual display of the outbreak's m agnitude and time trend. (Step 6) ! Hypotheses, based on what is known about th e disease, descriptive epidem iology, and what others have postulated, must be developed before conducting any kind of epidemiologic study (what are you going to study if you don't know what you are looking for?). (Step 7) ! While not every outbreak requires an analytic study, those that do are usually addressed by either a cohort study or a case-control study. Both types of study attempt to identify associations between exposures (risk factors or causes) and the disease of interest. In a cohort study, best suited for an outbreak in a well-defined population such as guests at a wedding, investigators usually attempt to enroll everyone, determ ine exposures and outcom es, calculate attack rates, and com pare att ack rates with a risk ratio or relative risk to identify associati ons. In a case-control study, which is well suited for outbreaks Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-58 without a w ell-defined populat ion, investigators usually enroll all of the case-patients plus a sam ple of persons who did not get i ll, then ask about exposures and compute an odds ratio to look for associations. (S tep 8) ! If needed, hypotheses can be refined and re-evaluated. In m any investigations, while the epidemiologists are conducting their epidemiologic investigations, environmental health specialists and laboratorians are conducting studies and tests of their own. Ideally, this multidisciplinary approach points to a single conclusion. (Steps 9 and 10) ! While implementing control and prevention measures is listed as Step 11, it is the primary goal of most outbreak investigations and usually occurs early in the investigation. Such measures can be implemented as soon as any link in the chain of disease transmission that is susceptible to intervention can be identified. If the source and mode of transm ission is known, disease contro l measures need not wait. However, there is no guarantee that these measures will work, so continued surveillance is essential. (Steps 11 and 12) ! Finally, communicating what was found and what should be or was done in a written report provides key public health, scien tific, and legal docum entation. (Step 13) Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-59 Exercise Answers Exercise 6.1 Nine cases of cancer in a community represents a cluster \u2014 a group of cases in a given area over a particular period of time that seems to be unusual, although we do not act ually know the size of the comm unity, the background rate of cancer, and the number of cases that might be expected. Nonetheless, either the health departm ent or th e community or both is concerned enough to raise the issue. Under these circumstances, an investigation may be justified for several reasons. 1. Because the number of expected cases is not known (or at least not stated), one reason to investigate is to determine how many cases to expect in the community. In a large community, nine cases of a comm on cancer (for exam ple, lung, breast, or colon cancer) would not be unusual. If the particular cancer is a rare type, nine cases even in a large community may be unus ual. And in a very small community, nine cases of even a common cancer may be unusual. 2. If the num ber of cancer cases turns out to be hi gh for that community, public health officials might choose to investigate further. They may have a research agenda \u2014 perhaps they can identify a new risk factor (workers exposed to a particular chem ical) or predisposition (persons with a particular ge netic trait) for the cancer. 3. Control and prevention may be the justification for additional investigation. If modifiable risk factors are known or identified, control and prevention measures can be developed. Alternatively, if the cancer is one that can treated successfully if f ound early, and a screening test is available, then investigation might focus on why these persons died from a treatable disease. If, for example, the nine cases were cancers of the cervix (detectable by Pap sm ear and generally nonfatal if identified and treate d early), a study might identify: a) lack of access to healthcare; b) physicians not following the recommendations to screen women at appropriate intervals; and/or c) laboratory error in reading or reporting the test results. Measures to correct these problem s, such as public screening clinic s, physician education, and laboratory quality assuran ce, could then be developed. 4. If new staff need to gain experience in conduc ting cluster investigations, training m ight be a justification for investigating these cases. More comm only, cancer clusters generate public concern, which, in turn, often results in political pressure. Perhap s one of the affected persons is a member of the mayor's family. A health departm ent needs to be responsive to such concerns, and should investigate enough to address the concerns with facts. Finally, legal concerns m ay prom pt an investigation, especially if a particular site (m anufacturing plant, houses built on an old dump site, etc.) is accused of causing the cancers. Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-60 Exercise 6.2 First, you should check the dates of onset rather than dates of report. The 12 reports could represent 12 recent cases, but could represent 12 cases scattered in tim e that were s ent in as a batch. However, assum ing that all 12 reports of tubercul osis and the 12 of W est Nile virus infection represent recent cases in a single county, both situations could be called clusters (several new cases seen in a particular area during a relativ ely brief period of time). Classifying the cases as an outbreak depends on whether the 12 cases exceed the usual num ber of cases reported in August in that county. Tuberculosis does not have a striking seasona l distribution. The num ber of cases during August could be compared with: a) the numbers reported during the preceding several months; and b) the num bers reported during Augus t of the preceding few years. West Nile virus infection is a highly seas onal disease that peaks during A ugust-September- October. As a result, the number of cases in Aug ust is exp ected to be higher than the numbers reported during the preceding several m onths. To determine whether the number of cases reported in August is greater than expected, the number must be compared with the numbers reported during August of the preceding few years. Exercise 6.3 Initial Case Definition Patient 1: No, eosinophil count < 2,000 cells/mm 3 Patient 2: Yes Patient 3: Yes Patient 4: Yes Patient 5: Yes Patient 6: No, eosinophil count < 2,000 cells/mm 3 Patient 7: No, other known cancer of eosinophilia Revised Case Definition Patient 1: No, eosinophil count < 1,000 cells/mm 3 and m yalgias not severe Patien t 2: Yes Patien t 3: Yes Patient 4: No, myalgias not severe Patien t 5: Yes Patient 6: Yes Patient 7: No, other known cancer of eosinophilia This illustrates that a case definition is a m ethod for deciding whether to classify someone as having the disease of interest or not, not whether they actually do or do not have the disease. Patients 1 and 4 may have mild cases, and Patient 7 may have leukem ia and eosinophilia- myalgia syndrom e, but are classified as non-cases under the revised definition. Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-61 Exercise 6.4 A case definition is a set of standard criteria for determining whether an individual should be categorized as having a particul ar disease or health-related co ndition. For an outbreak, a case definition consists of clinical criteria and specification of time, place, and person. A case definition can have degrees of certainty, e.g., suspect case (usu ally based on clinical and sometimes epidemiologic criteria) versus confirmed case (based on laboratory confirm ation). The outbreak appeared to be limited to students (no adults reported illness), but included both tour groups. Some students had severe abdominal pain and diarrhea and stool cultures positive for E. coli O157. Clearly these should be counted as case-patients. Some students had the sam e symptoms but negative cultures. Should they be counted as case-patients? Still others had the same symptoms but no stool testing. Should they be counted as case- patients? Finally, two students had single bouts of diarrhea, but no abdom inal pain and negative cultures. No one case definition is the absolutely correct case definition. One inves tigator could decide to include those with symptoms but without testing as suspect or probable cases, while another investigator could exclude them . Similarly, one investigator might put a great deal of faith in the stool culture and exclude those w ho tested negative, regardless of the presence of compatible symptoms, while another investigator m ight allow that some st ool cultures could be \"false negatives\" (test negative even though the person actually has the infection) and include them in a suspect or probable or possible category. The two students w ith si ngle bouts of diarrhea but no abdom inal pain and negative cultures seem least likely to have true cases of E. coli infection. Similarly, the beginning time limit could be set on December 2, the date that Tour A departed, or could be set later, to account for the minimum incubation period. So, one case definition might be: PERSON: Any tenth-grade studen t who went on either tour PLACE: Limited to students at city high schools TIME: Onset since December 2? 3? 4? CLINICAL: Confirmed stool sample positive for regardless of symptoms SUSPECT: Self-reported severe abdom inal diarrhea >2 culture negative Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-62 Exerci se 6.5 ID # Age Sex Race Disea se Date of OnsetLab Results Signs, Symptoms Physician 1 46 M W Lyme disease 8/1/2004 WB IgM+ EM,Fat,S,C Snow 2 56 F W Lyme disease 8/2/2004 WB IgM+, WB IgG+ EM,A,Fat,S, Fev Farr 3 40 F W Lyme disease 8/17/2004 WB IgM+, WB IgG+ EM Howard 4 53 M B Lyme disease 9/18/2004 WB IgM+, WB IgG- EM Fine 5 45 M W Lyme disease mid-May 2004 WB IgG+ A,Arthral, HA,Fat,S,C Howard 6 13 M B Lyme disease 2003 A,Arthral,Fat Steere A = arthritis Arthral = arthralgias C = chills EM = erythema migrans Fat = fatigue Fev = fever HA = heada che S = sweats Exercise 6.6 PART A 0123456 161718192021222324252627282930123 Date of symptom onset# Cases June JulyLikely Exposure PeriodAverage Incubation Period (12 days) Minimum Incubation Period (7 days) Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-63 PART B The date of onset of the earliest case was June 28. Subtracting the m inimum incubation period (7 days) from June 28 points to June 21. The m edian and modal date of onset was June 29. Subtracting the average (say, 12 days) from June 29 points to June 17. So the m ost likely exposure period was som etime around June 17 thr ough June 21, give or take a day or two on either side. Indeed, the investig ators determ ined that exposure most likely occurred on June 19, when all ill persons either actively participated in or were nearby the sifti ng of dirt that probably harbored the organism . Exercise 6.7 Cell phones are quite popular. Noting that most if not all of the 17 patien ts had used cell phones does not indicate that cell phones are the cause of brain cancer. An epidemiologic study that compares the exposure experience of the case-patients with the exposure experience of persons without brain cancer is necessar y. A case-contro l study is the design of choice, since 1 7 persons with the disease of interest have already been identified. As m any as possible of the 17 persons with brai n cancer should be enroll ed in the case-control study as the case group. A group of persons without brain cancer need to be identified and enrolled as the control group. W hom would you enroll as controls? Rem ember that controls are supposed to represent the gene ral exposure experience in th e population from which the case- patients came. Controls could come from the same community (random ly selected telephone numbers, neighbors, friends) or the same healthcare providers (e.g., patients treated by the sam e neurologist but who do not have brain cancer). Once case-patients and controls are identified and enrolled, each would be questioned about e xposure to cell phones. Finally, the exposure experience of case-patients and controls would be compared to determine whether case-patients were m ore likely to use cell phones, or use part icular types of phones, or used them more frequently, or for longer cumulative time, etc. The alternative to a case-control study is a cohort study. For a cohort study you would have to enroll a group of cell phone us ers (\"exposed group\") and a group of persons who do not use cell phones (\"un exposed gro up\"). You would then have to determine how m any in each g roup develop brain cancer. Since brain cancer is a relatively rare event, you would need rather large groups in order to have enough brain cancer cases for the study to be useful. Therefore, a cohort study is less practical than a case-control study in this setting. Exercise 6.8 1. The appropriate m easure of association fo r a case-control study is the odds ratio. 2. The odds ratio is calculated as the cross-product ratio: ad / bc. Odds ratio = 15 x 23 / 8 x 7 = 6.16 = 6.2 3. With a chi-square of 9.41 and a 95% confiden ce interval of 1.6-25.1, this study shows a very strong (odds ratio = 6.2) associa tion between histoplasm osis and working in Building X. This finding is quite statistically significant (chi-square = 9.41 corr esponds to a p-value between 0.01 and 0.001). And although the 95% confidence interval indicates that the study is Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-64 compatible with a seemingly relatively wide range of values (1.6-25.1), most of these values indicate a strong if not stronger association than the one observed. Exercise 6.9 The first step in answering this question is to compare the attack rates (% ill) among those who ate the meal and those who did not eat the meal. Since the % ill is a measure of risk of illness, you could calculate a risk ratio for each m eal. Risk Ratio 9/18 Breakfast 90% vs. 46% = 2.0 9/18 Lunch 62% vs. 15% = 4.1 9/18 Dinner 52% vs. 43% = 1.2 9/18 Late dinner 54% vs. 44% = 1.2 9/19 Breakfast 49% vs. 52% = 0.9 9/19 Lunch 51% vs. 47% = 1.1 Clearly, the September 18 lunch has the highest risk ratio. It has a relatively high attack rate (though not the highest) among those who ate the meal, and the lowest attack rate among those who did not eat the meal. Furthermore, almost all of the cases (50 out of 54) could be \"accounted for\" by that lunch. In contrast, although the Septem ber 18 breakfast has a high attack rate among those who ate that meal, it has a relatively high attack rate among those who did not eat that breakfast, and most importantly, it can only account for one-sixth (9 out of 54) of the cases. Perhaps the Septem ber 18 breakfast was a m inor contributor, but m ost of the illness probably resulted from exposure that occurred at the Septem ber 18 lunch.

World Health Organization Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-72 Answers to Self-Assessment Quiz 1. C, D. Most outbreaks come to the attention of health authorities because an alert clinician or a concerned case-p atient (or parent of a case-patient) calls. The other method s listed occasion ally detect outbreaks, but less frequent ly. 2. A, B, C, D. Factors influencing a health depart ment's decision to conduct a field investigatio n include some related to the healt h proble m itself (e.g., severity of illness, number of cases, availability of prevention / control measures), some relate to the health department (e.g., \"corporate culture\" for conducting field investigations versus handling it by teleph one, availab le staff and resource s), and some relate to external concer ns (e.g., public or political pressure ). 3. B (False) . The most important public health reason for investigating an outbreak is disease control and prevention. Protecting and prom oting the public 's health is our primary mission, even if it interf eres with our ability to conduct research. 4a. A. As in Answer 3, our primary mission is to protect the public's health , so disease control and prevent ion measure s shoul d take priority whenever possible. Because disease prevention and contro l measures are often aimed at interr upting trans mission, such measures can be implemented if the source and mode of transmiss ion are know n. 4b. B. If the agent is known but the source and mode of transm ission are not know n (example: Salmonella eventually traced to marijuana), then the healt h departme nt does not know how to target its intervention. Investigation to learn the source and/or mode is necessary. 4c. B. As in Answer 4b, If the agent, source, and mode of transmission are not known (examples: Legionnaires' Disease in Philadelphia in 1976; Kawasaki Syndrome \u2014 if it turns out to be an infectious disease), then the health department does not know how to target its intervention. Investig ation to learn the source and/o r mode is necess ary. 5. D. Early steps include confirming that the number of cases exceeds the expected number, verifying the diagn osis, and preparing for field work (which includes talking with laboratorians about specimen collection). Next steps include conducting surveillance to identify additional cases; analyzing the data by time, place, and person; generating hypotheses; and evaluating those hypotheses (for example, by conducting a case-control study). 6. B (False). The order presented in this text is conceptual. In practice, the order can be different. For example, preparing for field work often follows establishing the existence of an outbreak and verifying the diagnosis. When possible, control measures are initiated at the same time the field investigation begins, or even earlier. 7a. B. Epidemic, the occurr ence of more cases of disease than expected in a given area or among a specific group of people over a particular period of time, tends to refer to more widespre ad occurrence than outbreak. 7b. C. Outbreak tends to be used for an increase that is localized. Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-73 7c. A Cluster is an aggreg ation of cases in a given area over a particular period of time that seems unusual or suspicious, but often the usual or expected number of cases is not known. 8. B, C. Even an investigat or without a clinical backgroun d should, if possible, see and talk to a patient or two to gain a better understanding of the clinical features of the disease (needed for developing a case defin ition) and to generate hypotheses by asking about possible exposures. 9. A, B, C, D. A case defin ition for an outbreak should specif y clinical criteria as well as appropriate time, place, and person characteristics. The case definition should NOT include the hypothesize d exposure of interest . First, the hypothesized exposure may not turn out to be the true exposure, so inclusion of the hypothesized exposure as part of the case definition during the case-finding step may result in missed cases . Second , during the analytic step, disease status and exposure must be determined indepen dently to avoid bias. Includi ng exposure as part of the case definition means that all cases will, by definition, be exposed, while only some of the controls will likely be exposed. As a result, the exposure will appear to be associated with disease, not necessaril y because it is the true exposure, but because of the case definition. 10. A (True). A case definiti on is a decis ion making tool. It provides criteria for classif ying illness as a \"case\" or \"not a case.\" However, few case definitions are 100% accurate, because people with mild or atypical or asymptomatic disease are likely to be missed, and people with similar but not the same disease may be included. Even a case definition that requires a laborato ry test is not 100% perfect, because laboratory tests themselves are not perfect. 11. B (False). On the one hand, case definition s need to be applied consistently, so that everyone involved in an investigation defines a case in the same way. On the other hand, case definiti ons can change during the course of an outbreak. For exam ple, for case finding purposes, a case definition might include categori es such as confirmed, probable , and possible , to try to include as many cases as possible . Later on, in the analytic phase, the case definition may be restricted to the confirmed cases. As anothe r example, a case definition may initially be restricted to a particular community. If the outbreak spreads beyond that geograp hic area, the \"place\" comp onent of the case definit ion also would need to be expanded. 12. A, B, C, D. To identify addition al cases as part of an outbreak investig ation, health department staff conta ct (by telep hone, broadcast fax, or e-mail) physicians' offices, clinics, hospitals, and laboratories. Depending on the affected age group, staff might also contact day care centers , schools, employer s, or nursing homes. Sometimes a press release is issued to local media outlets that inform the public and sugge st that persons with particu lar symptom s or exposures contact their healthc are provider s or health department . In addition , health department staff routinely interview case-patients and ask whether they know any persons with the same exposur e, if known, or with the same illness. 13. A, B, C, D, E. A data collection form for an outbr eak investig ation should include patient identifying informatio name , telephone number) , demograph ic informatio n (e.g., age, sex), clinical information (e.g., date of onset, laboratory confirm ation, whether Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-74 hospital ized), risk facto r inform ation (disease-specific, e.g., attended sports banquet (yes/n o), previously vaccinated?), and information about who collected the data (e.g., interviewer or abstracter initia ls, date of collection). 14. B (False) . Descriptive epidemiol ogy is essential not only for characterizing the pattern and distribution of the outbreak, but also for generating testab le hypotheses about the source, mode of transmiss ion, and risk factors for illness. Two of the suggeste d ways for generating hypotheses are to review the descriptive epide miology, particularly (1) the overall pattern of cases and develo p hypothe ses about what they have in comm on, and (2) the outliers to determine how they might be linked to the other cases. These hypotheses, in turn, are the ones that are tested using analytic epidemi ology. 15a. C. This scenario represe nts an intermittent exposure. The resulting epidemic curve has cases that appear to be occurring sporadica lly, but in fact occur when the malfunction ing heater is turned on at irregula r intervals. 15b. A. This scenario represents a point source exposure. The epidemic curve has a single peak, and all cases occur durin g a single incubat ion period . 15c. D. This scenario represe nts person -to-person transmission. The epidemic curve has a succession of \"waves\" of cases. 16 D. Subtr acting 24 hours (the minim um incubati on perio d) from the time of onset of the first case puts you in the April 20 Dinner interva l. Subtractin g 33 hours from the median case (which occurred in the 4-8 AM interval) on April 22), puts you in the April 20 4-7 pm interval, near both lunch and dinner that day. While the minimum method points to dinner on April 20, thorough investi gators would probably investigate possible exposures at lunch that day, too. 17. A, B, C, D, E. A late case on an epidemic curve has severa l possible explanation s, including a case of a similar but unrelated disease, a secon dary case (assuming it occurs one incub ation period after another case), a case with an unusuall y long incubatio n period, a case that resulted from exposure at a different time (for example, someone who ate leftovers the next day), or an error in recall or in recor ding the date. 18. A, B. A spot map is useful for pinpointing the geograph ic location of exposures , residences, employment sites, and the like. The spots represent occurrences, eithe r of exposure or disease. Spot maps are not used to display rates. Rather, area maps (also called shaded or chloropleth maps) are used to display incidence and prevalence rates. 19. A, B, C, D, E, F. Hypotheses can be generated in a variety of ways. One way is based on subject matter know ledge derived by review ing the literature or talking with expert s - what are the usual causes, sources, vehicles, or modes of transmis sion? Other ways include reviewing the overall pattern and the outliers from the descriptive epidemiology, by asking case-patients if they have any suspic ions about the cause of their illness, and by asking the same questi on of local authorities (if you are from out of town). 20. D. The key feature that characteriz es an analytic (epidem iologic) study is presenc e of a compari son group. Single case reports and case series do not have comp arison groups and are not analytic studies. Cohort studies (compares disease experience among exposed and Investigating an Outbreak Page 6-75 unexposed groups) and case-contro l studies (compares exposure exper ience among persons with and witho ut disease ) have compa rison group s and are analytic studie s. 21. A, B, C, D, E. Disease control meas ures can be directed at the eliminating the agent (e.g., by steril izing surgical equipment), interrupting transmi ssion (e.g., reducing mosquito populati on, covering one's mouth when coughin g), preventi ng entry into a host (e.g., wearing a mask, using insect repella nt), or improving host defenses (e.g., by immuniz ation). 22. A. A retrospective cohor t study is one in which disease has already occur red (hence, retrosp ective) and the investigator enrol ls all (or almost all) of a population (hence, cohort). The investigat or then determines exposures and calculates risks (attack rates) for different exposures and risk ratios (relative risks) for those exposed and unexposed . The study described for Questions 22-25 meets this characteriz ation. 23. D. The meas ure of association recommended for a retrosp ective cohor t study is a risk ratio, calculated as the ratio of the risk of disease among those exposed divided by the risk of disease among those not exposed. The attributable risk percent is a supplemental measure that quantifies how much of the disease could be \"explained \" or accounte d for by a particular expos ure. The chi-square is not a measu re of associati on, but a test of statistical significance (which is affected both by the stren gth of association and number of subjects in the study) . The odds ratio is used primar ily as a measu re of associati on in case-control studies. 24. B. The wedding cake (risk ratio = 45% / 5% = 9.0) is the most likely culprit. It has a high attack rate among the exposed group, a low attack rate among the unexposed group, and can account for 45 out of the 50 cases. The five \"unaccount ed for\" cases are within the range that can be \"expl ained away,\" for example by misreporting (for example, a man takes a bite of his partn er's cake but reports \"no\" for cake because he didn't take a whole piece himself), poor recall, etc. Punch is not associat ed with illness at all (risk ratio = 25% / 25% = 1.0). Sushi has an extremely high attack rate among those exposed (91%), but a relativ ely high attack rate among those unexposed (21%), and most importantly, could only account for 10 of the 50 cases. 25. A, B, C. The results should be communicated to all those who need or want to know, including the concerned family and wedding attendees, local governmental officials, the caterer, the church or facility where the weddi ng was held, et al. The outbreak is also reportable to the state health department, who in turn is likely to report it to CDC. However, local outbrea ks do not need to be reported to the World Health Organ ization.
