We are also a centralized hub for CLL research. Our team of laboratory and clinical-based investigators and physicians offers access to clinical trials of new, promising therapies. Our goal is to have a clinical trial option for patients at every stage of the disease. We offer clinical trials for newly-diagnosed CLL, relapsed/refractory CLL, as well as Richter's syndrome, a condition where CLL turns into an aggressive form of lymphoma. Patients may access a comprehensive range of services specialized for CLL treatment, including: From the time of diagnosis, Dana-Farber offers a personalized CLL risk-assessment, which provides detailed, patient-specific information about an individual's disease and prognosis.
