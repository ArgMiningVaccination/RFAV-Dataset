Moxibustion helps treat: Earwax, a bodily emanation that many of us would rather do without, is actually pretty useful stuff - in small amounts. It serves as a natural cleanser as it moves out of the ear, and tests have shown it has antibacterial and antifungal properties. But for many people, earwax is too much of a good thing. An ear canal plugged up with earwax can cause earaches, infections, and other problems. You can get medical help to remove an earwax blockage or you can take a do-it-yourself approach which is not recommended. Trying to remove the wax with a cotton swab tends to push the earwax back into the ear. Although you can also buy over-the-counter ear drops intended to break up earwax, sometimes the ear drops don't work on their own. A clinician tackles an earwax problem in much the same way as a do-it-yourselfer, but with professional expertise, sophisticated tools and a superior view deep into the ear canal. While each of our locations offer Chinese natural therapies, some services may only be offered at each location on limited days. Please do not hesitate to choose the location more convenient to you and your schedule. Don't be in pain for longer than you have to be.
