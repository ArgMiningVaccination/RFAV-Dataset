The examination(s) must be written by all candidates, including graduates from Canada and those completing their education o utside of Canada. The examination is designed to assess knowledge, skills and abilities required for practice. A passing result on the examination indicates that the candidate has demonstrated the minimal standard of competence. A fail result indicates th at the candidate has not yet demonstrated the minimal standard of competence. The exam ination is administered independently through a consulting firm selected by the Canadian Alliance of Regulatory Bodies for Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists (CARB - TCMPA). This ensures t he exam is administered in a manner that is fair and consistent. Each Pan-Canadian examination consists of two parts: a written and a clinical case -study component. Successfully completing the examination means passing BOTH components. Candidates are required to pass the written component before advancing to take the clinical case -study component . The College also uses the exam ination , in part, to assess candidate 's fluency in English or French. As such, candida tes should ensure that they are reasonably fluent in either language prior to applying for the exam ination . The exam ination is written at a grade 12 reading level. Written Component Length of written examinations The length of the exam ination will depend on which version the candidate is writing: The Pan -Canadian Written Examination for TCM Practitioners .

ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS The College determines whether an individual is eligible to sit the Registration Examinations - Pan- Canadian Examinations. It will consider if you have completed an educational program , supervised clinical experience and have the necessary competenc ies that meet the requirements of the Registration Regulation and the Entry -Level Occupational Competencies for the Practic e of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Can ada. Eligibility for the examination is for the current examination only. The candidate's eligibility to sit for the current examination does not guarantee that the candidate will be eligible to sit subsequent exam inations. The eligibility criteria are subject to change. Below is a detailed description of the examination eligibility requirements. 1. Education Requirements Post -secondary educational requirements to become a member in the General class of registration: To use the title and designation of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner (R. TCMP), you must have successfully completed a post -secondary program in traditional Chinese medicine that consist s of at least four years of full -time education , or education that is of equivalent duration; or To use the title and designation of Acupuncturist (R. Ac), you must have successfully completed a post -secondary program in traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture that consist s of at least three years of full-time education, or education that is of equivalent duration. Full-Time Education The Registration Regulation further defines the full -time education program as a program that annually consists of: At least 480 hours per year of classroom theoretical instruction; or At least 620 hours per year of practical instruction; or Some combination of the two where, for every hour of classroom theoretical instruction that is less than 480 hours, there must be a corresponding increase of 1.3 hours in the number o f hours of practical instruction. Classroom theoretical instruction refers to education/learning which takes place in a classroom or through guided independent study, in which students develop knowledge and thinking skills, and beliefs and values, which enable them to demonstrate relevant Performance Indicators developed based on the Entry -Level Occupational Competencies for t he Practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practice in Canada (May 2010). Practical instruction refers to education, in which students work directly with an experienced practitioner and a simulated patient, to develop hands -on abilities which enable th em to demonstrate CTCMPAO Examination Guide 8 | P a g e relevant Performance Indicators developed based on the Entry -Level Occupational Competencies for the Practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practice in Canada ( May 2010). 2. Supervised Clinical Experience of Direct Patient Contact Successfully complete a program of clinical experience in the profession that is structured, comprehensive, supervised and evaluated and which consists of at least 45 weeks of clinical experience involving 500 hours of direct patient contact. (Ref. s. 9(1), of the Registration Regulation made under the TCM Act ) The clinical supervised experience can be obtained either as a part of an applicant's formal education program or separately, so long as it meets the requi rements. However, if the supervised clinical experience is obtained as a part of an applicant's formal education, the hours of instruction must be in addition to those hours counted towards meeting the educational requirement. In other words, one cannot us e the same hours of instruction to satisfy the formal education requirement and the supervised clinical experience requirement. The clinical supervised experience involves 500 hours of direct patient contact with the individual communicating a traditiona l Chinese medicine diagnosis and/performing acupuncture pursuant to the TCM Act , plus repeated and reliable performance consistent with the required entry -level co mpetencies in a clinical environment with a variety of patients. Direct patient contact experience refers to shared supervised clinical activities or solo supervised clinical activities involving direct patient contact. In supervised clinical training, students work directly with patients in a setting designed to provide patient care. Students must be supervised throughout their clinical education, in a manner that facilitates their development of clinical abilities while ensuring that patient care is sa fe, effective and ethical. Observation hours and simulated practice hours may not be included towards meeting direct patient contact requirements. Clinical observation hours refer to activities where applicants have no active involvement. Simulated pract ice refers to activities using standardized or simulated patients and case conferences with clinical supervisors involving discussions between the applicant and the applicant's clinical supervisor about a specific patient. Applicants who complete formal e ducation in Ontario after proclamation of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Act, which was April 1, 2013, are required to ensure that supervision is performed by qualified members of the College For more information on the clinical experience requirement, please see the College's Supervision Policy. 3. Competency Assessment To ensure you have the required breadth and depth of knowledge, skill and judgement to practise the profession safely and competently, you must pass an assessment conducted by the College . Pursuant to Section 9(1)5 of the Registration Regulation , your completed education program/learning is assessed by the College to identify the extent of the relevance to the Council's approved and published competencies for TCM practice in Canada . Unlike approval of an education program, the assessment focuses on the cumulative competencies you have obtained through formal education and post - graduate and continuing education studies. CTCMPAO Examination Guide 9 | P a g e To assist you with understanding the competency assessment process, the College has developed the Guidelines for Evaluation of Applicant's Traditional Chinese Medici ne and/or Acupuncture Education or a Substantially Equivalent Education Program and Assessment of Competency . These guidelines (which are not requirements) will be used to assess whether you are able to demonstrate alignment with the required entry to pra ctice competencies , through your completed learning/educational program in traditional Chinese medicine. 2019 EXAMINATION SCHEDULE Start of Application: May 1, 2019 Application Deadline: July 2, 2019 (5:00PM EST) Deadline for Special Accommodation Request: July 2 , 2019 (5:00PM EST) Deadline for Withdrawal of Application: July 8 , 2019 (5:00PM EST) *application fee is non -refundable* Date of Written Examination: October 1 9, 2019 Date of Clinical Case -Study Examination: January 18, 2020 EXAMINATION APPLICATION PACKAGE You can find all documents related to the exam on the Pan-Canadian Examination Webpage .

SECURITY Security precautions eliminate unfair advantages among the candidates and avoid the high human/financial costs of replacing examination materials. That is why the strictest security measu res are taken to protect the content of the examination before, during and after the examination. All examination materials are protected by copyright. The regulatory bodies take strict security measures to protect examination materials during all phase s of development and administration including development and review of material, reproduction, transportation and disposal of materials, and administration of material to candidates. Code of Conduct for the Examination Candidates are subject to the Rule s of Conduct as described below. Candidates who contravene the Rules of Conduct may be denied participation, may have results invalidated and/or may be denied CTCMPAO Examination Guide 11 | P a g e admission to the examination. Each candidate, by the act of participating in a Pan -Canadian exami nation, agrees to abide by the following Code of Conduct. 1. Candidates acknowledge that the examination and the items therein are the exclusive property of the regulatory body. 2. Candidates acknowledge that they CANNOT remove any part of the examination from the test site, nor can they give or receive assistance from another candidate during the examination. 3. Candidates acknowledge that their behaviour before, during and after the examination must be such that it does not disturb other candidates. This includ es unnecessary questioning of examination policies and procedures, disruptive comments about the examination or other behaviour that, in the opinion of the examination invigilators, could cause anxiety for other candidates. 4. Candidates acknowledge that their participation in any act of cheating, as described below, may be sufficient cause for the regulatory body to terminate their participation, to invalidate the results of their examination or to take any other necessary action. 5. Cheati ng refers to any act or omission by a candidate that could affect the result of that candidate, another candidate or a potential future candidate. These acts include: a) non-eligible individuals posing as eligible candidates; b) bringing study or reference mate rials to the test area; c) giving or receiving assistance to or from another candidate during the examination; d) removing or attempting to remove examination material by any means, electronic or otherwise, from the testing site; and e) receiving or giving informat ion about the written component or the clinical component either before or after1 the examination.

Note: this includes discussing exam ination items or other information about the examination with examiners or other candidates after the examinations . Protocol in the Event of Suspected Cheating 1. If the examiners and/or examination invigilators suspect that cheating may have occurred, they may confiscate a candidate's test materials, as well as other documents or objects or materials that could be used for cheating, and require the candidate or other person(s) to leave the examination site. The regulatory body reserves the right to photograp h candidates or groups of candidates for later use as evidence and to use monitoring and surveillance technologies to detect and document cheating. 2. Candidates may be asked to change their seats during the examination if they are suspected of cheating. 1 Debriefing increases the understanding of examination. Information gained in debriefing could act as an unfair advantage to unsuccessful candidates on future examinations. Confidentiality of information should be considered in the same way as confidentiality of pati ent information; the duty to maintain confidentiality is continuous. CTCMPAO Examination Guide 12 | P a g e 3. The examiners and/or the examination invigilators shall report any suspected cheating to the registrar or designate (herein known as the \"Head Invigilator\"). 4. The Head Invigilator shall conduct appropriate investigations of the alleged cheating and shall make one of the following decisions: Declare that the occurrence of cheating was not established; Declare that cheating did occur. 5. If the Head Invigilator declares that the occurrence of cheating was not established, the candidate's score shall be r eleased, if possible, or the candidate shall be permitted to sit the next available examination without charge. 6. Cheating may be declared at any time after a candidate has registered and includes the time after the examination as well as after results have been released. 7. If the Head Invigilator declares that cheating did occur, one or more of the following may occur. The candidate will be deemed to have failed the examination. The Head Invigilator shall report findings to the regulatory body. The candidate may be prosecuted. The College may deny further access to the examination. SCORING Setting the Passing Score: Written and Clinical Case -Study Examinations Marking the Examination: Written Component The computer answer sheets are electronically scanned and scored. It is very important that these answer sheets are filled out correctly. Quality control reports and checks are done during and after marking to ensure accuracy. Each multiple -choice question is worth one point. A correct answer receives a score of one point and an incorrect answer receives a score of zero. There is no penalty for incorrect or blank responses. If you are not certain, select your best option. The passing score for the examination is set by the Examination C ommittee using the modified Angoff method. The modified Angoff method is one of the most widely used and accepted methods for establishing the passing score in registration/licensure examinations. The modified Angoff method requires each member of the comm ittee to independently rate each question on the examination in terms of the minimally competent candidate. The minimally competent candidate can be conceptualized as the candidate possessing the minimum level of knowledge and skills necessary to perform a t a registration/licensure level. To do the rating, the committee members ask themselves \"what percentage of minimally competent candidates will answer this question correctly?\" The ratings from all members are then collated and tabulated to achieve the av erage rating per item. These ratings are then averaged to obtain the passing score for the total examination. A candidate's total score is computed using the total number of correct answers selected by the candidate. The total score is compared to the pas sing score to designate their pass/fail status. The status of \"pass\" is reported for candidates whose total score meets or exceeds the passing score; the status of \"fail\" is reported for candidates whose total score is below the passing score. CTCMPAO Examination Guide 13 | P a g e Marking the Examination: Clinical Case -Study Component Each case -study examination situation, depending on the components of the question, will be scored on a scale ranging from 0 (no understanding of the problem) to 4 points (complete response). The final mark for a candidate is simply the sum of all score points for the clinical case -study questions. The passing score for the examination is set by the Examination Committee using the extended Angoff method. Instea d of asking participants to estimate the probability of a correct response on a multiple - choice question, the participants will be asked to indicate the score a minimally competent candidate would obtain out of the maximum points allowed for the question. Thus, the passing score for the exam is the average rating of all the participants' standard -setting responses. Examination Results A candidate must pass both the written and clinical case -study components of the examination to be considered for registra tion as a TCM Practitioner or Acupuncturist. Results will NOT be given over the telephone or by fax for reasons of confidentiality. The time to return results to candidates may vary; however, it will take approximately 4 weeks to return the results of the written component and 6 weeks to return the results of the clinical case -study component .
