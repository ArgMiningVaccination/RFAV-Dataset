In July, we heard that a new \"College of Medicine\" was to arise from its ashes. It seemed clear [from the people involved](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263) that the name \"College of Medicine\" would be deceptive. Now the College of Medicine has materialised, and it is clear that one's worst fears were well justified. At first sight, it looks entirely plausible and well-meaning. Below the logo [one reads](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/about-college-medicine) \"There is a new force in medicine. A force that brings patients, doctors, nurses and other health professionals together, instead of separating them into tribes.\" \"That force is the new College of Medicine. Uniquely, it brings doctors and other health professionals together with patients and scientists.\" It is apparent from the outset that the well-meaning words fall into the trap described so clearly by James May (see [What 'holistic' really means](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3095)). It fails to distinguish between curing and caring. As always, the clue lies not in the words, but in the people who are running it. Who is involved? After a bit of digging on the web site, you find the names of the people on the [Science Council of the \"College of Medicine\"](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/science-council), The preamble says \"Good medicine must be grounded in good science as well as compassion. The College's Science Council brings a depth of knowledge from many senior figures.\" But then come the names. With the odd exception the \"science council\" is like a roll-call of quacks, the dregs left over from the Prince's Foundation.

There are a few gaps in this table, to be filled in soon. One can guarantee that a great deal more will appear about the College on the web, very soon. The [Governing Council of the College](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/governing-council) is equally replete with quacks (plus a few surprising names). It has on it, for example, a spiritual healer (Angie-Buxton King), a homeopath (Christine Glover), a herbalist (Michael McIntyre). Westminster University's king of woo (David Peters), not to mention the infamous [Karol Sikora](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Karol+Sikora%22). Buxton-King [offers a remarkable service](#abk1) to heal people or animals at a distance. Meanwhile, it seemed worthwhile to provide a warning that the title of the College is very deceptive. It hides an agenda that could do much harm. It is, quite simply, the Prince of Wales by stealth. Follow-up 28 October 2010 Professor Sir Graeme Catto, who has, disgracefully, allowed his name to be used as president of this \"College\" has said to me \"There are real problems in knowing how to care for folk with chronic conditions and the extent of the evidence base for medicine is pretty limited\". Yes of course that is quite true. There are many conditions for which medicine can still do little. There is a fascinating discussion to be had about how best to care for them. The answer to that is NOT to bring in spiritual healers and peddlers of sugar pills to deceive patients with their fairy stories. The \"College of Medicine\" will delay and pervert the sort of discussion that Catto says, rightly, is needed. 29 October 2010 I need a press card. I see that the BMJ also had a piece about the \"College of Medicine\" yesterday: [Prince's foundation metamorphoses into new College of Medicine](http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c6126.full), by Nigel Hawkes. He got the main point right there in the title. As was [clear since July](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263), the driving force was Michael Dixon, Devon GP and ex medical director of the Prince's Foundation. Hawkes goes easy on the homeopaths and spiritual healers, but did spot something that I can't find on their web site. The \"Faculties\" will include \"in 2011, neuromusculoskeletal care. Two of the six strong faculty members for this specialty are from the British Chiropractic Association, which sued the author Simon Singh for libel for his disobliging remarks about the evidence base for their interventions.\" The College certainly picks its moment to endorse chiropractic, a subject that is in chaos and disgrace after they lost the Singh affair. One bit of good news emerges from Hawkes' piece, There is at least one high profile doubter in the medical establishment, Lord (John) Walton (his 2000 report on CAM was less than blunt, and has been widely misquoted by quacks) is reported as saying, at the opening ceremony \"I'm here as a sceptic, and I've just told my former houseman that,\" he said. The target of the remark was Donald Irvine, another former GMC president and a member of the new college's advisory council.\" 31 October 2010. I got an email that pointed out a remarkable service offered by a member of College's [Governing Council](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/governing-council). Angie Buxton-King, a \"spiritual healer\" employed by UCLH seems to have another web site, [The Beacon of Healing Light](http://www.angiebuxton-king.com/) that is not mentioned in [her biography](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/angie-buxton-king) on the College's site. Perhaps it should have been because it makes some remarkable claims. The [page about distant healing](http://www.angiebuxton-king.com/Distant_Healing.php) is the most bizarre. Absent Healing/Distant Healing \"Absent healing is available when it is not possible to visit the patient or it is not possible for the patient to be brought to our healing room. This form of healing has proved to be very successful for humans and animals alike.\" \"We keep a healing book within our healing room and every night spend time sending healing to all those who have asked for it. We have found that if a picture of the patient is sent to us the healing is more beneficial, we also require a weekly update to monitor any progress or change in the patients situation. Donations are welcome for this service.\" I wonder what the Advertising Standards people make of the claim that it is \"very successful\"? I wonder what the president of the College makes of it? I've asked him. Other blogs about the \"College of Medicine\" 30 October 2010. Margaret McCartney is always worth reading. As a GP she is at the forefront of medicine. She's written about the College in [The Crisis in Caring and dangerous inference](http://www.margaretmccartney.com/blog/?p=801). She's also provided some information about a \"professional member\" of the [College of Medicine](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/dr-sam-everington), in [..and on Dr Sam Everington, at the Bromley by Bow Centre....](http://www.margaretmccartney.com/blog/?p=803) It is one of the more insulting things about alternative medicine addicts that they claim to be the guardians of caring (as opposed to curing), They are not, and people like McCartney and Michael Baum are excellent examples. Prince of Wales to become honorary president of the \"College of Medicine?\" Last night I heard a rumour that the Prince of Wales is, despite all the earlier denials, to become Honorary President of the \"College\". If this is true, it completes the wholesale transformation of the late, unlamented, Prince's Foundation for Integrated Medicine into this new \"College\". Can anybody take it seriously now? Text messages to Graeme Catto and Michael Dixon, inviting them to deny the rumour, have met with silence. Herbal nonsense at the College 29 July 2011. I got an email from the College if Medicine [ [download it](http://www.dcscience.net/COM-Self-care.pdf)].

They are known on Twitter as [@thetismercurio](http://twitter.com/#!/ThetisMercurio) and [@lovelyhorse_](http://twitter.com/#!/lovelyhorse_). Steiner Waldorf Free Schools - 'Do we have to mention Steiner, or Anthroposophy?' At the time of writing we are aware of 16 Steiner Waldorf schools and new initiatives in the UK applying for or publicly expressing interest in Free School Funding. The established schools are: [Brighton](http://www.brightonsteinerschool.org.uk/survey.php)Steiner School [Cambridge](http://www.cambridge-steiner-school.co.uk/home/press_release_june_2010.html)Steiner School [Bruton](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/BHTCDFD), Somerset [Michael Langley](http://www.rsskl.org/information/state-funding.aspx), Hertfordshire School, School, [Islington](http://www.stpaulssteinerschool.org/school-fairs.html) [Cragg Vale](Cragg Vale, near Bridge, West Yorkshire & use this link), near Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire The umbrella organisation for Steiner Waldorf schools in the UK is the [Steiner Waldorf Schools Fellowship](http://www.steinerwaldorf.org.uk/). The Chief Executive Director of the SWSF is [Christopher Clouder ](http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:23zX02qe6EQJ:ecswe.net/wren/documents/christoph_clouder_info.pdf+christopher+clouder&hl=en&gl=uk&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESgesW2mtTLcHN6uLfLd8yKwk7edHJuwkWsFlxn-xpsKPNRS_-sp2eoe8lgQYDmkxtQa9Cg5RgzsiVwlXixua4MyxfFyOABCn3NPT5LXHSU-cnjbBCltK_VpYyQ-L-FNng0P2RQ_&sig=AHIEtbQ569s0aLuTCybUjH5V4ABFOUwRAA) but another prominent figure is Development Director Sylvie Sklan. As representatives of the SWSF they have been the plausible public face of Anthroposophy, working for many years within the establishment to create the conditions for wholesale public funding of Steiner Waldorf schools in the UK. As pragmatists they see Michael Gove's Free Schools Initiative as the Movement's big chance. We will take you into the woods to show how the Steiner edifice of nonsense has been obscured by smoke and mirrors. A government report indicates the truth, but the schools themselves are reluctant to share their Special Knowledge. Into the Woods. A government report, and a very special inspection service There is no independent evidence to support the pedagogy of Steiner Waldorf education. But supporting the funding of the Steiner Academy Hereford, the only state funded Steiner school to date (created under New Labour), is a government report from 2005, The [Woods Report](http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:-lyXLvdNp2MJ:www.dcsf.gov.uk/research/data/uploadfiles/RR645.pdf+woods+report+steiner&hl=en&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESjAZKS-g0seAudC6MQMQK8epdnNkWZ29lt6S_gYVfydd5dpCwaRZUHRuuq_iab5rjHVkCp1x3ETTEtQ-dIyY3zgq4U0nXIidJHJ2Ik7pwqySsQXAhqRHADLqV1uczf_yuOdMYT2&sig=AHIEtbTtG0XmPsqHEfH3e1WKfWK3p3QDgg) 'Steiner Schools in England'. Mike Collins of UK Anthroposophy, home to some meticulous investigative work, demonstrates how the Woods Report describes Steiner Waldorf as [Anthroposophical education. ](http://ukanthroposophy.wordpress.com/2009/03/13/steiner-education-anthroposophical-education-official/) In fact the Report's authors are unusually candid about the occult nature of Steiner schools. They also, elsewhere, make no secret of their own [ immersion in the 'spiritual'](http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a739516787) assuming a common understanding of that ambiguous word, a word which is rarely defined. But whether or not they are themselves to any degree adherents of Anthroposophy, they [clearly believe](http://www.wwwords.co.uk/pdf/freetoview.asp?j=forum&vol=48&issue=3&year=2006&article=13_Woods_FORUM_48_3_web) that education would benefit from Steiner's spiritual vision, stating in the Forum Journal in 2006: \"The point is that Steiner education offers a distinctive process of opening and nurturing children and educating the whole child in the twenty-first century.\" There is, in the Woods Report, an elaboration of the pivotal role of karma and reincarnation [p93] a description of the use of 'temperaments' to classify children [p89] and of the variance in the precise nature of allegiance to Anthroposophy amongst teachers [p94] (as observed in our first post: reflecting the nature of an esoteric religion). But 'Steiner says' is nevertheless the dominant code: \"Steiner's lectures are referred to and teachers constantly update themselves on the pedagogical principles outlined by Steiner, testing these in the practice of collegial discussion.\" [p105]\" This should be no surprise: \"Steiner education takes a particular perspective and entails a set of practices which relate to each other in order to give Steiner schools their character. These include the role of the teacher understood as a sacred task in helping each child's soul and spirit grow, which underpins the commitment to each pupil and is the basis of sustaining the class teacher-pupil relationship over eight years\" [p120] This may strike the reader as rather an unusual educational aim, especially if a school is not formally classed as a 'faith' or religious school. Would it not take sophistry to maintain that this is not an essentially religious impulse? (It does. p97/125/129) But we must remember that we are handicapped by our ignorance of Spiritual Science. The clue is given by one of the Steiner teachers quoted, who suggests what is needed is to: \"communicate to [the] wider educational community that in essence Steiner education is a spiritual approach beyond religion\" [p116] To do them justice, in other published work the Woods are cautious, although this problem strikes us as inevitable: \"None of this should be taken to mean that Steiner schools achieve their ideals or are entirely without their flaws. Many teachers, in our view, are too dependent on following the guidance and ideas of Steiner as if they were 'sacred' directions.\" 'In Harmony with the child': Philip A Woods & Glenys J Woods: Forum 48/3 2006 The [Woods Report](http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:-lyXLvdNp2MJ:www.dcsf.gov.uk/research/data/uploadfiles/RR645.pdf+woods+report+steiner&hl=en&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESjAZKS-g0seAudC6MQMQK8epdnNkWZ29lt6S_gYVfydd5dpCwaRZUHRuuq_iab5rjHVkCp1x3ETTEtQ-dIyY3zgq4U0nXIidJHJ2Ik7pwqySsQXAhqRHADLqV1uczf_yuOdMYT2&sig=AHIEtbTtG0XmPsqHEfH3e1WKfWK3p3QDgg) ignores the consequences for children of teachers' adherence to the anthroposophical belief in karma and reincarnation. It is obvious that the potential for harm has not been recognised, nor taken seriously by those who should have read the Report. Instead it has been accepted that because the pedagogy is 'spiritual' it must be good: and the Hereford Academy has been handed funds, allowed exemptions (including the freedom to teach Steiner's 'Goethean science') and stands as the precedent for further expansion of Steiner Waldorf into the State sector. What kind of barmpottery would be too extreme for the Woods? The fact that Glenys Woods maintains she is a Reiki Healer ( [Angelic and Atlantaen](http://www.facebook.com/pages/HEALING-INTERNATIONAL/263019755340?v=feed&story_fbid=343968875340)) suggests that her beliefs about what is real would seem extravagant to those working within even the most complex and nuanced concepts of modern neuroscience. The [Woods Report](http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:-lyXLvdNp2MJ:www.dcsf.gov.uk/research/data/uploadfiles/RR645.pdf+woods+report+steiner&hl=en&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESjAZKS-g0seAudC6MQMQK8epdnNkWZ29lt6S_gYVfydd5dpCwaRZUHRuuq_iab5rjHVkCp1x3ETTEtQ-dIyY3zgq4U0nXIidJHJ2Ik7pwqySsQXAhqRHADLqV1uczf_yuOdMYT2&sig=AHIEtbTtG0XmPsqHEfH3e1WKfWK3p3QDgg) suggests that Anthroposophy should be better understood by educationalists and parents; the writers clearly believe that, as a spiritual entity, it is of value. But they also attempt to diffuse the presence of Anthroposophy by stating that the \"curriculum is not designed to guide and encourage young people into becoming adherents of anthroposophy...\" [p120] which may appear to lessen the obligation to know what it is. When we are told the disingenuous line: 'Anthroposophy is not taught to the children\", we should not forget that it is not explained to prospective parents either, even if there may be a few (ill-attended & bewildering) study groups for parents who have already joined. It isn't explained to the government officials who anyway appear so incurious, or to taxpayers. We have none of us earned the right to the Movement's Special Knowledge. But Ofsted understands this. It knows it is not qualified. As of September 2009 Steiner schools in the UK have been inspected not by Ofsted, who used to do so but by the [Schools Inspection Service](http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/Ofsted-home/Publications-and-research/Browse-all-by/Education/Providers/Independent-schools/Annual-report-letter-on-the-quality-of-the-inspections-and-reports-by-the-School-Inspection-Service-SIS/(language)/eng-GB). The SIS inspects only two types of schools: those run by the [Exclusive Brethren](http://barthsnotes.wordpress.com/2007/06/24/exclusive-brethren-schools-in-the-news/) and now Steiner Waldorf. The lay Inspectors in each case are expected to understand the distinct character of the schools. In the case of Steiner Waldorf, they have all been connected in some way with Steiner schools or with the Anthroposophical Movement. Ofsted, which we believe feels unqualified to understand the pedagogy, has effectively allowed Steiner Waldorf schools greater powers to inspect themselves. Free school funding relies on these inspections: the results of which are rather more positive under the new regime. The Hereford Steiner Academy - the Academy nobody wanted. The only state funded Steiner school in the UK has already caused controversy. [Francis Beckett](http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2008/mar/10/schools.uk2) wrote in the Guardian in 2008 that former director of education Eddie Oram had turned down initial plans submitted on his watch because \"he did not think the Steiner staff had the right expertise to deal with pupils with individual needs.\" Oram's proof of evidence: to the Public Inquiry for the original applications by the DCSF to build a new school for the Steiner Academy, is comprehensive. There is no need, no desire and no justification for such a school in Herefordshire, especially in the village of Much Dewchurch. The Project Lead for the DCSF, sponsoring the Academy, was the Rev. Mark Evans, a church of England priest on secondment to the Department. His proof of evidence glowed with praise for Dr. Steiner: \"The outcomes of this education can be seen in the quiet confidence of its pupils, their balanced approach to life and their capacity for innovative thinking.\" But the Rev. Evans produced no evidence for this assertion, nor did he mention karma, or reincarnation. This seems a significant omission; he was in all probability unaware of the nature of the pedagogy he was selling. The Hereford Steiner Academy site does mentions Anthroposophy, although to find it involves [a little searching](http://www.steineracademyhereford.eu/index.php/teacher/the-teachers-experience). The assertion that \"Anthroposophy is a developing body of research\", as stated here by Hereford, should rightly be disputed. Essentially Anthroposophy is dogma; gained through 'clairvoyance', inherited by studying Steiner's words, comprehended by those ascending the ladder of esoteric Knowledge. But something has to be said about it, now the Movement is forced to do so. The Steiner Academy followed one of the recommendations of the Woods Report: unusually for a Steiner school it has a Principal, [Trevor Mepham](http://herefordshire.greatbritishlife.co.uk/article/learning-to-live-with-one-another-14123/). In a long exposition to 'Herefordshire Life' on the nature of Steiner Waldorf education, Mepham misses the chance to satisfy another of the Woods Report's suggestions: he doesn't explain, by name, the system's fundamental credo. Free School Hopefuls The current group of Steiner Free School hopefuls vary in their willingness to discuss Anthroposophy. As an example, on the website of the Norwich Steiner School Anthroposophy is not mentioned, although in reality it is never absent. The Norwich [curriculum policy](http://www.norwichsteinerschool.co.uk/documents_files/school_curriculum_policy.pdf) describes the pedagogy without mentioning its [essence](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XVvQI0-5W1QC&printsec=frontcover&dq=rudolf+steiner+the+incarnating&source=bl&ots=54_w1AvyKh&sig=XyYixLaGh1ra79SC4YjG-thnQv8&hl=en&ei=utO9TNTuKJDQjAfZ09SPAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAg%23v=onepage&q&f=false) but we catch stray glimpses of angelic forms. So, a moral aim is to cultivate 'reverence' for nature, the children stand not in a doorway but on a 'threshold' and 'The narrative thread for Ancient civilisations often begins with the fall of [Atlantis](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QOIK9hiTBeYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=rudolf+steiner+atlantis&source=bl&ots=bxahmpDqHU&sig=aKHExKTnYAACtXrsGU2Qk4JW_O0&hl=en&ei=NO-9TNviJ9O7jAeWldC_Ag&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAg%23v=onepage&q&f=false)'. In the March 2010 newsletter from Norwich ('Talking Trees') there is an observation by a class teacher which exemplifies the Steiner Waldorf attitude to less spiritual forms of education: \"I look at the children in Oak Class and see a luminosity that cannot be measured. When we do measure children, we diminish that luminosity. The world seems to be full of children whose inner light has been subdued, if not entirely extinguished.\" There is at the time of writing no mention of Anthroposophy on the website of the Rudolf Steiner School [South Devon](http://sites.google.com/a/steiner-south-devon.org/www/home3), except towards the end of the parents' handbook. Although this is hard for outsiders to find, the handbook's author still neglects to describe karma and reincarnation and includes the unusual proviso that this is 'not a cult'. South Devon has stated on its site: \"The department [DofE] appears to be impressed by our application, in particular what they call our \"strong educational vision\". But before they can proceed to the next step they have asked to see stronger evidence of demand for Steiner education in the area, including from those outside the school community. They would prefer this to be in the form of a petition.\" Many of those who have agreed to sign the South Devon petition have done so in ignorance of even the name of the 'philosophy' that is so vital to the school, imagining that their plausible description of Steiner Waldorf is sufficient. In a ' [circle meeting](http://www.steiner-south-devon.org/MinutesofMandateCircle22ndMay2008.pdf)' held at the South Devon School in 2008, found on the web, someone even asks the question: \"Do we need to mention Steiner, or Anthroposophy?\" It's hard to lose the guru's name without changing all the signs. But surely local people might be put off if they understood how the education at this school is intimately informed by the clairvoyant visions of the Mystic Barmpot. We've screenshot the site, in case there are any alterations. This concern about mentioning Anthroposophy is driven by a fear that an undercurrent of critical analysis will become mainstream. Critics We trust we presented in our [previous post](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3528) a description of Steiner Waldorf Education that identifies the intrinsic role of Anthroposophy, making the system and its flaws intelligible, but we are not suggesting that our observations are original. Not only have there been comprehensive posts about Steiner schools on the popular political blog [Liberal Conspiracy](http://liberalconspiracy.org/2009/07/23/pseudoscience-is-not-a-valid-educational-choice/) (with much additional material from Unity, including the 5 Big Ideas of science that Steiner education can't handle); there has been in the last few years an international stream of criticism from those who have experienced Waldorf pedagogy and its effects on families. Ex-parents, students and teachers of Steiner Waldorf schools have appeared on-line, seeking answers; making sense of their own distressing experiences, expressing bewilderment and anger and frequently offering support to others. Their words appear on blogs, on internet forums and in the press in some countries, although no UK journalist has so far grasped the significance of their [warnings.](http://www.mumsnet.com/ReportTalkPost?topicid=43&threadid=713603&msgid=14807983) What should be reiterated is that it is difficult to make sense of an esoteric (hidden) philosophy in action, even if you have chosen to be involved at its aesthetically pleasing outer edges. For many parents, Waldorf is a form of [bait and switch](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=156). mumsnet: \"You don't expect a school to lie,\" In the New Schools Network [document](http://newschoolsnetwork.org/assets/events/files/First_Steps_Guide_Sept10.pdf) cited in our previous post, Free School hopefuls are advised how to advertise their projects: \"Post something on mumsnet, netmums, or facebook.\" If the NSN had done their homework, they would know that mumsnet Steiner threads have been so controversial (and incomprehensible to those not involved) that in 2008 parents were asked by mumsnet's co-founder Justine Roberts [not to post](http://www.mumsnet.com/ReportTalkPost?topicid=1374&threadid=562904&msgid=11503224) about Steiner education at all. Indeed the forum was threatened with legal action by [Sune Nordwall, ](http://www.thebee.se/indexeng.htm)(also known as Thebee, Tizian, Excalibur, Mycroft etc) a Swedish anthroposophist; since discovered to be in the employment of the Swedish Waldorf School Federation. Blogger Alicia Hamberg aka [zooey](http://zooey.wordpress.com/2010/05/29/supervising-the-attacks/) quotes (in translation): \"In England, the attacks on [waldorf] pedagogy have led to parents withdrawing their children from the waldorf schools. The [ [Swedish Waldorf School] Federation]has employed Sune on a part-time basis to monitor the debate.\" We do not suggest on this blog that the Swedish Waldorf School Federation are responsible for or complicit in Nordwall's activities on mumsnet or elsewhere, although as Alicia Hamberg points out, they have not sought to distance themselves from his behaviour. What is notable though is that representatives of Waldorf education in Sweden were concerned to monitor a UK debate held not in the press but in the relative obscurity of the supposedly safe, supportive world of mothers' chatrooms. The Steiner Waldorf movement understands the importance of a positive profile on the UK's most influential meeting place for parents; the very people who form their customer base. But their tactics are counterintuitive. In anthro-speak everywhere, critics, the majority of whom are parents who have had children in Steiner schools, become attackers. Even the Steiner Waldorf Schools Fellowship's Communications Officer Jeremy Smith felt drawn to issue a [call-to-arms](http://www.steinerwaldorf.org/downloads/newsletter/2009SpringNewsletter.pdf) to rebuff those who dared to question Waldorf's 'good intentions': \"I would be very grateful if teachers and parents who share these concerns would be willing to join me in posting replies to anti-Waldorf threads in an attempt to give a more accurate picture to the outside world of what Steiner education is all about. We are also co-ordinating this internationally through the European Council for Steiner Waldorf Education. Please contact me at [smithj@rsskl.org]if you are interested in becoming involved.\" We invite them to answer us here, instead. Stockholm University: \"scientifically unacceptable... simply untrue\" There are other interesting comparisons with Sweden. A recent announcement that UK Free Schools will not be required to employ [qualified teachers](http://www.nurseryworld.co.uk/news/bulletin/NurseryWorldUpdate/article/1029724/?DCMP=EMC-CONNurseryWorldUpdate) indicates that the UK is traveling in the opposite direction to Sweden which, in an attempt to [raise standard](http://www.thelocal.se/29676/20101018/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter)s has just introduced more stringent teacher training requirements for all its schools, including Waldorf (the state funding of which pre-dates Sweden's own Free Schools experiment). Swedish Waldorf schools will have to apply for exemptions from these guidelines (as well as from new requirements regarding early years literacy and numeracy), since there are no university accredited Waldorf teacher training courses in Sweden. Indeed the aspirations of Swedish anthroposophists suffered a blow in 2008 when Stockholm University closed the Waldorf teacher training courses in the Institute of Education it had recently taken over. The VC of Stockholm, [K\u00e5re Bremer](http://rektorsblogg.su.se/2008/08/25/waldorfutbildningen/), agreed with his Education Faculty that the Waldorf literature did not satisfy the University's standards of \"scientific validity\" and that \"Some of the content is not only scientifically unacceptable, it is [simply untrue](http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=sv&u=http://blogs-test.it.su.se/kbrem/Utbildning/kbrem-opRH2Vg6&ei=Nji8TL75JdXH4gbdru3lDQ&sa=X&oi=translate&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CB8Q7gEwAQ&prev=/search%253Fq%253DI%252Bden%252Bl%2525C3%2525A4rarutbildning%252Bsom%252Buniversitetet%252Btagit%252B%2525C3%2525B6ver%252Bav%252BL%2525C3%2525A4rarh%2525C3%2525B6gskolan%252Bing%2525C3%2525A5r%252Bocks%2525C3%2525A5%252Butbildning%252Bav%252Bwaldorfl%2525C3%2525A4rare.%252BKursplanen%252Boch%252Bkurslitteraturen%252Bhar%252Bdiskuterats%252Boch%252Bgranskats%252Bav%252BL%2525C3%2525A4rarutbildningsn%2525C3%2525A4mnden%252Brespektive%252BNaturvetenskapliga%252Bfakultetsn%2525C3%2525A4mnden.%2526hl%253Den%2526safe%253Doff%2526client%253Dsafari%2526rls%253Den%2526prmd%253Div).\" Alicia Hamberg described the [ensuing outcry](http://zooey.wordpress.com/2008/10/08/university-of-stockholm-dumps-waldorf-teacher-training-program/) from the Waldorf community; quoting the dean of the faculty of natural sciences and professor of bio-chemistry, Stefan Nordlund, who stated in a Swedish newspaper article: \"In parts, the students' course literature is not simply unscientific. It is in fact dangerous, and it conveys misconceptions which are worse than muddled. We are supported by the department of natural sciences as well as the department of humanities in taking this position.\" A relaxation of teaching qualifications here in the UK is essential if Steiner Free Schools are to be given the green-light, since the UK's only Steiner BA and the Foundation Course in Steiner Early Years education at the University of Plymouth are also closing. Plymouth's new VC, Prof Wendy Purcell, herself a scientist, can claim credit for ejecting the Mystic Barmpot from her faculty of education. It is certainly true that the course didn't attract sufficient numbers to be viable, even though it appears that Steiner trainee teachers were supported by the beneficence of a ' [godparents anthroposophical training fund](http://gatf.org.uk/downloads/GATFAnnualReport20092010.pdf).' Mike Collins posted a fascinating investigative report into the [Plymouth closures](http://ukanthroposophy.wordpress.com/2009/11/06/plymouth-university-axes-steiner-ba/) in November last year. At the time of writing this, a representative of the University told us that they have no plans to reintroduce Steiner teacher training. However: in a plot twist which links both countries, it is not Stockholm University (which had rejected their Steiner courses for being unscientific) but the University of Plymouth which is accrediting a [European Masters Programme ](http://steinerhogskolan.se/masters/integrated-masters-programme/)in Eurythmy, described as an anthroposophical 'dance form': in collaboration with Rudolf Steiner University College J\u00e4rna, 50 km South of Stockholm. Except that Rudolf Steiner College, J\u00e4rna is not regarded as a university college by the Swedish National Agency for Higher Education, nor can it issue formally recognized degrees. We do not imagine that anyone at Plymouth outside the dwindling Steiner BA is familiar with eurythmy, or its therapeutic arm, curative eurythmy. One of the aims of the European Masters course is: \"to place Eurythmy in the context of modern education,\" but this can only apply to [Waldorf.](http://www.eurythmyassociation.org.uk/index.php?id=4) Eurythmy is a physical expression of Rudolf Steiner's anthroposophical image of the relationship between the 'spirit' and the physical worlds. It is steeped in the supernatural. Of course what is happening in reality as participants sway and dash is not exactly what eurythmists imagine is happening, as anyone familiar with CAM will [understand](http://www.hermeshealth.co.uk/euryth.htm). But an intention clearly exists. Once again, in Steiner Waldorf schools, there is that anthroposophical concern for the 'incarnating' child. As Steiner [told his teachers](http://www.webcitation.org/5tZZfl0kC): \"You cannot teach anthroposophy directly to children but they can do eurythmy. And they will face life in quite a different way than if they didn't do eurythmy.\" From \"Times of Expectation: New Forms of Ancient Beauty out of the World of the Spirit.\" Lecture, Dornach, 7th October 1914 (final section). Steiner introduces eurythmy to the anthroposophists Where are the teachers to come from for these new UK Steiner Free Schools?

Rawlings was for many years a pupil at a New York Waldorf school, so he's familiar with how it feels to be inside the system. His pages on [Karma](http://sites.google.com/site/waldorfwatch/karma), central to Steiner's doctrines, as well as those on the background to Waldorf's distinct attitude to [Special Educational Needs ](http://sites.google.com/site/waldorfwatch/abnormal)(including the use of Curative Eurythmy) are particularly instructive. Steiner Waldorf - \"We must worm our way through\" Steiner Waldorf Schools all over the UK are applying for Free School funding. Millions could be diverted from local schools to support them. The decision to fund lies ultimately with the Secretary of State. We have every reason to believe that he is now personally aware of Anthroposophy, even of the critical role of karma and reincarnation within Steiner schools and the content of the course literature that forms a central part of Steiner Waldorf teacher training courses. We would like to ask him: who would be served by the funding of these schools? We do not believe it can be the children, or the families (many involved with hopeful, small initiatives) who do not understand what Steiner education really is. So, Mr Gove: cui bono? \"We must worm our way through...[I]n order to do what we want to do, at least, it is necessary to talk with the people, not because we want to, but because we have to, and inwardly make fools of them.\" Rudolf Steiner, Conferences with Teachers of the Waldorf School in Stuttgart, vol.1, 1919 to 1920 Forest Row, East Fellowship Publications, 1986 [pp. 125] Follow-up Very sorry to see that the University of Aberdeen is running what seems to be a very [dubious Steiner course](http://zooey.wordpress.com/2010/11/28/university-of-aberdeens-steiner-course/). The proposals made here are intended to improve postgraduate education with little harm to undergraduate education and no extra cost. It is not intended to get the government off the hook when it comes to funding of either teaching or research.

It was published today [in The Times](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/article2762731.ece), in a 500 word version that was skilfully shortened by Times journalist, Robbie Millen [download [print version](/Times-thundere-paper-version-121010.pdf)] . It made the Thunderer column (page 22) It was written before I had seen the Browne report on University finance, Comments on that will be added in the [follow-up](#follow). Honours degrees have had their day Universities have problems. The competition for research money is already intense in the extreme, and many excellent research applications get turned down. Vice-chancellors want students to pay huge fees. A financial crisis looms. It is time for a rethink the entire university system. The traditional honours degree has had its day The UK's honours degree system is a relic left over from the time when a tiny fraction of the population went to university. The aim is now for half the population to get some sort of higher education, and the old system doesn't work. It tries to get children from school to the level where they can start research in only three years. Even in its heyday it often failed to do that. Now teachers in vastly bigger third year classes try to teach quite advanced stuff to students most of whom have long since decided that they don't want to do research. It's just as well they decided that, because academia doesn't have jobs for half the population. The research funding system is strained to breaking point Vince Cable's cockup over the amount of money spent on mediocre science has long since been corrected But despite the intense competition for research funds, anyone who listens to Radio 4's Today Programme (I do), or reads the Daily Mail (I don't) might get the impression that some pretty trivial research gets published. One reason for this is that science reporters always prefer the simple and trivial to basic research. But another reason is that the system places enormous pressure to publish vast amounts. Quantity matters more than quality. The Research Assessment Exercise determines the funds that a university gets from government, and although started with the best of intentions, it has done more to reduce the quality of research than any other single change in the last 20 years. Promotion in universities is dependent on publication, and so is university funding. Since 1992, when John Major's government converted polytechnics into universities at a stroke of the pen, their staff too have been expected to publish to be promoted. We need a lot of teachers to cope with 50 percent of the population, but there just aren't enough good researchers to go round. It is a truth universally acknowledged that advanced teaching should be done by people who are themselves doing research, but the numbers don't add up. So what can be done? Another way to organise higher education The first essential is to abolish the honours degree (cue howls of outrage from the deeply conservative vice-chancellors). It is simply too specialist for an age of mass education. Rather, there should be more general first degrees. They should still, by and large, aim to produce critical thinking rather than being vocational, but cover a wider range of subjects to a lower level, If this were done, the necessity to have the first degrees taught by active researchers would decrease. Many of them could be taught in 'teaching only' institutions. They could do it more cheaply too, if their staff were not under pressure to publish papers constantly. It would take fewer people and less space. It isn't ideal, but I see no other way to increase the numbers in higher education without spending much more than we do now. After the first degree, that modest fraction of students who had the ability and desire to get more specialist knowledge would go to graduate school. There they could be taught at a rather higher level than the present third year of an honours degree, and be prepared for research, if that is what they wanted to do. Hang on though, isn't it the case that UK Universities already have graduate schools? Yes, but they are largely offshoots of HR that provide courses in advanced powerpoint and life-style psychobabble. Vast amounts of money have been wasted in the \"Roberts Agenda\". What we need is real graduate schools that teach advanced stuff. Education not training. There is another problem. It is very hard now for anyone in research to find time to think about their subject. Most of their time is occupied writing grant applications (with 15% chance of success), churning out trivial papers and teaching. If much of the lower level undergraduate teaching were to be done, more cheaply, in places that did little or no research, the saving would, with luck, fund the extra year for the minority who go on the graduate school. The research intensive universities would do less undergraduate teaching. Their staff would have more time to do research and teach the graduate school. They would turn into something more like Institutes of Advanced Studies. A lot of details would have to be worked out, and it isn't ideal, just the least bad solution I can think of. It has not escaped my attention that this system has some resemblance to that in the USA. The USA does rather well in science. Perhaps we should try it. What we should not copy is the high fees charged in the USA. Education is a public good, and the costs should be met by people paying according to their means. I think that is called income tax. Follow-up The Browne report is a retrogressive disaster As I understand it. [ the recommendations](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=413806&c=1) not only remove the cap on fees but also make it more expensive for most people to repay loans. It is the most retrogressive thing that has happened in education in my lifetime. According to an analysis cited in [the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/oct/11/tuition-fees-graduates-browne-review) \"Graduates earning between \u00a335,000 and \u00a360,000 a year are likely to have to pay back more in fees and interest than those earning more than \u00a3100,000\" That is far to the right of anything that Mrs Thatcher contemplated. If it were to be adopted, it would be a national disgrace. The Lib Dems are our only hope to stop the recommendations being implemented. They must hold the line. 15 October 2010. It is getting clearer now. Numbers from the Social Market Foundation (SMF) were [quoted in the Financial Times](http://blogs.ft.com/westminster/2010/10/graduates-earning-27k-will-be-hardest-hit-by-browne/) as showing that the rich pay less than the poor for their degrees. At first the [ Institute of Fiscal Studies](http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/5307) (IFS) seemed to disagree. Now the IFS has [ rethought the analysis](http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/5307) and there is little difference between the predictions of the liberal (SMF) and conservative predictions, There is, unsurprisingly, some difference in the spin. ISF says that you only pay less in the top two deciles of lifetime income, ie. the top 20 percent. That's not quite the point though. Both analyses agree that anyone above the median income pays back much the same (until it decreases for the top 20 percent). In other words, unless you earn less than around \u00a322k. there is little or no progressive element whatsoever. It is an ill thought-out disaster. The part 2 is [The Steiner Waldorf cult uses bait and switch to get state funding. Part 2](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3595). The part 3 is [Steiner Waldorf Schools Part 3.

That includes utterly barmy doctrines about how the phase of the moon affects crops and such like astrological baloney (as well as some possibly sensible stuff about compost). Then I had a series of mails from a correspondent that made me realise that Steiner schools have some much more unpleasant ideas than a bit of astrological baloney, including the dangerous ideas about [anthroposophical medicine](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1761165/).

The matter has acquired new urgency now that Steiner schools are seeking government support via the Tory's \"free schools\" programme.

My only contribution so far was to add Rudolf Steiner to my [Patients' Guide](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=733). \"Anthroposophical medicine: followers of the mystic barmpot, Rudolf Steiner, for whom nothing whatsoever seems to strain credulity\" Luckily I became acquainted with two of the most knowledgeable people on the topic. They are known on Twitter as [@thetismercurio](http://twitter.com/#!/ThetisMercurio) and [@lovelyhorse_](http://twitter.com/#!/Lovelyhorse_). After meeting them it occurred to me that I should ask them to write a guest post or two. Here is part one. The true nature of Steiner Waldorf education In a document produced this September by the [New Schools Network,](http://newschoolsnetwork.org/assets/events/files/First_Steps_Guide_Sept10.pdf) the (avowedly) politically neutral organisation set up to assist groups interested in Education Minister Michael Gove's much vaunted and highly criticised Free Schools revolution, there is a question: \"..what do you want your school to be? A traditional school with a highly academic curriculum, setting and streaming? Or a school following the Montessori method or Steiner-Waldorf?\" This seems straightforward; in the case of Montessori it is so. The two school systems are often linked as 'progressive' alternatives but differ greatly. Montessori is a popular, predominantly early years education method, represented amongst the first wave of 16 Free Schools by the Discovery Free School, Crawley. Described as education adapted for each individual child, in the UK Montessori places itself [within the remit](http://www.montessori.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/50582/guide-to-early-years.pdf) of the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) guidelines. Steiner Waldorf schools are similarly called \"child-centred\" but are in reality underpinned by a fantastical edifice of nonsense which directs the teachers in the way they work with individual children. The schools have a distinct pedagogy in the context of which government guidelines are anathema; thus [exemptions to the EYFS](http://www.savesteinerschools.org/?p=27) have been sought for the kindergartens at all Steiner settings. The [Open Eye](http://openeyecampaign.wordpress.com/about/) Campaign, championed by Steiner teacher Dr Richard House of Roehampton University, stated in 2007 that they feared the EYFS was potentially harmful and 'a breach of the human right of parents to have their children educated in accordance with their own philosophies'. Few early years teachers reject the importance of play or would welcome an overly prescriptive regime, many support the review of the EYFS currently being undertaken by Dame Clare Tickell. But they may be surprised at the [rhetoric](http://www.greenworld.org.uk/page5/page107/page110/page110.html) of Richard House and Graham Kennish, Steiner teacher trainer and science advisor: \"Monoculture of children's minds. Strip mining of children's imaginative forces for short-term aims. The deep ploughing which destroys the soil and crushes individuality with heavy machinery. The application of fertiliser which turns childhood aspirations to dust which then blows away, leaving the barrenness of violence in adolescence. .... Education as the cultivation of inner resources for which an inner ecology is needed.\" Anthroposophy To make sense of this histrionic language, parents and policy makers must understand the philosophy that informs all Steiner Waldorf schools (Waldorf in the US and Europe): Anthroposophy. Wikipedia will not help here (it has been 'cleansed'), parents who ask are told the literal meaning: 'wisdom of man'. Anthroposophy's inventor, Austrian Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) is presented by his proponents as a profound philosopher, a polymath; an expert in agriculture and architecture, medicine, social care, art and education. [Triodos Bank](http://www.goetheanum.org/1169.html?L=1), [Camphill Communities](http://www.camphill.org.uk/about), [biodynamic agriculture](http://biodynamicshoax.wordpress.com/) (including wine) and ['Social Pedagogy'](http://www.abdn.ac.uk/education/courses/basp/news-events/) are all expressions of Steiner's anthroposophical ideas. The first 'Steiner' school, named Waldorf after its cigarette factory patron, was opened in Stuttgart in 1919. With typical bravado the Movement has for some time proclaimed Waldorf 'the fastest growing school system in the world'. Applying Anthroposophy to his subject, Science Advisor Dr Graham Kennish can be read some time before the Open Eye Campaign asking the [important questions](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:DxRh7QmEnjsJ:www.science.anth.org.uk/sgnl398.rtf+graham+kennish+science&cd=6&hl=en&ct=clnk&client=gmail): \"How valid is the current popular and medical perception of the heart as a pump? What sustains this model and how much is lost in maintaining it?\" And in his: [Teaching Biology in a Human Context](http://www.waldorflibrary.org/Journal_Articles/biologykennish.pdf) he describes Waldorf adolescents learning anatomy with a 'sense of wholeness and meaning'. Kennish was until recently the Science advisor for the University of Plymouth Steiner BA course (now closing) and is still featured on the University site as a researcher for the [Steiner Waldorf Academy Research Network, ](http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/researchcover/rcp.asp?page=322&pagetype=G)linked to the only UK state funded Steiner Waldorf Academy, Hereford. Amongst the [set texts](http://ukanthroposophy.wordpress.com/plymreadinglists/) at Plymouth (obtained through a recent FoI request) was a book called 'Secrets of the Skeleton, Form in Metamorphosis', the jaw-dropping fantasy of which presumably misled hosts of trainee Steiner Waldorf teachers. But this isn't science: it's Steiner's 'Spiritual Science'. As an advocate of this world view Dr Richard House [made a plea](http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6049290) in a comment on the TES website for an understanding of the supersensible world through Steiner's 'upgrading' of science. But this is not, he suggests, for the intellectually lazy. What is not mentioned by the Steiner teachers taking your child into their care is that Steiner was by the time he wrote and lectured about education an occultist, an ex-theosophist whose insights were gained, it is stated, through clairvoyance. Nor will they be honest about the core beliefs of Anthroposophy, described by historian Dr Peter Staudenmaier: \"Spiritual advancement through karma and reincarnation, supplemented by the access to esoteric knowledge available to a [privileged few\"]. The influence of Anthroposophy on Steiner Waldorf education The pedagogy of Waldorf schools is informed by Steiner's esoteric scheme of [karma and reincarnation](http://www.scribd.com/doc/8615410/The-Education-of-the-Child-Dr-Rudolf-Steiner). The child 'incarnates' in 7 year cycles: the 'etheric' body is born at 7, the astral body at 14 and the 'ego' or the individuality that returns from past lives, at 21. Abstract reasoning is discouraged too early (before 14) because it interferes with the anthroposophical - spiritual - vision of human development. If parents are surprised at this information, or believe it to be a charming metaphor, we know that Steiner advised his teachers to be coy: \"[W]e have to remember that an institution like the Independent Waldorf School with its anthroposophical character, has goals that, of course, coincide with anthroposophical desires. At the moment, though, if that connection were made official, people would break the Waldorf School's neck.\" Rudolf Steiner, Faculty Meetings with Rudolf Steiner (Anthroposophic Press, 1998) p. 115 [In this interview](http://www.waldorflibrary.org/images/stories/journal_articles/GW3902.pdf) the late Joan Salter, author of 'The Incarnating Child', (standard Waldorf the importance of her anthroposophical studies: \"JS: What appeals to me about Steiner is that he is thoroughly practical. We're inclined to think of babies as children, but they have been old people. Our \"little treasures\" have been here many times. I think we need to be aware of this. You can see this if you observe the child. That is why I think observation is so important. LM: Can you say more about this in relation to caring for young children? JS: The reason we come here again is to redeem old karma and to establish new karma. We need to ask ourselves: If this is why the human being has come, how can we bring up the child, or what can we do, to help the child do this? LM: That sounds like the key to parenting!\" The role of the [Steiner kindergarten teacher](http://knol.google.com/k/anthroposophy-and-waldorf-education-the-kindergarten-years#) is to facilitate the 'incarnation' of the spirits and souls of children into their physical bodies. If there is here a philosophy that the EYFS guidelines might \"breach\": in our direct experience the significance and implications of this philosophy are inadequately understood by most Steiner parents. Teachers, if pressed, may repeat that 'Anthroposophy is not taught to the children' but this is disingenuous or naive. The transmission of Anthroposophy is subtle, through verses, stories and images. Every aspect of Steiner education is informed by Steiner's clairvoyant 'insight' or 'intuition' and has occult implications. Thus the Waldorf categorisation of children according to their ['temperaments'](http://waldorfparents.blogspot.com/2010/09/children-and-four-temperaments-what.html) and their 'soul type', school readiness linked to the 'change of teeth', the dance form eurythmy, the oddly uniform artwork, the gnomes (or elementals) and the faceless dolls, are all embodiments of the anthroposophical impulse. Labeling of children according to a spurious philosophy could be seen as insignificant were it not for the pedagogical response of those Steiner teachers who, instead of acknowledging a child's real, individual emotions and behaviour, respond to body-type, hair colour, gait and 'humour' in formulaic (occult) and potentially detrimental ways. The way Steiner Waldorf schools want classify your children (from [openwaldorf.com](http://www.openwaldorf.com/temperaments.html)). [Click to enlarge](/The_Four_Temperaments_Rudolf_Steiner.jpg). Eugene Schwartz, a Waldorf Educational Consultant with his own US site Millennial Child, gave a series of lectures called 'The Karma of Education' at Rudolf Steiner House, London in April this year at the invitation of St. Michael Steiner School in Wandsworth. The [podcast](http://millennialchild.com/Resources/podcasts.html) is available to download and is essential listening for Michael Gove. Schwartz is candid and even entertaining; if anyone could make Steiner's Saturn/Sun/Moon evolution, Lemuria and Atlantis palatable it might be him. But this is adult fantasy, theosophical science-fiction; it is not a basis for the education of children, however well-meaning or well connected some of its proponents may be. As Anthroposophy is an esoteric movement with an 'inner circle', it is not surprising that the undeclared hierarchy of Steiner schools includes practicing anthroposophists as well as some teachers making attempts to work assiduously for the benefit of their classes, trying even to ignore Anthroposophy. The turnover of the latter type of teacher is high. For those who imagine they will 'take the good bits & ignore the rest' of Steiner in any possible UK Free Schools, there are indications [in this document](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=gmail&attid=0.1.1&thid=12926b8b51050098&mt=application/pdf&url=https://mail.google.com/mail/?ui%3D2%26ik%3Dc5e2a6f331%26view%3Datt%26th%3D12926b8b51050098%26attid%3D0.1.1%26disp%3Dattd%26zw&sig=AHIEtbTRl1B694MMf5ilMor) from the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America, directed at the many 'Waldorf inspired' initiatives budding in the States, that without Anthroposophy there is no Steiner Waldorf. Readers are instructed that essential to the \"art\" of teaching is: \"an openness to reckon with the unseen spiritual realities which live behind the physical world and developing the perceptivity to experience what this reality is.\" In addition, those concerned can buy a copy of the most recent (2007) edition of The Class Teachers' Handbook' by Kevin Avison, available from the bookshop of the UK Steiner Waldorf Schools Fellowship: \"...without active recall the teacher cannot claim to be including the spiritual world, the activity of the night, in the lesson. Recall time is the moment in the lesson when what is beginning to individualise itself in the child through their unconscious communication with the hierarchies (especially the Angels, Archangels and Archai - see for example, The Hierarchies as the Source of Action Speech and Thought, April 28, 1023 - GA224) during sleep can express itself.\" In the same Handbook, Avison advises teachers: \"anything indicating what the class might have learnt or covered in Morning Lesson should be 'lost' before you leave the school,\" Many have taken him seriously, since the 'loss' of notes is a complaint made repeatedly by Waldorf parents all over the world. The implications of spiritual science So why are parents asking for these schools? Steiner Waldorf schools offer an apparently creative, 'unhurried', authentic childhood experience free from our dominant exam culture and from technology. They stress the ecological and holistic. They are alluring. The distinct aesthetic within the Steiner kindergarten: natural materials, wool, washed peach-coloured walls and gentle voices creates for some parents a lost garden of childhood, in contrast to which the brash plastic of the average nursery becomes an affront to the senses. There's no reason to suspect anything odd, so Michael Gove can hardly be blamed for his positive reaction to the Bruton Steiner School, which appears to have been his [moment of zen](http://beta.thisissomerset.co.uk/fosseway/news/Meadow-School-influences-new-policy-small-schools/article-1167375-detail/article.html). But the Steiner dream ends for many families with the realisation that their child is academically far behind his or her peers. Susan Godsland, an independent reading intervention expert, has helped many ex-Steiner children learn to read at 8, 9 and 10. Though she acknowledges that some children can blossom in Steiner school, that a percentage will learn to read earlier in spite of the pedagogy, she believes it's cruel to deny a child the chance to read until so late. In the last paragraphs of her [Room 101](http://www.dyslexics.org.uk/room_101.htm) she explains why early reading isn't encouraged. A child is 'blessed' with not being able to read and write, since Steiner says early reading will hinder the later spiritual development of children. She adds: 'this is simply mumbo-jumbo and should be treated with the contempt it deserves.' While it is evident that this failure in basic teaching could cause low self esteem, the influence of [anthroposophical medicine](http://ukanthroposophy.wordpress.com/?s=doctors) within Waldorf schools is an added concern (for example, [mistletoe as a 'treatment' for cancer](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1761165/)). In addition the [measles epidemics](http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=18838) linked to European Waldorf schools are an indication of an [anti-vaccination culture](http://web.archive.org/web/20070906215310/http:/www.waldorfhomeschoolers.com/measles.htm). In the [US Microbe Magazine](http://www.microbemagazine.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1579:measles-target-missed&catid=399:animalcules-and-forum&Itemid=481), Bernard Dixon states: \"Steiner believed that febrile illnesses such as measles and scarlet fever were related to a child's spiritual development. Adherents assert that the use of vaccines (especially measles vaccine) deprives infants of the opportunity to benefit from the experience of having those diseases.\" In Norway, homeopath Gro Lystad enlists Steiner's concept of a ['transforming illness'](http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=no&u=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/norge/1.7043347&ei=lFrAS4uBCIPw0wTHzYSnCQ&sa=X&oi=translate&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAcQ7gEwAA&prev=/search%3Fq%3DFrykter%2Butbrudd%2Bav%2Bmeslinger%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dsafari). \"I am quite sure that it is positive for a child who is healthy. It is conceivable that some will die, but this applies to children who are impaired in advance,\" In our opinion, [the disclaimer](http://www.ecswe.net/downloads/statements/ecswe_vaccinationstatement.pdf) issued by the European Council for Steiner Waldorf Education regarding vaccination is not entirely candid, since it states only that opposition to vaccination is not a part of their \"specific educational objectives\", omitting Steiner's belief that if children are vaccinated they will need a ' [spiritual education](http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/ManfKarma/19100525p01.html)'. And it makes no mention of Karma. The rejection of evidence in favour of a 'spiritual paradigm' by adherents of Anthroposophy is not surprising given that it is a belief system which is essentially anti-scientific. Peter Staudenmaier, a historian who has written extensively about Anthroposophy, [explains](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/waldorf-critics/message/14631) that: 'like other esotericists, anthroposophists regularly view themselves as privy to special knowledge which distinguishes them from the unenlightened \u2014 and an aggravated resentment against 'intellectualism' and critical thought and the ostensibly materialist cast of modern science and scholarship.' These beliefs mean that the emotional and physical health of children is potentially being put at risk. We cannot agree that the satisfaction of lobbying groups or parent choice is enough to justify the public funding of Steiner Waldorf schools. Follow-up The last few weeks have produced yet another example of how selective reporting can give a very misleading impression. As usual, the reluctance of the media to report important negative results is, in part, to blame.. The B vitamins are a favourite of the fraudulent supplements industry. One of theit pet propositions is that they will prevent dementia. The likes of Patrick Holford were, no doubt, delighted when a study from Oxford University, published on September 8th, seemed to confirm their ideas. The paper was [Homocysteine-Lowering by B Vitamins Slows the Rate of Accelerated Brain Atrophy in Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Randomized Controlled Trial](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0012244). (Smith AD, Smith SM, de Jager CA, Whitbread P, Johnston C, et al. (2010)). The main problem with this paper was that it did not measure dementia at all, but a surrogate outcome, brain shrinkage. There are other problems too. They were quickly pointed out in blogs, particularly by the excellent Carl Heneghan of the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine, at [Vitamin B and slowing the rate of Brain Atrophy: the numbers don't add up](http://trusttheevidence.net/carl-heneghan/vitamin-b-and-slowing-the-rate-of-brain-atrophy-the-numbers-don%E2%80%99t-add-up/100909109). Some detailed comments on this post were posted at Evidence Matters, [David Smith, B vitamins and Alzheimer's Disease](http://evidencematters.posterous.com/david-smith-b-vitamins-and-alzheimers-disease). This paper was reported very widely indeed. A Google search for 'Vitamin B Alzheimer's Smith 2010' gives over 90,000 hits at the time of posting. Most of those I've checked report this paper uncritically. The Daily Mail headline was [10p pill to beat Alzheimer's disease: Vitamin B halts memory loss in breakthrough British trial](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1310330/Vitamin-B-halts-memory-loss-10p-pill-beat-Alzheimers-disease.html), though in fairness to Fiona MacRae, she did include at the end \"The Alzheimer's Society gave the research a cautious welcome. Professor Clive Ballard said: 'This could change the lives of thousands of people at risk of dementia. However, previous studies looking at B vitamins have been very disappointing and we wouldn't want to raise people's expectations yet.' \" That caution was justified because a mere two weeks later, on September 22nd, another paper appeared, in the journal Neurology.. The paper is [Vitamins B12, B6, and folic acid for cognition in older men](/ford-b-vits-dementia-2010.pdf), by Ford et al. It appears to contradict directly Smith et al. but it didn't measure the same thing. This one measured what actually matters. \"The primary outcome of interest was the change in the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog). A secondary aim of the study was to determine if supplementation with vitamins decreased the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia over 8 years.\" The conclusion was negative. \"Conclusions: The daily supplementation of vitamins B12, B6, and folic acid does not benefit cognitive function in older men, nor does it reduce the risk of cognitive impairment or dementia.\" Disgracefully, this paper has hardly been reported at all. It is an excellent example of how the public is misled because of the reluctance of the media to publish negative results. Sadly that reluctance is sometimes also shown by academic journals, but not in this case. Two things went wrong, The first was near-universal failure to evaluate critically the Smith et al paper. The second was to ignore the paper that measured what actually matters. It isn't as though there wasn't a bit of relevant history, Prof Smith was one of the scientific advisors for Patrick Holford's Food for the Brain survey. This survey was, quie rightly, criticised for being uninterpretable. When asked about this, Smith admitted as much, as recounted in [Food for the Brain: Child Survey. A proper job?](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=218). Plenty has been written about [Patrick Holford](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Patrick+Holford%22), here and elsewhere. There is even a web site that is largely devoted to dispelling his myths, [Holford Watch](http://holfordwatch.info/). He merited an enture chapter in Ben Goldacre's book, Bad Science. He is an archetypal pill salesman and the sciencey talk seems to be largely used as a sales tool. It might have been relevant too, to notice that the Smith et al. paper stated | | Competing interests: Dr. A. D. Smith is named as an inventor on two patents held by the University of Oxford on the use of folic acid to treat Alzheimer's disease (US6008221; US6127370); under the University's rules he could benefit financially if the patent is exploited. There is, of course, no reason to think that the interpretation of the data was influenced by he fact that the first author had a financial interest in the outcome. In fact university managers encourage that sort of thing strongly. Personally, I'm more in sympathy with the view expressed by Strohman (1997) \"academic biologists and corporate researchers have become indistinguishable, and special awards are given for collaborations between these two sectors for behaviour that used to be cited as a conflict of interest\".
