Verifying & Tracking Requirements The College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences utilizes CastleBranch, a secure screening platform used in health care education. Incoming students will receive instructions on how to register with CastleBranch (where the documentation will be uploaded) prior to their first fall semester in the program. Instructions to create a CastleBranch account, as well as notifications about upcoming requirements, are sent via email. Below you will find a description of each vaccination, certification and licensure requirement, as well as what documentation will be acceptable. Additional annual paperwork, not listed here, will also be tracked through CastleBranch. That paperwork and applicable deadlines will be listed in students' CastleBranch accounts. How it works: - First, you upload documentation of required items to your CastleBranch account for verification. - Then, CastleBranch will review documentation and validate or decline the documentation. - If it's declined, you will be informed why so you can resolve the issue and resubmit. Vaccinations & Immunity Tests Vaccination documentation can take time to find, so get started verifying your vaccinations early. Please be aware when starting an immunization series that some series take months to complete.
