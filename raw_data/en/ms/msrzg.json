Quick congestion reliever - \u00bd tsp of honey (Manuka honey if available), with ?1/4 lemon and turmeric + ginger powder- dissolve in mouth slowly. 2. Steamy Bath - Fill the bathtub with warm water and add a couple of drops of the essential oils. Then sit in the bathtub for 15 minutes. Great for opening up those clogged and congested nostrils, and its quite relaxing! 3. Onion, garlic and honey syrup - One of my favorites. A great alternative to store bought cough syrups and it's safe for everyone to use! - take 1 large onion and three garlic cloves; chop them and cover them with honey. Warm them in a covered pot for about 40 minutes at low heat. Then store it in a glass bottle in the refrigerator. Take about \u00bd to 1 tsp. every 15 - 30 minutes until the cough is better. 4. Avoid mucus forming foods - No dairy products, bananas or melons until the cough has resolved. 5. Drink plenty of fluids - To keep the body hydrated drink lots of water, chicken broths, and vegetable broths. 6. Steam cleaning - Give your child steam with essential oils - either in a bathtub or using boiling water. Sit with them for 10 or 15 minutes. For older children, use a facial steamer or pot of hot water (carefully!). The steam will help loosen the nose and chest congestion, and help your child cough it up or blow it out. Do this steam-cleaning every morning and before bed, as well as during the day if possible. 7. Sleep upright - If possible, allow your child to sleep in a slightly upright position. This allows for easier breathing during sleep. 8. Nose hose - For older children, it is crucial to have them blow their nose several times during a steam cleaning, as well as frequently throughout the day. Getting out all the junk will help prevent this from turning into a bacterial infection. An alternative to steaming is to use nasal homeopathic decongestant spray to loosen up the nasal congestion before blowing it out. For infants too young to blow their nose, you can suction them out using a blue rubber bulb syringe. 9. Hot steam vaporizer - Use a hot steam vaporizer in the bedroom at night (not a cool mist humidifier). This warm, humid environment can help keep noses and chests clear at night. Be sure to air the room out well during the day because mold can start to grow in the room due to the warmth and humidity. 10. Eucalyptus and lavender oil - Add only one drop of each of these to a facial steamer, pot of hot water or some vaporizers. They can help clear up the congestion faster and work great as antibacterial and antiviral. 11. Vapor rubs on the chest - Occasionally, these can cause wheezing because the vapors may be too strong for some children, but overall they will work well. It is safe to try, but do observe your child to make sure it doesn't cause wheezing. 12. Drink twice as much liquid - This will help to thin secretions and prevent dehydration.
