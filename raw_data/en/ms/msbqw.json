Viral Fever: Causes and Symptoms Viral fever is any fever that happens as a result of a viral infection. Viruses are tiny living organisms that spread easily from person to person. The most common ways of getting a viral fever include: Inhalation of infected droplets released during coughing or sneezing by an ill person. Through contaminated foods or drinks. Through insects and animals that carry viruses. Viral fevers can range in temperature from 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C) to over 103\u00b0F (39\u00b0C), depending on the underlying virus. General symptoms of viral fever are chills, headache, a feeling of extreme weakness, muscle pain and aches, etc. A viral fever, whether mild, moderate, or severe, can be treated with simple ayurvedic remedies. Before we jump into the remedies, let us understand a viral fever from an ayurvedic point of view. Fever in Ayurveda In ayurveda, each individual is born with 5 elements of nature which are Earth, Air, Water, Fire, and Space. The balance of these elements is known as Dosha. There are 3 main doshas- Vata (energy of movement, composed of space and air), Pitta (digestion and metabolism composed of fire and water), and Kapha (structure and lubrication, composed of water and earth). An imbalance in the above doshas results in illnesses and infections. Ayurveda describes fever as Jwara roga. An imbalance between kapha and vata dosha leads to the development of a fever. High kapha in the body leads to cold and excess vata reduces the digestive fire because of which you experience chills, indigestion, and fatigue. Ayurveda suggests simple home remedies to restore the balance of your doshas to treat low-grade to mild fever or viral fever. Remedies For Viral Fever From The House Of Ayurveda 1.
