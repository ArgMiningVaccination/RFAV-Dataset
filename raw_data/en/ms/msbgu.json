Aged Nrf2-null mice develop all major types of age-related cataracts. Invest OphthalmolVisSci. 2021;62(15):10. https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.62.15.10PURPOSE.Age-related cataracts affect the majority of older adults and are a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Treatments that delay cataract onset or severity have the poten- tial to delay cataract surgery, but require relevant animal models that recapitulate the major types of cataracts for their development.Unfortunately,few such models are avail- able. Here, we report the lens phenotypes of aged mice lacking the critical antioxidant transcription factor Nfe2l2(designated as Nrf2 /). METHODS.Three independent cohorts of Nrf2 /and wild-type C57BL/6J mice were evaluated for cataracts using combinations of slit lamp imaging, photography of freshly dissected lenses, and histology. Mice were fed high glycemic diets, low glycemic diets, regular chow ad libitum, or chow with 30% caloric restriction. RESULTS.Nrf2/mice developed significant opacities between 11 and 15 months and developed advanced cortical, posterior subcapsular, anterior subcapsular, and nuclear cataracts. Cataracts occurred similarly in male mice fed high or low glycemic diets, and were also observed in 21-month male and female Nrf2 /mice fed ad caloric restriction. Histological observation of 18-month cataractous lenses revealed significant disruption to fiber cell architecture and the retention of nuclei throughout the cortical region of the lens. However, fiber cell denucleation and initiation of lens differentiation was normal at birth, with the first abnormalities observed at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS .Nrf2/mice offer a tool to understand how defective antioxidant signal- ing causes multiple forms of cataract and may be useful for screening drugs to prevent or delay cataractogenesis in susceptible adults. Keywords: age-related cataract, antioxidant, nutrition, glycemic index, caloric restriction Cataracts account for 51% of global blindness and are especially prevalent in the aging population with 68.3% of Americans over the age of 80 years devel- oping cataracts.1-3Cataracts are broadly defined as the opacification of the ocular lens and involve a myriad of pathogenic mechanisms. Leading risk factors for cataracto- genesis include age, genetic predisposition, diabetes melli- tus, and oxidative damage.4Age-related cataracts are themost prevalent form of cataract and are commonly present in three forms, as visualized by slit-lamp imaging: nuclear, posterior subcapsular, and cortical cataracts.5-7These vari- ous forms of cataracts imply variable susceptibility to cataracts in different areas of the lens and can present sepa- rately or often as a mixed cataract.4,5Given the growing global aging population, the personal burden of lost sight, burgeoning public health costs associated with loss of sight Copyright 2021 The Authors iovs.arvojournals.org|ISSN: 1552-5783 1 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.

It is widely accepted that oxidative stress is a leading cause of protein aggregation and subsequent lens opaci- fication causing vision loss.8-13There is strong evidence demonstrating an age-related decline in antioxidant mech- anisms, which when coupled with diminished proteolytic capacities to remove them, increases the risk for cataract development.5,6,14-17Oxidative stress involves the produc- tion of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can tion of proteostasis and apoptosis.12,15,18-23ROS production canoccurfromavarietyofenvironmentaltriggers,including light exposure, mitochon- drial activity, and hyperglycemia, as observed in diabetes mellitus.22,24This association between oxidative stress and disease has led to a better understanding of the cellular mechanismsofprotectionagainstoxidativestressandmeans of enhancing these activities. Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 [Nfe2l2]) is a well-characterized transcription factor that acts as a primarycellular defense mechanism against oxidative stress. Under normal conditions, Nrf2 is located in the cytoplasm, bound to Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), ubiquitinated, and for degradation by the protea- some.25,26Upon oxidative stress, Nrf2 is released from Keap1,translocates to the nucleus,binds to the promoter for a set of antioxidant response element (ARE) genes,and initi- it is not surprising that the inhibition of Nrf2 subsequently decreases the capacity for the cell to respond to oxida- tive stress, which is exacerbated with increasing age.26,28 The association between reduced downstream antioxidant effects due to decreased Nrf2 activity, evident with age and in age-related cataracts, has garnered attention for Nrf2 as a therapeutic target for cataract treatment and prevention.27 Several studies have used human lens epithelial cells (HLECs),treatedwithsuppressorsofNrf2activity,torecapit- ulate molecular markers of protein aggregation as expected for cataractogenesis.18,19,29-33In animal cataract models, treatment with antioxidant compounds,including those that induce Nrf2 transcription and activation protect against selenite-induced cataracts.31,34Similarly, activators of Nrf2 can protect HLEC from features of cataract that are induced under conditions of oxidative stress with high glucose, hydrogen peroxide, or homocysteine treatments.20,32,33,35-37 Analysis of age-related cataractous lenses from human diabetic or non-diabetic samples showed decreased methy- lation of the Keap1 promoter, which in turn upregulates and nuclear translocation and antioxidant activity.28,38Similarly, Nrf2 gene variants in humans have been associated with premature surgical treat- ment of cortical and posterior subcapsular cataracts.39 At present, there are several mouse cataract models, but the majority of these exhibit early onset lens defects or congenital cataracts (i.e. those present at birth).40,41 These include genetic models for cataracts that contain well- characterized human cataract mutations, altered functional- ity of critical protein quality control pathways, like ubiqui-tin proteolysis pathway, autophagy, mitochondrial dynam- ics, and unfolded protein response, and manipulation of developmental regulatory pathways.42-52Other models for cataracts use chemical induction, the most common being sodium selenite that induces acute oxidative stress, trigger- ingcataractformation.31Thesemodelsaresuitableforstudy- ing severe cataracts but do not capture the gradual and varied onset that occurs with aging. Wild-type mouse lines of various strains develop age- related cataracts when aged out to 30 months;these animals demonstrate a variety of opacifications, including anterior opacities, ring cataracts, and cortical haziness.53However, it is difficult and expensive to keep a majority of mice out to such old ages. Therefore, there is a need for an accelerated timeline to visualize this same range. Several genetic models for age-related cataracts have been devel- oped, although these models often develop one subtype of age-related cataracts. For example, B2-crystallin ( Crybb2) knockout mice are born with transparent lenses but develop cortical cataracts with age and show decreased oxidative stress response capacity.54In the LEGSKO model, in which de novo glutathione (GSH) production is abolished specif- ically in the lens, it was reported that mice develop severe nuclear cataracts by9months.55GSH isacritical lensantiox- idant whose synthesis is transcriptionally controlled by Nrf2 in response to oxidative stress.26GSH is also responsible for the regulation of the major protein quality control machin- ery.56Similarly,a mouse knockout for glutaredoxin 2 (Grx2), a redox sensor that is activated under oxidative stress, also develops nuclear cataracts at an accelerated rate and sever- ity by 13 to 16 months.57Although the majority of human cataracts present during the process of aging, there is no \"gold standard\" mouse model for age-related cataracts that presents the variety of subtypes seen in humans. Given that many of these cataract models result in a decreased oxidative stress response capacity and that Nrf2 is an important transcription factor in activating cellu- lar protection mechanisms against oxidative stress, we hypothesized that alterations to Nrf2 expression would lead to cataract development. A whole-body Nrf2 knockout (Nrf2 /) streptozotocin-induced diabetic animal model showed accelerated cataract development compared to diabetic Nrf2 +/+control animals.58However, the possi- bility of cataracts /mice was not reported. Animals lacking Nrf2 are viable but experience a shortened lifespan compared to wild-type mice, which can be extended by caloric restriction.59We recently described the protection of mouse retina from accelerated age-related macular degeneration-like features with the feeding of a low glycemic diet in an Nrf2 /context.60Here, we char- acterize the lens phenotypes of aged Nrf2 /mice and propose them to represent an accelerated model of age- related cataracts that captures a wide range of pathologies observed in humans. MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals Study 1: Eleven to 18-month male Nrf2 /:N r f 2 +/,a n d Nrf2/mice(allele: Nfe2l2tm1Ywk),61maintainedforatleast 10 generations on a C57BL/6J genetic background, were obtained from Michael Freeman (Vanderbilt University) and The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), respectively, and were interbred to generate Nrf2 /mice.

Thirty-nine Nrf2 /male mice were randomized into groups of 20 high glycemic (HG)-fed mice and 19 low glycemic (LG)-fed mice. At the time that slit lamp imag- ing was performed, 17 HG-fed mice and 18 LG-fed mice were still alive. A full description of dietary treatment is published elsewhere.60Diets contained identical macronu- trient compositions with the exception that the HG starch was composed of 100% amylopectin (Amioca starch; Ingre- dion Inc., Bridgewater, NJ, USA), LG starch was composed of 70% amylose/30% amylopectin (Hylon VII starch; Ingredion Inc.). For comparisons with wild- type C57BL/6J mice, a separate cohort of 3 male mice fed standard chow ad libitum was studied at 18 months. All animal work was performed at the Tufts University Human Nutrition Research Center of Aging (HNRCA) and approved by the Tufts University Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee (IACUC) in adherence with the ARVO statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research. Study 2: Neonatal genetic background were housed at a temperature range of 20 to 23\u00b0C under 12:12-hour light-dark cycles with free access to water and food, as described previously.63TheNrf2 /mice were generated by replacing a portion of exon 5 of Nrf2withlacZcDNA, resulting in the deletion of the conserved carboxyl 280 amino acid residues DNA bind- ing domain and producing a nonfunctional Nrf2-LacZ fusion protein.62Mice were used in accordance with proto- cols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and mouse studies adhered to the ARVO state- ment for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research. Study 3: Twenty-one month male and female Nrf2 / mice: Nrf2 /mice (allele: Nfe2l2tm1Ywk), maintained for at least 10 generations on a C57BL/6J genetic background, were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and were backcrossed to C57BL/6J mice. Mice were bred at the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and fed chow diets (NIH-31 diet; #T.9717.15, Envigo) ad libitum or were given a 30% caloric restriction, beginning at 9 months of age until 21 months of age, as described previously.59 Mice were used in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the NIA, and mouse studies adhered to the ARVO state- ment for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research. Statistical Analyses Analysis for age-diet and age-genotype interactions was performed in SPSS as a univariate general linear model using a type III sum-of-squares method. Pairwise compar- isonsofcorticalnucleardepthwereperformedinSPSSusing Student'st-test. Cataract frequency was compared using Fisher's exact test.Cataract Imaging and Scoring Study 1: Morphological changes in the lenses of the mice were monitored by a slit-lamp (Zeiss Slit Lamp Biomi- croscopy, Santa Rosa, CA, USA). After dilation with eye drops containing 1% tropicamide and 0.5% phenylephrine hydrochloride, the animals were handheld unanesthetized and were presented to the slit lamp observer (author S.J.) randomly.Theslitlampwasfirstfrontalview,followedby30 degreeangleviewing.Thedegreeoflensopacityineacheye was graded and classified according to the LOCS II system.64 Total cataract scores of 0 to 4 were based on The Framing- ham Eye Study,where scores of 4 and 5 were combined into a single score due to limitations of resolution due to the smaller eye size.65Scores are reported per animal,with indi- vidual eyes combined.The examiner was blinded to the age and diet groups of the mice. Front view slit lamp photography was carried out using a Zeiss slit lamp microscope.Narrow focal slit lamp photog- raphy was carried out using the Micron III system with an attached slit lamp light source (Phoenix Research Laborato- ries). The Micron III system was used for fundus photogra- phy. Freshly dissected lenses were photographed on a Leica dissection microscope. Study 3: Dissected lenses were imaged on a dissecting microscope, either mounted against a 300-mesh electron microscopy grid (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatsfield, PA, USA, Catalog No. 6300H-Cu), a wire grid, or placed on a dark background. Lenses were evaluated from two large cohorts of mice. The first cohort of mouse lenses, repre- senting mostly male mice, was evaluated and scored at the University of Delaware, whereas the second cohort of mice, consisting of mostly female mice, was evaluated and scored at the National Eye Institute (NEI). Opacities were deter- mined ex vivo and scored in a binary fashion. Lenses with visible opacification and distorted appearance in grid imag- ing were considered as defective. Histology and Lens Immunofluorescence Study 1:E y cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4) and lenses were dissected.Fixed lenses were processed by freeze-substitution followed by embedment in paraffin, as described in ref. 66. In brief, eyes were plunged into dry iced-cooled liquid propane for 1 minute, very rapidly trans- ferred to 20 mL 97% methanol, 3% acetic acid, and cooled on dry ice. Freeze-substitution was allowed to proceed for 48 hours at 80\u00b0C.Samples were gradually warmed up,and then processed through graded ethanols to three changes of 100% ethanol. Samples were then processed conventionally into paraffin. The 5 m sections were harvested, deparaf- finized, and hydrated. To visualize membranes, sections were blocked in 10% normal goat serum in PBS, then exposed to Wheat Germ Agglutinin,Alexa Fluor 488,diluted 1:20, for 1 hour (Thermo Fisher).

Next, slides were blocked using normal donkey serum (Jackson Immunore- search), incubated with primary antibodies (goat anti- - crystallins; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 hours, washed with PBT, and incubated with secondary antibody conju- gated to either Cy3 or Alexa Fluor 488 (Jackson Immunore- search). Slides were mounted in Prolong Gold Antifade with DAPI (Molecular Probes) and photographed on a Zeiss Axiovert fluorescence microscope and digital camera. Study globes ( n=37,Nrf2 /mice and n=13, wild-type mice) were by immersion in forma- lin and embedded in methacrylate for conventional toxylin and eosin stain (H&E) histology. RESULTS Cataract phenotypes have not previously been reported in aged Nrf2 /mice. Using slit lamp or fundus imaging, we observed a full range of LOCSII cataract scores in these 11 to 15 month old Nrf2 /mice. The grades ranged from 1 (mild) to 4 (severe; Fig. 1).64Cataracts scoring a grade of 3 or 4 sufficiently obscured the light to the back of the eye such that fundus images did not reveal the retina or its vasculature. None of the Nrf2 /mice had completely transparent lenses at 11 to 15 months,which were observed in wild-type C57BL/6J mice of the same age (see Fig. 1). Because epidemiologic data suggested a correlation between HG diets and risk for cataracts,67,68we evaluated cataracts in our Nrf2 /cohort that had consumed HG or LG diets.60We have previously shown that dietary treatment with an LG diet ameliorated retinal phenotypes.60Cataract grades were lowest in the youngest mice we scored (11 monthsofage)andincreasedwithagingsuchthatalmostall of the mice had cataract grades of 4 at 15 months ( Fig. 2). The trend to increased cataract score with age was highly significant ( P=2.3\u00d7104). In contrast, the effect of diet on cataract score was not significant ( P=0.97). Cataracts were present bilaterally, with no animals scoring more than one grade apart between eyes. Cataract prevalence was also determined based on a cutoff grade of two ( Table 1). Again, cataractfrequencyincreasedwithagebutwasnotassociated with diet (see Table 1).FIGURE2. Nrf2 /cataract scores get progressively worse w i t ha g ei r r e s p e c t i v eo fd i e t .

Nrf2 /mice develop multiple types of cataracts. Slit lamp images from 15 month old mice reveal cortical cataracts (A,B),posterior subcapsular cataracts ( C,D),and nuclear cataracts heterogeneous anterior and posterior subcapsular cataracts ( G-J). Arrows indicate the diagnostic opacities associated with each cataract type. Further analysis of 15 month Nrf2 /mouse lenses using slit lamp photography revealed that cataracts resem- bled the 3 major human age-related cataracts: cortical Figs. 3A,3B), posterior subcapsular Figs. 3C,3D), and nuclear cataract (see Figs. 3E,3F). Cataracts were further scored for cataract subtype and total cataractscoreusingthemodifiedLOCSIIscoringsystem.The majority of cataracts presented with significant (defined as grade2orhigher)corticalcataractsand/orposteriorsubcap- sular cataracts (19/35).Nuclear cataracts were observed in 5 of the 35 mice. Most of the cataracts and all of the nuclear cataracts consisted of at least two kinds of cataracts simulta- neously. Ex vivo analysis of cataractous lenses at 18 months revealed significant and heterogeneous opacification of the anterior capsule (see Figs.3G,3H) and the posterior capsule (seeFigs. 3I,3J). Lenses from 18 month old mice were histologically eval- uated using wheat germ agglutinin to visualize the shape of lens cells ( Fig. 4, green) and DAPI to visualize the nuclei (seeFig. 4, red). In these older animals, cells in the anterior lens (see Figs. 4A-C), cortex (see Figs. 4D-F), and poste- rior (see Figs. 4G-I) revealed widespread disruptions to the lens fiber architecture, in association with opacification. The most severe abnormalities were observed in the corti- cal region, consistent with the degree of cortical cataract (seeFigs. 4D,4E). The lens nucleus architecture was largely intact, also consistent with nuclear cataract being a less penetrant phenotype. Alongside changes in lens cell archi- tecture, we also observed aggregates throughout the lens. Strikingly, we observed nuclei abnormally present in Nrf2 /mouse lenses well beyond the outer cortical region. Ectopic nuclei were observed in the posterior part of Nrf2 /mouse lenses (see Figs. 4G,4H) but not wild-type mouse lenses (see Fig. 4I). Many of these nuclei appeared pyknotic or rounded-up (see Figs. 4D-F, insets). We did not observe ectopic nuclei in the deeper parts of the lens nucleus in either Nrf2 /or wild-typemice lenses,suggest- ing that nuclear degradation occurred normally in primary fiber cells.The process of lens fiber cell denucleation (LFCD), whereby the nucleus of the fiber cell is systematically disas- sembled and degraded, begins during mid-gestation in the center of the lens, and continues throughout the life of the organism in a stereotypical pattern beginning at the lens outer cortex and proceeding to the inner cortex.69,70Usually, retention of lens nuclei is noted in congenital cataracts and is most obvious in the center of the lens.46,47,71In order to determine whether embryonic LFCD occurred normally in Nrf2 /mice, we evaluated lenses at P1, when LFCD has already occurred in wild-type mice (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Nrf2 /mouse lenses at P1 showed appropri- (see Supplementary Fig. S1B). Lens differ- entiation also occurred appropriately, with normal timing and levels of gamma crystallins expression in Nrf2 / mouse lenses (see Supplementary Figs. S1C, S1D). We did observe some fracturing of the Nrf2 /mouse lens upon sectioning, which may indicate some defective packing of primary fiber cells (see Supplementary Fig. S1D). In order to gain further insight into the early steps of cataractogenesis in Nrf2 /mice,we also evaluated young adult lenses in 3 month wild-type and Nrf2 /mice. Nrf2 /mouse lenses were transparent with no obvi- ous gross phenotypes. Histological evaluation of the lenses showed that lenses were properly formed and lens fiber cell differentiation occurred normally at the transition zone (Supplementary Figs. S2D-F). However, the precise geom- etry of the bow region appeared subtly different in Nrf2 /mouse lenses (see Supplementary Fig. S2F). We also observed some abnormalities in the anterior part of the lens, where delaminated nucleated cells were observed in conjunction with disorganization of the lens fiber cells in the region, a possible initiating event in the formation of an anterior subcapsular cataract (see Supplementary Figs. S2H, S2I). The abnormalities in 18 month Nrf2 /mouse lenses in the bow region prompted us to evaluate potential connec- tions between retained cortical nuclei, age, and geno- type.Figure 5 shows measurements of the distance fromNrf2-Null Mice Develop Age-Related Cataracts IOVS |D e c e m b e r 2 0 2 1|V o l . 6 2|N o . 1 5|A r t i c l e 1 0|6 FIGURE4.

We observed both age-related increases in nuclear depth and genotype- related increase, but only in older Nrf2 /mice. These findings indicate a statistically significant age-genotype interaction in equatorial nuclear depth that may underlie some of the opacities observed in older Nrf2 /mouse lenses. Given the increasing severity in cataracts between 11 and 15months(see Fig.2)andtheseverityofcataractphenotype at 18 months in male Nrf2 /mice (see Figs. 3G-J,Fig.4), we tested whether further aging to 21 months would lead to increased severity of cataracts in an independent cohort of male and female Nrf2 /mice.This cohort also allowed us to test whether delaying aging via a 30% caloric restriction compared to ad libitum feeding would impact cataractogen- esis in Nrf2 /mice,59a finding we observed using Emory mice.72,73Cataracts were observed at high frequency in both male and female mice (Supplementary Fig. S3, Tables 2 - 3,Figs.6A-D).Furthermore,observedcataractswerehetero-Nrf2-Null Mice Develop Age-Related Cataracts IOVS |D e c e m b e r 2 0 2 1|V o l . 6 2|N o . 1 5|A r t i c l e 1 0|7 FIGURE6.

Both male and female mouse Nrf2 / mice showed a significantly higher frequency of cataracts than wild-type mice, and CR did not significantly reduce the frequency of cataracts relative to ad libitum feeding (see Tables 2,3).Histological analysis was performed on contralateral eyes from 21 month female wild-type and Nrf2 /mice. Whereas wild-type mouse lenses were clear and showed no histologic abnormalities (see Figs. 6E,6G,6I,6L), nuclear cataracts were observed both in lens sections from Nrf2 /mice (see Fig. 6F), consistent with the images from whole lenses (see Figs. 6B,6C).

Most Nrf2 /mouse lenses exhibited posterior (see Figs. 6J,6K,6M,6N). Poste- rior subcapsular defects were associated with cellular (see Fig. 6J) or acellular plaques (see Fig. 6K). Anterior subcap- sular defects were associated with degeneration of the lens epithelium (see Fig. 6M), normally a monolayer of flat cells (seeFig. 6L), or vacuolation of the subcapsular region (see Fig. 6N). DISCUSSION There are few highly reproducible models of age-related humancataracts.Becausecataractsinhumansoftenoccurin combinations of different types and they appear later in life, the property of Nrf2 /mice to similarly exhibit different types of cataracts in an age-dependent manner (see Tables 1-3), present them as a good model of human cataracts, while also providing a useful and suitable model for age- related cataracts of various specific types. Cataracts in these Nrf2 /mice can be compared with the few prior models of age-related cataracts. The Emory mouse develops progressive cortical and nuclear cataracts but penetrance is low and severity is limited, making it a costlyanddifficultmodel.72,74TheGrx2knockoutfirstdevel- ops a nuclear opacity, which progresses to affect cortical and subcapsular regions, but this does not model the typi- cal human cataract pattern.57Few rodent models recapitu- late highly prevalent posterior subcapsular cataracts, which are best modeled in chemically treated rabbits or ionizing radiation-treated mice.75,76The LEGSKO GCLC, and GCLM, and regulates glutathione regen- eration.78Thus, it is somewhat surprising that Nrf2 / mouse cataracts do not develop nuclear cataracts at a higher prevalence. Genetic redundancy with Nrf1, also present at high levels in the lens, may be an additional factor.79,80 Whether phenotypic disparities relate to different genetic backgrounds, genetic redundancies, or baseline levels of glutathione should be sorted out as we determine which are the best models of human age-related cataracts. Nrf2/mice offer an opportunity to understand the sequence of events behind cataract development, especially considering that Nrf2 functions as a nuclear transcription factor, and thus likely performs its critical functions in lens epithelial cells and/or newly developing cortical fiber cells prior to LFCD, when the lens cell nucleus is disassem- bled and degraded.69Our observation that young Nrf2 / mouse lenses, although transparent, progress to cataractssuggests that they may have underlying defects in fiber cell formation, findings hinted at in histological analysis of 3 month old Nrf2 /mouse lenses. Careful analysis of Nrf2 /mouse lens epithelial cells may reveal aspects of accel- erated aging, altered stress response pathways, or abnormal metabolismandhomeostasis.Futurestudiesalsowarrantthe study of Nrf2 binding partners like MafG and MafK, whose deficiency is also associated with cataracts.80The notion of subtle alterations in fiber cells escalating into progres- sive cataracts is supported by the Crybb2knockout mouse, wherethelossofa -crystallinmanifestsasage-relatedcorti- cal cataracts,54and inBfsp2knockout mice, where loss of the intermediate protein filensin results in more rapid age- related cataracts.81 Our observation of large numbers of abnormal nuclei through the inner and outer cortex of Nrf2 /mouse lenses indicates abrogation or truncation of secondary LFCD.Some cataract models have shown delayed secondary LFCD, with nuclei observed anteriorly, such as mutations in B2-crystallin or loss of Connexin 50, but the fiber cells eventually do undergo denucleation.82,83More commonly, impaired LFCD occurs in primary fiber cells, thus prefer- entially affecting the central part of the lens.47,84Impaired primary LFCD is observed in many congenital cataract models, as well as certain age-related cataracts like the Grx2 knockout mouse.85The finding of normal primary LFCD may explain why we do not observe more signifi- cant nuclear cataracts.However,retention of fiber cell nuclei in itself does not explain the degree of cortical opacifi- cation, as milder cataracts also retained fiber cell nuclei (seeFigs. 4B,4E,4H,4K). Our finding that LFCD occurred normally at birth (see Supplementary Figs. S1A, S1B) and was not different between wild-type and Nrf2 /mouse lensesat3months(see Fig.2)raisesthepossibilitythatthere may be alternative regulatory mechanisms for LFCD during adulthood. Absent or incomplete secondary LFCD may be a moregeneralfeatureofage-relatedcataractsthanpreviously described. Our observation of increased nuclear depth with age, even in wild-type mice (see Fig. 5), confirms results found during normal aging in many organisms.86Our data suggest that the rate-limiting steps in nuclear removal are impactedbynormalagingandfurtherexacerbatedbyadefi- ciency in Nrf2.The recent transcriptomic characterization of theagingmouselensmayofferpotentialmechanismslinked LFCD.87 The of anterior and posterior subcapsular cataracts in Nrf2 /mice offers the potential to deter- mine the etiology of these cataracts as well.Some subcapsu- lar cataracts were associated with the presence of nucleated cells,as is typical during congenital TGF -induced cataracts, and associated with pathological epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).88Evidence of potential EMT was observed in 18 month cataracts (see Fig. 4H), as well as in young 3 month lenses (see Supplementary Figs. S2H, S2I). Never- theless, other posterior and anterior opacities did not show such cellular plaques and had severely disrupted fiber cell architecture (see Figs. 4A,4B,4G;Figs. 6K,6M,6N). Our data support a model where subcapsular plaques consist of populations of fiber cells and myofibroblastic cells that may eventually die or degenerate.89,90Plaque formation may be further linked to specific tissue damage, including breakage oftheposteriorlenscapsule(see Fig.6J),whichmayactivate a subsequent fibrotic immune response.91 Our finding that Nrf2 /mice developed severe age- related cataracts emphasizes the importance of the Nrf2Nrf2-Null Mice Develop Age-Related Cataracts IOVS |D e c e m b e r 2 0 2 1|V o l . 6 2|N o . 1 5|A r t i c l e 1 0|9 pathway in lens morphogenesis and cataractogenesis. In human cataractogenesis, disruption of the Nrf2 pathway appears to occur via altered epigenetic regulation of KEAP1, leading to a diminished Nrf2 response.38During the normal process of lens aging,downstream functions enzy- maticfunction,alldecreaseinassociationwithcataractogen- esis.5,6,8,14,15,92Whether those decreases are caused directly or indirectly by loss of Nrf2 function remains to be deter- mined. This research also informs about potential ways to allevi- ate or remediate cataracts using Nrf2-related biology. The Nrf2 /mouse cataract model presented here should be useful to screen anti-cataractogenic treatments, prefer- ably in combination with other Nrf2 +/+models. Exist- ing approaches, including small molecule Nrf2 activators or plant-derived Nrf2 activators, like sulforaphane, should be studied further in Nrf2 +/+and Nrf2 /cataract models. In vitro data in lens epithelial cells or aging human lenses suggests that sulforaphane treatment can confer improvedantioxidantlevelsandresponseandthereforemay protect against cataracts.93,94It will be beneficial to identify compoundsthat can protect the lens in an Nrf2-independent fashion,because human cataracts are associated with epige- netically diminished Nrf2 responses over the course of aging.Because multiple types of cataracts are observed,this Nrf2/mouse model may reveal treatments that prefer- entially improve different parts of the lens. Prior laboratory and epidemiology studies indicated that LG diets protect against age-related ocular condi- tions, including age-related macular degeneration and some cataracts, and that caloric restriction delayed cataracts in Emory mice and some pigmented lines of mice and rats.60,68,72,73,95-97We therefore explored the possibility of a dietary cataract intervention by feeding Nrf2 /mice LG or caloric restriction diets. However, we did not find a significant difference in cataract onset, prevalence, or type of cataract in Nrf2 /mice fed LG or caloric restriction diets. There was some hint from cataract frequency data that caloric restriction may reduce cataract frequency in 21 month male and female Nrf2 /mice (approximate 20- 25% reduction; see Tables 2 ,3), but we were likely under- powered for this difference to reach statistical significance. This reduction may indicate separate roles for Nrf2 in regu- latingagingeventsrelatedtocataracts,whicharereducedby caloric restriction, separately from cell autonomous require- ments for Nrf2 in the lens. Our study design has strengths and limitations. Our comparison of multiple Nrf2 /alleles,dietary treatments, ages, and cataract assessments may appear as a limitation. However, one strength of utilizing multiple cohorts of mice, reared and analyzed at different centers, is that we can be more confident of the reproducibility of cataracts in Nrf2/mice in both sexes of mice fed multiple dietary treatments, and whose cataracts are observable in slit-lamp imaging,grossappearance,andhistology.Weevaluatedmice with two different knockout alleles of Nrf2,although we did not evaluate mice with the Nfe2l2tm1Mymallele at older ages. It is conceivable that different alleles of Nrf2 bred to differ- ent genetic backgrounds may develop cataracts at different frequencies than what we report here. Future studies will evaluate proteomic and transcriptomic changes in Nrf2 / lenses and direct measurements of antioxidant status in mild and severe cataracts.In summary, aged Nrf2 /mice develop all major types of human age-related cataracts at a high prevalence. Nrf2/lenses retain cortical fiber cell nuclei, suggesting a role for Nrf2 in terminal differentiation of late-born lens fiber cells. Understanding the roles of Nrf2 in normal lens homeostasis will generate new insights into the processes of cataractogenesis and will generate new leads into the devel- opmentofanti-cataracttreatments.Thisnewmodelofhighly prevalent age-related cataracts should facilitate drug discov- ery and testing.
