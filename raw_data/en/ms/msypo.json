This week I has the extreme pleasure of visiting Bev, the owner for a couples massage outside on her gorgeous balcony. With me was my divine soul mate and love of my life and together we blissfully fell into a magical healing experience. With all due respect to heaven, this sacred space is heaven on earth. Bev has special gifts in her hands and her heart. She met us at a common spot and lead us up a huge mountain hill to her apartment where the sessions are offered. The water view from the balcony is spectacular and being high up a hillside facilitates breezes which make this outside experience even better. She offers an anti-gravity hammock which releases tension in the lower back and allows one to lightly float before the massage begins. The massages itself was customized for both of us and my Love connected with Bev in a spiritual way. My massage was relaxing and luxurious. After we were served a special cooling drink that Bev made which hit the spot perfectly. If you are looking for a massage on St John, there are many to choose from. Most like Bev are independent. I cannot recommend Point Wellness enough. Come see what Bev's special gift can do for you. This is my second time visiting Beverly while vacationing on St John. Our group of three enjoyed antigravity yoga and massage and will absolutely do it again. We leave feeling refreshed and free from the tension travel can sometimes bring on. This aerial yoga exceeded our expectations - it was both an unexpectedly good workout as well as therapeutic! Beautiful views, fun, relaxing and very different way to experience St. John! Highly recommend this to anyone visiting the area. Enjoy this amazing experience while overlooking Cruz Bay! Bev was a knowledgable and experienced instructor. She is a fun and easy person to be around. I felt relaxed and ready for the day after my workout. I will definitely be a repeat client when I go back to St. John. Thank you, Bev! Carole T We started the day with breathtaking ocean views doing antigravity yoga (first time for both of us). So fun! Bev is an excellent instructor. We continued with a couples massage, followed by lunch by the pool! Perfect relaxing spa day! Bev is an absolute jewel and made this experience so fab! My 2 friends and I had our first experience with antigravity yoga with Bev in June. We had a fun, educational experience with her and thoroughly enjoyed our time there! We followed the antigravity session with an hour massage, on the balcony overlooking Great Cruz. Ladies, this is a MUST DO, trust me! My friends and I traded experience stories after and we each agreed they were one of the best massages we have ever had! It was such a great experience and I'm so glad we booked with Bev!! Thank you so, so much to Bev and her staff!! Much Love "}
