Every single person has capacities, abilities, and gifts, and the quality of an individual life in part depends on the extent to which these capacities are used, abilities expressed, and gifts given. Just as individual lives are enhanced by the opportunity to give, communities are made stronger when residents use their full potential by directing their capacities toward the well-being of the neighborhood. As communities attempt to build a healthy future, they must often struggle against a development perspective that encourages them to see only their needs and deficiencies. But most communities have already experienced what happens when they focus solely on what is missing in their community, and they know that this approach does not produce positive results. In fact every community has needs, problems, and deficiencies; the choice for community groups is whether that is all they want to focus on. Like a glass of water filled to the middle which can be viewed as either half empty or half clients havedeficiencies and needscitizens havecapacities and gifts full, a community can be seen as a half-empty place comprised of clients with needs and deficiencies, or as a place half-full of citizens with capacities and gifts to give. Table of Contents i A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight One critical part of building a healthy community is finding out what individual capacities each resident possesses. Collectively, these individual capacities represent an important asset for the community. They comprise a powerful \"tool\" that can be used to address problems, promote growth, and enhance the quality of local life. The less a community knows about itself and its citizens' capacities, the easier it is to fall into a pattern of seeing the community and its people only through a \"needs\" perspective. The more a community becomes familiar with itself and its citizens, the more obvious it becomes that what is good about a community far outweighs whatever needs it may have. Additionally, it becomes clear that the challenges a community faces can be addressed most effectively by using the capacities that already exist there, rather than looking somewhere else for answers. What is the purpose of this guide? This guide was developed to report how a number of community groups used an asset-based approach in their community-building efforts, and how they developed and implemented a capacity inventory project through which they identified and mobilized the gifts and skills of local people. The asset-based community-building approach illustrated in this guide was developed by John McKnight and John Kretzmann and presented in their manual, Building Communities From the Inside Out. That book contains a single example of an individual capacity inventory. This guide introduces a much wider variety of inventories, used in different kinds of communities for many different community-building purposes. Who should use this guide? Groups and organizations of all kinds have used the asset-based approach in their community building efforts. The range of groups who have developed and used a capacity inventory include: Large and small organizations ranging from government entities with many partners, to small neighborhood groups with just a few members. Formal organizations and informal collections of community residents. Groups addressing a variety of issues, such as health, education, economic development, cultural enhancement, youth development, etc. Rural groups and urban groups. Funded groups and groups who operate with volunteers. Chapter One - Introduction 5 A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight Any kind of group or organization can adapt the capacity inventory process for use in their own particular community-building efforts. The point is to shift the focus from community needs to community capacities, and the capacity inventory allows an organization to do just that by asking about the personal \"gifts\" that individuals can contribute toward building their community: What are the skills they can put to work? What are the abilities and talents they can share? What are the experiences from which they have learned? What are the interests and dreams they would like to pursue? Once collected, the aggregate information forms a knowledge base about local capacities that can be mobilized toward community building. These powerful human resources can be directed toward: Promoting economic growth, local enterprises, and job connections. Organizing local community-building activities and projects. Showcasing local talents, and celebrating community. Facilitating citizen action around critical issues. Rebuilding relationships, trust, and \"social capital.\" More about the capacities communities discover. Community organizations are almost always surprised by the extent of the individual capacities they find as a result of doing a capacity inventory. Individuals possess many more capacities than are apparent without asking, because most people do not publicize their individual capacities beyond listing them on a resume, using them in the voluntary work they do, or sharing them with immediate family members. The leader of one community organization in rural California expresses the general astonishment shared by most groups who have started to discover the extent of the gifts of local people through the use of the capacity inventory: We never guessed how much we would find! People checked off so many things they could offer to each other! Table of Contents i A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight In fact, what all community groups discover through the capacity inventory process, is that every community resident possesses an extensive array of individual capacities. The capacities that have been discovered by most groups come in the form of: Skills in a wide range of categories, including creative skills, office and retail skills, service-related skills, caregiving skills, maintenance and repair skills, construction skills, and many more. Abilities and talents including art, story-telling, crafts, gardening, teaching, sports, political interest, organizing, volunteering, and more. Interests such as the sharing of skills, enthusiasm for learning and exploring new ideas, participating in a new activity. Experiences such as travel experiences, educational, or life experiences that give the individual a unique perspective to share. Community building results: What local capacities can produce. Once discovered, these capacities can be mobilized towards all sorts of community-building projects. The six community organizations whose experiences we feature here each found an enormous range of capacities among their local residents and successfully mobilized them into building strong local programs. After identifying the issues upon which they wanted to focus, these organizations used the issues as opportunities for local people to utilize their capacities and give their gifts. In every case, these organizations found that using the capacity inventory as a community-development tool produced both tangible and intangible results. Both are important; both contribute to the overall well-being of a community. Tangible results generally take the form of specific community-building or economic development activities that emerge out of the increased awareness of residents and organizations about their own capacity to act effectively. Here are examples of some tangible results reported by community groups who have conducted an individual capacity inventory among local residents. Economic development: Linking existing businesses with new markets. Making employers aware of the skills of potential employees in the community. Sponsorship of the start-up of a catering business. Chapter One - Introduction 7 A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight Producing a community income and balance sheet. Establishing an advisory group for a primary business corridor. Showcasing the talents of local start-up businesses at a fund-raiser. Mobilizing community creative talent to produce a community celebration and arts fair. Raising funds for community projects. Establishing new public transportation routes to enable isolated consumers to patronize local businesses. Increasing availability of critical resources such as child or respite care. Identifying retirees in the community who can assist local groups with professional expertise. Identifying opportunities for local employment so that local residents can work within the local economy. Organizing people to address issues: Identifying new participants for community organizations and local issue campaigns. Organizing resident management groups. Establishing a senior center. Starting a food bank that incorporates homebound disabled people and seniors in its management structure. Establishing a network of local people to supervise visitations among family members separated by child and family service agencies. Organizing a neighborhood skills center where participants decide what will be taught. Building trust and \"social capital\" through connections and linkages: Creating intergenerational linkages between elders and children. Connecting two troubled teens in different parts of the country who now share a supportive \"pen-pal\" relationship over the internet. Identification of a homebound man with computer expertise who can tutor young students. Connecting families of children with mental illnesses so they can jointly advocate for their children. Linking a man who lost everything in a fire to an advocate who could assist him in the process of rebuilding his life. Creating supportive links among families with problems. Providing opportunities for people to volunteer to share with others. Table of Contents i A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight Civic involvement: Registering voters and providing transportation to polling places. Creating volunteer advocacy networks for assisting families through interactions with institutions and agencies. Involving more adults in youth activities such as sports teams or clubs. Monitoring by residents of an urban greenspace project. Identifying neighborhood people who can act as spokespeople on issues of concern to community members. Opening opportunities for volunteer action for the benefit of the community. From the examples you can see that tangible results can be small-scale or large-scale, and can involve relationship building among just a few individuals with common interests, or multiple entities ranging from individual residents to large institutions. The leader of one community organization that has grown over many years into a major community development corporation shares the pride he feels in the group's accomplishments: We started out as a small group just trying to prevent the total destruction of our community by outside developers and city agencies. Now we are about to embark on the largest manufacturing project to be undertaken in the city of New York in 50 years, in which we will employ more than 1,500 local residents! Intangible results are sometimes harder to identify, but are certainly no less important. Members of the communities engaged in the asset-based development process often speak about the positive perspective that nearly everyone develops as a result of gathering and working with individual capacities. Intangible results are usually those differences in feelings and attitudes that result from seeing the community and its members in a new way--as a collection of capacities rather than a set of needs. Here are some examples of intangible results reported by residents who have engaged in an individual capacity inventory. Community spirit and pride are enhanced. Individuals see themselves differently--as citizens with the capacity and authority to ask questions, and the power and ability to initiate and carry out the changes they desire. Chapter One - Introduction 9 A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight Community members previously identified only by their problems, for example, \"too old,\" \"too young,\" \"too poor,\" suddenly are viewed as contributing members of the community. Community members who once looked around their neighborhood and saw only problems, now see the limitless possibilities that exist. People are more willing to reach out to their neighbors, get to know them, and begin to build relationships that depend only upon individual trust and caring, rather than always asking outsiders for help. Community residents develop a new sense of hope about themselves and their future, and increased confidence about and their ability to build a better life. One woman's personal change exemplifies many of the intangible results we heard about: I've lived in this neighborhood a long time and I always used a post office box instead of my address. I didn't want people to know where I was from because I was embarrassed. Since doing the survey and all of us see how many great people, places, and resources we have here, I feel different. We have a lot going for us. I feel proud of our neighborhood and how we are the ones making things happen. Now I use my own address. When we say \"building community from the inside out\" we are referring to both tangible and intangible outcomes that result from the community building process. Believing in oneself and one's neighbors and the individual and collective ability to accomplish something worthwhile is just as important as the concrete outcome of actually starting a new enterprise. In fact, they are reverse sides of the same accomplishment. Believing in the capacity to accomplish goals is necessary before concrete goals can be successfully achieved. Remember, successful community building depends on both: Building a belief in the capacities of local people, and Mobilizing their capacities to produce concrete outcomes. Table of Contents i A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight The rest of this guide is presented in three parts. The remainder of Chapter One introduces the six organizations whose experiences are featured in this guide. Chapter Two is devoted to sharing the experiences of these community groups as they incorporated an individual capacity inventory into their community-building plan. Chapter Three offers tips and lessons learned by these organizations about how to successfully conduct an inventory of the capacities of local residents. Chapter Four briefly introduces some other resources for helping build communities from the inside out, including the Neighborhood Economic Series, a set of three workbooks that each explain a step-by-step process for accomplishing a specific component of whole-community economic mobilization. The Appendix provides additional examples of successful individual capacity inventories adapted and used by still other organizations. The six community groups featured in Chapter 2 succeeded both in building a belief in the capacities of local residents, and in mobilizing these capacities to produce concrete community-building outcomes. Results were achieved when individual residents began to see themselves as the core ingredients in problem solving related to their own and others concerns. In each case committing to conduct a capacity inventory, designing the questions, gathering the information, and then assessing how to connect individuals and create strong relationships became the very process of community building. The information shared by these groups comes directly from their citizen/members and includes what they have learned and accomplished from using an asset-based approach. The organizations featured here are unique in many ways. We've tried to include organizations representing different kinds of membership, different kinds of places, and different styles or organizing. For each group we attempt to answer each of the following questions: Who are the members of this organization? How many are there? Are they individuals or is the group a consortium of associations or organizations? What is the organization's purpose? Why did they come together and what are they trying to accomplish? How did they go about designing their capacity inventory? How did they translate their ideas into a set of inventory questions? How did they go about conducting their capacity inventory? Were local residents involved in every phase of the project? Chapter One - Introduction 11 A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight How are they using the information they learned? In what concrete ways are the capacities of individuals being incorporated in community-building efforts? While each organization may be different along some of these dimensions, the one thing each and every organization shares is a commitment to seeing themselves and their members as a collection of assets and capacities and to building on their internal resources. The capacity inventory developed by each one is incorporated into their individual stories so that you will be able to see how each organization tailored their inventory to meet their specific needs. Introduction to the community organizations. The Family Support Network (FSN) is made up of families whose focus is to promote connections for the purpose of resource sharing, advocacy, and mutual support. They are located in the Seattle area, and their membership currently includes 150 families. FSN uses volunteers from among the membership to conduct an individual capacity inventory, to maintain a databank of the capacities of local families, and to facilitate an exchange of resources among its members. The organization was originally started by a working mother who realized that just as she herself needed help to keep up with the routine demands of daily life, so did other families. Interfaith Action is a church-based community organization in Minneapolis. Among its activities the 25 member churches focus on economic development in low-income neighborhoods, which they pursue through their own community development corporation. Interfaith Action currently counts as members more than 500 families. The organization uses church volunteers to distribute their capacity inventory, which is primarily focused on discovering the economic capacities among its member families. Originally formed to consolidate local power in response to discriminatory practices by institutions in their community, the group subsequently decided to incorporate an asset-based perspective into their development efforts. The Sierra County Children's Health Collaborative (SCCHC) is a network of organizations and individuals whose purpose is working together to find ways to promote community health by focusing on the health of their children. SCCHC is a rural organization serving a sparsely populated, mountainous county covering 900 square miles in California. Collaboration workers conduct capacity inventories, enter the information into a computerized system, and promote connections among individuals. Table of Contents i A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight They help people meet in settings in which they can share their capacities to improve the nutritional, emotional, physical, spiritual, and economic health of children and families. SCCHC originally formed in response to a funder's Request for Proposals that called for an agenda for community action around health issues. The Neighborhood Pride Team (NPT) is an organization whose membership is comprised of formerly isolated individuals whose purpose is discovering their individual and collective strengths and using these strengths for community problem solving, especially in terms of economic development. NPT is located in a struggling and isolated Portland neighborhood, and its membership currently includes 60 women and 7 men. Individual members conduct a capacity inventory among their neighbors and then work to link people with similar interests to undertake activities for creating local economic opportunities, promoting self esteem, and developing careers. Originally organized with a general goal of reducing the isolation of the families living in the economically disadvantaged area, NPT has created a vision that promotes pride, economic development, and hope for the future. The Mutual Partnerships Coalition (MPC) is made up of large and small groups ranging from health maintenance organizations to churches. Their purpose is to work together toward community well-being by bringing youth and the elderly into intergenerational networks that focus on reducing isolation and improving health. A Seattle group, MPC has five member organizations representing many individuals. Each member group employs a \"community guide,\" an individual who conducts capacity inventories among local residents and facilitates linkages among those individuals whose needs and interests correspond. The MPC coalition originally came together to respond to a challenge from a large foundation to develop community health projects that would promote stronger communities. Banana Kelly Community Improvement Association (BK) is a large, not-for-profit community development corporation whose purpose is building community through activities in housing, economic development, and education. BK is an urban organization located and serving residents in the South Bronx. BK conducts a capacity inventory among residents in order to mobilize them in their many economic development and housing management efforts. The organization originally started as a community response to the activities of several institutions who were moving to displace local residents. BK is currently responsible for the largest new manufacturing project to be undertaken in New York City in 50 years, and plans to employ at least 1,500 local residents in this development effort. Chapter One - Introduction 13 A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight The organizations featured in this guide and the stories they share represent just a few of the creative ways that community groups around the country are making the asset-based development process work for them. Each of these organizations has taken the idea of building communities from the inside out and applied it to their own particular circumstances and settings. Each one has taken the original capacity inventory design and modified it so that it is able to capture the kind of specific information about local residents they feel will be most useful in the asset-mobilization project they have designed for themselves and their community. No two of the organizations featured here are exactly alike, although they each share at least one or two characteristics with one or more of the other groups. Membership The membership of the Family Support Network and the Neighborhood Pride Team are made up primarily of individuals living in neighborhoods; Interfaith Action's membership includes families affiliated with 25 churches across the larger metropolitan area; the Sierra County Children's Health Collaborative, the Mutual Partnerships Coalition, and the Banana Kelly Community Improvement Association have a combination of individual, organizational, and institutional members. Location Banana Kelly, Interfaith Action, and the Mutual Partnerships Coalition are urban organizations, while the Sierra County Children's Health Collaborative is a rural group, and the Family Support Network and the Neighborhood Pride Team are located in small neighborhoods situated in larger urban centers. Surveyors The Neighborhood Pride Team, the Family Support Network, and Interfaith Action use volunteers to conduct their capacity inventory; the Sierra County Children's Health Collaborative uses local schools to distribute the inventory; member groups in the Mutual Partnerships Coalition hire community guides who conduct the inventory among local residents; and Banana Kelly conducts the inventory among new residents in the buildings they manage and among local people who come into contact with any one of their sub-groups. Table of Contents i A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight Uses and results Interfaith Action, Banana Kelly, and the Mutual Partnerships Coalition use the capacity inventory as the basis for large- and small-scale local economic development projects; The Sierra County Children's Health Collaborative and the Family Support Network use the capacity inventory as the basis for improving the general health of community members by creating and expanding networks of local people who can exchange resources with one another; and the Neighborhood Pride Team uses the capacity inventory for both expanding relationships and creating job and career opportunities. The remainder of this guide explores the organizations and their goals in more depth, explains the way they made use of the asset-based approach, and shares some of the lessons they learned in the process of building community from the inside out. In addition, each story includes a reproduction of the actual capacity inventory used by the different groups. For examples of capacity inventories developed by groups other than those featured in this guide, please refer to the Appendix where five more unique examples are provided. Please note that while we have attempted to reproduce each of the inventories as exactly as possible, in the interest of space we have eliminated most of the blank lines that each group originally included for entering the answers provided by the individuals. Chapter Two - Sharing the Experience 15 Family Support Network A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight CHAPTER TWO SHARING THE EXPERIENCE This chapter will report the experiences of six very different communities, each of which has created its own tools and methods of mapping and mobilizing the capacities of local residents. Each of these stories contains valuable lessons for community builders everywhere. FAMILY SUPPORT NETWORK An urban network of families working together on a voluntary basis to promote family-based connections for the purpose of resource sharing and mutual support The Family Support Network (FSN) is made up of families who joined together to create people-to-people connections that allow individuals and families to support one another. Its members believe that it is a good system for building community. FSN is about sharing and caring, and the network focuses on peer support. Network meetings connect people who ordinarily would not be in relationship, for example, a homeless man and a judge. The Family Support Network provides a way for families to increase their participation in the everyday life of their community. The Family Support Network is a \"ramp into everyday life,\" a thriving environment where building community happens through a caring, lively, and fun process of neighbor-to-neighbor exchange. Belonging to the network is like being part of a big extended family. Members gather for fun, companionship, support, and when needed, help from their neighbors. The FSN connects people together by phone, e-mail, or personal contact. Neighborhood gatherings are offered on a regular basis to provide people in the community a place to meet, share a meal and discuss various topics of interest. Local agencies utilize the FSN to enhance support services to their clients and help them be more self-sufficient. Based in the Seattle area, FSN's membership includes 250 families from across America. How does the network function? Each individual or family completes a registration form which includes a brief capacity inventory. Those with computers can register through the FSN website which immediately transfers the information directly into the FSN 16 Chapter Two - Sharing the Experience Family Support Network A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight Databank. The databank provides the basis for all communication, organizing, and matching of network members. Each family in the network has agreed to share their gifts and resources with other families and in return receive access to the gifts and resources of other families. All families agree to participate on a regular basis to keep the connections going among all members. A packed and informative newsletter keeps the members informed of upcoming activities and opportunities for involvement. The FSN is an informal organization and is operated totally by volunteers. A variety of jobs are available, each one considered an integral part of the functioning network. Good Neighbors include all the members of the network. They connect with their neighbors--other network members--whenever a reason arises. People become good neighbors by filling out a capacity inventory and agreeing to become part of the network of supportive families. Recently, the FSN capacity inventory has been used to sign up long-distance Good Neighbors on the FSN website. Family Advocates participate in a training course in order to be prepared to advocate for and support member families when they are dealing with bureaucracies or systems with which they may be unfamiliar, for example, health care providers, courts, social workers, or police. They use their skills to help families navigate these systems, and may accompany families who have meetings with one of these entities. Community Connectors are neighbors who use the database to connect people to others in the community in order to match requests, interests, or needs. Community Connectors track the inventory data and use their familiarity with the gifts and capacities of the network members to promote and facilitate the most appropriate connections. FSN Partners are businesses who contribute cash, time, expertise, services, and equipment to the FSN community networking activities. The Family Support Network has a wonderful track record of creating useful and valuable relationships. In 1995, out of 1,000 requests for connections, 96% resulted in successful connections with another member of the community. These matches were based on requests such as child care, respite care, providing transportation, negotiating debt payments, supervising child protection visits, sheltering fire victims, locating housing, and advocating for families with large bureaucracies. In addition, many connections were made for the simple purpose of connecting people with similar interests or in Chapter Two - Sharing the Experience 17 Family Support Network A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight response to the desire of members to share their gifts and capacities with other members of the network. The FSN volunteers find that almost every need, interest, or request can be matched by another Good Neighbor or Family Advocate in the network. The Family Support Network also offers its members several kinds of activities in which they can become involved in order to share their individual gifts and capacities. Family activities encourage members to get together for fun with neighbors and friends. FSN sponsors picnics, trips to the movies, ballgames, and camp-outs for its members. Neighborhood Gatherings allow members to get together for supportive talk about family issues--including divorce, mental health, family violence, and disruptive behavior--with other families facing the same situation. The Family Support Network was started by a working mother with four children who felt she needed help to keep up with all the demands made upon her in her life. Her personal need for a community of supportive people led to the development of a support network of families in her area that were experiencing similar stress and isolation. This woman's goal for the last 10 years has been to connect more neighbors to neighbors for the purpose of helping one another. Family Support Network success stories A mother with a child with serious physical disabilities was having trouble getting the school to provide adequate resources. An FSN Family Advocate was able to assist the mother to get the school to meet her demands for her child's well being. As a result of this connection, a friendship was formed between the two women and when the Family Advocate's child became aggressive at home, the mother was able to help out by taking the child for the weekend. The boy became a great support for the disabled child, and the two families continue in a nurturing relationship with one another. An elderly woman, concerned about health care issues, was connected with an isolated mother whose son had behavior problems. Connecting these two women has resulted in the mother helping the older woman with her health care difficulties; the older woman assisting with caring for the son; and the development of a solid friendship between two formerly isolated individuals. 18 Chapter Two - Sharing the Experience Family Support Network A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight A family living in public housing needed some shelves in their apartment. Their case worker connected them with the Family Support Network, who found people with the tools, skills, and materials that were necessary to build the shelves without delay. An e-mail connection was created between two troubled teenagers in different parts of the country. An advice and pen-pal relationship has developed. The Family Support Network's individual capacity inventory is fairly short and asks questions about the abilities and interests of the individual, their expertise, what outdoor and indoor activities they have experience doing, and what resources they have that they would be willing to share with other members of the community.

Interfaith Action is a coalition of churches that addresses a range of community issues including local economic development. Its recently formed Hispanic CTI Campaign (CTI) takes a major role in Interfaith Action's goals of creating more local jobs, promoting the start-up of new small businesses, and strengthening the local economy by keeping dollars circulating within the community. Three Latino churches have taken the lead in economic development efforts, and have made progress in developing business connections and organizing cooperative planning within the Latino community. These three churches form a strong and diverse component of Interfaith Action's membership, and their congregations represent more than 500 families. Located in Minneapolis and inner-ring suburbs, Interfaith Action was originally founded by members of local churches in order to challenge the failure of a local bank to comply with the Community Reinvestment Act. While continuing to use community organizing methods growing out of the tradition of the late Saul Alinsky, the group has subsequently added asset-based development tools and perspectives to its organizational approach. Interfaith Action is about community organizing, and for its members this means organizing powerful relationships using the most effective methods it can discover. Interfaith Action have found that as a group of community people start to develop vision, identify goals, and begin action toward reaching their goals, the inevitable result is movement along a pathway that involves both partnerships and confrontations. They therefore encourage their members to organize for the purpose of expanding relationships and power, and promote the idea that this interaction reflects a natural process in the development of effective leaders and a healthy community life. Interfaith Action has been able to consolidate their power and collectively address economic issues in their metro community. Their strength for action is rooted in their knowledge that their members possess many individual capacities and, collectively, extensive community assets. 22 Chapter Two - Sharing the Experience Interfaith Action A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight The individual capacity inventory developed by members of the Hispanic community is called a Community Talent Inventory, and is conducted among church members in one of the following three ways. First, pairs of church volunteers complete the inventory among individual members of local congregations. Second, the inventory is conducted among small groups of local residents whenever they gather. Third, it is used in what Interfaith Action calls a \"group blitz,\" an effort to conduct Sunday morning interviews among the occupants of the pews in local churches. Because Interfaith Action was especially interested in the potential start-up of small businesses and in residents' involvement in other local economic-development activities, organizers created a short capacity inventory consisting of only five basic questions. The questions gather information about residents' skills, interests, and experiences. Interfaith Action's inventory forms were prepared in both English and Spanish in order to accommodate the local residents and their language capabilities. Interfaith Action has conducted the inventories among more than 200 local church members. The results demonstrate that this Latino community is rich in individual talent, business acumen, and experience in arts and crafts, theater, sales, the music industry, and in specialty food and catering. The capacity inventory process helped members of Interfaith Action to discover the talent, skills, and capacities possessed by individuals residing within the community and to see new opportunities for development. As a result of using their capacity inventory among members of local congregations, Interfaith Action has successfully involved local entrepreneurs and local residents to work together toward whole-community economic development. Interfaith Action success stories Interfaith Action has several success stories to share that illustrate how information about individual capacities is being used. In one community area, mobilizing the individual capacities discovered by conducting 100 inventories has resulted in a computer literacy center for skills development and skills exchange. Chapter Two - Sharing the Experience 23 Interfaith Action A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight In another neighborhood, comprised mostly of Spanish-speaking immigrants, the information gathered through the completion of 60 individual capacity inventories is being used for job and enterprise development. Interfaith Action is partnering with various entities to establish a city-wide \"Fiesta de los Lagos\" festival, which will be a major ongoing program in the city of Minneapolis. Scheduled for kick-off in the Fall of 1998, a \"Fiesta\" is planned which will consist of a 3-day market featuring local arts and crafts, food, music, and celebration. The festivities at this annual street fair will showcase the talent and skills of Minneapolis' Latino community. Local entrepreneurs have been motivated to establish a small business training program in the community for the purpose of promoting new business start-ups. Interfaith Action is also currently negotiating with bankers and other established businesses to create a small business incubator, in order to provide support and technical assistance to new and growing businesses. This incubator is the first Mercado Centro in Minneapolis. After identifying 45 Spanish-speaking members interested in entrepreneurial activities but needing technical education, Interfaith Action members convinced a local technical school to hire a bilingual teacher and purchase Spanish-language textbooks in order to provide this assistance. In the Camden community of Minneapolis, the Talent Inventory led to the creation of new business/community association, the Camden Economic Development Association (CEDA), which is securing partners and resources to develop a commercial intersection in Camden. Interfaith Action's individual capacity inventory is brief and focuses on developing an understanding of the skills and abilities possessed by local residents and the extent to which they are interested in using these capacities in efforts to build the local economy. 24 Chapter Two - Sharing the Experience Interfaith Action A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 PHONE: INSTITUTION: LIST BELOW THE ANSWERS YOU GET TO THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: 1.

Their goal is to bring community residents together to work towards building strong, mutually helpful relationships, and in doing so, increase the health of everyone. SCCHC defines health in the broadest terms and focuses its efforts on a wide range of health issues including the nutritional, emotional, physical, spiritual, and economic health of their children, families, and community. The members of this organization come together through their participation in school-based parent associations. California's Sierra County is a rural area of 900 square miles near Lake Tahoe. More than three thousand people reside in this area and SCCHC would ultimately like to identify the gifts and capacities of each individual, and then connect them to one another. One big challenge has been the large size of the target area, and the sizable distance separating the residents. Consequently, Sierra County Children's Health Collaborative decided to organize and operate through the county's four elementary schools, a strategy that allows them to build connections through parents' involvement in their children's schools. SCCHC has established the Sierra Kids Action Network (SKAN) as a mechanism for people to connect. SKAN is a computerized system that offers opportunities for people to get involved. Regular volunteer activities include: Tutoring for young people who need help with their academic work. Assisting community residents, both adults and children, with a variety of issues, such as improving access to medical care, and increasing knowledge about and use of local programs. Connecting parents so that they can work collectively on issues affecting youth, such as linking young people to local institutional programs and resources, and helping young people prepare for learning. 26 Chapter Two - Sharing the Experience Sierra County Children's Health Collaborative A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight Identifying business and community leaders who might be prepared to make presentations in the classrooms. The information in the SKAN system is collected through the use of an individual capacity inventory which SCCHC calls a \"Community Resources Inventory.\" The collaboration has completed 249 inventories to date, from among parents involved in one of the four elementary schools. Capacity inventories are completed either by a collaborative employee who meets with families in one-to-one settings, or individually by parents when they come to their local schools for an event or activity. This process is helping them to generate a complete understanding of parents' skills, interests, and abilities. A second inventory also captures information about the concerns parents have about the young people of Sierra County. SCCHC workers have been excited by the extent of the information they are collecting for the computer database. They report that people have indicated both that they have many more skills and resources than they ever imagined, and that they are very willing to share them with each other. The capacity inventory was designed to allow two people in a household to respond, in the hopes of getting both parents to participate. Because SCCHC hopes to find out more about each individual than just their current skills, they ask each person to indicate both: whether or not they possess a particular skill or experience, and whether or not they are willing to get involved in a project that uses that skill or experience. Sierra County Children's Health Collaborative has a toll-free 800 telephone number for people to call to tap into the SKAN database and to help make connections. Refrigerator magnets have been distributed throughout the county to advertise the telephone number and familiarize residents with the project. In addition, pamphlets sent home with school children describe the benefits of participation and the matching process. Because the collaboration has been successful so far, the organization plans to expand the project to include other county residents who do not have elementary school aged children. In addition, they plan to create and use a capacity inventory for children because they believe that children represent another untapped resource in their community, with skills and capacities to contribute. Chapter Two - Sharing the Experience 27 Sierra County Children's Health Collaborative A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight Sierra County Children's Health Collaborative originated when residents of the county responded to a foundation invitation to organize a community agenda around health concerns. From the beginning, residents seized the opportunity not only to improve health, but to approach the work in a way that helped to bridge long-standing rifts between different groups in the county. By defining their project as county-wide, they linked two populations-- the West side of the county, where residents are primarily newcomers and \"urban transplants,\" and the East side of the county where residents are mostly long-settled families who make their living from cattle ranching or logging. Noting that the interests and concerns of the residents of these distinct parts of the county can be very different, SCCHC uses the common interest in children and children's health issues as a unifying theme around which to involve members from both parts of the county. Doing so has enabled SCCHC to successfully involve parents from all over the county in a common effort. Sierra County Children's Health Collaborative success stories SCCHC is just beginning to make new connections among the residents who have completed the capacity inventory process, but they have helped a number of people make new connections with other community members. The collaborative has discovered people with all kinds of skills, abilities, and interests, all of whom are willing to get involved in the community for the purpose of exchanging skills, care, and information. Resident artists have been connected with the elementary schools so that children can benefit from their expertise and knowledge. Story tellers (23 in fact!), have been identified, and have contributed their time at the schools and at community functions. A retired elementary school teacher has been connected with a school that was not able to offer any early childhood education courses. Because of the match, there are now two such courses offered at the school. The information in the SKAN database is available to anyone in the county to use for the purpose of making connections with other community members. The people in this county are quickly developing a community of tight relationships by recognizing each others' gifts, and by organizing ways to contribute together to make a more healthy place for young people to learn and grow. 28 Chapter Two - Sharing the Experience Sierra County Children's Health Collaborative A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight COMMUNITY RESOURCES INVENTORY The purpose of this Community Resources Inventory is to identify the gifts, strengths, and abilities that you are willing to share with the community.

NPT has three specific goals toward which they direct their energies: Creating and finding job opportunities with easy access for their residents. Providing job training and building the self-esteem necessary to promote residents' successful transition to new jobs, while honoring the survival skills developed by the women living in the community. Building a new sense of community pride. NPT is located in a community on the Southeast side of Portland. Because the area was only recently annexed into the city, the neighborhood lacks infrastructure such as sewers, well paved streets, sidewalks, and streetlights. The area still feels like a small rural town, and becoming part of the larger urban area has been a struggle for the residents of the community. Over half the residents of the community are living below median income and more than 30% of the resident adults have not completed high school. A large proportion of women receive public assistance and are the single heads of households. As a result, agencies representing the urban area approached the residents of this community with the attitude that they needed help, causing increased withdrawal by residents who began to be embarrassed by their place of residence. But NPT members are not comfortable with the notion that they are a community of people who need services. They prefer to define for themselves the things that need to be done locally, and to focus on the strengths of the local residents and their capacity to address issues. 38 Chapter Two - Sharing the Experience Neighborhood Pride Team A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight The Neighborhood Pride Team works directly with local individuals, promoting relationships in order to decrease isolation and build the local economy. While the city encourages recruitment through the network for employees at far-away jobs, the residents themselves want to develop micro-enterprise in their area so that they have access to ways of making a living right in the community. To this end they are developing a micro-enterprise lending program, a temporary job service, and a job matching and skills exchange program. The capacity inventory is the foundation of NPT's work. Because they felt that the usual statistics about their community presented a narrow and negative view, the women of NPT decided to focus on the strengths and capacities of community residents. Designing and conducting the inventory allowed women to meet with each other in their homes. This process facilitated talking to one another, and the spreading of a new sense of pride in themselves and their neighborhood. Residents were inspired by this new view of themselves, as people with talent, experience, skills, and a broad range of interests. They realized that they could connect with one another to share their skills and create new opportunities. The Neighborhood Pride Team's slogan is \"Encourage, Educate, Empower,\" which they do through the use of their capacity inventory. NPT members conduct the inventory among community residents in a one-to-one setting, and always with a person with whom they are acquainted. \"Cold calls\" are not a part of NPT's inventory process. With assistance from a local university, the Neighborhood Pride Team established a computer database into which they enter information from their individual capacity inventories. An NPT member was trained to operate the system, although she had never used a computer prior to this project. She is currently the resident expert and is comfortable working with both NPT members and the university staff. Currently the Neighborhood Pride Team continues to gather information about the community and to establish connections among residents. NPT has completed 115 inventories of skills and interests and makes the data available to local people for the purpose of creating matches. A number of surprise skills have surfaced: the neighborhood has discovered a resident sword swallower, a llama bridle maker, a motorcycle circus aerialist, and many musicians. In addition, many skills potentially useful for small businesses have emerged, and many matches have been made for skills and work exchange. NPT hopes to increase their membership to 200, with a capacity inventory completed for each one. They are also working on an inventory of neighborhood small businesses in order to identify those that could be matched to individual job skills, or strengthened for a better community. Chapter Two - Sharing the Experience 39 Neighborhood Pride Team A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight The Neighborhood Pride Team began with a handful of women who went door-to-door to meet their neighbors to do HIV/AIDS awareness education and to organize for a safer community for local kids. They discovered that there were strong women living in the community, but that too many of these women were isolated and afraid to enter community life. The Neighborhood Pride Team transformed the community and its attitude through its capacity inventory project. Through their involvement in NPT, neighborhood residents are now proud to be identified with their community, and recognize themselves as a group of people with both individual skills and capacities and collective strengths. Working with NPT has brought new self-respect and self-esteem to community members by focusing on people's gifts and building relationships among residents. Neighborhood Pride Team success stories NPT created a Community Development Corporation to develop the capacities of residents, and has started a neighborhood-operated Job Skill Center which offers computer training classes, bookkeeping, and literacy. Members of NPT have successfully registered more than 100 new residents to vote. A local Boys and Girls Club was looking for a crafts teacher, and the NPT database was able to provide the names of 8 people in the neighborhood who had craft skills they were willing to share. Two women who seemed to be lonely and without challenging activities to engage their energy, were identified by the capacity inventory as having cooking skills. Enlisted to cook for an NPT event, they became friends and continue to contribute their skills in local cooking projects. A young mother, overwhelmed by the demands of a teething baby, used the database to find someone in her neighborhood who had time available and could help her with housekeeping chores. A healthy working relationship and a close friendship developed from this connection. A local woman with a love for animals was enlisted to assist families who found that they had to take an animal to the local shelter. A couple who were talented musicians but unknown in the community, lamented that they were never invited to play at musical events. Through the inventory process, their skills were identified, and a local CDC invited them to play for a group of 400 community people, where they were able to showcase and share their talents. 40 Chapter Two - Sharing the Experience Neighborhood Pride Team A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight NEIGHBORHOOD PRIDE TEAM SURVEY OF SKILLS AND INTERESTS We are doing a survey to find out about the skills and interests of people in our neighborhood.

MPC focuses its energy and resources toward: Identifying and mobilizing the capacities of local young people and elderly residents in an effort to promote mutually supportive intergenerational relationships. The motto of this coalition is: \"A gift that is not given is not a gift,\" and they look to members of these age groups to give their unique gifts, especially to one another. MPC is located in Seattle and reaches out to residents in Seattle's central urban area. In addition to its primary purpose of fostering healthy intergenerational relationships, MPC also has several long-term goals. These include: Testing whether mutually-supportive matches among community members result in improved well being, especially among isolated youth and seniors. Building a broad base of local residents to participate in the program. Promoting change in social service organizations to include a focus on building on the strengths of individuals. Ensuring the continuation of the relationship-building work and its control by community members by encouraging each member organization to \"spin off\" with its own asset-based projects, expanding the scope of the original organization and its resources. Each member organization in the Mutual Partnerships Coalition employs a community member as a \"community guide\" whose job is to conduct capacity inventories among community residents and match individuals to other individuals or groups based on interests and needs. Matching activities are especially focused on creating lasting links between young people and the elderly for the purpose of promoting community health. 48 Chapter Two - Sharing the Experience Mutual Partnerships Coalition A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight Members of the Mutual Partnerships Coalition designed three inventories with which to gather information from members of the different constituencies on which they focus: Elderly individuals living in the community, especially those who might be isolated, so that they can be connected to young people and to organizations that can use their skills. Youth living in the community in order that they might develop lasting relationships with members of the elderly population. Organizations, such as human service agencies and churches are included in the capacity inventory process so that they can be connected to individual participants and develop opportunities to give and share as well. These three types of inventories--The Individual Capacity Profile, The Youth Capacity Profile, and The Group/Program Capacity Profile--are short, simple to complete, and are conducted in a one-to-one conversation between the community guide and the individual or organization. Using this process individual gifts are identified and incorporated into a \"gift bank,\" a resource that has facilitated the matching of over 500 individuals. The gift bank is computerized and allows for easy access and quick retrieval of the information that helps the community guides to make appropriate matches. Once a connection has been made, MPC uses a Match Tracking Form which allows them to follow up on the success of linkages they have made between individuals and organizations. The capacity inventories represent the principle tool the Mutual Partnerships Coalition uses to collect, sort, and match interests of youth and elders. One particularly interesting feature of MPC's inventory system is that it is designed to collect stories from elders. From these stories, community guides identify seniors who are good candidates to develop new relationships because of similar pasts, or shared dreams or experiences. The Coalition was originally formed in 1990 to build stronger connections among a constituency of frail, elderly people who were isolated from other members of the community. Because its members believe that both the elderly and youth can sometimes be ignored when communities look around for gifted people, they focused their work on building intergenerational relationships between these groups. In 1992 the work of MPC was recognized by the Kellogg Foundation, whose 3.5 million dollar grant is directed toward mobilizing the capacities of each group. MPC can whole-heartedly say that when people pay attention to \"giftedness\" and to each other, relationships form, energy builds, and life and community health improves. Chapter Two - Sharing the Experience 49 Mutual Partnerships Coalition A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight Mutual Partnerships Coalition success stories MPC shares a wonderful success story about Lloyd Shelly and his LINKAGE project. Mr. Shelly, who is 84 years old, decided that linking home-bound elders by telephone would be a good idea. He created a community link in which participating elders get 2-3 calls every day. Seventy elderly people are a regular part of this circle of support and care. Mr. Shelly runs this project and the MPC staff helps him out as necessary. Another story of successful matches made by MPC involves local seniors, community organizations, residents, and an elementary school. The neighborhood had no easily accessible facility where seniors could meet for social activities. The community groups, residents, and Capitol Hill Seniors worked together to gain community support, funding, and planning assistance for a senior center which opened its doors in January of 1995. The program--Seniors at Lowell: Bridging the Generations--is located at Lowell Elementary school and provides a place where seniors gather for social activities, classes, exercise, and opportunities to connect. In return for space for the center, seniors spend 30 hours per month tutoring children who are students at the school. The MPC inventory was also instrumental in identifying the need for and the capacity to operate a food bank for homebound seniors and disabled residents. Neighbors in the community now have a meaningful way to give their gifts, and everyone has grown through the opportunity to spend time with residents who were formerly isolated. The MPC capacity inventory discovered the hidden talents of one isolated and lonely elderly man and put them to work in an intergenerational project. This man is now active in writing political letters and articles, recruiting elders to tutor in the local elementary school, leading field trips, and sharing his knowledge about the US Navy with school children. He has started to enjoy life more and is happy with his new friends and \"grandchildren.\" MPC also made a connection that resulted in a relationship among seniors who love the theater. With the help of one senior with acting experience, a theater troupe has been organized. In their regular bookings throughout the Seattle area their skits, plays, and monologues address issues in the lives of older Americans. Part of MPC's success with their capacity inventory is the result of their willingness to keep it simple. Their system is straightforward and brief; none of the forms is longer than two sides of a single page. 50 Chapter Two - Sharing the Experience Mutual Partnerships Coalition A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight Interview Date: Mutual Driver's License?

Banana Kelly has a Board of Directors, 70% of whom are neighborhood residents; plus 120 full time employees and hundreds of volunteers, all of whom are residents of the community. BK has no formal membership process; it considers all the local residents to be part of its organizational efforts. Banana Kelly's explicit purpose is building community, and the organization focuses its activities around three main components of the community that are considered critical: Housing renovation, development, and management. Education, both formal and informal. Economic development in the local area. Banana Kelly is a large-scale development organization that has a clear understanding of how to regenerate community. It operates as a developer, a landlord, an educator, a convener, and through these activities, a community builder. Local people are key participants in every one of its development projects. In the near future it expects to employ 1,500 residents in a new $500 million paper recycling project which is the largest manufacturing project to be launched in New York City since World War II. BK has built more than 2,500 apartments in the local area, and continues to manage more than 1,000 of these. More than 75% of Banana Kelly staff live in one of these apartments. BK hires and trains building managers from among community residents, and gradually turns over operation of its buildings to the actual residents living there. Along with their dramatic successes in housing and economic development, Banana Kelly seeks to reorient community people to view themselves differently--to replace the idea that they are primarily collections of needs and deficits, with a perspective which emphasizes capacities and assets. Chapter Two - Sharing the Experience 55 Banana Kelly Community Improvement Association A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight Banana Kelly employees and volunteers have learned that many times less is more. They have learned to start their local projects with what they have within the neighborhood, instead of looking beyond their own area for answers and resources. They do not accept the commonly-held view of \"reality;\" and have learned to trust that they can create their own reality. Acting on the recognition that the members of the Longwood/Hunts Point community can do it themselves has resulted in an increased level of community-based power, which in turn has produced striking successes in BK's development efforts. Many times new residents come into contact with BK through some kind of referral from a social service program. Often they arrive deeply blinded by a needs and deficiencies view of themselves and the world. Banana Kelly uses a capacity inventory to identify the gifts and talents of residents, and as a way to move people to an assets view of the world. They also use the capacity inventory to mobilize individual gifts in redevelopment projects sponsored by the associations. The way Banana Kelly designs and conducts their community development projects reflects the relentless focus on assets and capacities. The first step is to ask of local residents, what do we want to do, and how can we make our dreams happen? The second step is to ask, what individual capacities and community assets do we have with which to accomplish this, i.e., how do we value the best of \"what is\"? The third step is to ask, how can we mobilize these assets and capacities? Finally, the last step is to ask, what do we need from outside our neighborhood in order to get the job done? Banana Kelly was formed in 1977 during a period when powerful New York institutions were attempting, in BK's view, to de-people the South Bronx. Unwilling to let their neighborhood and its residents be manipulated, the initiators of the organization started a community group whose purpose was to educate residents about community building, and about how to invite outsiders to help with plans for their community. BK began using a capacity inventory in the mid-1980s, as a means of expanding the community's education process to include educating residents about the assets-based approach to development. 56 Chapter Two - Sharing the Experience Banana Kelly Community Improvement Association A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight Banana Kelly Community Improvement Association success stories Banana Kelly has an impressive array of successes, including involving local residents in building large-scale projects related to housing, education, and economic development. Banana Kelly recently received approval and funding from the New York City Board of Education to open a high school that uses the Experiential Learning Project approach to education. Students will use their skills and learn through participation in hands-on community development projects, earning a high school diploma as they contribute to, and participate in, the redevelopment of their neighborhood. The school, which will work with 240 students, opens in the Fall of 1997. BK manages a self-employment training program and $2 million revolving loan fund for the benefit of the residents of the Longwood/Hunts Point community. Individuals with entrepreneurial interests can participate in a six-week training program that helps them design and construct a small business plan, and qualified new businesses are eligible for small business loans through the loan fund. After three years of negotiations, BK expanded its plans for a paper recycling business that will be located on vacant land in the South Bronx. This half-billion dollar industry will provide recycling services to all of New York City. BK successfully negotiated with the city of New York to include the labor-intensive component of materials sorting in the project plan in order to be able to offer more jobs to local residents. The most important success story arising from the Banana Kelly Community Improvement Association is the ongoing success they have in changing the attitudes and belief systems of the local residents. From a community in which most people initially saw only serious deficits and needs, BK has produced a dramatic shift to a focus on capacities and abilities. This shift has enabled the community to achieve significant results in its many redevelopment efforts.

Source: Place of Interview: Interviewer: Chapter Three - Lessons Learned 65 A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight CHAPTER THREE LESSONS LEARNED Each of the community groups whose stories we told in the previous chapter learned a great deal from the actual process of designing and conducting a capacity inventory as part of their local development efforts. In this chapter we share their experiences in terms of: The general lessons learned as a result of the going through the process. The specific lessons learned in terms of defining the necessary first steps in the design of an effective capacity inventory project. These first steps are related to both purpose and method. Tips on what works and what doesn't work on a capacity inventory project. The lessons learned are presented with examples in the form of additional stories that each group can tell about what knowledge the learning process produced for them. What lessons have been learned by the community groups who have already designed and used an individual capacity inventory? Each of the six organizations featured here adapted and utilized a version of the capacity inventory to collect information about local people, and then successfully used that information in such a way that it contributed to building some part or element of their communities. The ways that each group defined their goals, designed their project, collected the information, put the information to work, and ultimately measured their success are quite different, but they all share one common learning experience: one of the main lessons learned by each of these groups as they worked--and continue to work--their way through their unique method of community-building, is that successful community building results directly from two distinct parts of the process. Successful community building is the result of effectively using the information collected: Connections between people are created and/or strengthened in new ways as a result of the information gathered in the capacity inventory. Many of the gifts and talents of community members--hitherto hidden because we 66 Chapter Three - Lessons Learned A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight may focus only on how people earn a living--are revealed through the capacity inventory. Without the capacity inventory, the problems of neighborhood residents may be more apparent than the gifts they possess that can be directed into the community for increased well-being. Only through the deliberate pursuit of individual talents, experience, gifts, skills, and interests can we be assured that we have the necessary information to consider the full range of possible connections for action, problem solving, community building and organizing. Successful community building emerges from the process of conducting an individual capacity inventory: The capacity inventory process itself produces increased awareness of the capabilities and potential power of local people. The interviewer gains knowledge about the extent of the gifts available in the community that are available for incorporation into community-building projects, as well as increased self-esteem through the responsibility of gathering information and educating citizens about the goals of the project. The person being interviewed gains a sense of power and self-worth by being encouraged to focus on their own strengths and capabilities, and through having their capacities validated by the inventory questions. Individual and community pride increase as a result of the process, and people begin to see themselves as worthwhile contributors to the growth and health of their neighborhood. Change is the key. Because of the conversations that neighbors have with neighbors in the capacity inventory process, everyone is involved in a fundamental change in their view of themselves, their neighbors, and their community. People come together in this process to discover possibilities among themselves, possibilities that are within their control and capabilities. Necessary First Steps in Designing an Effective Capacity Inventory Project There is no one correct model for asset-based community building, no complete step-by-step-plan that can be routinely followed in every instance. But there are some standard ingredients that are necessary for making the most of the capacity inventory, and any organization that wants to use the process effectively should be certain they include these ingredients in their recipe for success. Once these ingredients have been incorporated, there are endless combinations of flavor and additional trimmings that can be added to make the community creation unique. But the core ingredients must be there in order to produce a successful and satisfying outcome. Chapter Three - Lessons Learned 67 A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight The critical ingredients that must be part of an asset-based community-building project are actually comprised of the answers to a set of questions that each community group needs to focus on very early in the process, and answer very carefully. These questions fall into the two general categories: The PURPOSE of the project The METHODS that will be used to carry out the project DEFINING THE PURPOSE: The main question a community group must answer when considering the purpose of the project is: How will the skills and capacities of local people be translated into meeting community-building goals? In order to answer this question more easily, it can be broken down into a series of more specific and targeted questions: 1 What is the general goal that community members hope to achieve from this capacity inventory project? 2 What kinds of specific goals can be identified that will help to make the general goal more concrete in terms of outcomes? 3 What kinds of questions need to be asked in order to generate the kind of information necessary to meet both the general and specific goals? 4 What mechanism will be developed to facilitate mobilizing the capacities of local individual toward accomplishing the two kinds of goals? Before a capacity inventory can be effectively designed, the community group must clarify what they hope to achieve through the process. Many groups begin by defining their goal as building relationships in order to build a stronger community. This is a valuable goal, and it answers the first question. However, in terms of developing a successful capacity inventory project, this general goal requires further definition because it does not lead directly to a logical set of questions to ask, or to the most effective mechanism for meeting the goal. The identification of more specific goals enables the organization to establish the concrete outcomes it hopes to achieve. In addition, once the specific goals have been identified, it will be a much easier task to design a capacity inventory tailored to the particular needs of the group. Clearly identified goals also make the task of choosing a mechanism for mobilizing capacities an easier task, because the mechanism usually follows from understanding the specific goals. So remember: 68 Chapter Three - Lessons Learned A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight General goals should be further defined into one or two specific, concrete goals. Defining specific, concrete goals leads to developing appropriate capacity inventory questions. Defining specific, concrete goals leads to choosing an appropriate mechanism for mobilizing the capacities of local individuals. An example of how this process works might look something like this: If the general goal is local economic development, the specific, concrete goal may be the start up of five new small businesses within a year. In this case, employment skills, business experience, and entrepreneurial interest may be the appropriate focus of the inventory questions. The appropriate mechanism for mobilizing the capacities of local individuals may consist of a computerized data base that itemizes each person's inventory responses, and, additionally, some sort of economic-development committee may be the an additional vehicle that will contribute toward making these five new businesses happen. Each of the six community organizations featured in this guide went through the process of figuring out their overall purpose by defining both at least one general goal and at least one specific goal prior to beginning their inventory design. In many cases, specific goals changed and developed over time, and new and expanded goals emerged. Based on these goals, each organization also developed a set of inventory questions. Finally, each one identified a mechanism for using the data collected about individual capacities to promote community connections and for incorporating the information into their community-building project. The Family Support Network defined their general goal as increasing the ability of families to share resources with one another without having to engage in a lengthy or difficult process. Their specific goal was to develop a databank to facilitate the sharing and exchange of resources, one that residents could use to locate other members of the community with resources to share. They designed a very simple, concise, one page survey on which an individual can simply check-off the resources they have they are willing to share with other community members. In addition to resources in the form of personal skills and expertise, the inventory also includes a section on tangible property to share, for example, boats, cabins, or computers. Chapter Three - Lessons Learned 69 A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight The general goal of Interfaith Action was to increase economic opportunity in their low-income neighborhoods. Their more specific goals were to create jobs, promote the start-up of small businesses, and develop a city-wide festival featuring the creative talents of individual citizens. Interfaith Action designed a short inventory that allow them to capture information about work and business experience. The Sierra County Children's Health Collaborative identified promoting community health by improving the health of local children as their community-building goal. They decided that their concrete goal would be the establishment of a community data base that would facilitate new connections and relationships among residents based on skills and capacities. Their inventory is designed to capture information from as many as two adults in the household, and records extensive data not only about skills possessed, but also about willingness to participate and share. The Neighborhood Pride Team's initial general goal was to collect broad and inclusive information about women's skills and interests in order to promote a renewed sense of community pride and increased local involvement. They defined their specific goals as creating and finding job opportunities for community residents, providing job training and building self-esteem, and building a new sense of the community as a place where talented people live. NPT used the same general set of questions as the capacity inventory in Building Communities From the Inside Out, modified to eliminate the necessity of asking all the questions if an individual reported no skills in a general category; and modified to incorporate the individual's willingness to become involved in activities whether or not they actually possess the skill. NPT developed a computer database to organize and access information about community members. The Mutual Partnerships Coalition identified promoting community health as their general goal, and refined it to the specific goal of creating supportive intergenerational relationships among members of their youth and elderly population. They therefore designed a capacity inventory specifically for each group, using open-ended questions designed to prompt a conversation between the interviewer and citizen. These questions capture a sense of the individual's skills, capacities, and interests, as well as the particular gifts each person feels they can give. One unique aspect of their inventory is that the elderly are given an opportunity to share their life story, as a method of promoting connections among people with similar histories. MPC has developed specific roles and responsibilities for its members as part of the process of connection and community building. 70 Chapter Three - Lessons Learned A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight The original goal of the Banana Kelly Community Improvement Association was to prepare its residents to participate in larger city discussions about the redevelopment of their neighborhood. Their concrete goal became education for residents about housing issues and the terms and language used by the professionals who were attempting to control their neighborhood. Over time BK added the goals of changing the thinking of residents and promoting economic development. These were translated into the goals of connecting with as many neighborhood people as possible through the capacity inventory process, and the promotion of several specific construction projects. BK also used the capacity inventory laid out in Building Communities From the Inside Out, in order to capture as many skills as possible, and in order to give people a good sense of the range of capacities that they possessed collectively. Banana Kelly brings people into the organization via the capacity inventory process, but does not currently maintain an enormous database of all the responses it receives. Establishing general and specific goals Each of these groups went through a process in which they discussed and identified their goals. For many groups, the general goal arose from a group of people responding to a need they saw in their community--for connection, for development, for improved self-esteem--but thinking through the capacity approach to those issues helped them to clearly identify some specific goals toward which to work. Deciding what questions to ask on the capacity inventory The informational requirements for the capacity inventory usually emerge as a result of defining the concrete goals, which is why the first steps are so important. There is an infinite amount of information that can potentially be gathered from local residents, and an infinite number of questions that can be asked, but it is important to recognize that it is neither possible nor appropriate to try to ask them all. In fact, the success of a community-building project can be diminished by an overly ambitious and lengthy capacity inventory. Collecting too much information, or collecting information without a purpose are a waste of valuable time. Too much information, especially if it is not clearly related to community-building goals often becomes cumbersome and awkward to use. Another danger is that people get so focused on the collection of data about individual capacities that they forget Chapter Three - Lessons Learned 71 A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight their vision for how assets will be tapped and gifts and resources shared among residents. So remember to design inventory questions based on how each piece of information will be utilized. Choosing the mechanism for mobilizing individual capacities The mechanism for mobilizing individual capacities can be simple or complex, and can come in a variety of forms: It can be an easily-accessed computer database that can analyze data and produce likely matches among individuals based on interests. It can be an informal network of residents who get to know their neighbors and promote sharing of skills and resources. It can be hired \"community helpers\" whose job it is to expand residents' knowledge of the people in their community, and promote connections among these individuals. It can be a formal community development corporation whose aim is to promote the economic health of a community. It can be any number of different things depending on the resources and creativity of the people involved. Each community group decides for itself which kind is most appropriate. The six groups featured here chose differently, but each has managed to turn the information they collected into new relationships directed at meeting their specific goals. The purpose of an asset-based community development project then, is all of these four steps--the general goal, the specific goal, the inventory, and the mechanism--combined together into a cohesive development plan. SELECTING THE MOST APPROPRIATE METHODS: The main question a community group must answer when considering the possible methods of organizing and conducting the project is: What methods of collecting, recording, and analyzing the capacity information will be most effective in this community, and who will participate in the process? 72 Chapter Three - Lessons Learned A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight In order to answer this question more easily, it can be broken down into a series of more specific and targeted questions: What is the most effective way to collect information from our residents, given the resources at our disposal? How many of our community residents do we want to interview? How will our interviewers be educated and trained in the capacity inventory approach and process? What will happen to the capacity information once it has been collected? Who will be responsible for analyzing and maintaining it, and making sure it is available to be used toward meeting the organization's goals? Choosing the most effective way to collect information from local residents, given available resources. There is no right or wrong way to collect information from residents. The community groups who have engaged in this process have discovered that there are a number of effective ways to go about conducting the capacity inventory, once the questions have been decided upon. For each group, it is important to think about the kind of situation that will be the most appropriate for completing the inventory; what would and would not work within your community. This mean that groups planning a capacity inventory project should think about when, how, and by whom the inventory process will be carried out. Each of the six communities carried out very different data collection processes, yet each was successful. Sensitivity to appropriate levels of privacy of the people interviewed, as well as anticipating the comfort level and trust enjoyed by the interviewer and person being interviewed, help to clarify how data should be collected. One to One Interviews - are the most common way to collect asset-based information. This approach takes time, but also begins to get people connecting to each other. Meeting face-to-face with individuals represents a significant opportunity to get to know the community on a first-hand basis, and is especially good for promoting asset-based thinking among residents. Volunteer training is critical for one-to-one interviews because of the need for the interviewer to accurately present the organization and its goals, as well as opportunities for getting involved in the project. Chapter Three - Lessons Learned 73 A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight Self Administered Inventories - a number of groups have been successful in asking people to complete the inventory on their own and return the answers to the organization. Groups that have been successful in receiving returned inventories report that there may need to be an incentive to assure prompt return. Sierra County Children's Health Collaborative, for example, entered the names of people who returned a completed inventory, into a drawing for $50.00. A public housing group entered the names of tenants who completed inventories into a drawing for one month's free rent. Group Interviews - Conducting the inventory among a group of people is also a good option. This is a less labor-intensive process, as one interviewer can assist many people to complete the inventory form. Interfaith Action used this group format with good results. At their Sunday fellowship meetings they organized church members into small groups of 6-10 persons. They spent the first part of the meeting discussing the idea of building on assets and gaining ideas from members on how assets could be used to better organize themselves. They asked each group to answer the questions (via a discussion amongst themselves) with each member filling in the questions for the member sitting next to them. In this way, Interfaith Action felt that people would get to know each other, and begin to appreciate everyone's interpretation of skills, abilities and talents. Peer to Peer - The Neighborhood Pride Team expanded on the face-to-face method, by empowering resident women who had not previously identified themselves as organizers in the neighborhood. They spent time recruiting and training a core group of women on the concepts of asset-based community building and on understanding the damaging effects of being labeled by others outside of the community. The women were challenged to positively label themselves and not accept the labels of others that were not legitimate. These women were immediately credible to their neighbors because they approached them as peers rather than as outsiders who didn't understand their situation. A Public Party One organization decided to complete inventories as part of a day long community event. The group hosted a barbecue in a local park and invited representatives of local institutions--the police, fire department, and local businesses--to take part. Families who participated in a discussion about the asset-based approach to community building and completed a capacity inventory received a free ticket for lunch and had their name put in a raffle. Note: while this method can be successful, the 74 Chapter Three - Lessons Learned A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight public way in which the information is collected may bring up issues of confidentiality for some people, and may be less effective in incorporating people into community-building efforts, simply because there is less one-to-one contact with interviewers than in other approaches. Group Blitz - One group is planning to test doing inventories from the pulpit during Sunday services in the churches that are members of their network. They have started this process by scheduling members to speak at services on Sundays in member congregations. These informational talks are planned as a precursor to putting inventories in the pews for all members to complete. They also see this as a way to increase individual involvement in organizational work from church members currently not involved. Choosing how many community residents to interview. Deciding how many capacity inventories to conduct is also important, but can sometimes be a tricky issue for community groups to decide upon. If your population is small enough, or if you have sufficient resources, it is ideal to find out about as many people living in your community as you can. However, depending upon how many people live within the boundaries of your community, you may find that you must limit your Individual Capacity Inventory project to some smaller segment than the entire population. This is not necessarily a bad thing. The impulse is often to collect information from as many people as possible, but automatically giving in to this impulse sometimes leads to a distorted focus on the data gathering process, rather than on the use of the information. It is far better to start small and gradually increase the numbers, than to begin with an attempt to inventory everyone in the community. There is no \"correct\" number of inventories that applies to every group. It will depend on how many people are living in the target area and the extent of the resources of the group. If you are not able to conduct the inventory among the entire population you can identify a sub-set of individuals using one of the following techniques: Select by neighborhood, housing development, or street address. Target a specific area within your community and limit your capacity inventory project to the individuals who live in the area. Select by membership in associations. Target participants by their activities in such associations as PTAs, athletic groups, block clubs, or churches. If you target by membership you may be able to utilize the Chapter Three - Lessons Learned 75 A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight resources of the associations to facilitate completing the Individual Capacity Inventory. If you target by membership you may also be able to select participants by age or interest, if you think this will be useful for your organization. Training interviewers in the capacity inventory approach and process. It is very important that the people who volunteer or are hired to assist with conducting the capacity inventory are capable and knowledgeable disseminators of information about your community-building project. Because the process is as important as the final data, training interviewers to both accurately portray your project, and encourage newcomer's participation is critical. Training depends somewhat on the way you have decided to conduct your capacity inventory, but all training should include the following: Prepare the interviewer to make a general introduction to your organization and the work it does. The introduction should be brief, but it should tell the people your interviewers are talking to all the information they need to know in order to make them feel comfortable about having a conversation with your representative. Interviewers should feel comfortable making this introduction. Prepare the interviewer to understand and convey the limits of the confidentiality your organization agrees to with regard to the individual information collected. Prepare the interviewer to serve as an advisor or facilitator to individuals as they complete the inventory. They should be prepared to assist residents to understand and answer all of the questions on the inventory. This means they must completely understand them themselves. Prepare the interviewer for the kind of people they will be meeting and the kind of neighborhoods they may be visiting. The purpose of the capacity inventory is to mobilize local capacities, and interviewers who are intimidated by the unknown cannot effectively carry out their task. Prepare the interviewer for taking appropriate care of the completed inventories and returning them to the appropriate individual in charge of handling. 76 Chapter Three - Lessons Learned A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight Choosing creative alternatives for data design, maintenance, analysis. Being creative about how information will be analyzed is another critical ingredient. The information collected must be organized in a way that people can easily sort through it and pull different pieces of information out for specific purposes. Many communities, although not all, have--or are in the process of setting up--a database with which to manage the information. If your organization does not have the expertise or resources for a personal computer system, this should not inhibit your efforts. Data management is a concrete request that can be made to a local individual, association, or institution--a specific way that they can partner with your organization in your community building efforts. Probably there are organizations or individuals within your community who can contribute this expertise to your work. There are two critical elements in the analysis of asset-based data: the first element is dependent on human creativity, and the second element involves technical creativity. How can you make the most of human creativity? Community groups wishing to fully use the information about individual capacities they collect on the capacity inventory must become totally familiar with all pieces of the data itself. The importance of immersing oneself in the data can not be over-emphasized. Therefore, BEFORE any data is turned over to a volunteer who will input the data in a computer data base, some person or several persons must fully understand what each of the surveys has to say about the person who completed it. Doing this will enable your organization to comprehend how the inventories are related to each other, and to be able to articulate what the story is that these surveys individually and collectively represent. Generating this understanding is a process that can be best accomplished through having all the interviewers come together to share their experiences and their opinions about what the data reveals to them. This personalized step of data analysis can not be left to the computer. It requires human input and discretion. If you are lucky enough to have a computer with which to eventually organize the data, the computer should be viewed as only one part of the data management system. A computer can analyze numbers, sort cases, and generate aggregate data, but it can not understand individuals and their capacities. The citizens who acted as interviewers are the other part of the data management system because they Chapter Three - Lessons Learned 77 A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight are in touch with individuals and their stories. Working with other interviewers will help them become familiar with the content and possibilities embedded in the individual responses. The communities featured in this manual all reported that their long-term success in using data about individual capacities was directly dependent on the ability of those closest to the information--the interviewers--to share the information with others. Out of this sharing process, creative ideas were born on possibilities for mobilizing capacities for community action. Some questions and approaches to gaining an understanding of the capacity inventory information are noted below. An assumption is made that those who conducted the interviews are also members of the community and thus come to this discussion with community knowledge and experience. Ask each interviewer to summarize the individuals interviewed, recalling the demeanor, approach, enthusiasm or hesitation of that person. List the descriptive words on a board. As the group considers the list and what they know of the community, begin to develop a sense of the personality of the community. How might this personality affect making connections and mobilizing individual capacities? Review who was interviewed. Consider for example: How many women and how many men were interviewed? What was the average ages of those interviewed; how old was the oldest; how young was the youngest? What ethnic, racial, and cultural groups were represented? What languages were spoken? How might this information instruct your group on mobilizing capacities? What natural connections already exist among community members? How can our capacity data contribute to building on these already-existing connections? Identify the categories of skills or clusters of skills of those interviewed. List the categories in which there were numerous skills, for example, child care, mechanical skills, or experience in the arts. Make a list of the skill categories in which there were groups of individuals with similar skills. This may serve as a starting point for discussions about possible business ventures. List those skills that appear to be quite unique to just a few individuals. Identify one-of-a-kind talents that may present special opportunities. For example, identifying someone in the community who works in the music industry may present a unique match with someone who is looking for access to the industry. 78 Chapter Three - Lessons Learned A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight Pay special attention to the priority skills of those interviewed. These skills are often the ones that people feel most confident in sharing with others. Are there some people who should clearly be brought together to share ideas on how to use their skills for mutual benefit? Consider what individual and collective gifts can be offered to the community. Brainstorm about and give participants permission to dream of all the possibilities. Consider which individuals or groups (parent groups, civic clubs, crime watch groups, youth groups, schools or businesses) could utilize or benefit from these gifts. How can this information be relayed to them? Who among the participants has connections to these groups? Consider how meeting with them and sharing this information might inspire additional ideas. Discuss what is going on in the community that relates to the skills and talents identified through the capacity inventory. Where is there current community action or energy that someone could be plugged into? Where is there a need for the energy and skills of the individuals interviewed? Where are there opportunities for people to take leadership based on their gifts? Where are there opportunities for people to contribute as volunteers? This first step in the data analysis is critical. The discussion should help the group clarify next steps in utilization of the information. This step will also inform the participants on how they can set up a database to provide the best and easiest access to the types of information that has been made available through the capacity inventory project. How can you make the most of technical creativity? For those who have computer systems, there is a wide selection of database management software available. Whatever package you select, it is important that it is capable of providing access to community members to the capacity information on an ongoing basis. In other words, it must be \"user friendly\" for people who are accustomed to using basic personal computer systems. Capacity information is only utilized fully when it is up to date and accurate. The groups featured in this guide have been very creative in finding someone in the community with computer expertise to manage the ongoing input and manipulation of data. Mutual Partnerships Coalition was able to hire a staff person to work with the community guides to set up the database system. The position allows them to maintain close scrutiny on how the specialists are interpreting the Chapter Three - Lessons Learned 79 A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight data on the forms. The open-ended questioning style of the MPC inventory presents challenges to effective data management, but because the full time data manager works closely with the community specialists to properly code and organize the information from each interview, the system is a success. The Family Support Network looked for a person with personal computer skills to join their Board of Directors. This person enjoys making a contribution to the group by handling all the data entry and upkeep of the system, and providing family advocates regular reports of what resources, talents, and skills are represented within the community network. Family Advocates can get specific, \"up-to-the-minute\" information at any time. Interfaith Action is in the midst of designing their database with the assistance of the United Way of Minneapolis. The United Way will give Interfaith Action the software needed and provide training to volunteers who will keep the data up to date and accessible. The United Way has agreed to help Interfaith Action think through the types of reports and updates that can be produced to make the data most usable to the church organizations and individual citizens. Sierra County Children's Health Collaborative use Microsoft ACCESS\u00ae database software. It is easy to use and provides all the flexibility that they want in terms of manipulating their individual capacity data. The person who works with the software was not an experienced computer user when the project began. With training, this database provides for ease of data entry, maintenance, and retrieval. The Neighborhood Pride Team approached Portland State University's Urban Studies Department. There they found a friend in a professor who believes in community capacity building and has helped the group establish their data formats. NPT also uses ACCESS\u00ae software as their database management system. An NPT volunteer was chosen from the community, one who knew all the interviewers, and thus would be part of their discussions and analysis, and also a person willing to build her computer skills. The volunteer is in charge of working with the University staff although she had not used a computer before this project. Now she is key to software program design discussions and responsible for the production of reports and data management for the group. 80 Chapter Three - Lessons Learned A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight One important lesson that was learned by each community is that the data is being most effectively used in situations where there are individuals who serve as connectors--that is, people who can promote new relationships among community members. In each case it is people who have become familiar with the data and have a natural ability to bring people together. Mobilizing individual capacities toward community building and overall community well-being requires people skills. One of the community specialists for Mutual Partnerships Coalition explained, Much of our work is to listen to people and help them see what gifts they have that they have put on the back burner. To find out what is on their wish list. With elders too often the people most connected to their lives are social workers and others talking about what is wrong with them, or focusing on what is problematic. We won't get involved in those discussions. We help people get back to their dreams. Many times it can happen simply by connecting with another person. Tips on what works and what doesn't work? As a result of using the capacity inventory in a community-building project, these organizations have discovered a number of things they would recommend for other groups to do, and not to do, in order to produce a more successful outcome. DO Train all interviewers in how to present the community-building project and its goals, and in how to conduct the inventory. Many people are polled on a regular basis and are endlessly asked to fill out forms. The capacity inventory is not simply another form where someone from outside the neighborhood is collecting information about residents. Part of the process of conducting the capacity inventory is to educate and excite community members about the talents that they bring as individuals, and can offer to their community. Training should highlight this concept and assist the interviewers to understand how sharing examples of the possible ways that capacity information will be used for community action will ease the process of collecting information. DO Be sure to see the gifts and potential contributions in everyone. Make sure the team works to keep everyone's eyes open for maximizing resources. No matter who is being interviewed--an elder, younger adult, or youth--everyone has weaknesses and issues in their lives. Consider only their strengths and possibilities, and do not be sucked into a negative focus. Chapter Three - Lessons Learned 81 A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight DO Leave the fixing of people to others. Helping people may be tempting because of the many struggles of people's daily lives. Don't make it the center of your work or of your conversations with people, or the focus will not change, and things will never start happening based on the strengths of the individuals with whom you speak. DO Engage young people in the solutions. Intergenerational connections produce rich rewards for everyone involved. Using the capacity inventory to promote this kind of relationship has great potential, as communities often do not have natural ways that different generations can get involved with one another. The capacity inventory can provide an effective mechanism to promote these connections. DO Know where you are going and what you want to achieve for your neighborhood. Spend time clarifying what you want to achieve and identifying specific goals, and invest time in discussion of how the information will be used in meeting those goals. The greater the clarity of purpose, the more directed, effective, and creative the connections. DO Have fun! Celebrate together often! Everyone involved should feel the fun and excitement of getting to know neighbors and engaging in collective citizen action. Try not to... DON'T Collect the data and then shift your focus to managing it in a database. Do not forget to immerse yourself in the information. This is always the first step in data management and must precede data input, storage and sorting. Only when you know the data as well as you know your way to the grocery store, will you be ready to use the data and be able to match and connect people together. DON'T Have outside volunteers conduct the capacity inventory among your local residents. Accepting volunteer help from local college students to conduct the surveys is a waste of the knowledge that can be gathered by community people. The richness of the actual interviewing process is lost on a one-time volunteer from outside the neighborhood who will not be committed to ongoing analysis and effective mobilization of talents and skills. Volunteers can help with the data entry and setting up a software program. But before this happens residents must be grounded in the content of the information. 82 Chapter Three - Lessons Learned A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight DON'T Carry out unmanageable numbers of surveys. Some groups that never got their projects off the ground failed because they focused on the gathering of data. Their work became targeted to gathering responses from thousands of individuals rather than on using the responses in their community-building efforts. Collecting and managing data can quickly become an overwhelming task. It is better to begin with a smaller and more manageable number of inventories, and to maintain focus on mobilizing the capacities discovered in them. Additional collection of information can be done when the initial data have been absorbed and incorporated into meeting the organization's goals. DON'T Include every question you can think of on your inventory. Successful inventories tend to be those in which people designed a questionnaire specifically to their intended uses. People interviewed were more willing to answer questions that seemed targeted to the outcome described by the interviewer. Simply taking generic surveys from other groups may not capture the spirit and creativity of your group. Spend time reviewing sample inventories, discussing your goals, and designing something unique. Chapter Four - Other Community Resources 83 A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight CHAPTER FOUR OTHER COMMUNITY RESOURCES Four other Community-Building guides developed by the Asset-Based Community Development Institute describe additional activities that may help you in your pursuit of whole-community development. Building Communities From the Inside Out: A Path Toward Finding and Mobilizing a Community's Assets, is the major publication in the ABCD library; in addition there are currently three workbooks in a series called the Neighborhood Economic Series available for use in your community-building plans. Ordering information is included at the end of this section. Building Communities From the Inside Out: A Path Toward Finding and Mobilizing a Community's Assets This volume describes the basic concepts and methods associated with asset-based community building. The book is organized around describing how to release the capacities and capture the power of the three kinds of participants in community life: Individuals. Associations and organizations. Local institutions. It provides extensive advise and examples about rebuilding the local economy and mobilizing an entire community for development purposes. Mapping assets. Building relationships. Mobilizing for economic development and information sharing. Convening the community to develop a vision and a plan. Leveraging outside resources to support locally driven development. The guide also discusses potential funding sources for asset-based development projects, and gives hints on the kinds of expectations funders might have for the organizations with whom they become involved. The Neighborhood Economic Series is a set of three step-by-step workbooks on three separate components of community economic development. 84 Chapter Four - Other Community Resources A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight A Guide to Mapping and Mobilizing the Economic Capacities of Local Residents Individuals make up the largest segment of your community and the capacity of individuals to make a difference is sometimes overlooked. Individuals represent enormous and sometimes untapped potential, and mobilizing their capacities should be an important part of your community-building efforts. This process is explained in this guide, and following the steps described here will enable you to find out about: General skills and abilities. Employment skills and abilities. Teaching skills and abilities. Community skills and abilities. Entrepreneurial interests and experience. The step-by-step process is accomplished by talking directly to people in your community and asking them to help you understand what strengths they have, and how these strengths could be released toward building a stronger community. The information you collect about individuals can be matched with information you collect about local businesses and consumer needs to form a comprehensive picture of the potential of your community. A Guide to Mapping Consumer Expenditures and Mobilizing Consumer Expenditure Capacities Another way that you can think about expanding your ability to use the information you collected in your Individual Capacity Inventory is to find out about how your local residents prefer to spend their money. Step-by-step instructions for completing this kind of project are provided in another Community-Building Workbook titled, A Guide to Mapping Local Consumer Expenditures and Mobilizing Consumer Expenditure Capacities. Following the steps in this workbook will enable you to find out: What products people prefer to purchase. At what businesses people make their purchases. Why people choose to patronize the businesses they do. How much people typically spend on particular types of purchases. How people travel to the merchants they patronize. Chapter Four - Other Community Resources 85 A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight Finding out about local consumer expenditures is accomplished by talking directly to people in your community and asking them to help you understand what their consumer needs are, what kinds of businesses they would like to see in the community, and what kinds of things motivate them to make the purchases they do. This information is then matched with information about existing businesses, and is used to more precisely define what new businesses might be successfully started. A Guide to Mapping Local Business Assets and Mobilizing Local Business Capacities Yet another way you can think about expanding your ability to use the information you collected in your Individual Capacity Inventory is to find out about the businesses located within your community and develop strategies for releasing the capacities they represent. This process is explained in another Community-Building Workbook titled, A Guide to Mapping Local Business Assets and Mobilizing Local Business Capacities. Following the steps in this guide will enable you to find out: What businesses are located in your community. What connections these businesses have to local individuals in terms of job training. What connections these businesses have to local associations in terms of voluntary participation. What connections these businesses have to other local institutions in terms of local purchasing, local investment, and local volunteer activity. The step-by-step process is accomplished by using library resources to develop a map of local businesses, and by talking directly to business representatives and asking them to help you understand their relationship to other members of the community. This information allows you to identify potential linkages between business assets and other parts of the community, which can be used in your economic development efforts.

Each of the following five examples illustrates a creative way of capturing information about individual capacities that enables the organization to successfully mobilize these capacities in their community-building efforts. The Kansas City Community Builders capacity inventory is unique in that it offers residents the opportunity to list not only the specific gifts and skills they possess, but also allows them to note what they would like to teach to others in the community, and what they would like to learn. Additionally, KCCB asks individuals to develop a map of their networks, including churches, schools, associations, programs, government, and institutions. For each type of network member, the individual is asked to indicate the name, what they are doing with that entity, what more they would like to do, and whether or not they would like to know more about the entity. Finally, KCCB includes a page that asks questions about what the individual would like to do for their neighborhood, and what specific kinds of activities they would be willing to become involved in. The New Prospect Baptist Church in Cincinnati developed a simple capacity inventory that asks questions about gifts, skills, and dreams. They ask people to share a story about themselves and the people to whom they give their gifts and who share their gifts with them. They ask about what people like to do and what business they would be involved in if they could. Finally, they ask about dreams, and about what people would be doing if they could be doing anything at all. The Leadership Kentucky Foundation's short capacity inventory explores personal capacities that are related to civic involvement. Their questions require a simple yes or no answer, but their categories include political and governance activities, business activities, and the organization of civic events and activities. The United Neighbors' capacity inventory focuses on the neighborhoods in which people live. The inventory asks what people like best about the neighborhood, and what they would like to improve. It asks a set of questions about participation in civic organizations and activities, and about Appendix - Capacity Inventory Examples 87 A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight specific skills the person can share, and current employment. This inventory also asks the individual directly whether the would be willing to become involved in United Neighbors. Most of the questions are open-ended and promote a discussion between the interviewer and the individual being interviewed. The Greyrockers of Colorado developed a capacity inventory that is designed to be interactive and to promote individuals connecting with one another as a part of the inventory process. In a group setting, the inventory asks people to list their gifts--gifts of the head, gifts of the hands, and gifts of the heart--and then to introduce themselves to others in the room in order to share their gifts. The Greyrockers inventory is unique in that it introduces a note of humor and fun into the process, and gets people talking about capacities right from the start. 88 Appendix - Capacity Inventory Examples Kansas City Community Builders A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight KANSAS CITY COMMUNITY BUILDERS My Personal Inventory Gifts and Skills I have I can teach to others I want to learn Comments Child Care Cooking Cooking for large groups Catering Carpentry Gardening Painting Electrical Work Plumbing Nursing Caring for older people Mentoring children Mentoring youth Desk top publishing Word processing Drawing and art work Coordinating volunteers Distributing newsletters Playing sports (which ones) Coaching sports (which ones) Office work House maintenance work Yard work Appliance repair Singing, playing music Art and craft work Telephone calling Knitting and crochet Sewing Hair cutting, braiding Installing alarm systems Starting my own business Transportation for adults Transportation for children Driving truck, bus CONNECTIONS I HAVE IN AND OUTSIDE MY COMMUNITY Organization Name of org/ What I am I would I want to Appendix - Capacity Inventory Examples 89 Kansas City Community Builders A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight group/ individual already doing like to do more know more about Churches Schools Neighborhood Associations Youth programs Community groups Social services City Council Members City Departments 90 Appendix - Capacity Inventory Examples Kansas City Community Builders A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight IF I COULD DO ANYTHING FOR MY NEIGHBORHOOD I WOULD: Improvements on my home I want to make are: Improvements to my yard I want to make are: Improvements needed on my street are: Improvements in our neighborhood park or neighborhood in general are: CONNECTIONS WITH MY NEIGHBORS I am willing to.. meet with and get better acquainted with my neighbors help develop a plan for my block and surrounding neighborhood help with neighborhood clean-up look out for my neighbors help with a crime watch become a leader be a 'worker bee' with leaders Signed: Address: Date: Appendix - Capacity Inventory Examples 91 New Prospect Baptist Church A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight NEW PROSPECT BAPTIST CHURCH Cincinnati, OH Survey Guidelines INTRODUCTION My name is What is your name? Thank you for coming over. Did someone talk to you about what the \"Gift Exchange\" is all about? What do you understand it to be? Basically, we believe that everyone has God-given talents and gifts that can be used to benefit the community. I'd like to spend a few minutes talking to you about your gifts and skills. Before we get started, let me give you a small gift. GIFTS Gifts are abilities that we are born with. We may develop them, but no one has to teach them to us. 1. What positive qualities do people say you have? 2. Who are the people in your life that you give to? How do you give to them? 3. When was the last time you shared with someone else? What was it? 4. What do you give that makes you feel good? SKILLS Sometimes we have talents that we've acquired in everyday life such as cooking and fixing things. 1. What do you enjoy doing? 2. If you could start a business, what would it be? 3. What do you like to do that people would pay you to do? 4. Have you ever made anything? Have you ever fixed anything? DREAMS Before you go, I want to take a minute and hear about your dreams--those goals you hope to accomplish. 1. What are your dreams? 2. If you could snap your fingers and be doing anything, what would it be? CLOSING First, I'd like to thank you. We're talking to as many people as we can and what we'd like to do is begin a Wall of Fame here in the Soup Kitchen highlighting the gifts, skills and dreams of as many people as possible. The ultimate goal is to find a way to use those gifts in rebuilding the community. 92 Appendix - Capacity Inventory Examples New Prospect Baptist Church A Community Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight Before you go, can I get your full name?

Once a week or less 2 to 4 times Every day Where do you go? What kinds of new places of activities would you like to see in the neighborhood? Are you part of any group that gets together on a regular basis? What are they? Are you currently employed? Which shift? Is there any product or service related to your work that could be sold in the neighborhood? Should we let you know about our next meeting or activity? Would you be interested in Building Workbook \u00a9 1997 Kretzmann & McKnight GREYROCKERS GIFT LIST MY NAME IS: AND HERE ARE SOME OF MY GIFTS Please list 2-4 things in each category--things you wouldn't mind people at Greyrock knowing about you. Please write legibly. Gifts of the head (things I know something about, and would enjoy taking about, or teaching others about, e.g., birds, art history, movies, solar energy). Gifts of the hands (things I know how to do and enjoy doing, e.g., carpentry, sports [be specific], gardening, cooking). Gifts of the heart (things I care deeply about, e.g., protection of the environment, civic life, children). When you finish, tape the paper to some part of your person and wander around, reading other people's lists and having them read yours. Feel free to add or change as you go. Try to interact with at least 2 people. Benefits of doing a gifts list: (1) You can find people who share your interests. (2) If you need something done that you don't have the skills for, you may find someone who does have those skills and compensate them with money or through a barter arrangement. (Laurie and Katherine are working on a more elaborate barter system, or skills bank; see them if you are interested in helping develop it.) And, finally, (3) it helps you skill over the small talk and get to the meaning of life, or some such thing. PLEASE RETURN THIS FORM "}
