What is its function? The spleen is an important organ in the body that has a variety of responsibilities, such as: - It is a major blood filter, which helps remove old and damaged [red blood cells](https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm)and bacteria. - It is part of the lymphatic system and produces lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell that is a part of the immune system that helps to prevent and fight infection). - It acts as a reservoir for [red blood cells](https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm)and platelets, should the body need them. What type of pain does an enlarged spleen cause? Because of its location, should it enlarge, the spleen can irritate the [diaphragm](https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_control_methods/article.htm) and cause [hiccups](https://www.medicinenet.com/hiccups/symptoms.htm) and perhaps some [pain](https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm) in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. Additionally, due to its adjacent location to the diaphragm, [pain](https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm) from the spleen may radiate to the back and be felt in the shoulder blade. If the [enlarged spleen](https://www.medicinenet.com/enlarged_spleen_splenomegaly_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm) compresses the stomach, the person may feel full after eating a small amount and therefore be unable to eat large meals. What causes an enlarged spleen? Potential causes of an enlarged spleen include the following: Blood disorders The spleen will enlarge when it performs more of its duties to filter blood or manufacture blood cells. Therefore, any disease or condition that damages red blood cells, and requires them to be filtered and removed from the bloodstream, will cause the spleen to become larger. Conditions such as hemolytic [anemia](https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/article.htm), where red blood cells are damaged and broken down (hemolyzed) can cause the spleen to enlarge. Misshapen red blood cells, like those found in [sickle cell disease](https://www.medicinenet.com/sickle_cell/article.htm), [thalassemia](https://www.medicinenet.com/beta_thalassemia/article.htm), and spherocytosis, may be damaged when they try to squeeze through small capillary blood vessels. These damaged red blood cells need to be culled from the bloodstream and filtered out by the spleen. Decreased blood flow The spleen will enlarge if there is a decrease in blood flow through the splenic vein. This may cause spleen [congestion](https://www.medicinenet.com/treating_congestion/article.htm) and enlargement. This situation may be associated with [liver disease](https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_disease/article.htm) and [portal hypertension](https://www.medicinenet.com/portal_hypertension/article.htm). Damage to [liver](https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm) cells makes it difficult for blood to flow normally, and as blood backs up in the portal vein system, it may affect the pressure in the splenic vein. The decreased ability of blood to drain from the spleen causes it to become congested and grow larger. People with [congestive heart failure](https://www.medicinenet.com/congestive_heart_failure_chf_overview/article.htm) may have an [enlarged liver](https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_disease_quiz/quiz.htm) and spleen because of poor blood flow to and from the [heart](https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_how_the_heart_works/article.htm). Cancer [Leukemia](https://www.medicinenet.com/leukemia_quiz/quiz.htm) and [lymphoma](https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm) may be associated with abnormal white cells that can invade the spleen and increase its size. Other [cancers](https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm) can spread or [metastasize](https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm) to the spleen and cause it to enlarge. Metabolic diseases Certain metabolic diseases may cause the spleen to enlarge, including Hurler Syndrome, [Gaucher](https://www.medicinenet.com/gaucher_disease/article.htm) disease, and [Niemann-Pick Disease](https://www.medicinenet.com/dementia_pictures_slideshow/article.htm). In [sarcoidosis](https://www.medicinenet.com/sarcoidosis/article.htm) and [amyloidosis](https://www.medicinenet.com/amyloidosis/article.htm), the spleen can be involved and become enlarged with abnormal protein deposits. Infection Some infections may cause [splenomegaly](https://www.medicinenet.com/enlarged_spleen_splenomegaly_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm) a car accident, can damage the spleen. [](https://www.medicinenet.com/infectious_mononucleosis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm) SLIDESHOWSee Slideshow What are signs and symptoms of an enlarged spleen? Often, an enlarged spleen causes no symptoms or signs itself, but they are due to an underlying illness that causes splenomegaly. However, those people who do have symptoms of an enlarged spleen may experience: [Indigestion](https://www.medicinenet.com/dyspepsia/symptoms.htm)and a feeling of fullness because the enlarged spleen can compress the stomach. [Hiccups](https://www.medicinenet.com/hiccups/article.htm)because of diaphragm irritation. [Pain](https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm)in the upper abdomen that may radiate to the back or shoulder blade. Examples of illnesses that cause signs and symptoms may include: [Anemia](https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/symptoms.htm), which causes symptoms that include: [Low platelet count](https://www.medicinenet.com/thrombocytopenia_low_platelet_count/article.htm)( [thrombocytopenia](https://www.medicinenet.com/thrombocytopenia_low_platelet_count/article.htm)) due to spontaneous bleeding. - Signs and symptoms of a low [platelet count](https://www.medicinenet.com/complete_blood_count/article.htm)include: - Signs and symptoms of a low [Liver disease](https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_disease_quiz/quiz.htm)( [cirrhosis](https://www.medicinenet.com/cirrhosis/article.htm)), which causes symptoms and signs that - Weakness [Itching](https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm) [Loss of appetite](https://www.medicinenet.com/loss_of_appetite/symptoms.htm) [Easy bruising](https://www.medicinenet.com/easy_bruising/symptoms.htm) - - Ineffective white blood cell function may cause infections more often. - Heavy periods (menstrual) that are unusual. [Deep vein thrombosis](https://www.medicinenet.com/deep_vein_thrombosis/article.htm)( [DVT](https://www.medicinenet.com/deep_vein_thrombosis/article.htm), [blood clot in the leg](https://www.medicinenet.com/deep_vein_thrombosis/article.htm)) - Bleeding that will not stop. What tests diagnose an enlarged spleen? An enlarged spleen is most often found on physical examination. Either the health care practitioner is looking for an enlarged spleen because of a diagnosis that has already been made, or it is found incidentally when initially examining a patient (and it then serves as a clue to an underlying diagnosis). With its location protected beneath the left lower ribs, a normal spleen is usually not felt on physical exam, except in some unusually thin individuals. As it enlarges, the spleen grows from the left upper quadrant of the abdomen towards the umbilicus (the [belly button](https://www.medicinenet.com/belly_button/article.htm)). Sometimes the doctor will ask the patient to roll on their right side to better attempt to feel the spleen. An enlarged spleen may not be felt in [obese](https://www.medicinenet.com/obesity_weight_loss/article.htm) patients. On occasion, an enlarged spleen may be diagnosed by plain X-ray, [ultrasound](https://www.medicinenet.com/ultrasound/article.htm), abdominal [CT scan](https://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm), or [MRI](https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm) ( [magnetic resonance imaging](https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm)). is the treatment for an enlarged spleen? Because splenomegaly is due to an underlying illness, treatment will depend upon the primary cause. In some situations, removal of the spleen (splenectomy) may be part of the treatment. For example, in [hereditary spherocytosis](https://www.medicinenet.com/spherocytosis_hereditary_hs/article.htm), a condition in which red blood cells are abnormal and shaped like a sphere instead of a concave disk shape. These abnormal red blood cells are filtered from the bloodstream, which causes [anemia](https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/symptoms.htm) and an enlarged spleen. Splenectomy limits the number of red blood cells destroyed and helps treat the disease. There are no natural treatments for an enlarged spleen. What is the prognosis for an enlarged spleen? Often, the prognosis for an enlarged spleen depends entirely upon the underlying illness. For example, in patients with [infectious mononucleosis](https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/infectious_mononucleosis_picture/picture.htm), the spleen will return to its normal size once the infection resolves. In some instances, the spleen may need to be removed and the risk of infection may increase. In other cases, the spleen will remain enlarged and leave the patient at an increased risk for bleeding, spleen rupture, and infection. What complications are associated with an enlarged spleen? Perhaps the most important worry with an enlarged spleen is the risk of injury as it grows beyond the protection of the rib cage. A minor injury may cause it to rupture and bleed. Spleen injuries are often treated by observation, but on occasion, the spleen can rupture causing life-threatening [internal bleeding](https://www.medicinenet.com/internal_bleeding/article.htm) requiring surgery to remove the spleen. This is the reason that teenagers and young adults diagnosed with [infectious mononucleosis](https://www.medicinenet.com/infectious_mononucleosis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm) need to wait until the spleen returns to its normal size, and is protected by the rib cage, before participating in activities where the enlarged spleen could be damaged. All types of blood cells may become trapped in a large spleen. Anemia ( [low red blood cell count](https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/article.htm)) may cause: [thrombocytopenia](https://www.medicinenet.com/thrombocytopenia_low_platelet_count/article.htm)) be associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Leukopenia (low white blood cell count) may be associated with an increased risk of infection. Should the spleen need to be removed surgically (splenectomy), the risk of certain infections increases and the patient will need to make certain that their immunizations are up to date, especially against pneumococcus, [meningococcus](https://www.medicinenet.com/meningococcemia/article.htm), and haemophilus influenzae.

Can an enlarged spleen be prevented? An enlarged spleen is the consequence of an underlying illness, many of which may not be anticipated or prevented. [Liver disease](https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_disease_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm)due to [alcohol abuse](https://www.medicinenet.com/alcohol_abuse_and_alcoholism/article.htm), which causes [cirrhosis](https://www.medicinenet.com/cirrhosis_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm)and portal [hypertension](https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm), can be prevented. With [alcohol](https://www.medicinenet.com/alcohol_metabolism/article.htm)use, moderation is the key, and excessive drinking has very dangerous consequences both in the short and long term. - Certain causes of viral [hepatitis](https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_hepatitis/article.htm)(for example, [hepatitis B](https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_b/article.htm)and [hepatitis C](https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_c/article.htm)), which can lead to cirrhosis also can be prevented by avoiding contact with body fluids from infected individuals. [Hepatitis B](https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/hepatitis_b_picture/picture.htm)can also be prevented through vaccination. Finally, certain infectious diseases such as [HIV](https://www.medicinenet.com/human_immunodeficiency_virus_hiv/article.htm), [malaria](https://www.medicinenet.com/malaria_facts/article.htm), [tuberculosis](https://www.medicinenet.com/tuberculosis_tb_facts/article.htm), and anaplasmosis can be prevented if the appropriate measures are taken to minimize the risks of acquiring the disease.

It may accompany constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, and other symptoms. Find out the potential causes of pain in the abdomen and learn when you should see a doctor. AnemiaAnemia is the condition of having less than the normal number of red blood cells or less than the normal quantity of hemoglobin in the blood. The oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood is, therefore, decreased. There are several types of anemia such as iron deficiency anemia (the most common type), sickle cell anemia, vitamin B12 anemia, pernicious anemia, and aplastic anemia. Symptoms of anemia may include fatigue, malaise, hair loss, palpitations, menstruation, and medications. Treatment for anemia includes treating the underlying cause for the condition. Iron supplements, vitamin B12 injections, and certain medications may also be necessary. Blood Clots (in the Leg)Blood clots can form in the heart, legs, arteries, veins, bladder, urinary tract, and uterus. Risk factors include high blood pressure and cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, and family history. Symptoms and treatment depend on the location of the clot. CT Scan (Computerized Tomography)A CT scan is an X-ray procedure that combines many X-ray images with the aid of a computer to generate cross-sectional and three-dimensional images of internal organs and structures of the body. A CT scan is a low-risk procedure. Contrast material may be injected into a vein or the spinal fluid to enhance the scan. Cirrhosis (Liver)Cirrhosis of the liver refers to a disease in which normal liver cells are replaced by scar tissue caused by alcohol and viral hepatitis B and C. This disease leads to abnormalities in the liver's ability to handle toxins and blood flow, causing internal bleeding, kidney failure, mental confusion, coma, body fluid accumulation, and frequent infections. Symptoms include yellowing of the skin (jaundice), itching, and fatigue. The prognosis is good for some people with cirrhosis of the liver, and the survival can be up to 12 years; however the life expectancy is about 6 months to 2 years for people with severe cirrhosis with major complications. Complete Blood Count (CBC)A complete blood count (CBC) is a calculation of the cellular makeup of blood. A CBC measures the concentration of white blood cells, red blood cells, platelets in the blood, and aids in diagnosing conditions and disease such as malignancy, anemia, or blood clotting problems. CT Scan vs. MRI CT scan (computerized tomography) is a procedure that uses X-rays to scan and take images of cross-sections of parts of the body. CT scan can help diagnose broken bones, tumors or lesions in areas of the body, blood clots in the brain, legs, and lung, and lung infections or diseases like pneumonia or emphysema. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is a procedure that uses strong magnetic fields and radiofrequency energy to make images of parts of the body, particularly, the organs and soft tissues like tendons and cartilage. Both CT and MRI are painless, however, MRI can be more bothersome to some individuals who are claustrophobic, or suffer from anxiety or panic disorders due to the enclosed space and noise, the machine makes. MRI costs more than CT, while CT is a quicker and more comfortable test for the patient. DVT SlideshowDeep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a dangerous and sometimes fatal blood clot that occurs deep within the lower leg or thigh. Understand the symptoms, treatment and prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Hematocrit Ranges (Normal, High, Low)Hematocrit in the blood is the proportion of the blood that consists of red blood cells, by volume. A low hematocrit level may signal anemia, or other conditions such as loss of blood, nutritional deficiency, bone marrow problems, and abnormal hematocrit. High hematocrit levels may be due to chronic smoking, living at high altitudes, dehydration, or other conditions and diseases.
