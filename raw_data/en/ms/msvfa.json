If you're new to meditation, you can still benefit. A study in the 'Journal of Pain' found that after just a single hour of mindfulness meditation training over a three-day period, participants felt less pain while meditating and also experienced less pain sensitivity when they were not meditating. To start: Find a quiet location, sit in a comfortable posture, then focus your attention on your breath, an object or a mantra. If you find your mind wandering, simply bring it back to your focal point without judgment. Prayer, tai chi, qi gong, yoga and journaling can also offer meditative benefits, so choose the form that feels best for you. Acupuncture, an ancient form of traditional Chinese medicine, involves inserting thin needles into your body to stimulate specific points and regulate the flow of \"qi\" (vital energy) throughout your body. This practice is widely used for many types of pain, ranging from low back pain and carpal tunnel syndrome to osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia. Acupuncture also has many amazing qualities in regarding fertility, pregnancy and inducing labour. An inflammatory diet that is low in nutrients and high in toxins is one of the main causes of modern-day inflammation. This includes foods like; sugar, processed and high-sugar junk foods, refined oils, gluten and refined white flour. The good news is that diet plays a significant role in preventing and reducing inflammation. A low-inflammation diet, such as Mediterranean or plant-based, have been shown in studies to help people overcome chronic pain as well as improve their overall health. This is because they are are filled with nutrients, vitamins, antioxidants, polyphenols, and phytonutrients, all of which are needed for a healthy body. Similar to acupuncture, Emotional freedom technique (EFT) tapping focuses on the meridian points \u2014 or energy hot spots \u2014 to restore balance to your body's energy. It's believed that restoring this energy balance can relieve symptoms a negative experience or emotion may have caused.

Massage therapists use a variety of techniques, including kneading, tapping, pressure and deep circular movements, to relieve a variety of conditions, including pain. According to the American Massage Therapy Association, massage stimulates your brain to produce endorphins (natural pain-relieving chemicals) and other studies have shown that massage therapy: Exercise prompts the release of pain-relieving endorphins, which can help to block pain signals from reaching your brain. Exercise also works to boost your mood, strengthen bones, muscles and tissues around joints, and provides you with more energy. Gentler forms of exercise, such as yoga, can also be rotated into your routine.

Patients were also able to cut back on pain medications and had improvements in mood and anxiety levels.
