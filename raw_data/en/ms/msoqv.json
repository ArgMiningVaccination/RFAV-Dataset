ISR is a permanent unit within the A. James Clark School of Engineering, with a mission of promoting and facilitating interdisciplinary research in systems science and engineer - ing. Traditional research foci of ISR involve communication, computation and control. As of the writing of this report, ISR oversees more than 25 different externally funded interdisciplinary research projects. ISR was founded in 1985 as one of the first cohort of Engi - neering Research Centers funded by the National Science Foundation. Current funding sources include the State of Maryland, through the Clark School; industrial grants and gifts; and federal research projects. The Institute has several graduate and undergraduate efforts, including the Masters in Science in Systems Engineering; the Professional Masters in Systems Engineering (offered in conjunction with the UMD Office of Advanced Engi - neering Education); and engineering capstone courses for undergraduate engineering students. A cross-cutting minor in Systems Engineering is being developed for undergradu - ate engineers. Several research centers have been incubated within ISR, including the Maryland Robotics Center; the Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering; the Federal Aviation Administration Center of Excellence in Aviation Operations Research; and the Maryland NanoCenter. The Institute's outreach efforts include an industrial affiliates program and a number of collaboration agreements with international universities and research institutes. In addition to summarizing the status of ISR, this report also contains several recommendations for further enhanc - ing the Institute's profile and operation. A. Introduction A.1. Background of the self-study The University of Maryland Policy on the Review of Academic Units ( www.president.umd.edu/policies/i600a.html ) states that \"Periodic review of an academic unit's pursuit of excellence can contribute significantly to the enhance - ment of the unit's progress and respond to the University's responsibility for efficient use of resources.\" It mandates that every academic unit on campus undergo a review at no more than seven-year intervals. The primary goal of the review is to improve the unit's effectiveness and quality. Each dean is responsible for initiating such reviews and for reporting to the Provost on the results.The review process consists of \"an internal self-study in - cluding the accumulation of relevant data, external review of the unit, and proper utilization of the results of the review.\" This ISR internal self-study was produced by a committee chaired by Professor Steve Marcus. Members of the committee included Professors Michael Ball and Rance Cleaveland; Rebecca Copeland, director of public relations and information management; and Timir Datta, graduate student. The committee received its charge from Associate Dean Peter Kofinas on Sept. 5, 2014 and immediately began its work. During 2015 the committee met weekly, and com - pleted its work at the end of the summer of 2015. A.2. Overview The Institute for Systems Research (ISR) is a unit with - in the Clark School of Engineering at the University of Maryland. As of July 2015, the institute comprises 37 joint appointment faculty, 26 affiliate faculty, and five research faculty from four colleges and 14 units across the university. Within the A. James Clark School of Engineering, these include: Aerospace Engineering, Chemical and Biomolec - ular Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, the Fischell Depart - ment of Bioengineering, Materials Science and Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. Within the College of Behavioral and Social Sciences, ISR has faculty in the Neuroscience and Cognitive Science Pro - gram. In the College of Computer, Mathematical and Natu - ral Sciences, ISR has faculty in Biology, Computer Science, UMIACS (University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies) and Mathematics. Within the Robert H. Smith School of Business, our faculty are part of Decision, Operations and Information T echnolo - gies; and Logistics, Business and Public Policy. ISR research currently encompasses eight major areas: Communication systems and networks Control systems and methodologies Neuroscience and biology-based technology Micro and nano devices and systems Robotics Design, operations and supply chain management Systems engineering methodologies Computing, speech, artificial intelligence ISR faculty currently advise approximately 200 Ph.D. students. In addition, ISR serves some 35 M.S. Systems Engineering students, 70 M.S. students, and 25 Professional Masters in Engineering-Systems Engineering students. ISR has 15 administrative staff. The institute's annual re - search expenditures totaled $20 million in 2014. The institute began in 1985 as one of the six original NSF Engineering Research Centers (it was named the Systems ISR Review Report March 4, 20165Research Center, or SRC, at the time). ISR received fund - ing from NSF from 1985 through 1998, including funding in a re-competition, and has been a fully self-sustaining graduated ERC since that time. Permanent base budget funding from the state of Maryland of around $3 million per year was awarded in 1989, and in 1992 the SRC was renamed the Institute for Systems Research and became a permanent institute in the Clark School. Evidence of the high quality and the interdisciplinary nature of the institute includes the many honors and awards gained by the faculty ( Appendices 4-9 ), the publications and patents ( Appendices 10-11 ), the many collaborative projects and publications involving faculty from more than one department ( T able 5 ), and ISR alumni who have gone on to academic positions ( Appendix 20 ). Over the years, ISR leaders have consulted about the insti - tute's structural model with academic and research entities around the world. The ISR model was emulated in the formation of the following programs, centers and institutes: The ACCESS Center in the Royal Institute of T echnolo - gy (KTH), Sweden ELLIT Link\u00f6ping and Deci - sion-making in Complex Systems, CADICS\u2014Linnaeus Center, Sweden Lund University\u2014LCCC\u2014Lund Center for Control of Complex Engineering Systems - Linnaeus Center, Sweden Computer and Automation Research Institute (CARI), Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Hungary Research School of Information Sciences and Engineer - ing, Australian National University, Australia The Division of Systems Engineering across departments at the Massachusetts Institute of T echnology (with joint appointments for the first time in the history of MIT) in 1999. In addition, ISR has been used as a model for institutes within the University of Maryland. The latest example is the Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology Research (IBBR). When the University of Maryland Biotechnolo - gy Institute in Baltimore was dissolved and the researchers came to the University of Maryland's College Park campus, Provost Nariman Farvardin recommended forming an in - stitute like ISR, which led to talks with ISR leadership and the IBBR being organized along the lines of ISR. A.3 Most recent review (NSF 25th Anniversary site visit, 2010) While it was not an official University of Maryland review, ISR was reviewed by a team of outside experts in Novem - ber 2010. This review was initiated by the National Science Foundation on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of ISR's founding. A list of the members of the review team can be found in Appendix 26 . Here is a summary of the review's conclusions, and the current status of several of its recommendations. Strengths \"The core mission of ISR\u2014closing the gap between systems science and systems engineering\u2014will remain a hugely important, high value domain of fundamental research for decades to come.\" \"ISR can be very proud of its large collection of ex - cellent faculty who pursue high impact, well sponsored research.\" \"ISR has achieved a sustained, highly interdisciplin - ary research culture that features strong collaboration between very diverse academic communities in a patient, welcoming, inclusive atmosphere.\" \"ISR has gathered together an impressively large number of industrial partnerships at a variety of levels in areas of direct relevance to their missions.\" Weaknesses \"The penetration of systems science into systems engi - neering as practiced in the larger community and even within ISR itself remains limited.\" This is still an issue. \"Opportunities for undergraduate involvement seem limited.\" There has been significant progress. In particular, ISR has been offering a very successful capstone design course that is taken by students from a number of engineering departments (see Section C.3). Opportunities \"A gap remains between the discoveries (made both within ISR and beyond) of systems science and the practices of systems engineering. If it can balance the im - peratives of specific projects and the broader intellectual problem domain, ISR has the opportunity to cement its present position of leadership to create the best-in-class systems engineering program.\" This is still an opportunity. \"ISR has many future opportunities to stimulate the cre - ation of new companies and even new industries.\" This is still an opportunity. \"ISR has the opportunity to establish even greater diver - sity.\" There have been significant efforts in this direction. For example, the current ISR Director led a large interdisciplinary team from a number of universities that submitted a proposal for an NSF Engineering Research Center on \"Engineering Systems for Mental Health.\" He has also led the effort to create a new Brain and Behavior Initiative on campus. This effort includes faculty from most of the colleges on campus. \"There seems to be a great opportunity to increase the revenue from dues-paying industry members.\" This is still an opportunity. Threats to continued self-sufficiency and impact \"There is friction between ISR and other academic units.\" Over the past five years, the current ISR Director has been proactive in building relationships with other academic units. In addition, ISR has initiated and worked closely with The Institute for Systems Research6engineering departments to recruit new faculty with joint ap - pointments between ISR and departments. The necessary project- and disciplinary-specific focus of new ISR Centers might blunt its core mission.\" The core ISR basic research in systems is continuing strongly with funding from a large number of individual research grants from agencies such as the National Science Foundation. Additional detailed comments from the review team's report include: \"By any reckoning, the past scientific achievements of ISR have been impressive. ISR has also been quite successful in attracting, over the years, a stellar collection of researchers. The reports, both oral and written, conveyed a wonderful set of achievements by a highly diversified group of profes - sors and students. Among the papers cited in these presenta - tions are a large number of very high quality and influential publications by excellent researchers at the very top of their fields. While it is theoretically possible that the same or simi - lar set of individuals would have joined the University of Maryland even in the absence of ISR, it is beyond dispute that the existence and continued growth of ISR greatly enhanced the University of Maryland's ability to attract and retain such talent.\" \"Intellectually, we believe the policy of giving three-year appointments to ISR, with roughly a 20 percent turnover rate of those under review, ensures that the faculty comple - ment of ISR remains contemporary and forward-looking. The practice of encouraging multi-investigator research projects, especially those involving multiple disciplines, and locating graduate students in physical proximity, has clearly fostered an intellectually vibrant atmosphere. Some of the original 1985 \"class\" of NSF ERCs did not survive even the initial mid-term review! Against that backdrop, the mere fact that ISR has managed to retain its identity and to rein - vent itself as technology evolved is striking.\" \"The site visit committee was impressed by the significant industrial impacts and sponsorships cited in the report.\" \"The faculty and programs of ISR have very high stat - ure. Members and alumni are world-renowned leaders in control, signal processing, communication, MEMS, neuro - science, networking, operations research, and manufactur - ing....The faculty is first-class: creative, original, brilliant with a proven record of research.\" \"ISR has been remarkably successful in maintaining and enhancing industry collaborations after the NSF ERC funding.\" A.4 Financial overview ISR receives income from a number of sources to fund its operations. Base budget funding comes from 1) the State of Maryland; 2) Designated Research Initiative Funds (DRIF) associated with a return of part of the indirect costs gener - ated on research funding; 3) the Engineering Professional Masters (ENPM) program; 4) the Strategic and Associate Partners Programs; and 5) additional short-term commit - ments from other units at the university. T able 1 is a break - out of ISR's planned income and expenditures for FY2015. The largest expenditure by far is faculty salaries, which make up more than 66 percent of all expenditures and 79.25 percent of the state budget. As can be seen in T able 1 , the state budget is the largest source of income and covers 83.5 percent of income (not including research income). As the table illustrates, ISR balances its budget from a variety of sources. T wo important sources are faculty full- year sabbaticals and DRIF . When a faculty member takes a full-year sabbatical, ISR saves 50 percent of the nine-month state salary. Even though the amount varies annually, these significant savings help balance the budget. Unlike an Table 1: ISR 2015 Functional BudgetISR 2015 Functional Budget FY15 Income FY15 Obligation Balance State Budget - Faculty Salaries $ 2,518,666 $ 2,518,666 $ 0 State Budget - Staff Salaries $ 700,313 $ 960,674 $ (260,361) State Budget - Grad Asst Salaries $ 23,067 $ 0 $ 23,067 State Budget - Labor & Assistants $ 10,000 $ 111,790 $ (101,790) Turnover Expectancy $ (86,145) $ 0 $ (86,145) Total Salaries $ 3,165,901 $ 3,591,130 $ (425,229) Operational Costs $ 12,226 $ 206,250 $ (194,024) Total Budget $ 3,178,127 $ 3,797,380 $ (619,253) Other Sources of Income Soft Money Support (Provost, Dean, VPR & Etc.) $ 222,166 $ 222,166 Sabbaticals $ 92,401 $ 92,401 Other Income (Foundation & Philanthropic) $ 90,000 $ 90,000 Budget Cut $ (43,646) $ (43,646) DRIF $ 172,185 $ 172,185 ENPM - Professional Masters $ 95,000 $ 95,000 Total $ 3,806,233 $ 3,797,380 $ 8,853 ISR Review Report March 4, 20167academic unit, ISR has no teaching requirements and thus cannot reap the benefits of allowing faculty to \"buy out\" of teaching courses. Additionally, ISR sees an average DRIF return of $350K. Fifty percent of this DRIF is returned directly to the faculty for use as discretionary funds, but the remainder helps ISR balance its budget. In tight budget times, the 50 percent has been reduced to ensure ISR can balance its budget. Another large piece of balancing ISR's budget involves phil - anthropic funding. ISR has multiple programs and abilities for individuals and companies to partner with it. The details of these initiatives are outlined in Section E of this report. Notes on ISR's state budget The data in T able 2 show how the ISR state budget has fluctuated over the past 12 years, and in FY 2015 is at ap - proximately the same level as it was in FY 2003. Note the following: During this time peri - od, research expendi - tures managed in ISR rose more than 50 percent. During the great recession, ISR's state budget funding fell from $3.4M in 2009 to $2.9M in 2011, a loss of more than six percent. A simi - lar budget reduction period occurred from 2003 to 2005, when the state budget fell from $3.2M to $2.9M. In both these peri - ods, ISR managed its budget cuts by laying off staff, cutting operation costs and increasing reliance on \"soft money\" income. Faculty salaries\u2014the largest portion of the ISR state budget\u2014were not affected during the periods of bud - get reduction. As a result, (see Figure 1) between 2003 and 2015 faculty salaries as a percentage of the budget increased by almost 20 percent. This category now com - prises more than 75 percent of the budget. While ISR's state budget has increased since 2011, this is a result of new joint faculty hires, not restorations to staff or operations. The larger picture beyond the 2003-2015 period mirrors the increased research funding/decreased administrative support trends reported here. The scope and magnitude of ISR's overall research program have grown fairly steadily since the institute's 1996 graduation from the NSF ERC program. In 1996, funding was $10 million; in 2015, it is $20 million. In 1996, ISR had 34 staff positions. There are 15 ISR staff today.Over the years, ISR has responded to staff and operations cuts in a variety of ways (see the discussion in Section A.5) in an attempt to maintain the administrative support to which its faculty has become accustomed. This has posed signifi - cant challenges. A.5 Administration Organization and charge ISR includes the director, administrative and technical staff, joint, research and affiliate faculty, and elected faculty committees. The ISR Director is responsible for the overall operation of ISR, including most day-to-day decisions and supervision of the administrative and technical staff. The director receives input from the faculty through the elected Executive Committee, which serves as the director's sounding board. Many ISR functions are overseen by elect - ed committees that make recommendations to the director. Key committees include: Executive, Educational Program, Facilities and Services, and Salary. Staff units within ISR include finance and administration, led by Jason Strahan; external relations, led by Jeff Coriale; public relations and information management, led by Re - becca Copeland; computing, led by Jeff McKinney; and the MSSE program, led by John MacCarthy. ISR staff work behind the scenes in administrative, financial, educational, technical, outreach and public relations support to enable the Institute to fulfill and advance its mission and vision, and make its faculty's research possible. They have done so through financial lean times as well as in seasons of relative plenty. Administrative history When it was an NSF ERC, ISR's structure called for a full complement of administrative and technical staff that helped the institute support its faculty and accomplish its mandate. After the NSF funding ceased, the institute (a permanent part of the university since 1991), like the rest of the uni -ISR State Budgets 2003-Present Year ISR State ISR State Budgets 2003-present Figure 1: ISR Faculty Salary, as a Fraction of the State Budget, 2003 Compared with 2015The Institute for Systems Research8versity, was subject to the fluctuations of the state economy in periods of turbulence. The state's economic uncertainties often lead to problems with the state budget, and higher education support is a frequent target for cutbacks. Staffing lines throughout the university are frequently lost as a result. By 2009, ISR was operating with a staff roster less than one- half the size of that established during the NSF years. Most of those lost were technical and mid- and lower-salaried support staff, who had served in positions that kept things running behind the scenes, enabling other staff to address more specialized and visible tasks. Their loss opened holes in ISR's infrastructure that were filled in part by assigning ad - ditional tasks to remaining staff. Perhaps the most significant long-term effect has been that staff now spend the majority of their time on foundational and immediate tasks that keep ISR operating on a daily basis. Far less time is available for tasks that are more strategic or require extended planning. ISR's most time-sensitive and critical tasks do get complet - ed. But staff are aware of other beneficial projects they are unable to accomplish. Examples: During the NSF-funded years, five core constituent labs (the Neural Systems Lab, Intelligent Systems Lab, Systems Engineering and Integration Lab, Computer Integrated Manufacturing Lab and Communications and Signal Processing Lab) in ISR each had an ISR/NSF-funded lab manager. These positions continued to be fully fund - ed by ISR after the end of NSF funding through at least 1998, but gradually were defunded in ensuing years. By 2005, four of these labs still received partial support for lab managers; however at this time the funding was used to help support graduate student managers rather than staff. All ISR funding for lab managers ceased in 2006 due to budgetary concerns, and ISR had no technical staff for the next eight years. This changed in 2014 when a general facilities manager was hired using soft money. T wo staff were lost who had responsibilities for keeping current ISR's database of students, alumni, academic, government and industrial contacts. In the years since, it has been difficult to maintain and add to the database. T o be sure, ISR's circumstances are not all that different from that of staff in many other units at the University of Maryland and in other public higher-education institutions across the country. The long-term situation of having fewer state budget-line staff to accomplish more tasks, coupled with the increased use of student workers, soft money po - sitions and specialized outside contractors appears to be the new normal. Soft money solutions Several additions to ISR staff have been funded via soft money starting in the early 2000s. In the time since the re - cent recession, the Institute has been grateful for the univer - sity's recognition of the importance of its research initiatives and strategy for the future. The current ISR Director re - ceived start-up funds from the Clark School of Engineering as well as soft money on several occasions for new initiatives and systems engineering education. ISR also has been the recipient of soft money funds from the university's Division of Research, the Office of the Provost and other academic units on campus. Some of this funding has been used to restore staff functionality lost over the years. One example is the position of a staff educational program director. Other funding was used for a staff facilities manager to manage ISR labs and offices, a part-time staff administrator for the growing Maryland Robotics Center, and an administrative staff person for the NEXTOR II project. A.6 Facilities ISR occupies space in the A.V . Williams Building and the adjacent Engineering Annex Building. ISR joint-appoint - ment faculty have offices in several different building across campus. Below is a full list of ISR faculty centers and labs: Centers Federal Aviation Administration Center of Excellence in Aviation Operations Research (NEXTOR II) Maryland Robotics Center Laboratories Advanced Manufacturing Lab Autonomy Robotics Cognition Lab Collective Dynamics and Control Lab Computational Sensorimotor Systems Lab Control of Miniaturized Systems for Mechatronic, Biological, and Clinical Applications Laboratory CPS & Cooperative Autonomy Lab Simulation-Based System Design Laboratory (formerly the Computer Integrated Manufacturing Laboratory) Integrated Biomorphic Information Systems Laboratory Intelligent Servosystems Lab Laboratory for Advanced Materials Processing Laboratory for Microtechnologies Maryland Embedded Systems and Hardware Security (MeshSec) Lab MEMS Sensors and Actuators Lab Micro Robotics Lab Neural Systems Lab Power Electronics, Energy Harvesting and Renewable Energies Laboratory Robotics Realization Lab Speech Communication Lab Systems Engineering and Integration Lab Wireless Sensor LaboratoryISR Review Report March 4, 20169A.7 Recommendations Recommendations can be found at the end of the major sections of this report (cf. Sections B.5, C.4, E.5). In this section, we highlight three of these recommendations in research and education. 1. (cf. Section B.5) ISR should develop ongoing programs for seeding early-stage interdisciplinary projects. ISR has supported several ad-hoc mechanisms in the past for initiating new interdisciplinary research efforts. These should be regularized and continued as a means of ensuring ISR's continued commitment to this key part of its, the Clark School's, and the university's mission. 2. (cf. Section C.5) ISR should study and decide the future of the Master of Science in Systems Engi - neering program. ISR should study and decide the future of the Master of Science in Systems Engineering program. A review should broadly involve ISR faculty and should address the structural issues, which have been identified over the years and are discussed in Section C.5. If the MSSE program is to be sustainable, it must have strong faculty support and secure financial support for the position of director of the program. 3. ISR should develop mechanisms for the ongoing review and discussion of strategic planning. In Fall 2015, through the extensive efforts of its Strategic Planning Committee, ISR developed a Five Y ear Strate - gic Research Plan. This is an important living document that charts strategic research directions for ISR for the next five years. We encourage ISR to establish a mech - anism for periodic review and modification of strategic research and education objectives. B. Research As its name indicates, the Institute for Systems Research focuses on scholarly research in the area of systems. This section provides more detail about the research program of the institute and how it is carried out. It also reviews some of the noteworthy achievements of ISR-based researchers. B.1 Research mission and philosophy A key mission of ISR is to promote and facilitate research in systems science and engineering. While the specific defini - tions of the terms \"system science\" and \"system engineer - ing\" are open to debate, within ISR the former is taken to refer to a collection of mathematically-inspired frameworks and methods for analyzing models of system behavior. T op - ics such as optimization, simulation, feedback control, and operations research fall naturally within this umbrella. The term \"systems engineering\" covers issues related to the principled design and development of systems intend - ed to carry out a specific purpose; traditional engineering concerns such as resource allocation, cost/benefit tradeoffs, system interfaces and operating constraints are related to this subject. Since its founding, ISR has focused in particular on the sci - entific and engineering challenges associated with designing and analyzing systems in which communications, compu - tation and control feature prominently. Figure 2 summarizes the relationship among the major research themes in sys - tems science, and also the relationship between the scientific and engineering themes within ISR. Figure 2. ISR Research Framework (from 25th Anniversary Report) In comparison to more established disciplines such as mathematics or electrical engineering, systems engineering and systems science are relatively immature. ISR has had, and should continue to have, an important role to play in laying the foundations for these subjects. In this regard, the Institute's focus on technical, as opposed to, for example, managerial, systems helps differentiate it from other sys - tems-engineering institutes and departments. ISR also is charged with promoting interdisciplinary re - search. This focus is essential for a systems research organiza - tion, since modern systems include a heterogeneous array of components and systems, which may be mechanical, elec - trical/electronic, biological, software, etc., and which may be co-located or spread over significant distances from one another. ISR is intended to be a cross-cutting organization, with members from different departments given explicit ap - pointments, and with separate, department-style infrastruc - ture for research-proposal processing, grant management, and colloquia series. It also has research centers, such as the Maryland Robotics Center, that it helped found and for which it provides administrative and technical support.The Institute for Systems Research10B.2. Research teaming model ISR's research model is intended to advance its mission as an interdisciplinary institute focused on promoting and facilitating systems science and engineering. Since its incep - tion, and particularly after its graduation from the NSF En - gineering Research Center program, ISR has used diverse means for supporting and catalyzing research efforts. Although not explicitly stated, ISR's research model revolves around group collaborations devoted to specific research topics. At the earliest stages, small groups of two to three ISR faculty undertake such collaborations, typically by submitting joint grant proposals to external research-fund - ing agencies such as the National Science Foundation or the Air Force Office of Scientific Research. T o stimulate such early-state collaborations, ISR has in the past made small seed-funding grants available via an internal competition. As these collaborations mature and expand around a par - ticular topic, larger groups of five to 10 faculty, sometimes with collaborators at other institutions, may submit larger, longer-term project proposals to external funding agencies such as DARPA, or to special programs at the National Sci - ence Foundation such as the Engineering Research Centers program or Expeditions in Computing. ISR supports these activities by providing monetary sup - port to develop initiatives in targeted areas, such as green communications, that can be the basis for such proposals; by acting as a clearinghouse on campus for researchers interest - ed in identifying collaborators with whom to work on these larger-scale projects; and by serving as an informational re - source for other sources of on-campus support (such as the Vice President for Research's office) for the pursuit of larger funding opportunities. For topics attracting significant interest, and with the potential for generating longer-term revenue streams, ISR also serves as an incubator for research centers; the found - ing of the Maryland Robotics Center is a recent example of this phenomenon. Specific assistance provided by the Institute for the founding of centers includes administrative and business office support; advice on possible on-campus collaborators, office space and other resources; guidance on potential funding and partnering opportunities; and help with publicity and public relations. Some centers, such as the Maryland NanoCenter, maintain strong ongoing connections with ISR; others, such as the Center for Advanced Life-Cycle Engineering, \"graduate\" and become free-standing. T able 3 lists the centers currently affiliated with ISR and the year they were founded.Another aspect of ISR's research model involves providing opportunities for researchers to meet and interact, so that relationships that might lead to future research collabora - tions can be developed and nurtured. Such efforts include social events such as the regular \"Sys - tem Breaks\" and the annual welcome-back receptions. Oth - er initiatives include eight themed speaker series for which ISR provides funding and support: Advanced Networks Colloquia Brain-Based System Seminar Series ISR Distinguished Lecturer Series Intelligent Automation, Inc. Colloquia Series* (showcase of ISR faculty research) Lockheed Martin Maryland Robotics Center Seminar Series* Microsystems Seminar Series Model-Based Systems Engineering Colloquia UTRC Control and Dynamical Systems Invited Lecture Series* *These series currently are underwritten by ISR's partner compa - nies; ISR actively seeks sponsorship for all its series. A listing of seminar series and speakers from 2002 through Spring 2015 is included in Appendix 23 . Faculty-wide meetings, including twice-yearly faculty assemblies and periodic retreats, serve twin purposes of information sharing and facilitating ad-hoc faculty interac - tions during breaks and meals. Finally, as noted elsewhere in this document, ISR includes mechanisms for shared governance in the form of various faculty committees. These also provide opportunities for faculty to meet and interact, with research collaborations potentially emerging as a result. ISR recently drafted a five-year strategic research plan. The process was led by a Strategic Planning Committee, with significant input from the faculty.

Table 4 shows the cumulative external research funding of ISR joint-appointment faculty in the years 2010-14. This figure may be seen as roughly stable in this time frame; the uptick in 2011 and downtick in 2014 may be attributed to changes in the composition of the faculty.

The numbers reflect, for each year, publications involving ISR faculty from more than one department. The steady growth in this figure may be seen as an indication of the emphasis ISR places on the interdisciplinary component of its mission. This section gives the titles, ISR joint appointment faculty involved and funding agencies of externally funded collab - orative research efforts currently underway within ISR. The research awards are from 2009-2015 and involve faculty from two or more University of Maryland departments and/or within the University System of Maryland. This same information, including abstracts of the research projects, is found in Appendix 14 . Note that this list does not include a number of projects where the collaborator is from a different field but outside the University System of Maryland. It also does not include numerous projects undertaken with ISR alumni who are now working in other academic settings.2015 Air Force Center of Excellence on Nature-Inspired Flight Technologies and Ideas (NIFTI) Faculty: Pamela Funding Agency: Air Force Office of Scientific Research Development of an Implantable Device to Determine Cancer Cell Response to Chemotherapy in Real Time Faculty: Elisabeth Smela (ME/ISR); Pamela Abshire (ECE/ ISR); John Basil (UM Dental School) Funding Agency: UMD-UMB 2015 Research and Innovation Seed GrantThe Institute for Systems Research12Simulation-Based and Risk-Sensitive Methodologies for Stochastic Optimization and Control Faculty: Steve Marcus (ECE/ISR), Michael Fu (BMGT/ISR) Funding Agency: Air Force Office of Scientific Research 2014 Temporal Auditory Coding in Schizophrenia and Treatment-Resistant Auditory Hallucination Faculty: Jonathan Simon (ECE/BIOLOGY/ISR), L.

(MSE), Energy Frontier Research Center B.5 Recommendations Overall, ISR has a robust research program. The following recommendations are intended to preserve and enhance this robustness. Each is presented with a short rationale. 1. Develop ongoing programs for seeding early-stage interdisciplinary projects. ISR has supported several ad-hoc mechanisms in the past (seed grants, initiatives, etc.) for initiating new interdis - ciplinary research efforts. These should be regularized and continued as a means of ensuring ISR's continued commitment to this key part of its, the Clark School's, and the university's mission. 2. Convey to the faculty and staff on a regular basis, such as during the annual \"State of ISR\" pre - sentation by the ISR Director, quantitative data reflecting how ISR is addressing its mission and vision. Currently, a \"State of the Institute\" address is given; this recommendation would be to use the opportunity to review the mission and vision and to give quantitative as well as anecdotal data on how well ISR is doing in achieving its mission and vision. 3. Clarify criteria for center relationships, including creation, sustainment, \"graduation\" and decom - missioning. The incubation of centers represents an important aspect of ISR's activities, and yet a review of the centers currently affiliated with the Institute indicates widely varying levels of activity and engagement. Developing guidelines for determining how centers are formed, sustained, and eventually made independent or decom - missioned, would help ensure some consistency in these matters. 4. Ensure intra-Institute communication mech - anisms are up-to-date, including mailing lists, web resources and calendars, and develop an \"on-boarding\" document for new faculty and The Institute for Systems Research14staff describing ISR infrastructure, facilities and resources. One good way to stimulate collaborations is to make Institute members aware of when their colleagues have competed successfully for grant funding. Announcing these awards via e-mail, and also on ISR website and other social media, achieves this goal. 5. ISR should develop mechanisms for the ongoing review and discussion of strategic planning. In Fall 2015, through the extensive efforts of its Strategic Planning Committee, ISR developed a Five Y ear Strate - gic Research Plan. This is an important living document that charts strategic research directions for ISR for the next five years. We encourage ISR to establish a mech - anism for periodic review and modification of strategic objectives. C. EDUCATION C.1 Educational impact of ISR's research programs ISR was born as an NSF Engineering Research Center with a primary mission to pursue a systems science research agenda, and to integrate research, education, and technolog - ical innovation. Research continues to be its principal focus. Its primary educational impact is through the integration of students at all levels into its research enterprise. ISR research projects nearly always include (and usually require) substan - tial input from students. Through this deep involvement in research, ISR students receive the most valuable educational experience a world-class research university has to offer. A distinctive aspect of the research projects funded under the original NSF ERC structure was that projects were required to be interdisciplinary. That is, to receive funding, projects had to involve faculty and (by association) students from multiple departments. While this is not a requirement of current ISR projects, it continues to be very common. The need to integrate disciplinary knowledge serves to fur - ther enhance the educational experience for ISR students. While students from ISR's MSSE program often participate in research projects, by far the majority of students involved in ISR research projects are Ph.D. and M.S. students whose advisors are ISR faculty members, and who are earning their degrees through departmental programs. Howev - er, many ISR projects also involve post-docs and visiting scientists or engineers. It is also the case that many faculty carve out a strong role for undergraduate students. Earlier in its history, ISR hosted the NSF Y oung Scholars program, which brought high school students to campus during the summer to work on ISR projects. Research team members from all of these groups have received valuable educations that in many cases have led to outstanding job placements and rewarding careers.ISR Student Organization While ISR students have their disciplinary \"home\" outside the Institute, ISR has its own somewhat special community. The ISR Student Organization (ISO) serves an important role in building this community. What makes this organi - zation unique amongst other student organizations is that like ISR itself, membership is not limited to students from a single department. Thus it serves as a forum that facilitates inter-departmental student interactions which might not occur otherwise. The ISO existed before its sister organization the ECE Graduate Student Association (GSA) and served as the mod - el for its development. The current ISR leadership has con - tributed significantly in establishing the ISO as a prominent part of ISR student experience; this has come in the form of newly allocated resources which allowed the creation of an ISR student lounge, as well as staff support for organizing ISO events. These include social events and employment and mentoring events with invited industry partners and ISR alumni. The ISO also has held meet-and-greet events to raise awareness about the ISO, as well as poster sessions in which students have the opportunity to present their own research to faculty members and external guests. The activ - ities and events sponsored by the ISO contribute to student growth not only by fostering student interaction, but also by preparing students for long-term success in their careers after graduate school. ISR alumni profiles The following paragraphs are examples of the academic, business and government career paths ISR alumni and postdoctoral researchers have chosen over the years. These examples also are indicative of the quality of our alumni and the many opportunities available to those with systems science training.

He currently serves as senior scientific adviser to the Defense Programs Office of the National Nuclear Security Administration of the U.S. Department of Energy. Hamid Jafarkhani (EE Ph.D. 1997) was advised by Profes - sor Nariman Farvardin (ECE/ISR)\u2014former ECE depart - ment chair, Clark School dean, and University of Maryland provost.

Poovendran is a founding member and the associate director of research of the UW Center for Excellence in Information Assurance Research and Education. Zhengying Zhao was a postdoctoral researcher within ISR (2003), advised by Professor Michael Ball (BMGT/ ISR), who worked on NSF- and T oshiba-funded projects. This experience led directly to a position at Intel where he manages the Global Operations Research Engineer T eam for the Supply Planning Operations and Customer Planning and Logistic functions. He was recently named an Intel Principal Engineer. Enlu Zhou (EE Ph.D. 2009) was co-advised by Profes - sor Steve Marcus (ECE/ISR) and Professor Michael Fu (BMGT/ISR). She is an assistant professor in the Stewart School of Industrial & Systems Engineering at Georgia T ech. Her research interests include simulation optimization, stochastic control, and Monte Carlo methods, with applica - tions in financial engineering and revenue management. Examples of Undergraduate Research Experiences From its earliest days, ISR has been successful in ob - taining grants for NSF's summer Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) programs. These summer programs, typically funded for three-year runs, integrate both University of Maryland students and students from other universities into ISR research projects. Themes vary based on the ISR faculty PI's interests; ISR's most recent REU grant (2012-2014) was on microrobotics and was headed by Sarah Bergbreiter. In its early years, ISR obtained state funding for the Undergraduate Research Participation Award (URPA) Program. This program provided a stipend to University of Maryland students to work on ISR projects either during the summer or the academic year. Professor Gary Rubloff's Laboratory for Advanced Materials Processing typically has between two and five undergraduates intimately involved in laboratory projects. Alumni of this lab have entered Ph.D. programs at the University of Maryland, UC Berkeley and MIT. Professor S. K. Gupta, director of the Maryland Robotics Center, similarly directs between two and five under - graduate students each semester on robotics projects. These are particularly attractive to undergraduates because of the opportunity for broad, innovative thinking and the appeal of the final product. Professor P . S. Krishnaprasad has placed a strong empha - sis on the integration of undergraduates into the work of his Intelligent Servosystems Laboratory over the past three decades. The student experiences have varied from summer projects, sometimes supported by NSF REU programs, to multiple academic year involvement in collaborative research and independent projects. The Institute for Systems Research16 One of the students who conducted research in the Intelligent Servosystem Lab was Ermin Wei (2008 triple B.S. in Computer Engineering, Mathematics and Finance with a minor in German; 2014 Ph.D. from EECS at MIT). She is now an assistant professor in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Northwestern University. C.2 Masters degree programs in systems engineering Master of Science in Systems Engineering (MSSE) The Master of Science in Systems Engineering (MSSE) was launched in 1987. It differs from traditional engineering de - grees in that it is not focused on knowledge in a single core domain\u2014e.g. materials, aeronautics, mechanical design\u2014but rather teaches principles and methods applicable across domains. Its students study integration and design problems that by their nature involve multiple engineering disciplines. The MSSE program also differs from traditional systems engineering degrees in that it incorporates the \"system science\" knowledge and points-of-view of ISR faculty. Stu - dents are taught design, analysis and optimization methods not found in other programs. Throughout its history, the program has received strong input from ISR industry partners. In the 1996-98 period and again in 2006-2007, formal reviews and curriculum redesigns were proposed and implemented by teams consist - ing of both ISR faculty and industry partners. In the period 2000-2002, ISR faculty obtained an NSF grant to design curriculum innovations for MSSE courses. Professional Master of Systems Engineering (PMSE) The MSSE program graduated its first student in 1990. A related program, the Professional Masters of Systems Engi - neering (PMSE), was started in 1994. From the beginning these two programs have been closely linked. A set of basic/ required systems engineering courses are shared between the PMSE and MSSE programs so that each class contains students from both programs (see Appendices 24 and 25 for curricula of the two programs). Table 6: MSSE and PMSE Degrees Awarded, FY1993-2014MSSE and PMSE Degrees Awarded, FY1993-2014 FY 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 MSSE 7 7 8 10 5 6 7 8 8 10 11 11 4 7 5 3 0 0 0 3 6 10 PMSE \u2014 \u2014 * * * * * * 6 7 6 8 10 7 15 12 15 14 13 9 17 6 TOTALS: MSSE 136 PMSE 174 *PMSE totals from 1995-2000 aggregate only = 29The MSSE program requires a thesis or scholarly paper, whereas the PMSE program only requires coursework. MSSE students typically choose disciplinary classes from other departments. These classes would not include PMSE students but might include students from other disciplines, such as electrical engineering. ISR receives funds from the university (a portion of the tuition) to support the PMSE program but does not re - ceive additional funds to support the MSSE program. This program architecture allows the PMSE funds to subsidize instructor costs for the MSSE program. T able 6 provides statistics on the graduates from the two programs over their histories. The low number of graduates in the periods of 2009-2010 reflects the fact that the MSSE program had stopped accepting students in the years leading up to 2007. Around 2007, some resources were invested into the program and students were once again brought in. The more recent progress of both programs is reflected in Figures 3, 4 and 5. The current number of enrollees should probably be described as modest. Efforts to bring up enroll - ment have had some success, but more work and investment probably is required to make the programs a success. Teaching MSSE courses As discussed earlier, because ISR is a research institute, its faculty have a reduced teaching load and no formal teaching duties within ISR. As such, the MSSE curriculum is taught through special \"deals\" made with certain faculty and/or their departments, overload teaching and the use of adjuncts. Recently ISR faculty have developed and offered two innovative special MSSE electives: Sensor Systems (Abshire & Lovell) and Cybersecurity for the Smart Grid (Qu). The faculty involved volunteered to teach these courses over and above their normal teaching loads. Recent task force recommendations (2012) A recent ISR Systems Engineering Task Force sought to address the challenges around the lack of ISR faculty involvement in the MSSE program. The committee's report, delivered in Spring 2012, provided multiple recommen - dations. These sought both to improve faculty attention to systems engineering (as opposed to systems science) and also to establish faculty teaching commitments. ISR Review Report March 4, 201617are introduced to the technical aspects of systems engineer - ing practice through team-based project development and a systematic step-by-step procedure for product development that includes working with a real-world customer. Since its initial offering in Fall 2010, annual enrollment in the course has grown from 11 to 78 in AY2014-2015 (see Figure 6 ). In 1996, ISR was chosen to administer the brand-new Gemstone program. The innovative, interdisciplinary undergraduate honors program was conceived by former Clark School Dean William Destler (now president of the Rochester Institute of T echnology). As the Clark School's first interdisciplinary unit, ISR was the natural incubator for this unique undergraduate education program. Freshmen in Gemstone form teams and spend the next three years an - alyzing and investigating important societal problems from various disciplinary perspectives. T wo ISR faculty members, Thomas Fuja (now at the University of Notre Dame) and Christopher Davis (Electrical and Computer Engineering), have served as the director of the Gemstone program and many others have served as Gemstone team mentors. Currently, four ISR faculty are mentoring Gemstone research teams. Oversight of the Gemstone Program re - mained in the Clark School until it became one of the five living-learning programs within the University's Honors College in July 2010.Specifically, the report recommended the establishment of an ISR faculty teaching \"obligation.\" At the time of ISR faculty contract renewals, each faculty member would be required to choose and commit to a teaching \"obligation.\" The nature of this obligation should be flexible, e.g. it does not necessarily involve the delivery of a full course. While course development or delivery might constitute a possible way of fulfilling the obligation, student advising, delivery of a guest lecture or other activities could also satisfy the requirement. These recommendations never were formally accepted by ISR faculty, although the ISR director is seeking to implement some aspects of them. In addition, at recent ISR faculty meetings there have been productive discussions on how to address these issues, including discussion of how involvement in the MSSE program can enhance faculty members' research programs. C.3 ISR leadership in systems and cross-disciplinary programs In the past six years, ISR has developed and offered an undergraduate projects course for senior-level engineering students that teaches the principles of systems science and systems engineering. The course, ENSE 489P: Special Top - ics in Engineering: Hands-on Systems Engineering Proj - ects, draws students from all areas of engineering. Students Figure 6: Enrollment in ENES 489P , AY2010-11 to Figure 4: Entering MSSE Students, 2007-2014*Figures not yet available for 2015* Figure 5: MSSE Enrollment, 2007-2014*Figures not yet available for 2015*The Institute for Systems Research18that counts toward both the BS and MSSE degree. The ENSE courses also count as CHBE electives. In the follow - ing year, students will take the remaining courses required to complete the MSSE degree, as well as complete research and a thesis. Possible undergraduate minor in systems engineering The ISR Education Program Committee was charged in 2014-2015 to create a roadmap for the development of an undergraduate systems engineering (SE) minor. The moti - vation came from the feeling that there is a growing interest and need for incorporating systems engineering and systems thinking into the undergraduate curriculum. Moreover, in the last three years the enrollment in the capstone SE project course ENES 489P has grown to the point where there is a waiting list for both semesters. The committee has proposed the following tentative structure: 1) Systems Engineering Concepts Course 2) Probability/Statistics Course 3) System Modeling/Analysis Course 4) SE/Project Management Course 5) SE Project Course ENES 489P All except the first requirement would come from existing courses. The first requirement may be a one-credit over - view course rather than a three-credit course like the other requirements. C.5 Analysis and recommendations Analysis By far ISR's most significant educational impact has been through student involvement in its research programs. ISR has many distinguished alumni who can trace their success back to the rich and unique research experience provided by ISR. This is to be expected, since ISR was created to be a research institute and research remains its principal mission. Over the years, the MSSE program has gone through good and bad periods. After a relatively short period (2007-2008) when no new students were admitted, the MSSE program has been revived and once again is admitting and graduating students. However, it must still be viewed as a somewhat marginal program. Many issues contribute to the challenges ISR has had with maintaining a high-quality program: 1. The MSSE program is a systems engineering program. As discussed earlier, there is a difference between systems engineering and systems science. Many ISR faculty are strong systems scientists but have little interest in, or affinity for, systems engineering. 2. ISR faculty have no formal teaching requirement within ISR. As such the MSSE program is run through special \"deals\" with certain faculty and/or their departments, overload teaching and the use of adjuncts. This comment ISR faculty have taken leadership roles in other Clark School and cross-campus programs, reflecting the faculty's broad, cross-disciplinary nature. For example, Jeffrey Herr - mann is the associate director for the university's QUEST (Quality Enhancement Systems and Teams) honors fel - lows program, and David Lovell is the faculty advisor of the Clark School's chapter of Engineers Without Borders. A new example of this is Professor Ray Adomaitis' (CHBE/ISR) leadership in the university's Solar De - cathalon efforts. The Solar Decathlon is a U.S. Depart - ment of Energy-sponsored biennial competition where student teams design, construct, and operate energy efficient and cost-effective solar powered homes. In winter 2015, Adomaitis, together with two co-PIs from the School of Architecture, were informed that their proposal was selected as one of 20 teams sched - uled to compete in 2017. A distinguishing feature of Team Maryland's proposal is the prominent role systems engineering methods will play in the design, optimization, construction, and op - eration of the solar home. Under the guidance of ISR faculty, undergraduate and graduate students (including MSSE students) will employ Model-Based Systems En - gineering (MBSE) approaches to define system func - tional requirements from the competition rules, and will decompose the project design elements in a hierarchical manner while simultaneously identifying validation cri - teria to be tested in the project construction phase. The systems science elements that will be developed as part of this project include physically based models of house mechanical systems performance; as well as thermal dynamics, dynamic optimization of energy and water use, real-time control of the house environment; and distributed sensing, communication, and actua - tion of house mechanical systems. The proposed use of Model Predictive Control (MPC) for house environ - mental control, and stochastic dynamic optimization for the integration of photovoltaic, thermal solar, and energy storage systems will provide substantive research problems for MSSE and other engineering graduate students. C.4 New educational initiatives New combined CHBE BS/MSSE program A five-year combined Chemical and Biomolecular Engi - neering Bachelor of Science/Master of Science in Sys - tems Engineering degree will be offered by ISR and the Clark School's Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering beginning in Fall 2015. The program offers in - terested CHBE undergraduate students a strong foundation in process systems engineering concepts. It also will open new employment opportunities for CHBE students in the Washington, D.C. area. Students will take two core ENSE graduate courses in their senior year (ENSE 621 and ENSE 622) and one elective ISR Review Report March 4, 201619Refereed Journal Publications by ISR Joint Appointment Faculty, 2010-2015 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 101 86 118 111 99 50 (partial year) Table 7: Refereed Journal Publications by ISR Joint Appointment Faculty, 2010-2015should be taken as a fact, not as a criticism or necessarily a suggestion for change. In fact, the state originally fund - ed ISR as a research institute so that its faculty support was designated for research and not instruction. Other research institutes on the University of Maryland campus have similar arrangements. A substantial, \"wholesale\" change in ISR teaching requirements would certainly change the fundamental nature of the Institute. 3. Generally, faculty have a strong preference for providing research support to Ph.D. students rather than (terminal) masters students. As a result, ISR is only able to provide a relatively small number of MSSE students with research assistantships. 4. Because MSSE students share the majority of their classes with PMSE students, it is not possible to add depth to the classes that would provide MSSE students with a stronger, more research-focused program than typical professional masters programs. 5. Largely because of the issues described above, the uni - versity, the Clark School and ISR itself have not made a long-term financial or organizational commitment to the MSSE program. ISR's impact on undergraduate education through involve - ment of undergraduates in research projects and its delivery of a capstone course is laudable and certainly has had a significant impact. Opportunities The demand in various competitive systems engineering programs clearly indicates the possibility for growing the MSSE program. At the same time, ISR must effectively compete with these programs. ISR's clear strategic advan - tage is the intellectual strength and research reputation of its faculty. Y et, it must address the deficiencies described above to create a world-class program that takes advantage of the strength of its faculty. Alternatively, ISR and the Clark School could save finan - cial and organizational resources by closing the program. However, in addition to diminishing the impact of ISR in the educational domain, this would close off a lane for ISR to disseminate some aspects of its research into practice. Any drastic changes along these lines should be considered in the context of the PMSE program; the two programs might be merged, or one closed and the other left open. The first two challenges discussed above represent major structural challenges. These have been known to ISR and Clark School faculty and administrators for many years. Y et attempts to improve the viability of the program over those years have led to, at best, modest results. For example, the conclusion of a review com- mittee that included ISR faculty and industry and government representatives stated that ISR should set an enrollment goal of 100 students to consider its pro- gram successful. This goal certainly has not been met. The program history leads one to conclude that either something drastic must be done to improve the program or it should be dropped. Given the demand for systems engineering education among practicing engineers, there appears to be an oppor - tunity for the delivery of non-degree programs aimed at working professionals. D. Faculty There are three types of ISR faculty appointments: joint, affiliate, and research. Joint appointment faculty are tenure-track faculty who have a portion (usually around 50 percent) of their salary paid by ISR and are expected to spend a signif - icant portion of their time participating in interdisci - plinary research projects and ISR activities. The State of Maryland funded ISR to enable faculty to have the time to do this. Joint appointment faculty have full voting rights in ISR and serve on ISR committees. Most have a reduced teaching load in their departments in alignment with their reduced appointment in the department. Affiliate faculty are tenure-track faculty who do not receive salary from ISR (a \"zero percent appointment\") but participate in the research and other activities of the Institute. They do not have voting rights. Research faculty are supported on research grants, as opposed to state funds. Research faculty have full voting rights in ISR and serve on ISR committees. ISR joint appointments are three-year rotating appoint - ments. A faculty member applies and is evaluated by an ISR Appointment, Promotion, and T enure (APT) committee that is partly elected and partly appointed. It evaluates all candidates and makes recommendations to the ISR Direc - tor, who makes the final decisions. Obviously, ISR looks for quality and excellence, but the appointment is also based on interdisciplinary work and compatibility with ISR's strategic needs. This in-depth review every three years is more thor - ough than many post-tenure review processes, and provides significant feedback to ISR faculty. It is particularly import - ant for associate professors; the ISR Director has used this process as an opportunity for their mentoring and career development as they move toward full Professor. ISR joint appointment faculty have tenure track appoint - ments in departments across the campus, including almost all of the engineering departments, the Smith School of Business, Biology, and Computer Science. In addition to The Institute for Systems Research20these departments, there are also ISR affiliate faculty from the Mathematics Department. It is difficult for isolated researchers to fit into ISR, with its emphasis on collegiality and interdisciplinary research. ISR lets prospective joint appointment and affiliate faculty know that they are expected to interact with other faculty; one of the criteria during the review is that the committee sees evidence that this is already occurring. ISR has official input into both the promotion and salary processes of its jointly appointed faculty. By the early 1990s, faculty were being drawn to the Univer - sity of Maryland specifically to work in ISR. In addition, current faculty within the university seek joint appoint - ments or affiliations with the institute on a regular basis. Of ISR's five directors, two were already University of Mary - land faculty, but three came to the university specifically to work with ISR. Steve Marcus originally was recruited from the University of T exas to be ISR Director in 1991, while Gary Rubloff came from North Carolina State University to become Director in 1996. Reza Ghodssi, ISR's current Director, came to the university as an ISR joint appoint - ment from a postdoctoral position at MIT; being able to be a part of ISR weighed heavily in his decision to accept Maryland's offer. Beyond these directors, many other faculty have chosen the University of Maryland based on the ability to be associated with ISR. Quality of the faculty Using any measurement, ISR is at least very competitive in the fields of research it has entered. In certain areas such as communication, control, neuroscience, MEMS and oper - ations research, ISR is among the leaders. T able 7 shows the number of refereed journal publications by ISR joint appointment faculty from 2010-2015. ISR faculty have given 27 plenary addresses at international conferences in the past five years (see Appendix 5 ). ISR fac - ulty include 62 Fellows of academic societies (see Appendix 4) and 45 NSF CAREER and other Y oung Investigator awards (see Appendix 8 ). ISR faculty also have won prestigious national and interna - tional awards in their fields. For example, P . S. Krishnaprasad won the IEEE Bode Prize in 2007 \"for fundamental con - tributions to the theory of control of natural and synthetic physical systems.\" The prize, given by the IEEE Control Systems Society, recognizes distinguished contributions to control systems science or engineering. ISR affiliated faculty member Ben Shneiderman (Com - puter Science) was inducted into the National Academy of Engineering in 2010. S.K. Gupta, Elisabeth Smela, Sarah Bergbreiter and Derek Paley have won the Presidential Early Career Award for Sci - entists and Engineers (PECASE). The PECASE is the high - est honor bestowed by the U.S. government on outstanding scientists and engineers beginning their independent careers. The awards are conferred annually at the White House. Other awards won by ISR faculty can be found in Appen - dices 6, 7 and 9. A list of ISR faculty patents is available in Appendix 11. E. Industry outreach, external relations and technology transfer E.1 ISR collaboration mechanisms and modes of interaction From its beginning, industry interaction has been one of ISR's central goals. ISR has always maintained full-time external relations staff dedicated to this function, and has developed a variety of mechanisms by which companies can have a formal relationship with ISR. ISR maintains a strategic partners program with four part - ner levels: Sustaining Partner, Senior Partner, Partner and Associate Partner. Each level has its own minimum contri - bution and benefits. The top three levels include the benefit of one or more faculty-led research projects. ISR always has been very flexible in its industry interactions. It has both customized the formal partner programs and created special mechanisms to meet specific company needs. In addition, ISR centers and large projects\u2014for example CSHCN/HyNet\u2014sometimes have had their own programs and mechanisms for interacting with industry. In all of these cases, the external relations staff has adapted and provided support as appropriate. This staff also has helped develop various international cooperation programs. These have involved formal coopera - tion mechanisms with either foreign universities or research institutes. In addition, ISR has kept step with the rest of the univer - sity in increasing contact with and emphasis on alumni for collaborative and development purposes in recent years. The external relations staff has been tasked with this challenge. This is a long-term, value-added activity; it is well acknowl - edged that \"philanthropy follows engagement.\" T able 8 provides a picture of the level of industry collabo - ration for the 2015 fiscal year. The first section shows the amount of up-front cash payments made by industry to support ISR research. This comes in three forms: member - ship dues for the partnership programs, cash gifts to support faculty and their activities and income from intellectual property license agreements. The second section shows in- kind, no-cost software licenses and in-kind visiting scholar salary values. It also shows funding students receive from companies as interns. The third section gives the value of sponsored research contracts and grants such as industry research contracts and Maryland Industrial Partnership ISR Review Report March 4, 201621(MIPS) projects. The bottom section is a list of all industry partners ISR worked with in some form in FY 2015. This table provides some indication of the breadth of the methods of interaction and also the scope of interactions in terms of numbers and types of organizations. Over the years, ISR has only had two or three companies classified in one of the top three levels of its Strategic Part - ners program. The newer Associate Partners program (with lower dues) currently has 11 partners: Intelligent Automa - tion, Research Center; and ST Microelectronics. The National Institute of Standards and T echnology also is an Associate Partner. It is safe to say that ISR does not have an extensive set of formal partners. At the same, by using a flexible approach, ISR has been able to very broadly engage industry in a cross-section of its research efforts. In the following section we discuss some the key industry relationships.E.2 Key industry collaborations Hughes Network Systems Hughes Network Systems (HNS), headquartered in Mary - land, was an early collaborator with ISR. This collaboration played a strong role in the development of the Center for Satellite and Hybrid Communications Networks (CSHCN), which later became the Maryland Hybrid Networks Center (HyNet). CSHCN/HyNet was a center housed within ISR that brought together satellite communications compa - nies. HNS was probably the most active member and ISR research led by John Baras led to highly successful HNS commercial products. This research produced multiple inventions productized by HNS, including DirecPC, Turbo Internet, DirecWay, and SpaceWay. The inventions received many awards, including the University of Maryland 1994 Outstanding Invention of the Y ear; the Outstanding MIPS Project Award (large company); Distinguished Engineer of the Y ear (Doug Dillon, HNS) from the Maryland Academy of Sciences; the ComNet 1996 New Product Achievement Award (wireless); the 1996 \"Hot Product\" for network services from Data Communications magazine; and the T echnical Excellence Award (networking hardware category), from PC Magazine .Industry collaboration, FY2015 compared to FY2011 FY 2011 FY 2015 Magic - SW for courses; $3,768 each x 65 users) Visiting with these companies in some form: Avoneaux Medical Institute, LLC Capita Foundation Cerona Networks Corp.

Unconventional Concepts, Inc. UTRC Weinberg Medical Physics Table 8: Industry collaboration, FY2015 compared to FY2011The Institute for Systems Research22HNS continues to provide summer internships to Univer - sity of Maryland students. More than 60 students affiliated with CSHCN/HyNet, and many more from University of Maryland at large, have been employed by HNS. Toshiba In 2000, at the invitation of then-University of Maryland President Dan Mote, T oshiba scientists visited several labo - ratories across campus. T oshiba became a strategic partner of ISR based on these visits. Each year T oshiba funded multiple projects (usually between one and two). Depending on the project, the funding supported a combination of faculty, students and post-docs. In all cases, T oshiba scientists or engineers came to College Park for periods of four months to a year to assist with the research. Over the course of the 2001-present collaboration, 18 T oshiba scientists and engineers have visited in this way. Research topics covered a broad cross section, including supply chain management, manufacturing process monitoring and quality control, and MEMS product and process design. T oshiba executives visited ISR on multiple occasions and ISR faculty and staff visited the T oshiba Corporate Manufacturing Research Center in Y okohama, Japan, as well. T oshiba put the results of several ISR projects into use. For example, the \"Advanced Available to Promise\" project directed by Michael Ball produced an optimization model used by T oshiba to drive its available -to-promise business function for point-of- sale terminal production and delivery. This project received the \"Outstanding Contribution to Business Performance Award\" from the Director of T oshiba Corporate Manufacturing Engineering Center (CMC), June, 2003. Honda ISR's long-term partnership with Honda (1999-2009) brought 12 high-quality and high-promise engineers to campus to complete a 14-month set of objectives. Honda engineers were paired with ISR faculty on projects suited to their specialties. As part of Honda's globalization effort, the engineers experienced U.S. university research culture and also learned English. Engineers worked on control theory research, 3-D image reconstruction for video images, hybrid electric vehicle transmissions, and motorcycle noise-damp - ing systems. In addition to the Honda visiting scientists, ISR faculty were awarded two separate Honda Initiation Grant program awards, which added new mechanisms for collab - orations. Research with Bill Levine developed an engine idle speed and emission controller that favorably compared to exist - ing controllers. Modeling was extensively used. The engine model included airflow dynamics, combustion, fuel injection and catalytic converter components. A model was developed by linearizing at nominal points. The model's accuracy was evaluated by comparing both measured and simulated data. The models were used to compare idle controllers, air-fuel ratio controllers, and emission controllers.Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems Northrop Grumman was an ISR industrial affiliate program member for 20 years, usually at the sustaining partner level. There were typically three or four projects per year. Project topic areas were mutually agreed upon based on the exper - tise of ISR faculty and Northrop Grumman's needs at the time. Other collaborations and benefits included: teaming to win agency program awards, participation on the ISR Strategic Advisory Council, Maryland MIPS (state match - ing) awards, student hiring, in-kind donations, and cash gift support. Extensive and frequent discussions and meetings were held to maintain a close relationship and work towards identifying additional collaborations. A recent Northrop Grumman collaboration success in - volved an ISR research team led by Gary Rubloff and Ray Adomaitis. ISR research has helped move Northrop Grum - man to a position of competitive leadership in GaN-based materials and process technology for microelectronics sys - tems, in material quality, process uniformity, film thickness control, and manufacturability. NG has used ISR contribu - tions to fabricate high-power, high-frequency GaN devices. This significant new capability enabled NG Electronic Systems to move from an original Phase I to a considerably larger Phase II Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) program. Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin and its CEO Norman Augustine were key industrial supporters at the creation of ISR. The company endowed the Lockheed Martin Chair in Systems Engineer - ing in 1987 for $1.5 million; John Baras holds this chair. For years Lockheed Martin was a dues-paying member of CSHCN/HyNet, and worked extensively with this center on hybrid networks research. They were also the lead indus - try partner for ATIRP and the Federal Labs Consortium, of which ISR was a part. Over the years, ISR teamed with Lockheed Martin to win MIPS awards and CRAD government agency awards; the company also has sponsored direct research. Lockheed Martin has sponsored student fellowships and supplied judges for the 489P end-of-semester student presentation competition. Currently Lockheed Martin is an ISR Associate Partner, a member of ISR's Strategic Advisory Council, and the spon - sor of the Lockheed Martin Robotics Seminar Series. Intelligent Automation, Inc. (IAI) It is safe to say that Intelligent Automation, Inc., (IAI) is more closely connected to ISR research than any other company. Its president, Vikram Manikonda (EE Ph.D. 1997) is an alumnus. While a graduate student working with P . S. Krishnaprasad, he helped develop MDLe, a motion control language for robotics. IAI further developed the ideas un - derlying MDLe into the commercial multi-agent computa - tion platform, CybelePro, a distributed control framework for higher level motion programming. ISR Review Report March 4, 201623Manikonda is the chair of the ISR Strategic Advisory Council. T wo current IAI research scientists have part-time visiting appointments with ISR, interacting with T ony Ephremides and Michael Fu and their students. IAI has hired eight ISR alumni as permanent staff members, and periodically hires students as interns. IAI provides funding for ISR's internal colloquium series. W ork with startup companies and entrepreneurs ISR relies on the expertise of MTECH and its programs when working with start-up companies and entrepreneurs. Depending upon the needs of the startup (or startup idea), MTECH has programs to assist entrepreneurs working towards success. In particular, ISR faculty and students have collaborated on projects with small, entrepreneurial compa - nies through the Maryland Industrial Partnerships (MIPS) program. ISR periodically engages MTECH professionals to present informative programs to ISR faculty and students. In 2013, ISR held an alumni symposium focused on en - trepreneurship, where successful alumni spoke to current ISR students about their experiences and lessons learned. In addition, in recent years, ISR alumni entrepreneurs have returned to campus on a regular basis to talk specifically with current students in an informal, small group setting. In addition, ISR faculty work with smaller com - panies through the federal government STTR/ SBIR programs. For example, Sennur Ulukus and IAI, Inc., as well as Ben Shapiro and Weinberg Medical Associates, recently worked together through these programs. Other significant collaborations As discussed earlier, ISR has had various levels of interaction with a wide range of industry partners during its history. The various constituent centers within ISR have been a particularly significant mechanism for interaction. For example, CSHCN/HyNet had its own industry partner program. Those partners contributed finan - cial support to the center and ISR and sponsored a variety of research projects. Prominent partners (in additional to HNS) included Loral, Lockheed Martin, COMSAT, TR W and Bell Atlantic. NEXTOR and NEXTOR-II have also had their own industry partner programs. Organizations that have worked closely with ISR faculty have included Federal Express Corp., the Maryland Aviation Administration and Metron Aviation. Throughout the almost 20-year life of NEXTOR and NEXTOR-II, Metron Aviation has had close ties to ISR. Metron and Maryland have had a nearly-continuous stream of joint projects sponsored either by the FAA or NASA. Metron has hired five NEXTOR graduates, includ - ing Robert Hoffman (Math Ph.D. 1997), now Metron Di - rector of Advanced Research. Hoffman has a long-running ISR visiting appointment: He regularly spends time at ISR Figure 7: ISR Strategic Advisory Council, July 2015working with faculty and students. Through this relationship several NEXTOR research results have been integrated into every-day use, especially via FSM, the Metron-developed decision support tool used daily by the FAA and airlines to plan and control air traffic management initiatives. E.3 Strategic Advisory Council The ISR Strategic Advisory Council (SAC) is a scientifi - cally and technically diverse group of seasoned professionals external to ISR. Over the years, its membership has been a balanced mix of industry, academics and international rep - resentatives. Figure 7 lists the SAC members as of July 2015, with their titles and affiliations. Currently, the SAC draws principally from industry. In theory, the SAC is a key component of ISR. The SAC charter states its purpose is to provide evaluation and guid - ance to ISR on research directions, educational programs, and management. This advice ideally delivers strategic benefits to ISR and its external partners. The SAC also is encouraged to contribute substantially by identifying important systems engineering challenges facing industry, government and society. E.4 Partnerships with international universities and research institutes ISR has developed formal collaboration agreements with universities and research institutes in a number of countries (see T able 9 ). These agreements have enriched ISR's research enterprise across several dimensions and given it a global perspective. The types of interactions supported include: Bidirectional exchange of researchers; Bidirectional short-term visits; Co-authors of papers; U.S.-international funding for joint research and joint proposals; Committee membership on student thesis committees, co-advising, and faculty selection committees;The Institute for Systems Research24 Short course development and jointly organized workshops; and Joint degree program development In addition to improving ISR's research enterprise, these relationships also have enhanced ISR's international reputation. E.5 Major technologies and intellectual property produced by ISR ISR research has produced a significant body of valu - able intellectual property. In many cases, this has occurred because of the close interaction between ISR researchers and industry partners. As discussed above, ISR research has been directly converted into valuable products or business functions by HNS (DirecPC and related products), IAI (CybelePro), T oshiba (Available-to-Promise optimization software), Northrup Grumman (GaN-based materials and process technology) and Metron Aviation (new FSM opti - mization-based features). There also have been several cases where ISR faculty have more directly made new technology available commercially, such as through startup companies or direct software distri - bution. Some examples include: Andre Tits and his research team developed the CONSOL and FSQP , software tools for constrained non-linear optimi - zation. These were directly distributed by Tits and developed a large user base. They have been used in important appli - cation by ISR industry partners, Northrup Grumman and General Electric.Carol Espy-Wilson won the University of Maryland 2010 Invention of the Y ear Award for \"Multi-Pitch Tracking in Adverse Environments,\" her invention that radically im - proves sound quality over cell phones and through hearing aids. Espy-Wilson founded the company Omni-Speech LLC, which has commercialized the underlying basis of this technology. S. Raghavan, along with his students, developed a technique to rapidly find so-called Bidder-Pareto-Optimal Core Solu - tions in Combinatorial Auctions. The underlying algorithm and pricing method is now being used internationally in spectrum auctions. This work was awarded the INFORMS Computing Society Prize and was a finalist for the Europe - an Excellence in Practice Award. Ben Shneiderman's research group in the Human Comput - er Interaction Laboratory has produced several important software tools and visualization mechanisms. Spotfire, a multidimensional data visualization tool produced in the lab, was commercialized by the Spotfire company started by Christopher Ahlberg, a visiting student who worked in the lab. This product is used by a broad range of companies in the pharmaceutical, oil and gas and manufacturing control industries. Treemaps is a 2D data-visualization display that represents hierarchical data along with many associated at - tributes in a compact graphical view. An associated software product is distributed commercially and the tool has been profiled in several prominent news outlets. Displays based on it have appeared broadly. The extent of intellectual property produced by ISR faculty is indicated by the long list of patents in Appendix 11 .Australia University of South Australia Egypt Alexandria University Finland University of Oulu, the Centre for Wireless Communications L'\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure (ENS) Verimag Laboratory Georgia Free University of Tbilisi Agricultural University of Georgia Greece The Institute of Computer Science (ICS) of the Foundation of Research and T echnology- Hellas (FORTH) Demokritos: The National Center for Scientific ResearchIraq Baghdad University Italy Autonomous Province of Trento University of Trento Politecnico di Milano (University of Milan) Russia Institute of Information Transmission Problems, Russian Academy of Sciences Sweden The Royal Institute of T echnology, Stockholm (KTH) Linkoping University Switzerland School of Computer and Communication Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) Table 9: Formal International Research AgreementsTable 9: Formal International Research AgreementsISR Review Report March 4, 201625E.6 Analysis and recommendations Analysis ISR has had a very deep and broad set of industry inter - actions. These interactions have enhanced ISR research enterprise by increasing the level of innovation both in the problems studied and the techniques used and has benefit - ted students. Both through interactions with industry partners and through more direct entrepreneurial activity, ISR faculty and students have developed substantial new technologies and intellectual property. In many cases, these capabilities have been applied in industry or government settings. ISR has a strong set of international collaborations. In addi - tion to enhancing its research, these have helped produce a very strong national and international reputation especially within the control community. The SAC is a potential significant resource to ISR to provide outside/independent perspectives and ideas. In practice, the SAC's value to ISR, and ISR's utilization of the SAC over the years, has varied. Neither the SAC's observa - tions about ISR, nor its advice have had much impact on the Institute. In recent years, the SAC has convened about every 18 months, in addition to contacts during the year via e-mail and conference calls to discuss specific topics. ISR could gain better value from weighing and considering the SAC's deliberations on its behalf, and having more regular meetings.Opportunities ISR's industry interaction largely has been based on the ap - plication of \"systems science\" in a variety of domains. There would seem to be an opportunity to substantially interact with, and influence, the \"systems engineering\" business community to a much greater extent. While ISR industry impact and interaction has been sub - stantial, and, while some of this activity involves direct ISR faculty entrepreneurial activities, there would appear to be an opportunity for even more entrepreneurial activities, given the extent of innovation produced by ISR research. ISR certainly could take greater advantage of the SAC's willingness to serve. However, ISR does not have a pro - ductive partnership with its SAC at this point. ISR should fundamentally evaluate what kind of a relationship it wants and what it hopes to gain from its external advisory board. This evaluation should cover the SAC's purpose, structure, function, and utilization. ISR also should consider whether it still wants to have an external board.The Institute for Systems Research26Appendix 1: ISR Faculty, as of July 1, 2015 ISR joint appointment faculty Pamela Abshire .........................................................................

Michael Ball \"Advanced Available- to- Promise\" project funded by, and jointly carried out with, T oshiba Corporation produced an optimization model T oshiba used to drive its available- to- promise business function for point -of- sale terminal pro - duction and delivery. This project received \"the Outstanding Contribution to Business Performance Award\" from the Director of T oshiba Corporate Manufacturing Engineering Center (CMC),June, 2003. Certain concepts and models developed in my FAA -funded research project on \"Collaborative Decision Making\" have been integrated into decision support tools and proce - dures used by the FAA and the airlines. For example, the \"distance -based Ground Delay Program\" mechanism we de - veloped is now part of the FMS decision support tool used by FAA and airlines in ground delay program planning. Alexander Barg My most important contribution to industry is related to the problem of data encoding in distributed storage systems for the purpose of data protection against disk failures. I constructed an optimal solution to the encoding problem which improves on the state of the art technology widely used in industry. I am currently exploring possibilities for commercialization of the new coding design. Sarah Bergbreiter Collaboration with Renensys on NSF CPS grant for bridge monitoring (just starting). In addition, a Google solve for a talk. Fabricated tactile sensors sent to companies iWalk and BionicSkins. Anthony Ephremides In the '90's along with John Baras and a team from the CCDS we worked with Hughes Network Systems to help them develop their product DirectPC. This was a major success for the company and they acknowledged it. We re - ceived a campus award for that, and we still receive royalties. Recently (during 2014) Lucent-Alcatel Bell Labs ran a competition for the Bell Prize. They advertised it extensive - ly, asking for \"ideas\" contributions that would be \"movers and shakers.\" I submitted one on Implementable Random Access. They received over 400 inputs and they selected about forty (mine was amongst them). I went to Murray Hill to defend it as a finalist. In the end the award was given to a Princeton Professor (Abbe).

Reza Ghodssi The MEMS-based Gray-scale T echnology developed in our group and funded by Army Research Lab (ARL), was also used by T oshiba to develop a miniature/compact relay device in silicon. They sent two of their engineers to ISR to work with us in my MSAL lab for almost one year to develop and implement the initial concept. The micro-ball bearing technology in MEMS has been recognized as one of the highlights in our group here at ISR. In the last few years, both SAMSUNG and SONYO have used this technique for some for their next generation minature energy harvesting devices. Maryland Robotics Center We have started dialogues with these four companies: Lockheed Martin Advanced T echnology Lab (ATL) to develop a strategic robotics partnership. Pete Staritz from ATL visited us last semester. ATL has renewed its robotics seminar series sponsorship. Northrop Grumman Undersea Systems. Jeff Coriale and I visited them last semester and they have joined ISR's Associate Partners Program (APP). They would like to find ways to support autonomy research at Maryland. ABB, to arrange a donation of their new dual arm robot, and sign them up as an ISR APP member as a result. This will add a new capability to the Robot Realization Lab. ISR Review Report March 4, 201657 Intelligent Automation Inc., for potential collaboration on new DARPA programs. S. K. Gupta My research group has developed planning algorithms for realizing autonomous unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), funded by ONR. We developed a model-predictive tra - jectory planning algorithm for USVs operating in civil - ian traffic. It reasons about the availability of contingency maneuvers needed if any of the civilian vessels breaches the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea. We also developed a local trajectory planning algorithm that generalizes the velocity obstacle concept to systems with non-linear dynamics and performed physical experiments to evaluate the planner in a real-world surveillance task. We have filed an invention disclosure on this software, recently received funding from MIPS, and partnered with Hyperion T echnologies to transition to a commercial product. Jeffrey Herrmann Throughout my career here I have worked with Maryland manufacturing firms to help them improve operations through better scheduling, facility layout, and improved pro - cesses, often using the ideas of lean manufacturing. I have created a professional development short course on facility design for lean manufacturing (which is also used to further my research on engineering design decision making). As a leader of the QUEST Honors Program, I have re - cruited corporate partners, scoped consulting projects, and advised teams of seniors who work with manufacturers and other firms to invent, evaluate, and recommend solutions to real -world problems. These student projects have made an impact on numerous firms over the years and have provided our students with outstanding learning opportunities. Alireza Khaligh Advancement of highly efficient and integrated power elec - tronic interfaces for plug in electric vehicles, and introduc - tion of miniature power electronic interfaces for microro - botics and energy harvesting. P . S. Krishnaprasad I have worked with IAI through student interns (Alldredge, Mischiati, T wu and Dey, with summer support), develop - ment and use (by Kulis and Sodre at IAI) of industrial im - plementation of MDLe (spun-off from ISL), and mentoring of engineers. I have worked with Northrop Grumman on semiconductor manufacturing, focusing on modeling and control of epitaxial CVD processes (A. Newman was partly supported under this). Richard La From 2008 to 2011, I collaborated with Intelligent Automa - tion Inc., (IAI), a local company located in Rockville, Md., on a successful SBIR contract funded by the Army Re - search Lab: \"A swarm intelligence based approach to secure, scalable and robust design for tactical networks\". T ogether with the PI from IAI, we investigated the fundamental limits of the communication overhead that is necessary for exchanging location information in multi-hop wireless networks. In addition, we designed a new family of robust and scalable message forwarding schemes based on swarm intelligence, which can be viewed a backward reinforcement learning method. Since the summer of 2014, my student and I have been collaborating with researchers at Bell Labs, a research lab for Alcatel-Lucent, on designing and evaluating the perfor - mance of real-time transport protocol (RTTP) for deliver - ing both streaming services and online gaming. In particular, our collaboration focused on implementing the RTTP protocol proposed by Google Inc., and carrying out its performance analysis in real networks. We are also develop - ing a mathematical model for capturing the dynamics of the RTTP protocol as a feedback control system with delays to understand the fundamental behavior of such RTTP protocols interacting with the Internet that exhibit complex dynamics at multiple timescales. Armand Makowski I am in preliminary discussions to develop internship support, and possible techical support to improve existing products for AirPatrol Corp., a startup located near Colum - bia, Md., which develops mobile cybersecurity platforms for enterprises and government agencies. Steve Marcus A project on statistical process control (SPC), funded by and joint with T oshiba Corp., in 2005. This project was the basis for further work (leading to a Ph.D.) by the T oshiba engi - neer, and led to testing of the resulting SPC methodologies in T oshiba factories. With Michael Fu, a project on preventive maintenance (PM) scheduling in semiconductor manufacturing fabs, joint with Intel, AMD, and the University of Cincinnati, in 2001- 2003. The project involved joint work and sum - mer internships at AMD and Intel for Ph.D. students. This project resulted in new methodologies and software for PM scheduling in semiconductor fabs, as well as joint journal papers with engineers from Intel and AMD. Nuno Martins Established a relationship between UTRC and ISR that lead to the creation of the UTRC Invited Lectures on Control and Dynamical Systems. UTRC also became a member of ISR Associate Partners program and Sonja Gla - vaski (former UTRC) became a member of ISR SAC.

I also estab -The Institute for Systems Research58lished an NDA with the National Geographic Society, and we partnered to get a $1.8M grant from NSF to develop an animal-borne wireless network (still ongoing). Prakash Narayan InterDigital, King of Prussia, Pa., initiated collaboration on the algorithmic aspects of our work on network securi - ty, and sponsored a two-year joint project on secret key propagation in a wireless network. My former Ph.D. student Nitin Sirinawarat and Professor A. Barg (ECE/ISR), and Drs. Alex Reznik and Chunxuan Y e (both of InterDigital) collaborated with me on this project from 2007-2009. Our ongoing work on secure function computation over a network was initiated jointly with Dr. Piyush Gupta of Bell Labs Alcatel-Lucent. My former Ph.D. student, Himanshu T yagi conducted an internship at Bell Labs with Dr. Gupta in 2010, and our collaboration continued for two years thereafter. Collaboration with Dr. Piyush Gupta of Bell Labs-Lucent on the problem of network function computation. This led to the publication: H. T yagi, P . Narayan, P .

This project was a Phase I SBIR with MDA that was awarded Phase II. Unfortunately, Primordial was purchased by a larger com - pany (Polaris) and is no longer eligible for the small business award. I have a long standing relationship with Bluefin Robotics, for whom I worked 2000- 2002 as a software engineer. Bluefin manufacturers autonomous underwater vehicles for commercial and defense applications. A Bluefin program manager visited UMD in Fall 2014 to describe Bluefin's involvment in the search for the missing airliner MH370. Gang Qu I developed a six-week MOOC on hardware security through a university partnership with Coursera. The first offering attracted more than 35,000 students, out of which more than 1,400 completed all the quizzes and final exam. In Spring 2014, I co-developed and co-taught ENSE 698C, Cybersecurity for Smart Grid, with four colleagues from outside of the university. One from NSA/NCCoE, two from NIST, and one from a local company. In Summer 2015, I participated in a panel discussion in the INCOSE 25th Anniversary International Symposium. The panel is entitled \"Have We Systems Engineered Our Infrastructure Well Enough to Withstand a Cyberterrorism Attack? A Debate on the Issues.\" I am the only panelist from academia, the other five are all from industry. I have continued to push for research collaboration with industry in these ways: I have 3 SBIR/STTR with industry: one (with John Baras) from DARPA with ACS, one from AFOSR with MiMoCloud, and one (awarded) from NRL with Mi - MoCloud. I have worked with Cisco, which has agreed on a con - tract of $180K ($60 for the initial one and $120 for the second phase). However, due to the lengthy contract ne - gotiation between the University and Cisco, the funding period expired. I have worked with several researchers in NIST on cy - bersecurity related topics. Currently we are preparing to submit a collaboration proposal. Ankur Srivastava Collaboration with CoolCAD LLC on their design tool flow. Graduation of students who have found employment in various companies. Subramanian Raghavan I have developed a technique to rapidly find so-called Bidder-Pareto-Optimal Core Solutions in Combinatorial Auctions. This work loosely speaking has generalized and developed a type of second price auction in the package/ combinatorial auction setting. It has spurred a significant interest in the economics literature (Professor Paul Milgrom from Stanford has coined the term \"Core-Selecting Auc - tions\" to describe the type of auction I proposed). Further, several governments across the world are using our specific algorithm and pricing method in their auctions, Specifically, the Office of Communications in the UK, the Austrian, Australian, Canadian, Dutch, Danish, Irish and Swiss gov - ernments have used this technique in their spectrum auc - tions. This work was awarded the INFORMS Computing Society Prize and was a finalist for the European Excellence in Practice Award. I have worked on problems of interest to the satellite indus - try. In particular, I worked on a multiperiod traffic routing problem in a satellite network. It is my understanding that the algorithms developed were used as part of an annual business plan exercise at the satellite company (INTEL - SAT) we collaborated with, to help plan for future capacity expansion needs. This work was awarded the 2010 Manage - ment Science Strategic Innovation Prize by the European Operational Research Society. Gary Rubloff Collaboration with Northrop Grumman (and Ray Ado - maitis) on in-situ sensing/metrology/control of MOCVD processes for fabrication of GaN-based HEMT devices. This lasted three to four years with significant funding, involved biweekly meetings at NG and my student there full time. We achieved real-time in-situ chemical sensing of reaction byproducts and exploited these signals to control ISR Review Report March 4, 201659a thin AlGaN layer thickness to something like 0.1nm (can check the number if it matters). Ray did excellent process and equipment modeling which allowed design of opti - mized precursor delivery spatial distributions. T ogether I believe we/ISR helped NG move from the starting lines (new hires/new program) to competitive with best of breed. The experimental part of this in my group was developed by other industry collaborations on real-time in-situ mass spectrometric sensing, done first with Inficon and later with MKS Instruments. Collaboration with T oshiba visitor T omimo Ino on ad - vanced process control (APC). While this was just a year and small ($36K), it had significant impact. I had been a protagonist for APC adoption in industry/Sematech circles, particularly as part of the International T echnology Roadmap for Semiconductors activity. Mr. Ino learned the strategic picture of APC while working with me, building the view in part from our equipment/process level simula - tions, in part from equipment and factory logistics/through - put considerations that flowed out of our IPDPM project (NSF-SRC, involving Marcus, Fu, Herrmann, Rubloff). Ino was successful in developing an APC \"pitch\" and strategy to start implementation of APC in T oshiba manufacturing. My understanding is that he has since been successful in leading this in T oshiba. Jonathan Simon My most important contribution to industry is as co author of the biological signal denoising technique TS PCA (de Cheveign\u00e9, A., and J. Z. Simon (2007) Denoising Based on Time Shift PCA, J Neurosci Methods 165(2), 297 305. ), which has been incorporated into the magnetoencephalog - raphy software product \"MEG Laboratory.\" This software is produced jointly by Y okogawa Electric Corp., Eagle T ech - nology Corp., and Kanazawa Institute of T echnology. Andre Tits Collaboration with Sikorsky Aircraft Corp. from 2008 to 2011 on controller design for a rotorcraft. (Featured an algorithm and software for convex quadratic optimization, produced by my group in earlier research.) This included over $100k of financial support. It produced one conference paper (American Control Conference). For more than two decades, collaboration with AEM De - sign, a startup that handled distribution of FSQP , optimiza - tion software produced by my group (based on algorithms developed by my group). FSQP has been extensively used (thousands of users) both in academia and in industry. Sennur Ulukus RADIUS: Reliable and Adaptive Decision makIng under Uncertainty for Spectrum access This was a phase I Air Force STTR project. RADAR: A Comprehensive and Dynamic Framework toward Realtime Network Traffic Resiliency This is a phase II DoD SBIR project.The Institute for Systems Research60Appendix 14: Research Grants to ISR Joint Appointment Faculty with a Faculty Member from a Different Department, 2009-2015 2015 AFOSR: Air Force Center of Excellence on Na - ture-Inspired Flight Technologies and Ideas (NIFTI) Faculty: Pamela Funding Agency: Air Force Office of Scientific Research The Air Force Center of Excellence on Nature-Inspired Flight T echnologies and Ideas (NIFTI) will conduct research into how animals move, navigate and use their senses, and create solutions for challenging engineering and technolog - ical problems related to building small, remotely operated aircraft. It is housed at the University of Washington, and in addition to Maryland researchers, includes faculty from Case Western Reserve University and international partners like Imperial College, University of Bristol, University of Sussex and Oxford University in the U.K. and Lund University in Sweden. The NIFTI center, one of six AFOSR COEs nationwide, is funded by the U.S. Air Force for up to $9 million over six years. It will focus on three main research areas: Locating objects. Researchers will look at how animals are able to find prey, a mate or food sources by encoding and processing information through their senses. Navigating in complex environments. Insects and bats often fly in windy and crowded spaces, skillfully avoiding collisions. Scientists will study how their neurological and physiological systems function to allow them to move in these ways. Navigating in sensory-deprived environments. Animals of - ten fly in low light or nearly complete darkness, and in plac - es where their ability to smell and hear might be compro - mised. Researchers will look more broadly at how animals use sensory information and how they make decisions about flight under different contexts. Learning from the behavior of insects and animals could inspire more advanced micro-air vehicles, or small, flying robots. These could be used in difficult search-and-rescue missions, to help detect explosives or mines when it would be too dangerous for humans to go on foot or in vehicles, and for environmental monitoring. AFOSR: Simulation-Based and Risk-Sensitive Meth - odologies for Stochastic Faculty: Steve Marcus (ECE/ISR), Michael Fu (BMGT/ISR) Funding Agency: Air Force Office of Scientific Research This research will study basic questions aimed at challeng -es in information superiority, logistics, and planning. The researchers will develop and analyze new algorithms for the simulation optimization approach of sequential response surface methodology by incorporating direct gradient estimates; develop and analyze new global stochastic kriging simulation metamodels using an extrapolation method en - abled by direct gradient estimates; utilize risk-sensitive cost functions to achieve express risk preferences and robustness in control problems; study how incorporation of risk-sensi - tivity affects the behavior of decision makers and controllers; develop and study efficient sampling and simulation-based methods for risk-sensitive control problems; study popula - tion-based methods for finding and improving on a good set of policies in risk-sensitive problems; and apply these optimization methodologies to practical problems, such as preventive maintenance, path planning for unmanned aerial vehicles, data mining, supply chain management, and finan - cial engineering. This is a three-year, $554K grant. 2014 UMD Research and Innovation Seed Grant: Tem - poral Auditory Coding in Schizophrenia and Treat - ment-Resistant Auditory Hallucination Faculty: Jonathan Simon (ECE/BIOLOGY/ISR), L. Elliot Hong (Psychiatry, UM School of Medicine) Funding Agency: UMD Division of Research, Research and Inno - vation Seed Grant Simon and Hong will investigate the neural processing of rhythmic sounds (whether speech or simpler sound rhythms) in schizophrenia patients with treatment-resistant auditory hallucinations, compared to neural processing in patients whose auditory hallucinations are treatable, and with healthy listeners. The neural mechanisms underlying these diverse abnormalities, which are measured by electro - encephalography and magnetoencephalography techniques, are not known. This research will advance the state of research in schizophrenia. Hong is Chief of the Neuroimaging Research Program in the Department of Psychiatry and the director of the UM Center for Brain Imaging Research. NIH NIDCR: Magnetic Delivery of Therapeutic Nanoparticles to the Dental Pulp Faculty: Didier Depireux (ISR); Radi Masri (UM School of Dentistry) Funding Agency: NIH National Institute of Dental and Cranio - facial Research Pulpitis, is an inflammation of the dental pulp deep within the tooth, most often experienced as a sharp pain when eating ice cream or having a cold drink. Usually treatment involves the dreaded root canal procedure to remove the ISR Review Report March 4, 201661damaged pulp. Depireux and Masri's (UM Dental School) research could give dental practitioners a much less invasive treatment option. The pair are developing a new, pat - ent-pending technique to deliver medication directly into the center of a tooth. The research uses strong magnetic fields to move medi - cation-coated, magnetic nanoparticles through the tooth's dentin and into the pulp. Dentin, a solid substance that encases the pulp, is surrounded by a harder-than-bone layer of enamel. \"When you have a cavity, usually the enamel has been damaged and the dentin is exposed, so when you eat or drink, it will stimulate the fluid within the dentinal tubules and cause pain,\" Masri explained. The researchers are using tubules, the microscopic channels that travel through the dentin into the tooth pulp, as the vehicles to deliver the inflammation-reducing or antibiotic medication. They have designed a system of magnetic arrays effective for upper or lower teeth. By manipulating a series of cube-shaped magnets, they can control the magnetic field so the nanoparticles are pulled through the tubules into the tooth pulp. This is a two-year, $450,000 grant. NSF CPS Collaborative Research: Designing semi-autonomous networks of miniature robots for inspection of bridges and other large infrastructures Faculty: Nuno Martins Funding Agency: National Science Foundation This new research will create a self-organizing network of small robots that could aid in visually inspecting bridges and other large civilian infrastructure. As they create the net - work, the researchers will establish new design and perfor - mance analysis principles and technologies. The networked robots could remotely and routinely in - spect complicated structures, like the assemblage of girders supporting a suspension bridge. The robots will use wireless information exchange to autonomously coordinate and co - operate in the inspection, and whenever possible, they will report back images and key measurements to experts for evaluation. The tiny networked robots will be able to access tight spaces, operate under various weather conditions, and autonomously execute tasks for long periods of time. The researchers are collaborating with Resensys a company that specializes in remote bridge monitoring. Resensys is a portfolio company of the Maryland T echnology Enter - prise Institute's (Mtech) T echnology Advancement Pro - gram an Mtech VentureAccelerator graduate and a former UMD $75K Business Plan Competition winner. Resensys' President and CTO Mehdi Kalantari (EE Ph.D. 2005) is an assistant research scientist in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. \"Designing semi-autonomous networks of miniature robots for inspection of bridges and other large infrastructures\" is a three-year, $850K grant, part of NSF's National Robotics Initiative. Steve Marcus (ECE/ISR) Funding Agency: National Science Foundation Compositional Modeling of Cyber-Physical Systems is a three-year, $500K grant to develop new mathematical mod - eling techniques for cyber-physical systems. Cleaveland and Marcus will devise novel conceptual methods for assembling systems from subsystems, and for reasoning about the be - havior of systems in terms of the behavior of their com - putational or physical subsystems. The research will enable scientists and engineers to develop more realistic models of the systems they are designing, and to obtain greater insights into the eventual behavior of these systems without having to build costly prototypes. Specifically, the researchers will develop the novel modeling paradigm Generalized Synchronization Trees (GSTs) into a rich framework for both describing cyber-physical systems (CPSs) and studying their behavior under interconnection. GSTs are inspired by Milner's use of Synchronization Trees (STs) to model interconnected computing processes, but GSTs generalize the mathematical structure of their fore - bears in such a way as to encompass systems with discrete (\"Cyber\") as well as continuous (\"Physical\") dynamics. NSF BRAIN EAGER: Wireless Measurement of Neu (ECE/ IREAP) Funding Agency: National Science Foundation The brain is a complex network of interconnected circuits that exchange signals in the form of \"action potentials.\" These are key to understanding cognition and complex thought. Currently available non-invasive methods for probing neuronal activity are limited; they cannot achieve sufficient spatial or temporal resolution to observe individu - al action potentials from single neurons or small clusters. Waks (ECE, IREAP) and Shapiro will develop a novel approach for non-invasive measurements that can read out individual action potentials across the entire brain. Their project will take advantage of recent advances in spintronic devices to create injectable nano-reporters. These nano-re - porters will detect weak electrical signals in the brain and convert them to microwave signals that can be detected wirelessly outside the body using a spin-torque nano-os - cillator (STNO). This approach could ultimately lead to the first non-invasive technology capable of measuring activations of individual neurons and small-scale neuronal networks in primates and humans, and could have a major impact on the understanding of the inner workings of the brain and cognition. The approach also could have import - ant clinical applications, particularly in neurological disor - ders and brain machine interfaces. This two-year, $300K award is made jointly by two NSF programs: the Instrument Development for Biological Re - search program (IDBR) and Emerging Frontiers (EF) in the Directorate of Biological Sciences (BIO). The Institute for Systems Research62NSF: A New Approach to Nonconvex Risk-Sensitive Stochastic Optimization Faculty: Steve Marcus (ECE/ISR), Michael Fu (BMGT/ISR) Funding Agency: National Science Foundation A New Approach to Nonconvex Risk-Sensitive Stochastic Optimization is a three-year, $340K grant that will fund development of a new framework for incorporating risk into sequential decision making under uncertainty. The two pillars of the approach are cumulative prospect theory and dynamic risk measures. The framework builds on both of these research streams to formulate a single theory that integrates subjective preferences in human behavior with normative decision-making objectives. Existing utility-based dynamic models cannot handle the nonconvexity implied by the behavioral models of prospect theory, whereas the framework allows the probability weighting found in cumu - lative prospect theory to be combined with the usual out - come weighting of traditional expected utility formulations in a sequential decision-making model that incorporates both types of risk sensitivity. The framework will be used to develop efficient dynamic programming sampling and sim - ulation-based methods for risk-sensitive optimization and control problems, and to investigate how the new modeling of risk-sensitivity affects the behavior of decision makers. The research will provide an alternative framework for decision making under risk to currently existing approach - es. The framework unifies the predominantly descriptive research stream of prospect theory coming primarily from psychology and behavioral economics with the normative approaches generally associated with the microeconomics and operations research communities. From this new ap - proach arise a host of challenges, both theoretical and com - putational. Algorithms will be developed that can be used to address practical operational and tactical decision-making problems arising in a wide variety of application areas, from manufacturing and supply chain management to service systems, including health care, transportation, and financial engineering. DOE: NEES EFRC renewed for four years Faculty: Gary Gary Sang Bok Lee (Chem/ Biochem) Funding Agency: Department of Energy The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Basic Energy Sciences has renewed its support for the University of Maryland's (UMD) Nanostructures for Electrical Energy Storage Energy Frontier Research Center (NEES EFRC) for another four years. The renewal is based both on the NEES EFRC's achievements to date and the quality of its proposals for future research. Professor Gary Rubloff (MSE/ISR) is the director of NEES, and Professor Sang Bok Lee (Chem&Biochem) is its deputy director. 2013 ARO MURI: Information Engines: Nanoscale Control, Computing and Communication out of Faculty: . S. Krishnaprasad (ECE/ISR); Christopher Jarzynski (Chem-Biochem/IPST) Office . S. Krishnaprasad (ECE/ISR) and Professor Christopher Jarzynski (Chem-Biochem/IPST) are part of a new Army Research Office Multi-University Research Initiative (MURI) grant, \"Information Engines: Nanoscale Control, Computing and Communication out of Equilib - rium.\" The five-year award was recently announced by the Department of Defense. Drawing on four distinct perspectives--computational mechanics, nonequilibrium thermodynamics, control theory, and nanoscale experiments--this project will investigate fundamental principles and algorithms for the creation of synthetic nanosystems that are able to gather, store, and manipulate information while immersed in a thermally noisy environment. Such capabilities appear to be a basis for achieving directed nanoscale flows of matter and energy. The team's research is also expected to yield insights into bio-molecular complexes with similar functionality. Advanced Silicon Carbide based Novel Hybrid Ener - gy Storage System Science Foundation The three-year, $438K National Science Foundation GOALI (Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaisons with Industry) award will provide funding to develop a novel hybrid energy storage system for electric vehicles. The new system will be composed of a high energy-density battery pack, an ultracapacitor pack and a DC/DC converter. This new lightweight system will weigh less than a conventional high power-density battery pack alone. At the same time it will offer an increased battery lifetime. The new system will be developed, implemented and validated on the powertrain of a new electric car. 2012 NSF Collaborative Research: Computational Foun - dations for Learning, Verifying, and Applying Model Simplification Rules Faculty: S. K. Gupta (ME/ISR); Dana Nau (CS/ISR) Funding Agency: National Science Foundation The researchers will develop feature-based simplification of computer-aided-design models, specifically to accelerate and automate downstream finite-element-analysis. In particular, the research will create algorithmic foundations for learning conservative feature suppression rules from demonstrations performed by human experts. The effect of simplification on simulation accuracy will be formally characterized and this understanding will be used to create robust algorithms ISR Review Report March 4, 201663for feature suppression within computer-aided design mod - els. Research findings will be integrated into graduate and undergraduate curriculum. The research will ultimately lead to a framework to automatically learn, validate, and apply context dependent model simplification rules that can be audited by human experts, and deployed to automate the model simplification task. The research will significantly speed up model simplifica - tion, and enhance the automated use of engineering analysis tools in the design process. Potential applications include design of heat exchangers, aircraft structures, and semi-con - ductor equipment. Computational Foundations for Learn - ing, Verifying, and Applying Model Simplification Rules is a three-year, $265K award.

The new seven-year contract with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will extend and expand the work of the original National Center of Excellence for Aviation Operations Research (NEXTOR). Research expenditures could total as much as $60M over the length of the contract. ISR professors Michael Ball (ISR/Robert H. Smith School of Business) and David Lovell (ISR/CEE) lead the Mary - land NEXTOR II team. (CEE/ISR) Funding Agency: Institute of Standards and Technology Professor John Baras (ECE/ISR) is the principal investigator for a $1 million cooperative agreement with the National Institute of Standards and T echnology. Associate Professor Mark Austin (CEE/ISR) and ISR postdoctoral research - er Shah-An Yang are co-principal investigators on the agreement. The research team will help NIST develop and deploy standards, test methods, and measurement tools to support consistently reliable performance of new smart sys - tems. These cyber-physical systems (CPS) knit information and physical technologies into interactive, self-optimizing products and infrastructures ranging from smart cars, aircraft and buildings to an intelligent electric power grid. By developing standards, test methods, and measurement tools, the UMD/NIST effort can help U.S. industry accelerate de - velopment of innovative cyber-physical system products that create jobs, while also protecting these new types of CPS infrastructure from cyber threats. 2010 DOD: Cooperative Research and Development Agreement: RDECOM Faculty: John Baras (ECE/ISR) and other UMD researchers Agency: U.S. Army Research, Development and Engi - neering Command The University of Maryland and the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) officially joined forces to expand research, development and engineering efforts by signing a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) in September. The CRADA builds upon already existing working relationships with the university while increasing the understanding The Institute for Systems Research64of the transforming missions and functions of Aberdeen Proving Ground, where RDECOM is headquartered. The ceremony took place in the rotunda of the Jeong H. Kim Engineering Building. NSF: Adaptive perceptual-motor feedback for the analysis of complex scenes Faculty: Cynthia Moss (JHU), Timothy Horiuchi (ECE/ISR) in Neuroscience Professor Cynthia Moss (Psych/ISR) is the principal inves - tigator and Associate Professor Timothy Horiuchi (ECE/ ISR) is the co-PI for a new National Foundation Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience grant, \"Adaptive perceptual-motor feedback of complex scenes.\" The five-year, $1.5 million grant will fund research to understand the processes that support perception and action in complex settings. The research will focus on spatial perception and navigation in the echolocat - ing bat, an auditory specialist that produces high frequency sonar calls and listens to echo returns to determine the location of objects in its environment. The echolocating bat modifies its sonar calls in response to echo information from targets (insect prey) and obstacles. Quantitative analyses of this animal's adaptive vocal behavior will be used to infer its perception of a changing environment. 2009 NSF CPS: Ant-Like Microrobots\u2014Fast, Funding Agency: National Science Foundation A team of Clark School faculty from the Institute for Sys - tems Research, the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and the Mechanical Engineering Department has won a three-year, $1.5 million National Science Foun - dation grant for Ant-Like Microrobots\u2014Fast, Small, and Under Control. Assistant Professor Nuno Martins (ECE/ ISR) is the principal investigator. Co-PIs are Pro - fessor Pamela Abshire (ECE/ISR), Associate Professor Elis - abeth Smela (ME), and Assistant Professor Sarah Bergbreiter (ME/ISR). No robots at the sub-cm3 scale exist because their development faces a number of open challenges. This research will identify and determine means for solving these challenges. In addition, it will provide new solutions to out - standing questions about resource-constrained algorithms, architectures, and actuators that can be widely leveraged in other applications. The team will discover new fundamental principles, design methods, and technologies for realizing distributed networks of sub-cm3, ant-sized mobile microro - bots that self-organize into cooperative configurations. DOE: Interior-Point Algorithms for Optimization Problems Many Constraints Faculty: Tits (ECE/ISR) Dianne O'Leary (CS/UMI Professor Andr\u00e9Tits (ECE/ISR) is the co-principal investi - gator for a new Department of Energy (DoE) grant, \"Interi - or-Point Algorithms for Optimization Problems with Many Constraints.\" The Principal Investigator for this grant is Professor Dianne O'Leary (CS/UMIACS). The three-year, $303,701 grant continues the research of an earlier grant in the same area. The researchers will develop, analyze, and test algorithms for the solution of optimization problems with a very large number of inequality constraints, specifically, many more inequality constraints than variables. NSF: Image Guided Autonomous Optical Manipula - tion of Cell Groups Faculty: S. K. Gupta (ME/ISR) Wolfgang Losert (Physics/ IPST/IREAP) Funding Agency: National Science Foundation Professor S.K. Gupta (ME/ISR) is the principal investigator for a three-year, $550K National Science Foundation grant, \"Image Guided Autonomous Optical Manipulation of Cell Groups.\" Associate Professor Wolfgang Losert (Physics) is the co-PI. The research team will create a computational foun - dation, methods, and tools for efficient and autonomous optical micromanipulation using microsphere ensembles as grippers. This system will make use of a holographic optical tweezer, which uses multiple focused optical traps to posi - tion microspheres in three-dimensional space. NSF: Next-Generation Model Checking and Abstract Interpretation with a Focus on Embedded Control and Systems Biology Faculty: Rance Cleaveland (CS/ISR); Steve Marcus Research Professor Rance Cleaveland (CS/ISR) is the principal in - vestigator and Professor Steve Marcus (ECE/ISR) is a co-PI for the University of Maryland's portion of a major new National Science Foundation collaborative research grant, \"Next-Generation Model Checking and Abstract Inter - pretation with a Focus on Embedded Control and Systems Biology.\" The five-year, $10 million project is part of NSF's \"Expeditions in Computing\" initiative. Maryland's part of the project is worth $1.8 million. Along with Marcus, T ong - tong Wu of the University of Maryland's School of Public Health is also a co-PI. The consortium will develop new computational tools to help scientists and engineers analyze and understand the behavior of the complex models they develop for application domains ranging from systems biol - ogy to embedded control. Building on the success of model checking and abstract interpretation (MCAI), two well-es - tablished methods for automatically verifying properties of digital circuit designs and embedded software, this research project will extend the MCAI paradigm to systems with complex continuous dynamics and probabilistic behaviors. The research will include: understanding the precursors and ISR Review Report March 4, 201665course of pancreatic cancer; predicting the onset of atrial fibrillation; and obtaining deep design-time insights into the behavior of automotive and aerospace control systems. Ulti - mately, the project is expected to provide vital tools that will enable health care researchers to discover better treatments for disease and will allow engineers to build safer aircraft and other complex systems. DARPA: Adaptive Environment for Agency (DARPA) Associate Professor Rajeev Barua (ECE/ISR) is the PI and Professor Rance Cleaveland (CS/ISR) is a co-PI for a DARPA research grant, Adaptive Environment for Su - percompiling with Optimized Parallelism (AESOP). The University of Maryland will collaborate with BAE Systems Inc and Princeton University on this four-year, $11.5 mil - lion program; Maryland's share is $2.53 million. Reflecting the belief that serial programs will continue to represent the vast majority of programs in the world, AESOP will develop a state-of-the-art compiler that can automatically compile serial programs into parallel programs to a wide variety of platforms. Unlike existing efforts which have focused on regular, scientific programs alone, the AESOP project will use an aggressive suite of existing methods and new techniques that the researchers have developed to extract large-amounts of scalable parallelism even from seemingly serial irregular programs. This will enable software to exploit the full potential of the hardware in the modern multi-core era. Further, the compiler will accurately characterize and compile to a wide variety of computer systems without any manual effort. NSF: Nanofabrication using Viral Biotemplates for MEMS Applications Sci - ence/Landscape Funding Agency: National Science Foundation Professor Reza Ghodssi (ECE/ISR) is the PI for a three- year, $401,712 NSF grant, \"Nanofabrication Using Viral Biotemplates for MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) Applications.\" The research will make use of the self-assem - bly and metal-binding properties of a biological nanostruc - ture, the T obacco Mosaic Virus (TMV), in the development of novel functional materials and fabrication processes for energy microsystems applications. The TMV is a high aspect ratio cylindrical plant virus that can be genetically engi - neered to include amino acids with enhanced metal-binding properties. These genetic modifications facilitate electroless plating of the molecules as well as self-assembly onto vari - ous substrates. The developed processes will be incorporated in the fabrication of new, nanostructured small-scale energy storage devices. NSF: Particle Filtering for Stochastic Control and Global Optimization Faculty: Michael Fu (BMGT/ISR); Steve Marcus (ECE/ISR) Funding Agency: National Science Foundation Professor Steve Marcus (ECE/ISR) and Professor Michael Fu (BMGT/ISR) are co-PIs for a three-year, $390K NSF grant, Particle Filtering for Stochastic Control and Global Optimization. The objective of this program is to provide new breakthroughs in the areas of stochastic control and global optimization through insights gained from particle filtering and from additional recent results in nonlinear filtering. Stochastic control and optimization can be applied to many problems of critical concern in US industry, so the resulting algorithms will have broad and transformative applicability. In the project, they will be tested on problems in industries from telecommunications to manufacturing to finance. ARO IARPA: Quantum Computing: Improving Josephson Junction Qubits Faculty: Gary (Joint Institute, Physics NIST , LPS) Funding Agency: Army Research Office: Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) Professor Gary Rubloff (MSE/ISR) is the co-PI on an interdisciplinary research collaboration with the Joint Quantum Institute (JQI) that has been awarded a five-year, $2.8 million grant from the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) through the Army Research Office (ARO) to devise, fabricate, study and test a new kind of key component for quantum computing. The team will work on novel methods of constructing the crucial, ultra-thin insulating barrier that lies between two supercon - ductors to form a \"Josephson junction.\" NSF: Combining Gradient and Adaptive Search in Simulation Optimization Faculty: Michael Fu (BMGT/ISR); Steve Marcus (ECE/ISR) Funding Agency: National Science Foundation: Collaborative Research Professor Michael Fu (BMGT/ISR/ECE) is the principal investigator and Professor Steve Marcus (ECE/ISR) is the co-PI for a three-year, $350K NSF collaborative research grant, Combining Gradient and Adaptive Search in Simula - tion Optimization. The researchers will develop new simu - lation optimization algorithms based on different sequences of the so-called \"reference distributions\" in a recently developed approach called model reference adaptive search, and new hybrid global-local search algorithms integrating local gradient search and problem structure. They also will conduct rigorous theoretical analysis of the resulting algo - rithms, both finite-time behavior using an adaptive search framework and asymptotic behavior using a novel connec - tion to stochastic approximation methods. A wide variety of applications from supply chain management to financial engineering will be tested to investigate specific gradient search algorithms and problem structure, and evaluating the effectiveness in terms of empirical behavior. This line of research fills an important part of the \"analytics\" computa -The Institute for Systems Research66tional tool kit that has led to increased competitiveness for US businesses from manufacturers and retailers with global supply chains to financial services managing complex risk factors. Maryland: A Micro-Direct Methanol Fuel Cell with Nanostructured Platinum Catalysts Using the Tobac - co Mosaic Virus Faculty: Reza Ghodssi (ECE/ISR); James (Plant Sci (ChBE/ MSE) Gary Rubloff (MSE/ISR) Funding Agency: Research and Industry Competition Grant Professor Reza Ghodssi (ECE/ISR) is the principal inves $250,000 FY2009 Maryland Nanobiotech - nology Research and Industry Competition Grant for \"A Micro-Direct Methanol Fuel Cell with Nanostructured Platinum Catalysts Using the T obacco Mosaic Virus.\" The research will develop fuel cells with surface area nano-struc - tured electrodes using the T obacco mosaic virus. The TMV is a high aspect ratio plant nanostructure which can be genetically modified to include functional groups that facilitate electroless metal deposition and self-assembly onto gold surfaces. This biotemplating process has been integrat - ed with standard micro-machining for the development of micro-fabricated batteries.

Y ou must fulfill all requirements within five years. The thesis option requires a total of 30 credit hours: 24 hours of coursework and six hours for the thesis project. The coursework includes 18 credits for the six core courses (four courses from the systems engineering core and two courses from the management core) and two elective cours - es. The elective courses must be taken from one special - ization area. The thesis project demonstrates the practical implications of systems engineering principles. Y ou may re - late the project to a practical industrial system or to an ISR research activity, with supervision by your academic advisor or another ISR faculty member. Because of its research component, we recommend this option for those who want to pursue a Ph.D. The non-thesis option requires each student to obtain a total of 30 credit hours of coursework to complete the pro - gram (four courses from the systems engineering core, two courses from the management core, and four elective cours - es). The elective courses must be taken from not more than two specialization areas. In addition, students must complete a scholarly paper. Expectations of the scholarly paper: While less detailed and complex than the thesis, the scholarly paper also contributes to systems engineering research. For exam - ple, a student might chose to write a literature review, iden - tify and propose a solution to a systems problem encoun - tered on the job, or prepare a systems case study. Y ou prepare the scholarly paper under the supervision of your academic advisor, have it read by at least one additional ISR faculty member, and approved by the MSSE graduate director.
