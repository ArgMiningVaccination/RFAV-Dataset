This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT Comirnaty 30 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside modified) 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION This is a multidose vial with a purple cap and must be diluted before use. One vial (0.45 mL) contains 6 doses of 0.3 mL after dilution, see sections 4.2 and 6.6. One dose (0.3 mL) contains 30 micrograms of tozinameran, a COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine (embedded in lipid nanoparticles). Tozinameran is a single -stranded, 5'- capped messenger RNA (mRNA) produced using a cell- free in vitro transcription from the corresponding DNA templates, encoding the viral spike (S) prot ein of SARS -CoV -2. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Concentrate for dispersion for injection (sterile concentrate). The vaccine is a white to off-white frozen dispersion (pH: 6.9 - 7.9). 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Comirnaty 30 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS -CoV -2, in individuals 12 years of age and older. The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology Individuals 12 years of age and older Comirnaty is admin istered intramuscularly after dilution as a single dose of 0.3 mL for individuals 12 years of age and older regardless of prior COVID -19 vaccination status (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID- 19 vaccine, C omirnaty should be administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a COVID -19 vaccine. 3 Severely immunocompromised aged 12 years and older Additional doses may be administered to individuals who are severely immunocompromi sed in accordance with national recommendations (see section 4.4). Paediatric population There are paediatric formulation s available for infants aged 6 months and above and children below 12 years of age. For details, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for other formulations . The safety and efficacy of the vaccine in infants aged less than 6 months have not yet been established. Elderly population No dose adjustment is required in elderly individuals 65 years of age. Method of administration Comirnaty 30 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection should be administered intramuscularly after dilution (see section 6.6). After dilution, via ls of Comirnaty contain 6 doses of 0.3 mL of vaccine. In order to extract 6 doses from a single vial, low dead -volume syringes and/or needles should be used. The low dead- volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of no more than 35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle: Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine. If the amount of vaccine remaini ng in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 mL, discard the vial and any excess volume. Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. The preferred site is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally. The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4. For instructions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 4 General recommendations Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine. Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recom mended following vaccination. No further dose of the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of Comirnaty. Myocarditis and pericarditis There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males (see section 4.8) . Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been observed. Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinees (including pare nts or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. Healthcar e professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this condition. Anxiety -related reactions Anxiety- related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stressrelated reactions (e.g. dizziness, p alpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. Stress -related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. Concurrent illness Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low -grade fever should not delay vaccination. Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders As with other intramuscular injections , the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals. Immunocompromise d individuals The efficacy and safety of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty may be lower in immunocompromised individuals. 5 Duration of protect ion The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials. Limitations of vaccine effectiveness As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty may not protect all vaccine recipie nts. In dividuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination . Excipients This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'potassium -free'. This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium -free'. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed. Concomitant administration of Comirnaty with other vaccines has not been studied. 4.6 Fertility, p regnancy and lactation Pregnancy A large amount of observational data from pregnant women vaccinated with Comirnaty during the second and third trimester have not shown an increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes. While data on pregnancy outcomes following vaccination during the first trimester are presently limited, no increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal develo pment, parturition or post -natal development (see section 5.3). Comirnaty can be used during pregnancy. Breast -feeding No effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of breast -feeding woman to Comirnaty is negligible. Observational data from women who were breast -feeding after vaccination have not shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty can be used during breast -feeding. Fertility Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Comirnaty has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. 6 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of safety profile Participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses In Study 2, a total of 22 026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty and a total of 22 021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 20 519 parti cipants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty. At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut -off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo- controlled blinded follow -up period up to the participants' unblinding dates, a total of 25 651 (58.2%) participants (13 031 Comirnaty and 12 620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15 111 (7 704 Comirnaty and 7 407 placebo) participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10 540 (5 327 Comirnaty and 5 213 placebo) participants 56 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), m yalgia (> 40%), chills (> 30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (> 10%) and were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age. The safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receiving Comirnaty, that were seropositive for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population. Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses In an analysis of long -term safety follow -up in Study 2, 2 260 adolescents (1 131 Comirnaty and 1 129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1 559 adolescents ( 786 Comirnaty and 773 placebo) have been followed for 4 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. The safety evaluation in Study 2 is ongoing. The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection s ite pain ( > 90%), fatigue and headache (> 70%), 40%), arthralgia and pyrexia ( > 20%). Participants 12 years of age and older - after booster dose The safety of a booster dose of Comirnaty in participants 12 years of age and older is inferred from safety data from studies of a booster dose of Comirnaty in participants 16 years of age and older. A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the original Comirnaty 2 -dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 6 months (range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow -up time of 8.3 months (range 1.1 to 8.5 months) and 301 participants had been followed for 6 months after the booster dose to the cut -off date (22 November 2021). The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia (> 30%), chills and arthralgia (> 20%). In Study 4, a placebo- controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5 081 participants), or placebo (5 044 participants) at least 6 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, 7 had a median follow -up time of 2. 8 months (range 0.3 to 7.5 months) after the booster d ose in the blinded placebo- controlled follow -up period to the cut -off date ( 8 February 2022 ). Of these, 1 281 participants (895 Comirnaty and 386 placebo) have been followed for 4 months after the booster dose of Comirnaty. No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. Participants 12 years of age and older - after subsequent booster doses The saf ety of a booster dose of Comirnaty in participants 12 years of age and older is inferred from safety data from studies of a booster dose of Comirnaty in participants 18 years of age and older. A subset of 325 adults 18 to 55 years of age who had complet ed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 90 to 180 days after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty had a median follow -up time of 1.4 months up to a data cut -off date of 11 March 2022. The most frequent adverse reactions in these participants were injection site pain (> 70%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia and chills (> 20%), and arthralgia (> 10%). In a subset from Study 4 (Phase 3), 305 adults > 55 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 5 to 12 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty had a median follow -up time of at least 1.7 months up to a data cut -off dat e of 16 May 2022. The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty booster (fourth dose) was similar to that seen after the Comirnaty booster (third dose). The most frequent adverse reactions in participants > 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 60%), fatigue (> 40%), headache (> 20%), myalgia and chills (> 10%). Booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID -19 vaccine In 5 independent studies on the use of a Comirnaty booster dose in individuals who had completed primary vaccination with another authori sed COVID- 19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose), no new safety issues were identified (see section 5.1). Tabulated list of adverse reactions from clinical studies and post -authorisation experience in individuals 12 years of age and older Adverse reactions observed during clinical studies are listed below according to the following frequency categories: Very common ( 1/10), Common ( 1/100 1/100), Rare ( 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000), Very rare (< 1/10 000), Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). 8 Table 1 . Adverse reactions from Comirnaty clinical trials and post -authorisation experience in individuals 12 years of age and older System Organ Class Very common ( 1/10) Common ( 1/100 to < 1/100) Rare ( 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000) Very rare (< 1/10 000) Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) Blood and lymphatic system disorders Lymphadenopathya Immune system disorders Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. rash, pruritus, urticariab, angioedemab) Anaphylaxis Metabolism and nutrition disorders Decreased appetite Psychiatric disorders Insomnia Nervous system disorders Headache Dizzinessd; Lethargy Acute peripheral facial paralysisc Myalgia Pain in extremitye Reproductive system and breast disorders Heavy menstrual bleedingh General disorders and administration site conditions Injection site pain; Fatigue; Chills; Pyrexiaf; Injection site swelling Injection site redness Asthenia; Malaise; Injection site pruritus Extensive swelling of vaccinated limbd; Facial swellingg a. In participants 5 years of age and older, a higher frequency of lymphadenopathy was reported after a booster ( 2.8%) dose than after primary ( 0.9%) doses of the vaccine. b. The frequency category for urticaria and angioedema was rare. c. Through the cli nical trial safety follow -up period to 14 November 2020, acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) was reported by four participants in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group. Onset was Day 37 after Dose 1 (participant did not receive Dose 2) and Days 3, 9, and 48 after Dose 2. No cases of acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) were reported in the placebo group. d. Adverse reaction determined post -authorisation. e. Refers to vaccinated arm. f. A higher frequency of pyrexia was observed after the second dose compared to the first dose. g. Facial swelling in vaccine recipients with a history of injection of dermatological fillers has been reported in the post-marketing phase. h. Most cases appeared to be non -serious and temporary in nature. 9 Description of selected adverse reactions Myocarditis and pericarditis The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see section 4.4). Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12- 29 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the second dose there were 0.5 6 (95% CI 0.37 - 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16 -24 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medic inal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 4.9 Overdose Overdose data is available from 52 study participants included in the clinical trial that due to an error in dilution received 58 micrograms of Comirnaty. The vaccine recipients did not report an increase in reactogenicity or adverse reactions. In the ev ent of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN 01 Mechanism of action The nucleoside -modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which enable delivery of the non- replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the SARS -CoV -2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane -anchored, full -length S with two point mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses to the spik e (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against COVID -19. Efficacy Study 2 is a multicentre, multinational, Phase 1/2/3 randomised, placebo- controlled, observer -blind dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the 56-year stratum. The study excluded participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological 10 diagnosis of COVI D-19. Participants with pre -existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV). Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approximately 44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of COVID- 19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID -19. In t he clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 60 days before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the study in order to receive either placebo or COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine. The population for the analysis of the primary e fficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years of age and older (18 242 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2 through 7 days after the second dose. In additi on, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older (804 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group). At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic COVID -19 for in total 2 214 person- years for the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 2 222 person- years in the placebo group. There were no meaningful clinical d ifferences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at risk of severe COVID -19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID -19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) 30 kg/m 2, chronic pulmonary disease, dia betes mellitus, hypertension). The vaccine efficacy information is presented in Table 2. 11 Table 2 .

In the updated efficacy analysis, efficacy of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing first COVID -19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2 compared to placebo was 91.1% (95% CI of 88.8% to 93.0%) during the period when Wuhan/Wild type and Alpha variant s were the predominant circulating strain s in participants in the evaluable efficacy population with or without evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2. Additionally, the updated efficacy analyses by subgroup showed similar efficacy point estimates across sexes, ethnic groups, geography and participants with medical comorbidities and obesity associated with high risk of severe COVID -19. Efficacy against severe COVID -19 Updated efficacy analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the CO VID-19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing severe COVID19. As of 13 March 2021, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID -19 is presented only for participants with or without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection (Table 4) as the COVID -19 case counts in participants 13 without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection were the same as those in participants with or without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection in both the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine and placebo groups.

Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow -up duration of > 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 1 110 participants who rec eived placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0). Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID -19 cases accrued during blinded placebo- controlled follow -up, repre senting up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population. 14 In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 1 030 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 30 cases in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0). In Study 2, an analysis of SARS -CoV -2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 15 ye ars of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170). The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years of age group was 1.76, with a 2- sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5- fold noninferiority criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2- sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was > 0.67. Immunogenicity in participants 18 years of age and older - after booster dose Effectiveness of a booster dose of Comirnaty was based on an assessment of 50% neutralizing antibody titres (NT50) against SARS -CoV -2 (USA_WA1/2020) in Study 2. In this study, the booster dose was administered 5 to 8 months (median 7 months) after the seco nd dose . In Study 2, analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to 1 month after the primary series in individuals 18 through 55 years of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after the booster vaccination demonstrated noninferiority for both geometric mean ratio (GMR) and difference in seroresponse rates. Seroresponse for a participant was defined as achieving a 4-fold rise in NT50 from baseline (before primary series). These analyses are summarized in Table 5. Table 5 .

Relative vaccine efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older - after booster dose An interim efficacy analysis of Study 4, a placebo- controlled booster study performed in approximately 10 000 participants 16 years of age and older who were recruited from Study 2, evaluated confirmed COVID -19 cases accrued from at least 7 days after booster vaccination up to a data cut -off date of 5 October 2021, which represents a median of 2.5 months post -booster follow -up. The booster dose was administered 5 to 13 months (median 11 months) after the second dose. Vaccine efficacy of the Comirnaty booster dose after the primary series relative to the placebo booster group who only received the primary series dose was assessed. The relative vaccine efficacy information for participants 16 years of age and older without prior evidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection is presented in Table 6. Relative vaccine efficacy in participants with or without evidence of prior S ARS -CoV -2 infection was 94.6% (95% confidence interval of 88.5% to 97.9%), similar to that seen in those participants without evidence of prior infection. Primary COVID -19 cases observed from 7 days after booster vaccination were 7 primary cases in the Com irnaty group, and 124 primary cases in the placebo group. 16 Table 6 .

Immunogenicity of a booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID -19 vaccine Effectiveness of a Comirnaty booster dose (30 mcg) in individuals who completed primary vaccination with another authorised COVID -19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose) is inferred from immunogenicity data from an independent National Institutes of Health (NIH) study phase 1/2 open- label clinical trial (NCT04889209) conducted in the United States. In this study, adults (range 19 to 80 years of age) who had completed primary vaccination with Moderna 100 mcg 2 -dose series (N = 51, mean age 54\u00b117), Janssen single dose (N = 53, mean age 48\u00b114), or Comirnaty 30 mcg 2-dose series (N = 50, mean age 50\u00b118) at least 12 weeks prior to enrolment and who reported no history of SARS -CoV -2 infection received a booster dose of Comirnaty (30 mcg). The boost with Comirnaty i nduced a 36, 12, and 20 GMR -fold rise in neutralising titres following the Janssen, Moderna, and Comirnaty primary doses, respectively. Heterologous boosting with Comirnaty was also evaluated in the study (EudraCT 2021- 002175- 19), a multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial of third dose booster vaccination against COVID -19, in which 107 adult participants (median age 71 years of age, interquartile range 54 to 77 years of age) were randomised at least 70 days post 2 doses of AstraZeneca COVID- 19 Vaccine . After the AstraZeneca with heterologous Comirnaty booster (n = 95). 17 Immunogenicity in participants > 55 years of a ge - after a booster dose (fourth dose) of Comirnaty (30 mcg) In an interim analysis of a subset from Study 4 (Substudy E), 305 participants > 55 years of age who had completed a series of 3 doses of Comirnaty received Comirnaty (30 mcg) as a booster dose (fourth dose) 5 to 12 months after receiving Dose 3. For the i mmunogenicity subset data see Table 7. Immunogenicity in participants 18 to 55 years of age - after a booster dose (fourth dose) of Comirnaty ( 30 mcg ) In Substudy D [a subset from Study 2 (Phase 3) and Study 4 (Phase 3)], 325 participants 18 to 55 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty received Comirnaty (30 mcg) as a booster dose (fourth dose) 90 to 180 days after receiving Dose 3.

Paediatric population The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID -19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not applicable. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. General toxicity Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekl y, generating relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible. Genotoxicity /Carcinogenicity Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential. Reproductive toxicity Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a c ombined fertility and developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat due to body weight differences , spanning between pre -mating day 21 and gestational day 20). SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no 19 vaccine- related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo- foetal or offspring development. No Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk. 6.

Multidose vials Multidose v ials of Comirnaty contain 6 doses of 0.3 mL of vaccine. In order to extract 6 doses from a single vial, low dead -volume syringes and/or needles should be used. The low dead- volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of no more than 35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle: Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine. If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 mL, discard the vial and any excess volume. Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 28 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. General recommendations Hypersensitivity and ana phylaxis Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine. Close observation for at least 15 minute s is recommended following vaccination. No further dose of the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of Comirnaty. Myocarditis and pericarditis There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males (see section 4.8) . Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been observed. Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpita tions following vaccination. Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this condition. Anxiety -related reactions Anxiety- related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stre ssrelated reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. Stress -related reactions are temporary and r esolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. Concurrent illness Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low -grade fever should not delay vaccination. Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders As with other intramuscular injections , the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals. 29 Immunocompromised individuals The efficacy and safety of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty may be lower in immunocompromised individuals. Duration of protection The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials. Limitations of vaccine effectiveness As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty may not protect all vaccine recipients. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination . 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interacti on studies have been performed. Concomitant administration of Comirnaty with other vaccines has not been studied. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy A large amount of observational data from pregnant women vaccinated with Comirnaty during the second and third trimester have not shown an increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes. While data on pregnancy outcomes following vaccination during the first trimester are presently limited, no increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or post -natal development (see section 5.3). Comirnaty can be used during pregnancy. Breast -feeding No effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of breast -feeding woman to Comirnaty is negligible. Observational data from women who were breast -feeding after vaccination have not shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed newb orns/infants. Comirnaty can be used during breast -feeding. Fertility Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Comirnaty has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. 30 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of safety profile Participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses In Study 2, a total of 22 026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty and a total of 22 021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 20 519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty. At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut -off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo- controlled blinded follow -up period up to the participants' unblinding dates, a total of 25 651 (58.2%) participants (13 031 Comirnaty and 12 620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15 111 (7 704 Comirnaty and 7 407 placebo) participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10 540 (5 327 Comirnaty and 5 213 placebo) participants 56 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in pa rticipants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia (> 40%), chills (> 30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (> 10%) and were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age. The safety profile in 545 participan ts 16 years of age and older receiving Comirnaty, that were seropositive for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population. Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses In an analysis of long- term safety follow -up in Study 2, 2 260 adolescents (1 131 Comirnaty and 1 129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1 559 adolescents (786 Comirnaty and 773 placebo) have been followed for 4 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. The safety evaluation in Study 2 is ongoing. The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age that received 2 doses were inj ection site pain ( > 90%), fatigue and 40%), arthralgia and pyrexia ( > 20%). Participants 12 years of age and older - after booster dose The safety of a booster dose of Comirnaty in participants 12 years of age and older is inferred from safety data from studies of a booster dose of Comirnaty in participants 16 years of age and older. A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the original Comirnaty 2 -dose cour se, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 6 months (range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow -up time of 8.3 months (range 1.1 to 8.5 months) and 301 participants had been followed for 6 months after the booster dose to the cut -off date (22 November 2021). The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia (> 30%), chills and arthralgia (> 20%). In Study 4, a placebo- controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5 081 participants), or placebo (5 044 participants) at least 6 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose , 31 had a median follow -up time of 2. 8 months (range 0.3 to 7.5 months) after the booster dose in the blinded placebo- controlled follow -up period to the cut -off date ( 8 February 2022 ). Of these, 1 281 participants (895 Comirnaty and 386 placebo) have been fo llowed for 4 months after the booster dose of Comirnaty. No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. Participants 12 years of age and older - after subsequent booster doses The safety of a booster dose of Comirnaty in participants 12 years of age and older is inferred from safety data from studies of a booster dose of Comirnaty in participants 18 years of age and older. A subset of 325 adults 18 to 55 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 90 to 180 days after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty had a median follow -up time of 1.4 months up to a data cut -off date of 11 March 2022. The most frequent adverse reactions in these participants were injection site pain (> 70%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia and chills (> 20%), and arthralgia (> 10%). In a subse t from Study 4 (Phase 3), 305 adults > 55 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 5 to 12 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty had a median follow -up time of at least 1.7 months up to a data cut -off date of 16 May 2022. The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty booster (fourth dose) was similar to that seen after the Comirnaty booster (third dose). The most frequent adverse reactions in par ticipants > 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 60%), fatigue (> 40%), headache (> 20%), myalgia and chills (> 10%). Booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID -19 vaccine In 5 independent studies on the use of a Co mirnaty booster dose in individuals who had completed primary vaccination with another authori sed COVID- 19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose), no new safety issues were identified (see section 5.1). Tabulated list of adverse reactions from clinical studi es and post -authorisation experience in individuals 12 years of age and older Adverse reactions observed during clinical studies are listed below according to the following frequency categories: Very common ( 1/10), 1/100), Rare ( 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000), Very rare (< 1/10 000), Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). 32 Table 1 . Adverse reactions from Comirnaty clinical trials and post -authorisation experience in individuals 12 years of age and older System Organ Class Very common ( 1/10) Common ( 1/100 to < 1/100) Rare ( 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000) Very rare (< 1/10 000) Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) Blood and lymphatic system disorders Lymphadenopathya Immune system disorders Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. rash, pruritus, urticariab, angioedemab) Anaphylaxis Metabolism and nutrition disorders Decreased appetite Psychiatric disorders Insomnia Nervous system disorders Headache Dizzinessd; Lethargy Acute peripheral facial paralysisc Myalgia Pain in extremitye Reproductive system and breast disorders Heavy menstrual bleedingh General disorders and administration site conditions Injection site pain; Fatigue; Chills; Pyrexia f; Injection site swelling Injection site redness Asthenia; Malaise; Injection site pruritus Extensive swelling of vaccinated limbd; Facial swellingg a. In participants 5 years of age and older, a higher frequency of lymphadenopathy was reported after a booster ( 2.8%) dose than after primary ( 0.9%) doses of the vaccine. b. The frequency category for urticaria and angioedema was rare. c. Through the clinical trial safety follow -up period to 14 November 2020, acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) was reported by four participants in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group. Onset was Day 37 a fter Dose 1 (participant did not receive Dose 2) and Days 3, 9, and 48 after Dose 2. No cases of acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) were reported in the placebo group. d. Adverse reaction determined post -authorisation. e. Refers to vaccinated arm . f. A higher frequency of pyrexia was observed after the second dose compared to the first dose. g. Facial swelling in vaccine recipients with a history of injection of dermatological fillers has been reported in the post-marketing phase. h. Most cases ap peared to be non -serious and temporary in nature. 33 Description of selected adverse reactions Myocarditis and pericarditis The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see section 4.4). Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12- 29 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the second dose there were 0.5 6 (95% CI 0.37 - 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16 -24 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 t o 17 years. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professi onals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 4.9 Overdose Overdose data is available from 52 study participants included in the clinical trial that due to an error in dilution received 58 micrograms of Comirnaty. The vaccine recipients did not report an increase in reactogenicity or adverse reactions. In the ev ent of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01 Mechanism of action The nucleoside -modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which enable delivery of the non- replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the SARS -CoV -2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane -anchored, full -length S with two point mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an antigenically preferred prefusion conformat ion. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against COVID -19. Efficacy Study 2 is a multicentre, multinational, Phase 1/2/3 randomised, placebo- controlled, observer -blind dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the 56-year stratum. The study excluded 34 participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID -19. Participants with pre -existing stable disease, defined as disease not requirin g significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B vir us (HBV). Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approximately 44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of COVID- 19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID -19. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before an d after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 60 days before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the study in order to receive either placebo or COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine. The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years of age and older (18 242 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2 through 7 days after the second dose. In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vac cine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older (804 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group). At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic COVID -19 for in total 2 214 person- years for the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 2 222 person- years in the placebo group. There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at risk of severe COVID- 19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID -19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) 30 kg/m2, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension). The vaccine efficacy information is presented in T able 2. Table 2 .

Additionally, subgroup a nalyses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed similar efficacy point estimates across genders, ethnic groups, and participants with medical comorbidities associated with high risk of severe COVID -19. Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additi onal confirmed COVID -19 cases accrued during blinded placebo- controlled follow -up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population.

In the updated efficacy analysis, efficacy of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing first COVID -19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2 compared to placebo was 91.1% (95% CI of 88.8% to 93.0%) during the period when Wuhan/Wild t ype and Alpha variant s were the predominant circulating strain s in participants in the evaluable efficacy population with or without evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2. Additi onally, the updated efficacy analyses by subgroup showed similar efficacy point estimates across sexes, ethnic groups, geography and participants with medical comorbidities and obesity associated with high risk of severe COVID -19. Efficacy against severe COVID -19 Updated efficacy analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing severe COVID19. As of 13 March 2021, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID -19 is presented only for participants with or wi thout prior SARS -CoV -2 infection (Table 4) as the COVID -19 case counts in participants without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection were the same as those in participants with or without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection in both the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine and placebo groups. 37 Table 4 .

Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow -up duration of > 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In par ticipants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0). Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID -19 cases accrued during blinded placebo- controlled follow -up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population. 38 In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 1 030 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 30 cases in 1 109 participants who received plac ebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0). In Study 2, an analysis of SARS -CoV -2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a randomly selected subset of participants who had no s erological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170). The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT ) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years of age group was 1.76, with a 2- sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5- fold noninferiority criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2- sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] wa s > 0.67. Immunogenicity in participants 18 years of age and older - after booster dose Effectiveness of a booster dose of Comirnaty was based on an assessment of 50% neutralizing antibody titres (NT50) against SARS -CoV -2 (USA_WA1/2020) in Study 2. In this study, the booster dose was administered 5 to 8 months (median 7 months) after the second dose. In Study 2, analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to 1 month after the primary series in individuals 18 through 55 years of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after the booster vaccination demonstrated noninferiority for both geometric mean ratio (GMR) and difference in seroresponse rates. Seroresponse for a participant was defined as achieving a 4-fold rise in NT50 from baseline (before primary series). These analyses are summarized in Table 5. Table 5 .

Relative vaccine efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older - after booster dose An interim efficacy analysis of Study 4, a placebo- controlled booster study performed in approximately 10 000 participants 16 years of age and older who were recruited from Study 2, evaluated confirmed COVID -19 cases accrued from at least 7 days after booster vaccination up to a data cut -off date of 5 October 2021, which represents a median of 2.5 months post -booster follow -up. The booster dose was administered 5 to 13 months (median 11 months) after the second dose. Vaccine efficacy of the Comirnaty booster dose after the primary series relative to the placebo booster group who only received the primary series dose was assessed. The relative vaccine efficacy information for participants 16 years of age and older without prior evidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection is presented in Table 6. Relative vaccine efficacy in participants with or without evidence of prior S ARS -CoV -2 infection was 94.6% (95% confidence interval of 88.5% to 97.9% ), similar to that seen in those participants without evidence of prior infection. Primary COVID -19 cases observed from 7 days after booster vaccination were 7 primary cases in the Com irnaty group, and 124 primary cases in the placebo group. Table 6 .

Immunogenicity of a booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID -19 vaccine Effectiveness of a Comirnaty booster dose (30 mcg) in individuals who completed primary vaccination with another authorised COVID -19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose) is inferred from immunogenicity data from an independent National Institutes of Health (NIH) study phase 1/2 open- label clinical trial (NCT04889209) conducted in the United States. In this study, adults (range 19 to 80 years of age) who had completed primary vaccination with Moderna 100 mcg 2 -dose series (N = 51, mean age 54\u00b117), Janssen single dose (N = 53, mean age 48\u00b114), or Comirnaty 30 mcg 2-dose series (N = 50, mean age 50\u00b118) at least 12 weeks prior to enrolment and who reported no history of SARS -CoV -2 infection received a booster dose of Comirnaty (30 mcg). The boost with Comirnaty i nduced a 36, 12, and 20 GMR -fold rise in neutralising titres following the Janssen, Moderna, and Comirnaty primary doses, respectively. Heterologous boosting with Comirnaty was also evaluated in the study (EudraCT 2021- 002175- 19), a multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial of third dose booster vaccination against COVID -19, in which 107 adult participants (median age 71 years of age, interquartile range 54 to 77 years of age) were randomised at least 70 days post 2 doses of AstraZeneca COVID- 19 Vaccine . After the AstraZeneca with heterologous Comirnaty booster (n = 95). Immunogenicity in participants > 55 years of ag e - after a booster dose (fourth dose) of Comirnaty (30 mcg) In an interim analysis of a subset from Study 4 (Substudy E), 305 participants > 55 years of age who had completed a series of 3 doses of Comirnaty received Comirnaty (30 mcg) as a booster dose (fourth dose) 5 to 12 months after receiving Dose 3. For the Immunogenicity subset data see Table 7. Immunogenicity in participants 18 to 55 years of age - after a booster dose (fourth dose) of Comirnaty ( 30 mcg ) In Substudy D [a subset from Study 2 (Phase 3) and Study 4 (Phase 3)], 325 participants 18 to 55 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty received Comirnaty (30 mcg) as a booster dose (fourth dose) 90 to 180 days after receiving Dose 3.

Paediatric population The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID -19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not applicable. 42 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. General toxicity Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnat y (receiving 3 full human doses once weekly, generating relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) consisten t with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible. Genotoxicity /Carcinogenicity Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential. Reproductive toxicity Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a c ombined fertility and developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat due to body weight differences , spanning between pre -mating day 21 and gestational day 20). SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no vaccine- related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo- foetal or offspring development. No Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk. 6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT Comirnaty 10 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside modified) 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION This is a multidose vial with an orange cap and must be diluted before use. One vial (1.3 mL) contains 10 doses of 0.2 mL after dilution, see sections 4.2 and 6.6. One dose (0.2 mL) contains 10 micrograms of tozinameran, a COVI D-19 mRNA Vaccine nanoparticles). is a single -stranded, 5'- capped messenger RNA (mRNA) produced using a cell- free in vitro transcription from the corresponding DNA templates, encoding the viral spike (S) protein of SARS -CoV -2. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Concentrate for dispersion for injection (sterile concentrate). The vaccine is a white to off-white frozen dispersion (pH: 6.9 - 7.9). 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Comirnaty 10 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS -CoV -2, in children aged 5 to 11 years. The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) Comirnaty 10 micrograms/dose is administered intramuscularly after dilution as a single dose of 0.2 mL for children 5 to 11 years of age regardless of prior COVID -19 vaccination status (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID- 19 vaccine, Comirnaty should be administered at least 3 m onths after the most recent dose of a COVID -19 vaccine. 49 Severely immunocompromised aged 5 years and older Additional doses may be administered to individuals who are severely immunocompromised in accordance with national recommendations (see section 4.4). Comirnaty 10 micrograms/dose should be used only for children 5 to 11 years of age. Paediatric population There are paediatric formulation s available for infants and children aged 6 months to 4 years. For details, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for other formulations . The safety and efficacy of the vaccine in infants aged less than 6 months have not yet been established. Method of administration Comirnaty 10 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection should be administered intramuscularly after dilution (see section 6.6). After dilution, vials of Comirnaty contain 10 doses of 0.2 mL of vaccine. In order to extract 10 doses from a single vial, low dead -volume syringes and/or needles should be used. The low dead- volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of no more than 35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract 10 doses from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle: Each dose must contain 0.2 mL of vaccine. If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.2 mL, discard the vial and any excess volume. Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. The preferred site is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally. The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4. For instructions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 50 General recommendations Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine. Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recom mended following vaccination. No further dose of the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of Comirnaty. Myocarditis and pericarditis There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males (see section 4.8) . Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been observed. Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. Healthcare pr ofessionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this condition. Anxiety -related reactions Anxiety- related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stressrelated reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in a ssociation with the vaccination process itself. Stress -related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. Concurrent illness Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low -grade fever should not delay vaccina tion. Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders As with other intramuscular injections , the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals. Immunocompromised individuals The efficacy and safety of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty may be lower in immunocompromised individuals. 51 Duration of protection The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical tria ls. Limitations of vaccine effectiveness As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty may not protect all vaccine recipients. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination . 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products a nd other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed. Concomitant administration of Comirnaty with other vaccines has not been studied. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy A large amount of observational data from pregnant women vaccinated with Comirnaty during the second and third trimester have not shown an increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes. While data on pregnancy outcomes following vaccination during the first trimester are presently limited, no increased r isk for miscarriage has been seen. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or post -natal development (see section 5.3). Comirnaty can be used during pregnancy. Breast-feeding No effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of breast -feeding woman to Comirnaty is negligible. Observational data from women who were breast -feeding after vaccination have not shown a risk for advers e effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty can be used during breast -feeding. Fertility Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 4.7 Effects on ability to drive an d use machines Comirnaty has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of safety profile Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after 2 doses In Study 3, a total of 3 109 children 5 to 11 years of age received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty 10 mcg and a total of 1 538 children 5 to 11 years of age received placebo. At the time of the analysis of Study 3 Phase 2/3 with data up to the cut -off date of 20 May 2022, 2 206 (1 481 Comirnaty 10 mcg and 725 placebo) children have been followed for 4 months after the second dose in the placebo- controlled blinded follow -up period. The safety evaluation in Study 3 is ongoing. 52 The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in participants 5 to 11 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older. The most fre quent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 50%), headache (> 30%), injection site redness and swelling ( 20%), myalgia , chills , and diarrhoea (> 10%). Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after booster dose In a subset from Study 3, a total of 401 children 5 to 11 years of age received a booster dose of Comirnaty 10 mcg at least 5 months (range of 5 to 9 months) after c ompleting the primary series. The analysis of the Study 3 Phase 2/3 subset is based on data up to the cut -off date of 22 March 2022 (median follow -up time of 1.3 months). The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after the p rimary course. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age were injection site pain (> 70%), fatigue (> 40%), headache (> 30%), myalgia, chills, injection site redness and swelling (> 10%). Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses In an analysis of long- term safety follow -up in Study 2, 2 260 adolescents (1 131 Comirnaty and 1 129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1 559 adolescents (786 Comirnaty and 773 placebo) have been followed for 4 months after the second dose. The safety evaluation in Study 2 is ongoing. The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse react ions in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain ( > 90%), fatigue and headache (> 70%), 40%), arthralgia and pyrexia ( > 20%). Participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses In Study 2, a total of 22 026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty 30 mcg and a total of 22 021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vacc ine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 20 519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty. At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut -off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo- controlled blinded follow -up period up to the participants' unblinding dates, a total of 25 651 (58.2%) participants (13 031 Comirnaty and 12 620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15 111 (7 704 Comirnaty and 7 4 07 placebo) participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10 540 (5 327 Comirnaty and 5 213 placebo) participants 56 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia (> 40%), chills (> 30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (> 10%) and were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age. The safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receiving Comirnaty, that were seropositive for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population. Participants 16 years of age and older - after booster dose A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the original Comirnaty 2 -dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty app roximately 6 months (range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, 53 had a median follow -up time of 8.3 months (range 1.1 to 8.5 months) and 301 participants had been followed for 6 months after the booster dose to the cut -off date (22 November 2021). The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia (> 30%), chills and arthralgia (> 20%). In Study 4, a placebo- controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5 081 participants), or placebo (5 044 participants) at least 6 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow -up time of 2. 8 months (range 0.3 to 7.5 months) after the booster dose in the blinded placebo- controlled follow -up period to the cut -off date ( 8 February 2022 ). Of these, 1 281 participants (895 Comirnaty and 386 placebo) have been followed for 4 months after the booster dose of Comirnaty. No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. Booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID -19 vaccine In 5 independent studies on the use of a Comirnaty booster dose in individuals who had completed primary vaccination with another authori sed COVID- 19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose), no new safety issues were identified. Tabulated list of adverse reactions from clinical studies and post -authorisation experience in individuals 5 years of age and older Adverse reactions observed during clinical stud ies are listed below according to the following frequency categories: Very common ( 1/10), Common ( 1/100 1/100), Rare ( 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000), Very rare (< 1/10 000), Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

The frequency category for urticaria and angioedema was rare. c. Through the clinical trial safety follow -up period to 14 November 2020, acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) was reported by four participants in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group. Onset was Day 37 after Dose 1 (participant did not receive Dose 2) and Days 3, 9, and 48 after Dose 2. No cases of acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) were reported in the placebo group. d. Adverse reaction determined post -authorisation. e. Refers to vaccinated arm. f. A higher frequency of pyrexia was observed after the second dose compared to the first dose. g. Facial swelling in vaccine recipients w ith a history of injection of dermatological fillers has been reported in the post - marketing phase. h. Injection site redness occurred at a higher frequency (very common) in children 5 to 11 years of age. i. Most cases appeared to be non -serious and tempor ary in nature. Description of selected adverse reactions Myocarditis and pericarditis The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see section 4.4). Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12 -29 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the second dose there were 0.5 6 (95% CI 0.37 - 0.7 4) extra cases of myocarditis in 16 -24 year old males per 10 000 compar ed to unexposed persons. Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years. 55 Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactio ns via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 4.9 Overdose Overdose data is available from 52 study p articipants included in the clinical trial that due to an error in dilution received 58 micrograms of Comirnaty. The vaccine recipients did not report an increase in reactogenicity or adverse reactions. In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital funct ions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01 Mechanism of action The nucleoside -modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which enable delivery of the non- replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the SARS -CoV -2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane -anchored, full -length S with two point mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to pr otection against COVID -19. Efficacy Study 2 is a multicentre, multinational, Phase 1/2/3 randomised, placebo- controlled, observer -blind dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the 56-year stratum. The study excluded participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinica l or microbiological diagnosis of COVID -19. Participants with pre -existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV). Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approximately 44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of COVID- 19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID- 19. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 60 days 56 before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the study in order to receive either placebo or COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine. The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years of age and older (18 242 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2 through 7 days after the second dose. In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older (804 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group). At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic COVID -19 for in total 2 214 person- years for the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 2 222 person- years in the placebo group. There were no meani ngful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at risk of severe COVID -19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID -19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) 30 kg/m 2, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension).

In the updated efficacy analysis, efficacy of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing first COVID -19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2 compared to placebo was 91.1% (95% CI of 88.8% to 93.0%) during the period when Wuhan/Wild type and Alpha variant s were the predominant circulating strain s in participants in the evaluable effic acy population with or without evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2. 58 Additionally, the updated efficacy analyses by subgroup showed similar efficacy point estimates across sexes, ethnic groups, geography and participants with medical comorbidities and obesity associated with high risk of severe COVID -19. Efficacy against severe COVID -19 Updated efficacy analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing severe COVID19. As of 13 March 2021, va ccine efficacy against severe COVID -19 is presented only for participants with or without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection (Table 4) as the COVID -19 case counts in participants without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection were the same as those in participants with or wit hout prior SARS -CoV -2 infection in both the COVID- 19 mRNA Vaccine and placebo groups.

T he point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0). Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID -19 cases accrued during blinded placebo- controlled follow -up, representing up to 6 months a fter Dose 2 in the efficacy population. In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 1 030 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain . In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 30 cases in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0). In Study 2, an analysis of SARS -CoV -2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (n = 190) t o participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170). The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years of age group was 1.76, with a 2- sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5- fold noninferiority criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2- sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was > 0.67. Efficacy and immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after 2 doses Study 3 is a Phase 1/2/3 study comprised of an open- label vaccine dose- finding portion (Phase 1) and a multicentre, multinational, randomised, saline placebo -controlled, observer -blind efficacy portion (Phase 2/3) that has enrolled participants 5 to 11 years of age. The majority (94.4%) of randomised vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Initial descriptive vaccine efficacy results in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior SARS -CoV -2 infection are presented in Table 5. No cases of COVID- 19 were observed in either the vaccine group or the placebo group in participants with evidence of prior SARS -CoV -2 infection. 60 Table 5 .

Pre-specified hypothesis -driven efficacy analysis was performed with additional confirmed COVID -19 cases accrued during blinded placebo- controlled follow -up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population. In the efficacy analysis of Study 3 in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were 10 cases in 2 703 participants who received the vaccine and 42 cases out of 1 348 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 88.2% (95% confidence interval 76.2, 94.7) during the period when Delta variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 12 cases in the 3 018 who received vaccine and 42 cas es in 1 511 participants who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 85.7% (95% confidence interval 72.4, 93.2). In Study 3, an analysis of SARS -CoV -2 50% neutralising titres (NT50) 1 month after Dose 2 in a randomly selected subset of partic ipants demonstrated effectiveness by immunobridging of immune responses comparing children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 3 to participants 16 to 25 years of age in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 2 wh o had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, meeting the prespecified immunobridging criteria for both the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and the seroresponse difference with seroresponse defined as achi eving at least 4 -fold rise in SARS -CoV -2 NT50 from baseline (before Dose 1). The GMR of the SARS -CoV -2 NT50 1 month after Dose 2 in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) to that of young adults 16 to 25 years of age was 1.04 (2 -sided 95% CI: 0.93, 1.18). Among participants without prior evidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, 99.2% of children 5 to 11 years of age and 99.2% of participants 16 to 25 years of age had a seroresponse at 1 month after Dose 2. The difference in proportions of participants who had seroresponse between the 2 age groups (children - young adult) was 0.0% (2- sided 95% CI: - 2.0%, 2.2%).

Effectiveness of a booster dose in ages 5 to 11 is inferred by immunogenicity. The immunogenicity of this was assessed through NT50 against the reference strain of SARS -CoV -2 (USA_WA1/2020) . Analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to before the booster dose demonstrated a substantial increase in GMTs in individuals 5 through 11 years of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after the dose 2 and the booster dose.

Paediatric population The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID -19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not applicable. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. General toxicity Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekly, generating relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (incl uding basophils and eosinophils) 63 consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible. Genotoxicity /Carcinogenicity Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential. Reproductive toxicity Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and developmental toxicit y study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat due to body weight differences, spanning between pre -mating day 21 and ge stational day 20). SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no vaccine -related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo- foetal or offspring development. No Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk. 6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT Comirnaty 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside modified) 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION This is a multidose vial with a maroon cap and must be diluted before use. One vial (0.4 mL) co ntains 10 doses of 0.2 mL after dilution, see sections 4.2 and 6.6. One dose (0.2 mL) contains 3 micrograms of tozinameran, a COVID- 19 mRNA Vaccine (embedded in lipid nanoparticles). Tozinameran is a single -stranded, 5'- capped messenger RNA (mRNA) produced using a cell- free in vitro transcription from the corresponding DNA templates, encoding the viral spike (S) protein of SARS -CoV -2. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Concentrate for dispersion for injection (sterile concentrate). The vaccine is a white to off- white frozen disper sion (pH: 6.9 - 7.9). 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Comirnaty 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS -CoV -2, in infants and children aged 6 months to 4 years. The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology Infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age without history of completion of a COVID-19 primary course or prior SARS -CoV-2 infection Comirnaty 3 micrograms/dose is administered intramuscularly after dilution as a primary course of 3 doses (0.2 mL each). It is recommended to administer the second dose 3 weeks after the first dose followed by a third dose administered at least 8 weeks after the second dose (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). If a child turns 5 years old between their doses in the primary course, he/she should complete the primary course at the same 3 micrograms dose level. 72 Infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age with history of completion of a COVID -19 primary course or prior SARS -CoV-2 infection Comirnaty 3 micrograms/dose is administered intramuscularly after dilution as a single dose of 0.2 mL for infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age. For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID- 19 vaccine, Comirnaty should be administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a COVID- 19 vaccine. Severely immunocompromised aged 6 months to 4 years Additional dose s may be administered to individuals who are severely immunocompromised in accordance with national recommendations (see section 4.4). Interchangeability The primary course may consist of ) but not exceeding the total number of doses required as primary course. The primary course should only be administered once. The interchangeability of Comirnaty with COVID -19 vaccines from other manufacturers has not been established. Paediatric population There are paediatric formulation s available for children 5 to 11 years of age. For details, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for other formulations . The safety and efficacy of the vaccine in infants aged less t han 6 months have not yet been established. Method of administration Comirnaty 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection should be administered intramuscularly after dilution (see section 6.6). After dilution, vials of Comirnaty conta in 10 doses of 0.2 mL of vaccine. In order to extract 10 doses from a single vial, low dead -volume syringes and/or needles should be used. The low dead- volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of no more than 35 microlitres. If stand ard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract 10 doses from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle: Each dose must contain 0.2 mL of vaccine. If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.2 mL, discard the vial and any excess volume. Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. In infants from 6 to less than 12 months of age, the recommended injection site is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. In individuals 1 year of age and older, the recommended injection site is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh or the deltoid muscle. Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally. The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4. 73 For instructions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypers ensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. General recommendations Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine. Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recom mended following vaccination. No further dose of the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of Comirnaty. Myocarditis and pericarditis There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males (see section 4.8) . Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been observed. Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. Healthcare pr ofessionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this condition. Anxiety -related reactions Anxiety- related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stressrelated reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. Stress -related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Indivi duals should be advised to bring symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. Concurrent illness Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low -grade fever should not delay vaccination. 74 Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders As with other intramuscular injections , the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals. Immunocompr omised individuals The efficacy and safety of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty may be lower in immunocompromised individuals. Duration of pr otection The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials. Limitations of vaccine effectiveness As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty may not protect all vaccine recipient s. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination . 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed. Concomitant administration of Comirnaty with other vaccines has not been studied. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Comirnaty 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is not intended for individuals older than 5 years of age. For details for use in individuals older than 5 years of age, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for those formulations . 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Comirnaty has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive, cycle, and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily aff ect the ability to drive, cycle, or use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of safety profile Infants 6 to 23 months of age - after 3 doses In an analysis of Study 3 (Phase 2/3), 1 776 infants ( 1 178 Comirnaty 3 mcg and 598 placebo) were 6 to 23 months of age. B ased on data in the blinded placebo- controlled follow -up period up to the cut-off date of 29 April 2022 , 570 infants 6 to 23 months of age who received a 3- dose primary course (386 Comirnaty 3 mcg and 184 placebo ) have been followed for a median of 1.3 months after the third dose. 75 The most frequent adverse reactions in infants 6 to 23 months of age that received any primary course dose included irritability (> 60%), drowsiness (> 40%), decreased appetite (> 30%), tende rness at the injection site (> 20%), injection site redness and fever (> 10%). Children 2 to 4 years of age - after 3 doses In an analysis of Study 3 (Phase 2/3), 2 750 children ( 1 835 Comirnaty 3 mcg and 915 placebo) were 2 to 4 years of age. Based on data in the blinded placebo- controlled follow -up period up to the cut -off date of 29 April 2022, 886 children 2 to 4 years of age who received a 3 -dose primary course (606 Comirnaty 3 mcg and 280 placebo) have been followed a median of 1.4 months after the third dose. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 2 to 4 years of age that received any primary course dose included pain at injection site and fatigue (> 40%), injection site redness and fever (> 10%). Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after 2 doses In Study 3, a total of 3 109 children 5 to 11 years of age received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty 10 mcg and a total of 1 538 children 5 to 11 years of age received placebo . At the time of the analysis of Study 3 Phase 2/3 with data up to the cut -off date of 20 May 2022, 2 206 (1 481 Comirnaty 10 mcg and 725 placebo) children have been followed for 4 months after the second dose in the placebo- controlled blinded follow -up period. The safety eval uation in Study 3 is ongoing. The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in participants 5 to 11 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 50%), headache (> 30%), injection site redness and swelling ( 20%), myalgia , chills , and diarrhoea (> 10%). Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after booster dose In a subset from Study 3, a total of 401 children 5 to 11 years of age received a booster dose of Comirnaty 10 mcg at least 5 months (range of 5 to 9 months) after c ompleting the primary series. The analysis of the Study 3 Phase 2/3 subset is based on data up to the cut -off date of 22 March 2022 (median follow -up time of 1.3 months). The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after the primary course. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age were injection site pain (> 70%), fatigue (> 40%), headache (> 30%), myalgia, chills, in jection site redness and swelling (> 10%). Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses In an analysis of long- term safety follow -up in Study 2, 2 260 adolescents (1 131 Comirnaty and 1 129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1 559 adoles cents (786 Comirnaty and 773 placebo) have been followed for 4 months after the second dose. The safety evaluation in Study 2 is ongoing. The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection s ite pain ( > 90%), fatigue and headache (> 70%), 40%), arthralgia and pyrexia ( > 20%). Participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses In Study 2, a total of 22 026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dos e of Comirnaty 30 mcg and a total of 22 021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 20 519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty. 76 At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut -off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo- controlled blinded follow -up period up to the participants' unblinding dates, a total of 25 651 (58.2%) participants (13 031 Comirnaty and 12 620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15 111 (7 704 Comirnaty and 7 407 placebo) participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10 540 (5 327 Comirnaty and 5 213 placebo) participants 56 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia (> 40%), chills (> 30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (> 10%) and were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age. The safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receivi ng Comirnaty, that were seropositive for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population. Participants 16 years of age and older - after booster dose A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the original Comirnaty 2 -dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 6 months (range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow -up time of 8.3 m onths (range 1.1 to 8.5 months) and 301 participants had been followed for 6 months after the booster dose to the cut -off date (22 November 2021). The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia (> 30%), chills and arthralgia (> 20%). In Study 4, a placebo- controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5 081 participants), or placebo (5 044 participants) at least 6 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow -up time of 2. 8 months (range 0.3 to 7.5 months) after the booster dose in the blinded placebo- controlled follow -up period to the cut -off date ( 8 February 2022 ). Of these, 1 281 participants (895 Comirnaty and 386 placebo) have been followed for 4 months after the booster dose of Comirnaty. No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. Booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID -19 vaccine In 5 independent studies on the use of a Comirnaty booster dose in ind ividuals who had completed primary vaccination with another authori sed COVID- 19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose), no new safety issues were identified. Tabulated list of adverse reactions from clinical studies and post -authorisation experience in individuals 6 months of age and older Adverse reactions observed during clinical studies are listed below according to the following frequency categories: Very common ( 1/10), Common ( 1/100 1/100), Rare ( 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000), Very rare (< 1/10 000), Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). 77 Table 1 .

The frequency category for angioedema was rare. c. Through the clinical trial safety follow -up period to 14 November 2020, acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) was reported by four participants in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group. Onset was Day 37 after Dose 1 (participant di d not receive Dose 2) and Days 3, 9, and 48 after Dose 2. No cases of acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) were reported in the placebo group. d. Adverse reaction determined post -authorisation. e. Refers to vaccinated arm. f. A higher frequency of pyrexia was observed after the second dose compared to the first dose. g.

Injection site redness occurred at a higher frequency (very common) in participants 6 months to 11 years of age. i. The frequency category for rash was common in participants 6 to 23 months of age. j. The frequency category for decreased appetite was very common in participants 6 to 23 months of age. k. Irritability, injection site tenderness, and drowsiness pertain to participants 6 to 23 months of age. l. Most cases appeared to be non -serious and temporary in nature. Description of selected adverse reactions Myocarditis and pericarditis The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see section 4.4). Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12- 29 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the second dose there were 0.56 ( 95% CI 0.37 - 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16 -24 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactio ns via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 4.9 Over dose Overdose data is available from 52 study participants included in the clinical trial that due to an error in dilution received 58 micrograms of Comirnaty. The vaccine recipients did not report an increase in reactogenicity or adverse reactions. In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01 Mechanism of action The nucleoside -modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which enable delivery of the non- replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the SARS -CoV -2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane -anchored, full -length S with two point mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and cellular immun e responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against COVID -19. 79 Efficacy Study 2 is a multicentre, multinational, Phase 1/2/3 randomised, placebo- controlled, observer -blind dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the 56-year stratum. The study excluded participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVI D-19. Participants with pre -existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV). Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approxi mately 44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of COVID- 19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The m ajority (93.1%) of vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID -19. In the clinical study, partic ipants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interv al of 60 days before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the study in order to receive either placebo or COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine. The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years of age and older (18 242 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2 through 7 days after the second dose. In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older (804 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group). At the time of the prima ry efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic COVID -19 for in total 2 214 person- years for the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 2 222 person- years in the placebo group. There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at risk of severe COVID -19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID -19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) 30 kg/m 2, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertens ion).

Efficacy of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing first COVID -19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2 compared to placebo was 94.6% (95% confidence interval of 89.6% to 97.6%) in participants 16 years of age and older with or without evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2. Additionally, subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed similar efficacy point estimates across genders, ethnic groups, and participants with medical comorbidities associated with high risk of severe COVID -19. Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID -19 cases accrued during blinded placebo- controlled follow -up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population.

In the updated efficacy analysis, efficacy of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing first COVID -19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2 compared to placebo was 91.1% (95% CI of 88.8% to 93.0%) during the period when Wuhan/Wild type and Alpha variant s were the predominant circulating strain s in participants in the eval uable efficacy population with or without evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2. Additionally, the updated efficacy analyses by subgroup showed similar efficacy point estimates across sexes, ethnic groups, geography and participants with medical comorbidities and obesity associated with high risk of severe COVID -19. Efficacy against severe COVID -19 Updated efficacy analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing severe COVID19. As of 13 March 2021, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID -19 is presented only for participants with or without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection (Table 4) as the COVID -19 case counts in participants without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection were the same as those in participan ts with or without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection in both the COVID- 19 mRNA Vaccine and placebo groups. 82 Table 4 .

Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow -up duration of > 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 005 participa nts who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0). Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID -19 cases accru ed during blinded placebo- controlled follow -up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population. 83 In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 1 030 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain. In pa rticipants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 30 cases in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0). In Study 2, an analysis of SARS -CoV -2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170). The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years of age group was 1.76, with a 2- sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5- fold noninferiority criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2- sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was > 0.67. Efficacy and immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after 2 doses Study 3 is a Phase 1/2/3 study comprised of an open- label vaccine dose- finding portion (Phase 1) and a multicentre, multinational, randomised, saline placebo -controlled, observer -blind efficacy portion (Phase 2/3) that has enrolled participants 5 to 11 years of age. The majority (94.4%) of randomised vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Initial descriptive vaccine efficacy results in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior SARS -CoV -2 infection are presented in Table 5. No cases of COVID -19 were observed in either the vaccine group or the placebo group in participants with evidence of prior SARS -CoV -2 infection. Table 5 .

In the efficacy analysis of Study 3 in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were 10 cas es in 2 703 participants who received the vaccine and 42 cases out of 1 348 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 88.2% (95% confidence interval 76.2, 94.7) during the period when Delta v ariant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 12 cases in the 3 018 who received vaccine and 42 cases in 1 511 participants who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 85.7% (95% confidence interval 72.4, 93.2). In Study 3, an analysis of SARS -CoV -2 50% neutralising titres (NT50) 1 month after Dose 2 in a randomly selected subset of participants demonstrated effectiveness by immunobridging of immune responses comparing children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 3 to participants 16 to 25 years of age in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 2 who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, meeting the prespecified immunobr idging criteria for both the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and the seroresponse difference with seroresponse defined as achieving at least 4 -fold rise in SARS -CoV -2 NT50 from baseline (before Dose 1). The GMR of the SARS -CoV -2 NT50 1 month after Dose 2 in c hildren 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) to that of young adults 16 to 25 years of age was 1.04 (2 -sided 95% CI: 0.93, 1.18). Among participants without prior evidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, 99.2% of c hildren 5 to 11 years of age and 99.2% of participants 16 to 25 years of age had a seroresponse at 1 month after Dose 2. The difference in proportions of participants who had seroresponse between the 2 age groups (children - young adult) was 0.0% (2- sided 95% CI: - 2.0%, 2.2%). This information is presented in Table 6. 85 Table 6 .

Note: Seroresponse is defined as achieving a 4-fold rise from baseline (before Dose 1). If the baseline measurement is below the LLOQ, a postvaccination assay result 4 \u00d7 LLOQ is considered a seroresponse. a. N = Number of participants with valid and determinate assay results before vaccination and at 1 month after Dose 2. These values are also the denominators used in the percentage calculations for seroresponse rates. b. Protocol -specified t iming for blood sample collection. c. GMTs and 2 -sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean logarithm of the titres and the corresponding CIs (based on the Student t distribution). Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 0.5 \u00d7 LLOQ. d. GMRs and 2- sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean difference of the logarithms of the titres (5 to 11 years of age minus 16 to 25 years of age) and the corresponding CI (based on the Student t distribution). e. Immunobridging based on GMT is declared if the lower bound of the 2- sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater than 0.67 and the point estimate of the GMR is 0.8. f. SARS -CoV -2 NT50 were determined using the SARS -CoV -2 mNeonGreen Virus Microneutralization Assay. The assay uses a fluorescent r eporter virus derived from the USA_WA1/2020 strain and virus neutralisation is read on Vero cell monolayers.

Effectiveness of a booster dose in ages 5 to 11 is inferred by immunogenicity. The immunogenicity of this was assessed through NT50 against the reference strain of SARS -CoV -2 (USA_WA1/2020) . Analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to before the booster dose demonstrated a substantial increase in G MTs in individuals 5 through 11 years of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after the dose 2 and the booster dose. This analysis is summarized in Table 7. Table 7 .

Two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for VE is derived based on the Clopper and Pearson method adjusted for surveillance time. Vaccine efficacy in participants with or without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection was similar to those participants without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection. Severe COVID -19 criteria (as described in the protocol, based on FDA defi nition and modified for children) were fulfilled for 12 cases (8 COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine and 4 placebo) among participants 6 months to 4 years of age. Among participants 6 months through 23 months of age, severe COVID -19 criteria were fulfilled for 3 cases ( 2 COVID- 19 mRNA Vaccine and 1 placebo). Immunogenicity analyses have been performed in the immunobridging subset of 82 Study 3 participants 6 to 23 months of age and 143 Study 3 participants 2 to 4 years of age without evidence of infection up to 1 month after Dose 3 based on a data cut -off date of 29 April 2022. SARS -CoV -2 50% neutralising antibody titres (NT50) were compared between an immunogenicity subset of Phase 2/3 participants 6 to 23 months of age and 2 to 4 years of age from Study 3 at 1 month after the 3 -dose primary course and a randomly selected subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants 16 to 25 years of age at 1 month after the 2- dose primary course, using a microneutralisation assay against the reference strain (USA_WA1/2020). The primary immunobridging analyses compared the geometric mean titres (using a geometric mean ratio [GMR]) and the seroresponse (defined as achieving at least 4 -fold rise in SARS -CoV -2 NT50 from before Dose 1) rates in the evaluable immunogenicity populat ion of participants without evidence of prior SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 3 in participants 6 to 23 months of age and 2 to 4 years of age and up to 1 month after Dose 2 in participants 16 to 25 years of age. The 88 prespecified immunobridging criteria were met for both the GMR and the seroresponse difference for both age groups (Table 9). Table 9 .

Paediatric population The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID -19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not appli cable. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. General toxicity Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekly, generating relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible. Genotoxicity /Carcin ogenicity Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential. Reproductive toxicity Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat due to body weight differences, spanning between pre -mating day 21 and gestational day 20). SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. Ther e were no vaccine -related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo- foetal or offspring development. No Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk. 90 6.

MARKETING AUTHORISATION HOLDER BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH An DATE OF FIRST AUTHORISATION/RENEWAL OF THE AUTHORISATION Date of first authorisation: 21 December 2020 Date of latest renewal: 10 October 2022 10. DATE OF REVISION OF THE TEXT Detailed information on this medicinal product is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu . 98 This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 Vaccine (nucleoside modified) 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION This is a multidose vial with a grey cap. Do not dilute prior to use. One vial (2.25 mL) contains 6 doses of 0.3 mL, see sections 4.2 and 6.6. One dose (0.3 mL) contains 15 micrograms of tozinameran and 15 micrograms of riltozinameran, a COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine (embedded in lipid nanoparticles). Tozinameran is a single -stranded, 5'- capped messenger RNA (mRNA) produced using a cell- free in vitro transcription from the corresponding DNA templates, encoding the viral spike (S) protein of SARS -CoV -2 (Origina l). Riltozinameran is a single -stranded, 5'- capped messenger RNA (mRNA) produced using a cell- free in vitro transcription from the corresponding DNA templates, encoding the viral spike (S) protein of SARS -CoV -2 (Omicron BA.1). For the full list of excipie nts, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Dispersion for injection. The vaccine is a white to off-white frozen dispersion (pH: 6.9 - 7.9). 4. CLINICAL Therapeutic indications Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 (15/15 micrograms)/dose dispersion for injection is indicated immunisation to prevent COVID -19 caused by SARS- CoV -2, in individuals 12 years of age and older who have previously received at least a primary vaccination course against COVID- 19 (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology Individuals 12 years of age and older Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 is administered intramuscularly as a single dose of 0.3 mL for individuals 12 years of age and older who have previously received at least a primary vaccination course against COVID -19 (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 99 For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID- 19 vaccine, Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 should be administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a COVID -19 vaccine. Severely immunocompromised aged 12 years and older Additional doses may be administered to individuals who are severely immunocompromised in accordance with national recommendations (see section 4.4). Paediatric population There are paediatric formulation s available for infants aged 6 months and above and children below 12 years of age. For details, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for other formulations . The safety and efficacy of the vaccine in children aged less than 6 months have not yet been established. Elderly population No dose adjustment is required in elderly individuals 65 years of age. Method of administration Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 (15/15 micrograms)/dose dispersion for injection should be administered intramuscularly (see section 6.6). Do not dilute pri or to use. Vials of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 contain 6 doses of 0.3 mL of vaccine. In order to extract 6 doses from a single vial, low dead- volume syringes and/or needles should be used. The low dead -volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of no more than 35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle: Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine. If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 mL, discard the vial and any excess volume. Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. The preferred site is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally. The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4. For instructions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 100 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. General recommendations Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis Events of anaphylaxis ha ve been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine. Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccina tion. No further dose of the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of Comirnaty. Myocarditis and pericarditis There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males (see section 4.8) . Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been observed. Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this condition. Anxiety -related reactions Anxiety- related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stressrelated reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, incr eases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. Stress -related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to br ing symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. Concurrent illness Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile i llness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low -grade fever should not delay vaccination. Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders As with other intramuscular injections , the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals. 101 Immunocompromised individuals The efficacy and safety of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 may be lower in immunocompromised individuals. Duration of protection The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials. Limitations of vaccine effectiveness As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 may not protect all vaccine recipients. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination . 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of int eraction No interaction studies have been performed. Concomitant administration of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 with other vaccines has not been studied. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy No data are available yet regarding the use o f Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 during pregnancy. However, a large amount of observational data from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown an increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes. While data on pregnancy outcomes following vaccination during the first trimester are presently limited, no increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or post -natal development (see section 5.3). Since differences between products are confined to the spike protein sequence, and there are no clinically meaningful differences in reactogenicity, Comirnaty Origi nal/Omicron BA.1 can be used during pregnancy. Breast -feeding No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 during breast -feeding. However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of breast -feeding woman to the vaccine is negligible. Observational data from women who were breast -feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/in fants. Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 can be used during breast -feeding. Fertility Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 102 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machin es Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of safety profile Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 Participants > 55 years of age - after a booster dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 (fourth dose) In a subset from Study 4 (Phase 3), 305 adults > 55 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 (15/15 mcg) 4.7 to 11.5 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 had a median follow -up time of at least 1.7 months. The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 booster (fourth dose) was similar to that seen after the Comirnaty booster (th ird dose). The most frequent adverse reactions in participants greater than 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 50%), fatigue (> 40%), headache (> 30%), myalgia (> 20%), chills and arthralgia (> 10%). No new adverse reactions were identified for Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1. Participants 18 to 55 years of age - after a booster dose of monovalent Omicron BA.1 (fourth dose) The safety of a Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 booster dose in individuals from 18 to 55 years of age is extrapolated fr om safety data from a subset of 315 adults 18 to 55 years of age who received a booster (fourth dose) of Omicron BA.1 30 mcg (monovalent) after completing 3 doses of Comirnaty. The most frequent adverse reactions in these participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 70%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia arthralgia (> 20%). Comirnaty 30 mcg Participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses In Study 2, a total of 22 026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty and a total of 22 021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respec tively). A total of 20 519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty. At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut -off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo- controlled blinded follow -up period up to the participants' unblinding dates, a total of 25 651 (58.2%) participants (13 031 Comirnaty and 12 620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15 111 (7 704 Comirnaty and 7 407 placebo) participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10 540 (5 327 Comirnaty and 5 213 placebo) participants 56 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia (> 40%), chills (> 30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (> 10%) and were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age. The safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receiving Comirnaty, that were seropositive for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general popula tion. 103 Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses In an analysis of long- term safety follow -up in Study 2, 2 260 adolescents (1 131 Comirnaty and 1 129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1 559 adolescents (786 Comirnaty and 773 placebo) have been followed for 4 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. The safety evaluation in Study 2 is ongoing. The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain ( > 90%), fatigue and headache (> 70%), 40%), arthralgia and pyrexia ( > 20%). Participants 16 ye ars of age and older - after booster dose A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the original Comirnaty 2 -dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 6 months (range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow -up time of 8.3 months (range 1.1 to 8.5 months) and 301 participants had been followed for 6 months after the booster dose to the cut -off date (22 Nove mber 2021). The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia (> 30%), chills and arthralgia (> 20%). In Study 4, a placebo- controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5 081 participants), or placebo (5 044 participants) at least 6 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow -up time of 2. 8 months (range 0.3 to 7.5 months) after the booster dose in the blinded placebo- controlled follow -up period to the cut -off date ( 8 February 2022 ). Of these, 1 281 participants (895 Comirnaty and 386 placebo) have been followed for 4 months after the booster dose of Comirnaty. No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. Booster dose followi ng primary vaccination with another authorised COVID -19 vaccine In 5 independent studies on the use of a Comirnaty booster dose in individuals who had completed primary vaccination with another authori sed COVID -19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose), no new safety issues were identified (see section 5.1). Tabulated list of adverse reactions from clinical studies of Comirnaty and Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 and post -authorisation experience of Comirnaty in individuals 12 years of age and older Advers e reactions observed during clinical studies are listed below according to the following frequency categories: Very common ( 1/10), Common ( 1/100 1/100), Rare ( 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000), Very rare (< 1/10 000), Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). 104 Table 1 .

In participants 5 years of age and older, a higher frequency of lymphadenopathy was reported after a booster ( 2.8%) dose than after primary ( 0.9%) doses of the vaccine. b. The frequency category for urticaria and angioedema was rare. c. Through the clinical trial safety follow -up period to 14 November 2020, acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) was reported by four participants in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group. Onset was Day 37 after Dose 1 (participant did not receive Dose 2) and Days 3, 9, and 48 after Dose 2. No cases of acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) were reported in the placebo group. d. Adverse reaction determined post -authorisation. e. Refers to vaccinated arm. f. A higher frequency of pyrexia was observed after the secon d dose compared to the first dose. 105 g. Facial swelling in vaccine recipients with a history of injection of dermatological fillers has been reported in the post-marketing phase. h. Most cases appeared to be non -serious and temporary in nature. Description of selected adverse reactions Myocarditis and pericarditis The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see section 4.4). Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12- 29 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the second dose there were 0.5 6 (95% CI 0.37 - 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16 -24 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. Limited data indicate that the risk of myoca rditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product i s important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 4.9 Overdose Overdose data is available from 52 study p articipants included in the clinical trial that due to an error in dilution received 58 micrograms of Comirnaty. The vaccine recipients did not report an increase in reactogenicity or adverse reactions. In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital funct ions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01 Mechanism of action The nucleoside -modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which enable delivery of the non- replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the SARS -CoV -2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane -anchored, full -length S with two point mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to pr otection against COVID -19. 106 Efficacy Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 Relative vaccine immunogenicity in participants > 55 years of age - after a booster dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 ( fourth dose) In an interim analysis of a subset from Study 4 (Substudy E), 610 adults greater than 55 years of age who had completed a series of 3 doses of Comirnaty received 1 of the following as a booster dose (fourth dose): after Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 (15/15 mcg) booster vaccination up to a data cut -off date of 16 May 2022, which represents a median of at least 1.7 months -booster fol low-up. The Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 (15/15 mcg) booster dose was administered 4.7 to 11.5 months (median 6.3 months) after the third dose. The primary objective of the analysis was to assess superiority with respect to level of neutralising titre and noninferiority with respect to seroresponse rate of the anti -Omicron immune response induced by a dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 (15/15 mcg) relative to the response elicited by a dose of Comirnaty (30 mcg) given as a fourth dose in Comirnaty- experienced participants greater than 55 years of age. Superiority of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 (15/15 mcg) to Comirnaty (30 mcg) was met, as the lower bound of the 2- sided 95% CI for GMR was > 1 (Table 2) . Seroresponse is defined as achieving 4-fold rise from baseline (before the study vaccination). If the baseline measurement is below the LLOQ, the postvaccination measure of 4 \u00d7 LLOQ is considered a seroresponse. The difference in percentages of participants who achieved seroresponse to Omi cron variant between the Comirnaty 2 .

Protocol -specified timing for blood sample collection. b. n = Number of participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified assay at the given sampling time point. c. GMTs and 2 -sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean logarithm of the titres and the corresponding CIs (based on the Student t distribution). Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 0.5 \u00d7 LLOQ. d. GMRs and 2 -sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean difference of the logarithms of the titres (vaccine group in the corresponding row - Comirnaty [30 mcg]) and the corresponding CI (based on the Student t distribution). Comirnaty 30 mcg Study 2 is a multicentre, multinational, Phase 1/2/3 randomised, placebo- controlled, observer -blind dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the 56-year stratum. The study excluded participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVI D-19. Participants with pre -existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV). Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approxim ately 44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of COVID- 19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The ma jority (93.1%) of vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID -19. In the clinical study, partici pants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 60 days before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the study in order to receive either placebo or COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine. The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years of age and older (18 242 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2 through 7 days after the second dose. In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older (804 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group). At the time of the primar y efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic COVID -19 for in total 2 214 person- years for the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 2 222 person- years in the placebo group. There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vacc ine efficacy in participants who were at risk of severe COVID -19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID -19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) 30 kg/m2, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension).

In the updated efficacy analysis, efficacy of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing first COVID -19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2 compared to placebo was 91.1% (95% CI of 88.8% to 93.0%) during the period when Wuhan/Wild type and Alpha variant s were the predominant circulating strain s in participants in the evaluable efficacy population with or without evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2. Additionally, the updated efficacy analyses by subgr oup showed similar efficacy point estimates across sexes, ethnic groups, geography and participants with medical comorbidities and obesity associated with high risk of severe COVID -19. Efficacy against severe COVID -19 Updated efficacy analyses of second ary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing severe COVID19. As of 13 March 2021, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID -19 is presented only for participants with or without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection (Table 5) as t he COVID- 19 case counts in participants without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection were the same as those in participants with or without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection in both the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine and placebo groups. 110 Table 5 .

Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow -up duration of > 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In par ticipants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0). Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID -19 cases accrued during blinded placebo- controlled follow -up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population. 111 In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 1 030 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 30 cases in 1 109 participants who received plac ebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0). In Study 2, an analysis of SARS -CoV -2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a randomly selected subset of participants who had no s erological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170). The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT ) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years of age group was 1.76, with a 2- sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5- fold noninferiority criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2- sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] wa s > 0.67. Immunogenicity in participants 18 years of age and older - after booster dose Effectiveness of a booster dose of Comirnaty was based on an assessment of 50% neutralizing antibody titres (NT50) against SARS -CoV -2 (USA_WA1/2020) in Study 2. In this study, the booster dose was administered 5 to 8 months (median 7 months) after the second dose. In Study 2, analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to 1 month after the primary series in individuals 18 through 55 years of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after the booster vaccination demonstrated noninferiority for both geometric mean ratio (GMR) and difference in seroresponse rates. Seroresponse for a participant was defined as achieving a 4-fold rise in NT50 from baseline (before primary series). These analyses are summarized in Table 6. Table 6 .

Relative vaccine efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older - after booster dose An interim efficacy analysis of Study 4, a placebo- controlled booster study performed in approximately 10 000 participants 16 years of age and older who were recruited from Study 2, evaluated confirmed COVID -19 cases accrued from at least 7 days after booster vaccination up to a data cut -off date of 5 October 2021, which represents a median of 2.5 months post -booster follow -up. The booster dose was administered 5 to 13 months (median 11 months) after the second dose. V accine efficacy of the Comirnaty booster dose after the primary series relative to the placebo booster group who only r eceived the primary series dose was assessed. The relative vaccine efficacy information for participants 16 years of age and older without prior evidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection is presented in Table 7. Relative vaccine efficacy in participants with or w ithout evidence of prior SARS -CoV -2 infection was 94.6% (95% confidence interval of 88.5% to 97.9% ), similar to that seen in those participants without evidence of prior infection. Primary COVID -19 cases observed from 7 days after booster vaccination were 7 primary cases in the Comirnaty group, and 124 primary cases in the placebo group. Table 7 .

Immunogenicity of a booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID -19 vaccine Effectiveness of a Comirnaty booster dose (30 mcg) in individuals who completed primary vaccination with another authorised COVID -19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose) is inferred from immunogenicity data from an independent Na tional Institutes of Health (NIH) study phase 1/2 open- label clinical trial (NCT04889209) conducted in the United States. In this study, adults (range 19 to 80 years of age) who had completed primary vaccination with Moderna 100 mcg 2 -dose series (N = 51, mean age 54\u00b117), Janssen single dose (N = 53, mean age 48\u00b114), or Comirnaty 30 mcg 2-dose series (N = 50, mean age 50\u00b118) at least 12 weeks prior to enrolment and who reported no history of SARS -CoV -2 infection received a booster dose of Comirnaty (30 mcg) . The boost with Comirnaty induced a 36, 12, and 20 GMR -fold rise in neutralising titres following the Janssen, Moderna, and Comirnaty primary doses, respectively. Heterologous boosting with Comirnaty was also evaluated in the study (EudraCT 2021- 002175- 19), a multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial of third dose booster vaccination against COVID -19, in which 107 adult participants (median age 71 years of age, interquartile range 54 to 77 years of age) were randomised at least 70 days post 2 doses of AstraZeneca COVID -19 Vaccine . After the AstraZeneca with heterologous Comirnaty booster (n = 95). Paediat ric population The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID -19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not applicable. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. General toxicity Rats intra muscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekly, generating relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) 114 consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible. Genotoxicity /Carcinogenicity Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential. Reproductive toxicity Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat due to body weight difference s, spanning between pre -mating day 21 and gestational day 20). SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no vaccine -related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo- foetal or offspring development. No Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk. 6.

General recommendations Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and sup ervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine. Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. No further dose of the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of Comirnaty. Myocarditis and pericarditis There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vacci nation, and more often in younger males (see section 4.8) . Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been observed. Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms o f myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this condition. Anxiety -related reactions Anxiety- related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stressrelated reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. Stress -related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. Concurrent illness Vaccinatio n should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low -grade fever should not delay vaccination. 122 Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders As with other intramusc ular injections , the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular admi nistration in these individuals. Immunocompromised individuals The efficacy and safety of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 may be lower in immunocompromised individuals. Duration of protection The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials. Limitations of vaccine effectiveness As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 may not protect all vaccine recipients. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination . 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed. Concomitant administration of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 with other vaccines has not been studied. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 during pregnancy. However, a large amount of observational data from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown an increase in adve rse pregnancy outcomes. While data on pregnancy outcomes following vaccination during the first trimester are presently limited, no increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or post -natal development (see section 5.3). Based on data available with other vaccine variant s, Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA .4-5 can be used during pregnancy. Breast -feeding No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 during breast -feeding. However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of breast -feeding woman to the vaccine is negligible. Observationa l data from women who were breast -feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 can be used during breast -feeding. 123 Fertility Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of safety profile The safety of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 is inferred from safety data f rom Comirnaty and Omicron adapted vaccine s. Comirnaty 30 mcg Participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses In Study 2, a total of 22 026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty and a total of 22 021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respec tively). A total of 20 519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty. At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut -off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo- controlled blinded follow -up period up to the participants' unblin ding dates, a total of 25 651 (58.2%) participants (13 031 Comirnaty and 12 620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15 111 (7 704 Comirnaty and 7 407 placebo) participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10 540 (5 327 Comirnaty and 5 213 placebo) participants 56 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia (> 40%), chills (> 30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (> 10%) and were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age. The safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receivi ng Comirnaty, that were seropositive for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population. Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses In an analysis of long- term safety follow -up in Study 2, 2 260 adolescents (1 131 Comirn aty and 1 129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1 559 adolescents (786 Comirnaty and 773 placebo) have been followed for 4 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. The safety evaluation in Study 2 is ongoing. The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain ( > 90%), fatigue and headache (> 70%), 40%), arthralgia and pyrexia ( > 20%). Participants 16 years of age and older - after booster dose A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the original Comirnaty 2 -dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 6 months (range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, p articipants who received a booster dose, 124 had a median follow -up time of 8.3 months (range 1.1 to 8.5 months) and 301 participants had been followed for 6 months after the booster dose to the cut -off date (22 November 2021). The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia (> 30%), chills a nd arthralgia (> 20%). In Study 4, a placebo- controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5 081 participants), or placebo (5 044 participants) at least 6 months after the se cond dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow -up time of 2. 8 months (range 0.3 to 7.5 months) after the booster dose in the blinded placebo- controlled follow -up period to the cut -off date ( 8 February 2022 ). Of these, 1 281 participants (895 Comirnaty and 386 placebo) have been followed for 4 months after the booster dose of Comirnaty. No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. Booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID- 19 vaccine In 5 independent studies on the use of a Comirnaty booster dose in individuals who had completed primary vaccination with another authorised COVID -19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose), no new safety issues were identified (see section 5.1). Omicron -adapted Comirnaty Participants 12 years of age and older - after a booster dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 (fourth dose) In a subset from Study 5 (Phase 2/3), 107 participants 12 t o 17 years of age , 313 participants 18 t o 55 years of age and 306 participants 56 years of age and older who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) -5 (15/15 m icrograms ) 5.4 to 16.9 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 had a median follow -up time of at least 1.5 months. The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 booster (fourth dose) was similar to that seen after 3 doses.

Most cases appeared to be non -serious and temporary in nature. Description of selected adverse reactions Myocarditis and pericarditis The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see section 4.4). Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12- 29 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the second dose there were 0.5 6 (95% CI 0.37 - 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16 -24 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 4.9 Overdose Overdose data is available from 52 study participants included in the cl inical trial that due to an error in dilution received 58 micrograms of Comirnaty. The vaccine recipients did not report an increase in reactogenicity or adverse reactions. In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN 01 Mechanism of action The nucleoside -modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which enable delivery of the non- replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the SARS -CoV -2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane -anchored, full -length S with two point mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection agai nst COVID -19. 127 Efficacy Omicron -adapted Comirnaty Immunogenicity in participants 12 years of age and older - after the booster ( fourth dose ) In an analysis of a subset from Study 5, 105 participants 12 to 17 years of age, 297 participants 18 to 55 years of age, and 286participants 56 years of age and older who had previously received a 2- dose primary series and booster dose with Comirnaty rece ived a booster (fo urth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5. In participants 12 to 17 years of age, 18 to 55 years of age, and 56 years of age and older, 75.2%, 71.7% and 61.5% were positive for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline, respectively. Analyses of 50% neutralizing antibody tit res (NT50) against Omicron BA.4- 5 and against reference strain among participants 56 years of age and older who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 in Study 5 compared to a subset of participants f rom Study 4 who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty demonstrated superiority of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 to Comirnaty based on geometric mean ratio (GMR) and noninferiority based on difference in seroresponse rates with respect to anti -Omicron BA.4- 5 response, and noninferiority of anti -reference strain immune response based on GMR (Table 2). Analyses of NT50 against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 among participants 18 to 55 years of age compared to participants 56 years of age and older who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 in Study 5 demonstrated noninferiority of anti -Omicron BA.4 -5 response among participants 18 to 55 years of age compared to participants 56 years of age and older for both GMR and difference in seroresponse rates (Table 2). The study also assessed the level of NT50 of the anti -Omicron BA.4- 5 SARS -CoV-2 and reference strains pre- vaccination and 1 month after vaccination in participants who received a booster (fourth dose) (Table 3).

SARS -CoV -2 NT50 were determined using validated 384-well assay platform ( original strain 1/2/3 randomised, placebo- controlled, observer -blind dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the 56-year stratum. The study excluded participants who were immunocompromised and those who had prev ious clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID -19. Participants with pre -existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrolment, were include d as were participants with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV). Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approximately 44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of the initially approved COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessment s of safety and efficacy against COVID -19. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine. In th e clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 60 days before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the study in order to receive either placebo or COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine. The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years of age and older (18 242 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2 through 7 days after the second dose. In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID -19 130 mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older (804 in the COVID -19 mRN A Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group). At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic COVID -19 for in total 2 214 person- years for the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 2 222 person- years in the placebo group. There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at risk of severe COVID -19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID -19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) 30 kg/m 2, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension).

Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow -up duration of > 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. T he point 133 estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0). Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID -19 cases accrued during blinded placebo- controlled follow -up, representing up to 6 months a fter Dose 2 in the efficacy population. In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 1 030 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 30 cases in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0). In Study 2, an analysis of SARS -CoV -2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (n = 190) t o participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170). The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years of age group was 1.76, with a 2- sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5- fold noninferiority criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2- sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was > 0.67. Immunogenicity in participants 18 years of age and older - after booster dose Effectiveness of a booster dose of Comirnaty was based on an assessment of 50% neutralizing antibody titres (NT50) against SARS -CoV -2 (USA_WA1/2020) in Study 2. In this study, the booster dose was administered 5 to 8 months (median 7 months) after the second dose. In Study 2, analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compa red to 1 month after the primary series in individuals 18 through 55 years of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after the booster vaccination demonstrated noninferiority for both geometric mean ra tio (GMR) and difference in seroresponse rates. Seroresponse for a participant was defined as achieving a 4-fold rise in NT50 from baseline (before primary series). These analyses are summarized in Table 7. 134 Table 7.

Relative vaccine efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older - after booster dose An interim efficacy analysis of Study 4, a placebo -controlled booster study performed in approximately 10 000 participants 16 years of age and older who were recruited from Study 2, evaluated confirmed COVID -19 cases accrued from at least 7 days after booster vaccination up to a 135 data cut -off date of 5 October 2021, which represents a median of 2.5 months post -booster follow -up. The booster dose was administered 5 to 13 months (median 11 months) after the second dose. Vaccine efficacy of the Comirnaty booster dose after the primary series relative to the placebo booster group who only received the primary series dose was assessed. The relative vaccine efficacy information for participants 16 years of age and older without prior evidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection is presented in Table 8. Relative vaccine efficacy in participants with or without evidence of prior S ARS -CoV -2 infection was 94.6% (95% confidence interval of 88.5% to 97.9% ), similar to that seen in those participants without evidence of prior infection. Primary COVID -19 cases observed from 7 days after booster vaccination were 7 primary cases in the Comirnaty group, and 124 primary cases in the placebo group. Table 8.

Immunogenicity of a booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID -19 vaccine Effectiveness of a Comirnaty booster dose (30 mcg) in individuals who completed primary vaccination with another authorised COVID -19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose) is inferred from immunogenicity data from an independent National Institutes of Health (NIH) study phase 1/2 open- label clinical trial (NCT04889209) conducted in the United States. In this study, adults (range 19 to 80 years of age) who had completed primary vaccination with Moderna 100 mcg 2 -dose series (N = 51, mean age 54\u00b117), Janssen single dose (N = 53, mean age 48\u00b114), or Comirnaty 30 mcg 2-dose series (N = 50, mean age 50\u00b118) at least 12 weeks prior to enrolment and who reported no history of SARS -CoV -2 infection received a booster dose of Comirnaty (30 mcg). The boost with Comirnaty i nduced a 36, 12, and 20 GMR -fold rise in neutralising titres following the Janssen, Moderna, and Comirnaty primary doses, respectively. Heterologous boosting with Comirnaty was also evaluated in the study (EudraCT 2021- 002175- 19), a multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial of third dose booster 136 vaccination against COVID -19, in which 107 adult participants (median age 71 years of age, interquartile range 54 to 77 years of age) were randomised at least 70 days po st 2 doses of AstraZeneca COVID -19 Vaccine . After the AstraZeneca with heterologous Comirnaty booster (n = 95). Paediatric population The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID -19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not applicable. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. General toxicity Rats intramuscularly admin istered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekly, generating relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible. Genotoxicity /Carcinogenicity Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential. Reproductive toxicity Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat due to body weight difference s, spanning between pre -mating day 21 and gestational day 20). SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no vaccine -related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo- foetal or offspring development. No Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk. 6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (5/5 micrograms)/dose -19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside modified) 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION This is a multidose vial with an orange cap and must be diluted before use. One vial (1.3 mL) contains 10 doses of 0.2 mL after dilution, see sections 4.2 and 6.6. One dose (0.2 mL) co ntains 5 micrograms of tozinameran and 5 micrograms of famtozinameran, COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine (embedded in lipid nanoparticles). Tozinameran is a single -stranded, 5'- capped messenger RNA (mRNA) produced using a cell- free in vitro transcription from the corresponding DNA templates, encoding the viral spike (S) protein of SARS -CoV -2 (Original). Famtozinameran is a single -stranded, 5'- capped messenger RNA (mRNA) produced using a cell- free in vitro transcription from the corresponding DNA templates, encoding the viral spike (S) protein of SARS -CoV -2 (Omicron BA.4-5). For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Concentrate for dispersion for injection (sterile concentrate). The vaccine is a white to off- white frozen dispersion (pH: 6.9 - 7.9). 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (5/5 micrograms)/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID -19 caused by SARS -CoV -2, in children aged 5 to 11 years. The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 is administered intramuscularly after dilution as a single dose of 0.2 mL for children 5 to 11 years of age regardless of prior COVID -19 vaccination status (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 143 For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID- 19 vaccine, Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 should be administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a COVID -19 vaccine. Severely immunocompromised aged 5 years and older Additional doses may be administered to individuals who are severely immunocompromised in accordance with national recommendations (see section 4.4). Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 (5/5 micrograms)/dose should be used only for children 5 to 11 years of age. Paediatric population There are paediatric formulation s available for infants and children aged 6 months to 4 years. For details, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for other formulations . The safety and efficacy of the vaccine in infants aged less than 6 months have not yet been established. Method of administration Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 (5/5 micrograms)/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection should be administered intramuscularly after dilution (see 6.6). After dilution, vials of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 contain 10 doses of 0.2 mL of vaccine. In order to extract 10 doses from a single vial, low dead- volume syringes and/or needles should be used. The low dead -volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of no more than 35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract 10 doses from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle: Each dose mu st contain 0.2 mL of vaccine. If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.2 mL, discard the vial and any excess volume. Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. The preferred site is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally. The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4. For instructions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 4.4 Special warnings and precautio ns for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 144 General recommendations Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine. Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recom mended following vaccination. No further dose of the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of Comirnaty. Myocarditis and pericarditis There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males (see section 4.8) . Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been observed. Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. Healthcare pr ofessionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this condition. Anxiety -related reactions Anxiety- related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stressrelated reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. Stress -related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Indivi duals should be advised to bring symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. Concurrent illness Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low -grade fever should not delay vaccination. Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders As with other intramuscular injections , the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals. Immun ocompromised individuals The efficacy and safety of the vaccine has not been assessed in individuals with weakened immune systems, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 may be lower in indiv iduals with weakened immune systems. 145 Duration of protection The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials. Limitations of vaccine effectiveness As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 may not protect all vaccine recipients. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination . 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed. Concomitant administration of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 with other vaccines has not been studied. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 during pregnancy. However, a large amount of observational data from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown an increase in adverse pregnancy ou tcomes. While data on pregnancy outcomes following vaccination during the first trimester are presently limited, no increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or post -natal development (see section 5.3). Based on data available with other vaccine variants, Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 can be used during pregnancy. Breast -feeding No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 during breast -feeding. However, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of breast -feeding woman to the vaccine is negligible. Observational data from women who were breast -feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 can be used during breast -feeding. Fertility Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. 146 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of safety profile The safety of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 is inferred from sa fety data from Comirnaty and Omicron adapted vaccine s. Comirnaty Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after 2 doses In Study 3, a total of 3 109 children 5 to 11 years of age received at least 1 dose of the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine 10 mcg and a total of 1 538 children 5 to 11 years of age received placebo. At the time of the analysis of Study 3 Phase 2/3 with data up to the cut -off date of 20 May 2022, 2 206 (1 481 Comirnaty 10 mcg and 725 placebo) children have been followed for 4 months after the second dose in the placebo- controlled blinded follow -up period. The safety eval uation in Study 3 is ongoing. The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in participants 5 to 11 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 50%), headache (> 30%), injection site redness and swelling ( 20%), myalgia , chills , and diarrhoea (> 10%). Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after booster dose In a subset from Study 3, a total of 401 children 5 to 11 years of age received a booster dose of Comirnaty 10 mcg at least 5 months (range of 5 to 9 months) after completing the primary series. The analysis of the Study 3 Phase 2/3 subset is based on data up to the cut-off date of 22 March 2022 (median follow -up time of 1.3 months). The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after the primary course. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age were injection sit e pain (> 70%), fatigue (> 40%), headache (> 30%), myalgia, chills, injection site redness and swelling (> 10%). Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses In an analysis of long- term safety follow -up in Study 2, 2 260 adolescents (1 131 Comirnaty and 1 129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1 559 adolescents (786 Comirnaty and 773 placebo) have been followed for 4 months after the second dose. The safety evaluation in Study 2 is ongoing. The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain ( > 90%), fatigue and he adache (> pyrexia ( > 20%). Participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses In Study 2, a total of 22 026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty 30 mcg and a total of 22 021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 20 519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty. At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut -off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo- controlled blinded follow -up period up to the participants' unblinding dates, a total of 25 651 (58.2%) participants (13 031 Comirnaty and 12 620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15 111 (7 704 Comirnaty and 7 407 placebo) participant s 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10 540 (5 327 Comirnaty and 5 213 placebo) participants 56 years of age and older. 147 The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia (> 40%), chills (> 30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (> 10%) and were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age. The safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receiving Comirnaty, that were seropositive for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population. Participants 16 years of age and older - after booster dose A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 yea rs of age who completed the original Comirnaty 2 -dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 6 months (range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow -up time of 8.3 months (range 1.1 to 8.5 months) and 301 participants had been followed for 6 months after the booster dose to the cut -off date (22 November 2021). The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most fre quent adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia (> 30%), chills and arthralgia (> 20%). In Study 4, a placebo- controlled booster study, participants 16 years of ag e and older recruited from Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5 081 participants), or placebo (5 044 participants) at least 6 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow -up time of 2. 8 months (range 0.3 to 7.5 months) after the booster dose in the blinded placebo- controlled follow -up period to the cut -off date ( 8 February 2022 ). Of these, 1 281 participants (895 Comirnaty and 386 placebo) have been followed for 4 months after the booster dose of Comirnaty. No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. Booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID -19 vacc ine In 5 independent studies on the use of a Comirnaty booster dose in individuals who had completed primary vaccination with another authorised COVID -19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose), no new safety issues were identified. Omicron -adapted Comirnaty Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after the booster (fourth dose) In a subset from Study 6 (Phase 3), 113 participants 5 t o 11 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 (5/5 mcg) 2. 6 to 8.5 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 had a median follow -up time of at least 1.6 months. The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 booster (fourth dose) was similar to that seen after 3 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 5 to 11 years of age were injection site pain (> 60%), fatigue (> 40%), headache (> 20%), and muscle p ain (> 10%). Participants 12 years of age and older - after a booster dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 (fourth dose) In a subset from Study 5 (Phase 2/3), 107 participants 12 t o 17 years of age , 313 participants 18 t o 55 years of age and 306 participants 56 years of age and older who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comi rnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 (15/15 mcg) 5.4 to 16.9 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 had a median follow -up time of at least 1.5 months. The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 booster (fourth dose) was similar to that seen after 3 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 12 years of age and older were injection site pain (> 60%), fatigue (> 50%), headache (> 40%), muscle pain (> 20%), chills (> 10%) , and joint pain (> 10%). 148 Tabulated list of adverse reactions from clinical studies of Comirnaty and Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 and post -authorisation experience of Comirnaty in individuals 5 years of age and older Adverse reactions observed during clinical studies are list ed below according to the following frequency categories: Very common ( 1/10), Common ( 1/100 1/100), Rare ( 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000), Very rare (< 1/10 000), Not known (cannot be estimated from the available da ta).

In participants 5 years of age and older, a higher frequency of lymphadenopathy was reported after a booster ( 2.8%) dose than after primary ( 0.9%) doses of the vaccine. b. The frequency category for urticaria and angioedema was rare. c. Through the clinical trial safety follow -up period to 14 November 2020, acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) was reported by four participants in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group. Onset was Day 37 after Dose 1 (participant did not receive Dose 2) and Days 3, 9, and 48 after Dose 2. No cases of acute periphe ral facial paralysis (or palsy) were reported in the placebo group. d. Adverse reaction determined post -authorisation. e. Refers to vaccinated arm. f. A higher frequency of pyrexia was observed after the second dose compared to the first dose. g. Facial swelling in vaccine recipients with a history of injection of dermatological fillers has been reported in the post - marketing phase. h. Injection site redness occurred at a higher frequency (very common) in children 5 to 11 years of age. i. Most case s appeared to be non -serious and temporary in nature. Description of selected adverse reactions Myocarditis and pericarditis The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see section 4.4). Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI 0.255 - 0.275) extra cas es of myocarditis in 12- 29 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the second dose there were 0.56 ( 95% CI 0.37 - 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16 -24 year old males per 10 000 compared t o unexposed persons. Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspecte d adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the nationa l reporting system listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 4.9 Overdose Overdose dat a is available from 52 study participants included in the clinical trial that due to an error in dilution received 58 micrograms of Comirnaty. The vaccine recipients did not report an increase in reactogenicity or adverse reactions. 150 In the event of overd ose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01 Mechanism of action The nucleoside -modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which enable delivery of the non- replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the SARS -CoV -2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane -anchored, full -length S with two point mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an antigenically preferred prefusion conformat ion. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against COVID -19. Efficacy Omicron -adapted Comirnaty Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 t o less than 12 years of age) - after the booster (fourth dose) In an analysis of a subset from Study 6, 103 participants 5 to 11 years of age who had previously received a 2 -dose primary series and booster dose with Comirnaty received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5. Results include immunogenicity data from a comparator subset of participants 5 to 11 years of age in Study 3 who received 3 doses of Comirnaty . In participants 5 to 11 years of age who rec eived a fourth dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 and parti cipants 5 to 11 years of age who received a third dose of Comirnaty, 57.3% and 58.4% were positive for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline, respectively. The immune response 1 month after a booster dose (fourth dose) , Comirnaty Original/Omicron titr es compared with the titres in the comparator g roup who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 also elicited similar reference strain -specific titr es compared with the titr es in the comparator group. The vaccine immunogenicity results after a booster dose in participants 5 t o 11 years of age are presented in Table 2. 151 Table 2.

SARS -CoV -2 NT50 were determined using validated 384-well assay platform ( original strain randomised, placebo -controlled, observer -blind dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and olde r, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the 56-year stratum. The study excluded 154 participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID -19. Participants with pre -existing stable disease, defin ed as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV). Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approximately 44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of the initially approved COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vacci nation. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID -19. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a m inimum interval of 60 days before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the study in order to receive either placebo or COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine. The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years of age and older (18 242 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2 through 7 days after the second dose. In addit ion, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older (804 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group). At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic COVID -19 for in total 2 214 person- years for the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 2 222 person- years in the placebo group. There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at risk of severe COVID -19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID -19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) 30 kg/m 2, chronic pulmonary disease, di abetes mellitus, hypertension).

In the updated efficacy analysis, efficacy of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing first COVID -19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2 compared to placebo was 91.1% (95% CI of 88.8% to 93.0%) during the period when Wuhan/Wild type and Alpha variant s were the predominant circulating strain s in participants in the eval uable efficacy population with or without evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2. Additionally, the updated efficacy analyses by subgroup showed similar efficacy point estimates across sexes, ethnic groups, geography and participants with medical comorbidities and obesity associated with high risk of severe COVID -19. Efficacy against severe COVID -19 Updated efficacy analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing severe COVID19. As of 13 March 2021, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID -19 is presented only for participants with or without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection (Table 7) as the COVID -19 case counts in participants without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection were the same as those in participan ts with or without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection in both the COVID- 19 mRNA Vaccine and placebo groups. 157 Table 7.

Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow -up duration of > 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 ca ses in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0). Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional con firmed COVID -19 cases accrued during blinded placebo- controlled follow -up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population. In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of prior inf ection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 158 1 030 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominan t circulating strain . In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 30 cases in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0). In Study 2, an analysis of SARS -CoV -2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170). The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years of age group was 1.76, with a 2- sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5- fold noninferiority criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2- sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was > 0.67. Efficacy and immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after 2 doses Study 3 is a Phase 1/2/3 study comprised of an open- label vaccine dose- finding portion (Phase 1) and a multicentre, multinational, randomised, saline placebo -controlled, observer -blind efficacy p ortion (Phase 2/3) that has enrolled participants 5 to 11 years of age. The majority (94.4%) of randomised vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Initial descriptive vaccine efficacy results in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior SARS -CoV -2 infection are presented in Table 8. No cases of COVID -19 were observed in either the vaccine group or the placebo group in participants with evidence of prior SARS -CoV -2 infection. Table 8.

In the efficacy analysis of Study 3 in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were 10 cases in 2 703 participants who received the vaccine and 42 cases out of 1 348 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 88.2% (95% confidence interval 76.2, 94.7) during the period when Delta variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 12 cases in the 3 018 who recei ved vaccine and 42 cases in 1 511 participants who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 85.7% (95% confidence interval 72.4, 93.2). In Study 3, an analysis of SARS -CoV -2 50% neutralising titres (NT50) 1 month after Dose 2 in a randomly sel ected subset of participants demonstrated effectiveness by immunobridging of immune responses comparing children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 3 to participants 16 to 25 years of age in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 2 who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, meeting the prespecified immunobridging criteria for both the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and the seroresponse difference with serore sponse defined as achieving at least 4 -fold rise in SARS -CoV -2 NT50 from baseline (before Dose 1). The GMR of the SARS -CoV -2 NT50 1 month after Dose 2 in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) to that of young adults 16 to 25 years of age was 1.04 (2 -sided 95% CI: 0.93, 1.18). Among participants without prior evidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, 99.2% of children 5 to 11 years of age and 99.2% of participants 16 to 25 years of age had a seroresponse at 1 month after Dose 2. The difference in proportions of participants who had seroresponse between the 2 age groups (children - young adult) was 0.0% (2- sided 95% CI: - 2.0%, 2.2%).

Effectiveness of a booster dose in ages 5 to 11 is inferred by immunogenicity. The immunogenicity of this was assessed through NT50 against the reference strain of SARS -CoV -2 (USA_WA1/2020) . Analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to before the booster dose demonstrated a substantial increase in GMTs in individuals 5 through 11 years of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after the dose 2 and the booster dose.

Paediatric population The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID -19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not applicable. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. General toxicity Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekl y, generating relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) 162 consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible. Genotoxicity /Carcinogenicity Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids and mRNA) are not expect ed to have genotoxic potential. Reproductive toxicity Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat due to body weight differences, spanning between pre -mating day 21 and gestational day 20). SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in m aternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no vaccine -related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo- foetal or offspring development. No Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk. 6.

The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 is administered intramuscularly as a single dose of 0.3 mL for children 5 to 11 years of age regardless of prior COVID -19 vaccination status (see sectio ns 4.4 and 5.1). 171 For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID- 19 vaccine, Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 should be administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a COVID -19 vaccine. Severely immunocompromised aged 5 years and older Additional doses may be administered to individuals who are severely immunocompromised in accordance with national recommendations (see section 4.4). Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 (5/5 micrograms )/dose should be used only for children 5 to 11 years of age. Paediatric population There are paediatric formulation s available for infants and children aged 6 months to 4 years. For details, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for other formulations . The safety and efficacy of the vaccine in infants aged less than 6 months have not yet been established. Method of administration Comirnaty Original/Omicron B A.4-5 (5/5 micrograms )/dose dispersion for injection be administered intramuscularly (see section 6.6). Do not dilute prior to use. The preferred site is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally. The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4. For instructions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6. Single dose vials Single dose v ials of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 contain 1 dose of 0.3 mL of vaccine. Withdraw a single 0.3 mL dose of C omirnaty Origin al/Omicron BA.4 -5. Discard vial and any excess volume. Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. contain 6 doses of 0.3 mL of vaccine. In order to extract 6 doses from a single vial, low dead- volume syringes and/or needles should be used. The low dead- volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of no more than 35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle: Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine. If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 mL, discard the vial and any excess vo lume. Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. 172 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. General recommendations Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropria te medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine. Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. No further dose of the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of Comirnaty. Myocarditis and pericarditis There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males (see section 4.8) . Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been observed. Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or s pecialists to diagnose and treat this condition. Anxiety -related reactions Anxiety- related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stressrelated reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alteration s in blood pressure, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. Stress -related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring symptoms to the attention o f the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. Concurrent illness Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low -grade fever should not delay vaccination. Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders As with other intramuscular injections , the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoa gulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as 173 haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals. Immunocompromised individuals The efficacy and safety o f the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 may be lower in immunocompromised individuals. Duration of protection The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials. Limitations of vaccine effectiveness As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 may not protect all vaccine recipi ents. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination . 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed. Concomitant administration of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 with other vaccines has not been studied. 4.6 Fertility, p regnancy and lactation Pregnancy No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 during pregnancy. However, a large amount of observational data from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown an increase in adverse pregnancy out comes. While data on pregnancy outcomes following vaccination during the first trimester are presently limited, no increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, em bryo/foetal development, parturition or post -natal development (see section 5.3). Based on data available with other vaccine variant s, Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA .4-5 can be used during pregnancy. Breast -feeding No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 during breast -feeding. However, n o effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of breast -feeding woman to the vaccine is negligible. Observational data from women who were breast -feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 can be used during breast -feeding. Fertility Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 174 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of safety profile The safety of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 is inferred from safety dat a from Comirnaty and Omicron adapted vaccine s. Comirnaty Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after 2 doses In Study 3, a total of 3 109 children 5 to 11 years of age received at least 1 dose of the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine 10 mcg and a total of 1 538 children 5 to 11 years of age received placebo. At the time of the analysis of Study 3 Phase 2/3 with data up to the cut -off date of 20 May 2022, 2 206 (1 481 Comirnaty 10 mcg and 725 placebo) children have been followed for 4 months after the second dose in the placebo- controlled blinded follow -up period. The safety eval uation in Study 3 is ongoing. The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in participants 5 to 11 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 50%), headache (> 30%), injection site redness and swelling ( 20%), myalgia , chills , and diarrhoea (> 10%). Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after booster dose In a subset from Study 3, a total of 401 children 5 to 11 years of age received a booster dose of Comirnaty 10 mcg at least 5 months (range of 5 to 9 months) after completing the primary series. The analysis of the Study 3 Phase 2/3 subset is based on data up to the cut -off date of 22 March 2022 (median follow -up time of 1.3 months). The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after the primary course. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age were injection site pain (> 70%), fatigue (> 40%), headache (> 30%), myalgia, chills, in jection site redness and swelling (> 10%). Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses In an analysis of long- term safety follow -up in Study 2, 2 260 adolescents (1 131 Comirnaty and 1 129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1 559 adolescents (786 Comirnaty and 773 placebo) have been followed for 4 months after the second dose. The safety evaluation in Study 2 is ongoing. The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in participant s 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain ( > 90%), fatigue and headache (> 70%), 40%), arthralgia and pyrexia ( > 20%). Participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses In Study 2, a total of 22 026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty 30 mcg and a total of 22 021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 20 519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty. At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut -off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo- controlled blinded follow -up period up to the participants' unblinding dates, a total of 25 651 (58.2%) 175 participants (13 031 Comirnaty and 12 620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for 4 months after the second dose . This included a total of 15 111 (7 704 Comirnaty and 7 407 placebo) participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10 540 (5 327 Comirnaty and 5 213 placebo) participants 56 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia (> 40%), chills (> 30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (> 10%) and were usually mild or mode rate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age. The safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receiving Comirnaty, that were seropo sitive for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population. Participants 16 years of age and older - after booster dose A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the original Comirnaty 2- dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 6 months (range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow -up time of 8.3 months (range 1.1 to 8.5 months) and 301 participants had been followed for 6 months after the booster dose to the cut -off date (22 November 2021). The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia (> 30%), chills a nd arthralgia (> 20%). In Study 4, a placebo- controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5 081 participants), or placebo (5 044 participants) at least 6 months after the se cond dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow -up time of 2. 8 months (range 0.3 to 7.5 months) after the booster dose in the blinded placebo- controlled follow -up period to the cut -off date ( 8 February 2022 ). Of these, 1 281 participants (895 Comirnaty and 386 placebo) have been followed for 4 months after the booster dose of Comirnaty. No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. Booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID- 19 vaccine In 5 independent studies on the use of a Comirnaty booster dose in individuals who had completed primary vaccination with another authorised COVID -19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose), no new safety issues were identified. Omicron -adap ted Comirnaty Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after the booster (fourth dose) In a subset from Study 6 (Phase 3), 113 participants 5 to 11 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 (5/5 mcg) 2.6 to 8.5 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 had a median follow -up time of at least 1.6 months. The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 booster (fourth dose) was similar to that seen after 3 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 5 to 11 years of age were injection site pain (> 60%), fatigue (> 40%), heada che (> 20%), and muscle pain (> 10%). Participants 12 years of age and older - after a booster dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 (fourth dose) In a subset from Study 5 (Phase 2/3), 107 participants 12 to 17 years of age, 313 participants 18 to 55 years of age and 306 participants 56 years of age and older who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comi rnaty Origin al/Omicron BA.4 -5 (15/15 mcg) 5.4 to 16.9 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 had a median follow -up time of at least 1.5 months. 176 The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 booster (fourth dose) was similar to that seen after 3 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 12 years of age and older were injection site pain (> 60%), fatigue (> 50%), headache (> 40%), muscle pain ( > 20%), chills (> 10%) , and joint pain (> 10%). Tabulated list of adverse reactions from clinical studies of Comirnaty and Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 and post -authorisation experience of Comirnaty in individuals 5 years of age and older Adverse reactions observed during clinical studies are listed below according to the following frequency categories: Very common ( 1/10), Common ( 1/100 1/100), Rare ( 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000), Very rare (< 1/10 000), Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

The frequency category for urticaria and angioedema was rare. c. Through the clinical trial safety follow -up period to 14 November 2020, acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) was reported by four participants in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group. Onset was Day 37 after Dose 1 (participant did not receive Dose 2) and Days 3, 9, and 48 after Dose 2. No cases of acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) were reported in the placebo group. d. Adverse reaction determined post -authorisation. e. Refers to vaccinated arm. f. A higher frequency of pyrexia was observed after the second dose compared to the first dose. g. Facial swelling in vaccine recipients with a history of injection of dermatological fillers has been reported in the post -marketing phase. h. Injection site redness occurred at a higher frequency (very common) in children 5 to 11 years of age. i. Most cases appeared to be non -serious and temporary in nature. Description of selected adverse reactions Myocarditis and pericarditis The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see section 4.4). Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the secon d dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12- 29 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the second dose there were 0.5 6 (95% CI 0.37 - 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16 -24 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in children age d 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal prod uct. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 4.9 Overdose Overdose data is available from 52 study p articipants included in the clinical trial that due to an error in dilution received 58 micrograms of Comirnaty. The vaccine recipients did not report an increase in reactogenicity or adverse reactions. In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital funct ions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended. 178 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01 Mechanism of action The nucleoside -modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which enable delivery of the non- replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the SARS -CoV -2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane -anchored, full -length S with two point mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to pr otection against COVID -19. Efficacy Omicron -adapted Comirnaty Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after the booster (fourth dose) In an analysis of a subset from Study 6, 103 participants 5 to 11 years of age who had previously received a 2 -dose primary series and booster dose with Comirnaty received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5. Results include immunogenicity data from a comparator subset of participants 5 to 11 yea rs of age in Study 3 who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. In participants 5 to 11 years of age who received a fourth dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 and participants 5 to 11 years of age who received a third dose of Comirnaty, 57.3% and 58.4% were positive for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline, respectively. The immune response 1 month after a booster dose (fourth dose), Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 elicited generally titres compared with the titres in the comparator group who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 also elicited similar reference strain -specific titres compared with the titres in the comparator group. The vaccine immunogenicity results after a booster dose in part icipants 5 to 11 years of age are presented in Table 2. 179 Table 2.

SARS -CoV -2 NT50 were determined using idated 384-well assay platform ( original randomised, placebo- controlled, observer -blind dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the 56-year stratum. The study excluded 182 participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVI D-19. Participants with pre -existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV). Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approxim ately 44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of the initially approved COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID -19. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 60 days before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the study in order to receive either placebo or COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine. The population for the analysis of the primary e fficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years of age and older (18 242 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2 through 7 days after the second dose. In additi on, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older (804 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group). At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic COVID -19 for in total 2 214 person- years for the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 2 222 person- years in the placebo group.

In the updated efficacy analysis, efficacy of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing first COVID -19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2 compared to placebo was 91.1% (95% CI of 88.8% to 93.0%) during the period when Wuhan/Wild type and Alpha variants were the predominant circulating strains in participants in the evaluable effic acy population with or without evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2. Additionally, the updated efficacy analyses by subgroup showed similar efficacy point estimates across sexes, ethnic groups, geography and participants with medical comorbidities and obesity associated with high risk of severe COVID -19. Efficacy against severe COVID -19 Updated efficacy analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing severe COVID19. As of 13 March 2021, vac cine efficacy against severe COVID -19 is presented only for participants with or without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection (Table 7) as the COVID -19 case counts in participants without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection were the same as those in participants with or with out prior SARS -CoV -2 infection in both the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine and placebo groups. 185 Table 7.

Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow -up duration of > 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 1 110 participants who received placebo. This als o indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0). Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID -19 cases accrued during blinded placebo- controlled follow -up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population. 186 In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 1 030 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 30 cases in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0). In Study 2, an analysis of SARS -CoV -2 neutralising titres 1 month a fter Dose 2 was conducted in a randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (n = 190) to partici pants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170). The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years of age group was 1.76, with a 2- sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5- fold noninferiority criterion wa s met as the lower bound of the 2- sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was > 0.67. Efficacy and immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after 2 doses Study 3 is a Phase 1/2/3 study comprised of an open- label vaccine dose- finding portion (Phase 1) and a multicentre, multinational, randomised, saline placebo -controlled, observer -blind efficacy portion (Phase 2/3) that has enrolled participants 5 to 11 years of age. The majority (94.4%) of randomised vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Initial descriptive vaccine efficacy results in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior SARS -CoV -2 infection are presented in Table 8. No cases of COVID- 19 were observed in either the vaccine group or the placebo group in participants with evidence of prior SARS -CoV -2 infection. Table 8.

In the efficacy analysis of Study 3 in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were 10 cases in 2 703 participants who received the vaccine and 42 cases out of 1 348 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 88.2% (95% conf idence interval 76.2, 94.7 ) during the period when Delta variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or wit hout evidence of prior infection there were 12 cases in the 3 018 who received vaccine and 42 cases in 1 511 participants wh o received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 85.7% (95% confidence interval 72.4, 93.2 ). In Study 3, an analysis of SARS -CoV -2 50% neutralising titres (NT50) 1 month after Dose 2 in a randomly selected subset of participants demonstrated effecti veness by immunobridging of immune responses comparing children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 3 to participants 16 to 25 years of age in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 2 who had no serological or vir ological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, meeting the prespecified immunobridging criteria for both the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and the seroresponse difference with seroresponse defined as achieving at least 4 -fold rise in SARS -CoV -2 NT50 from baseline (before Dose 1). The GMR of the SARS -CoV -2 NT50 1 month after Dose 2 in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) to that of young adults 16 to 25 years of age was 1.04 (2 -sided 95% CI: 0.93, 1.18). Among participants without prior evidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, 99.2% of children 5 to 11 years of age and 99.2% of participants 16 to 25 years of age had a seroresponse at 1 month after Dose 2. The difference in proportions of participants who had seroresponse between the 2 age groups (children - young adult) was 0.0% (2- sided 95% CI: - 2.0%, 2.2%). This information is presented in Table 9. Table 9.

Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after booster dose A booster dose of Comirnaty was given to 401 randomly selected participants in Study 3. Effectiveness of a booster dose in ages 5 to 11 is inferred by immunogenicity. The immunogenicity of this was assessed through NT50 against the reference strain of SARS -CoV -2 (USA_WA1/2020) . Analyses of NT50 1 month after the boost er dose compared to before the booster dose demonstrated a substantial increase in GMTs in individuals 5 through 11 years of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after the dose 2 and the booster dose. This analysis is summarized in Table 10. Table 10.

Paediatric population The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID -19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not applicable. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. General toxicity Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekl y, generating relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible. Genotoxicity /Carcinogenicity Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids and mRNA) are not expect ed to have genotoxic potential. Reproductive toxicity Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat due to body weight differences, spanning between pre -mating day 21 and gestational day 20). SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in m aternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no vaccine -related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo- foetal or offspring development. No Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk. 6.

Famtozinameran is a single-stranded, 5'- capped messenger RNA (mRNA) produced using a cell- free in vitro transcription from the corresponding DNA templates, encoding the viral spike (S) protein of SARS -CoV -2 (Omicron BA.4-5). For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Concentrate for dispersion for injection (sterile concentrate). The vaccine is a white to off-white frozen dispersion (pH: 6.9 - 7.9). 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (1.5/1.5 micrograms)/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID -19 caused by SARS- CoV -2, in infants and children aged 6 months to 4 years. The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology Infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age without history of completion of a COVID-19 primary course or prior SARS -CoV-2 infection Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (1.5/1.5 micrograms)/dose is administered intramuscularly after dilution as a primary course of 3 doses (0.2 mL each). It is recommended to administer the second dose 3 weeks after the first dose followed by a third dose administered at least 8 weeks after the second dose (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 196 If a child turns 5 years old between their doses in the primary course, he/she should complete the primary course at the same 3 micrograms or 1.5/1.5 micrograms dose level. Infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age with history of completion of a COVID -19 primary course or prior dilution as a single dose of 0.2 mL for infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age. For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID- 19 vaccine, Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 should be administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a COVID -19 vaccine. Severely immunocompromi sed aged 6 months to 4 years Additional doses may be administered to individuals who are severely immunocompromised in accordance with national recommendations (see section 4.4) . Interchangeability The primary course may consist ) but not exceeding the total number of doses required as primary course. The primary course should only be administered once. The interchangeability of Comirnaty with COVID -19 vaccines from other manufacturers has not been established. Paediatric population There are paediatric formulation s available for children 5 to 11 years of age. For details, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for other formulations . The safety and efficacy of the vaccine in inf ants aged less than 6 months have not yet been established. Method of administration Comirnat y Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 (1.5/1.5 micrograms)/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection should be administered intramuscularly after dilution (see 6.6). After dilution, vials of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 contain 10 doses of 0.2 mL of vaccine. In order to extract 10 doses from a single vial, low dead- volume syringes and/or needles should be used. The low dead -volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of no more than 35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract 10 doses from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle: Each dose must contain 0.2 mL of vaccine. If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.2 mL, discard the vial and any excess volume. Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. In infants from 6 to less than 12 months of age, the recommended injection site is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. In individuals 1 year of age and older, the recommended injection site is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh or the deltoid muscle. Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally. 197 The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4. For instructions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active subst ance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. General recommendations Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine. Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recom mended following vaccination. No further dose of the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of Comirnaty. Myocarditis and pericarditis There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males (see section 4.8) . Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been observed. Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. Healthcare pr ofessionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this condition. Anxiety -related reactions Anxiety- related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stressrelated reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpi tations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. Stress -related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. 198 Concurrent illness Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low -grade fever should not delay vaccination. Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders As with other intramuscular injections , the vaccine should be given with ca ution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals. Immunocompromised individuals The efficacy and safety of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 may be lower in immunocompromised individuals . Duration of protection The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials. Limitations of vaccine effectiveness As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 may not protect all vaccine recipients. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination . 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed. Concomitant administration of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 with other vaccines has not been studied. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 (1.5/1.5 micrograms)/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is not i ntended for individuals older than 5 years of age. For details for use in individuals older than 5 years of age, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for those formulations . 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive, cycle, and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive, cycle, or use machines. 199 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of safety profile The safety of a dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 is inferred from safety data from Comirnaty and Omicron adapted vaccine s. Comirnaty Infants 6 to 23 months of age - after 3 doses In an analysis of Study 3 (Phase 2/3), 1 776 infants ( 1 178 initially approved Comirnaty 3 mcg and 598 placebo) were 6 to 23 months of age. B ased on data in the blinded placebo- controlled follow -up period up to the cut -off date of 29 April 2022, 570 infants 6 to 23 months of age who received a 3-dose primary course (386 Comirnaty 3 mcg and 184 placebo) have been followed for a median of 1.3 months after the third dose. The most frequent adverse reactions in infants 6 to 23 months of age that received any primary course dose included irritability (> 60%), drowsiness (> 40%), decreased appetite (> 30%), tenderness at the injection site (> 20%), injection site redness and fever (> 10%).

A slightly lowe r frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age. The safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receiving Comirnaty, that were seropositive for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general populati on. Participants 16 years of age and older - after booster dose A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the original Comirnaty 2 -dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 6 months (range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow -up time of 8.3 months (range 1.1 to 8.5 months) and 301 participants had been followed for 6 months after t he booster dose to the cut -off date (22 November 2021). The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia (> 30%), chills and arthralgia (> 20%). In Study 4, a placebo- controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5 081 participants), or pl acebo (5 044 participants) at least 6 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow -up time of 2.8 months (range 0.3 to 7.5 months) after the booster dose in the blinded placebo- controlled follow -up period to the cut -off date (8 February 2022). Of these, 1 281 participants (895 Comirnaty and 386 placebo) have been followed for 4 months after the booster dose of Comirnaty. No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. Booster dos e following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID -19 vaccine In 5 independent studies on the use of a Comirnaty booster dose in individuals who had completed primary vaccination with another authori sed COVID- 19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose), no new safety issues were identified. 201 Omicron -adapted Comirnaty Infants 6 to 23 months of age - after the booster (fourth dose) In a subset from Study 6 (Phase 3), 39 participants 6 to 23 months of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 (1.5/1.5 mcg) 2.1 to 8.6 months after receiving Dose 3.

Irritability, injection site tenderness, and drowsiness pertain to participants 6 to 23 months of age. l. Most cases appeared to be non -serious and temporary in nature. Description of selected adverse reactions Myocarditis and pericarditis The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see section 4.4). Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12- 29 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the second dose there were 0.56 ( 95% CI 0.37 - 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16 -24 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 4.9 Overdose Overdose data is available from 52 study participants included in the clinical trial that due to an error in dilution received 58 micrograms of Comirnaty. The vaccine recipients did not report an increase in reactogenicity or adverse reactions. In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended. 204 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01 Mechanism of action The nucleoside -modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which enable d elivery of the non- replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the SARS -CoV -2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane -anchored, full -length S with two point mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proli ne locks S in an antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against COVID -19. Efficacy Omicron -adapted Comirnaty Immunogenicity in infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age - after the booster (fourth dose) In an analysis of a subset from Study 6, 60 participants 6 months to 4 years of age received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 (1.5/1.5 mcg) after receiving 3 prior doses of Comirnaty 3 micrograms dose concentrate for dispersion. Results include immunogenicity data from a comparator subset of participants 6 months to 4 years of age in Study 3 who received 3 doses of Comirnaty 3 micrograms dose concentrate for dispersion. At 1 month after a booster dose (fourth dose), a booster dose with Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 titres (regardless of baseline SARS -CoV -2 status) compared with the titres in the comparator group who received 3 doses of Comirnaty 3 micrograms dose concentrate for dispersion. Comirnaty Original/Omicron also strain -specific titres compared with the titres in the comparator group. The vaccine immunogenicity results after a booster dose in participants 6 months to 4 years of age are presented in Table 2. 205 Table 2 .

Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after the booster (fourth dose) In an analysis of a subset from Study 6, 103 participants 5 to 11 years of age who had previously received a 2 -dose primary series and booster dose with Comirnaty received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5. Results include immunogenicity data from a comparator subset of participant s 5 to 11 years of age in Study 3 who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. In participants 5 to 11 years of age who received a fourth dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 and participants 5 to 11 years of age who received a third dose of Comirnaty, 57.3% and 58.4% were positive for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline, respectively. The immune response 1 month after a booster dose (fourth dose), Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 elicited generally titres compared with the titres in the comparator group who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 also elicited similar reference strain -specific titres compared with the titres in the comparator group.

SARS -CoV -2 NT50 were determined using validated 384-well assay platform ( original strain randomised, placebo- controlled, observer -blind dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the 56-year stratum. The study excluded 209 participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVI D-19. Participants with pre -existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV). Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approxim ately 44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of the initially approved COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their fi rst vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID -19. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to ob serve a minimum interval of 60 days before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the study in order to receive either placebo or COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine. The population for the analysis of the primary effi cacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years of age and older (18 242 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2 through 7 days after the second dose. In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older (804 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo gr oup). At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic COVID -19 for in total 2 214 person- years for the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 2 222 person- years in the placebo group. There were no meaningful clin ical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at risk of severe COVID -19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID -19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) 30 kg/m 2, chronic pulmonary diseas e, diabetes mellitus, hypertension).

Additionally, the updated efficacy analyses by subgroup showed similar efficacy point estimates across sexes, ethnic groups, geography and participants with medical comorbiditi es and obesity associated with high risk of severe COVID -19. Efficacy against severe COVID -19 Updated efficacy analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing severe COVID19. As of 13 March 2021, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID -19 is presented only for participants with or without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection (Table 8) as the COVID -19 case counts in participants without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection were the same as those in participants with or without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection in both the COVID- 19 mRNA Vaccine and placebo groups.

Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow -up duration of > 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0). Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID -19 cases accrued during blinded placebo- controlled follow -up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population. In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 1 030 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 100.0) during the period when Alpha variant w as the predominant circulating strain . In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 30 cases in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0). In Study 2, an analysis of SARS -CoV -2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170). The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years of age group was 1.76, w ith a 2 -sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5- fold noninferiority criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2- sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was > 0.67. Efficacy and immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after 2 doses Study 3 is a Phase 1/2/3 study comprised of an open- label vaccine dose- finding portion (Phase 1) and a multicentre, multinational, randomised, saline placebo -controlled, observer -blind efficacy portion (Phase 2/3) that has enrolled participants 5 to 11 years of age. The majority (94.4%) of randomised vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. 213 Initial descriptive vaccine efficacy results in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior SARS -CoV -2 infection are presented in Table 9. No cases of COVID -19 were observed in either the vaccine group or the placebo group in participants with evidence of prior SARS -CoV -2 infection. Table 9.

Pre-specified hypothesis -driven efficacy analysis was performed with additional confirmed COVID -19 cases accrued during blinded placebo- controlled follow -up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population. In the efficacy analysis of Study 3 in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were 10 cases in 2 703 participants who received the vaccine and 42 cases out of 1 348 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 88.2% (95% confidence interval 76.2, 94.7) during the period when Delta variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 12 cases in the 3 018 who recei ved vaccine and 42 cases in 1 511 participants who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 85.7% (95% confidence interval 72.4, 93.2). In Study 3, an analysis of SARS -CoV -2 50% neutralising titres (NT50) 1 month after Dose 2 in a randomly sel ected subset of participants demonstrated effectiveness by immunobridging of immune responses comparing children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 3 to participants 16 to 25 years of age in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 2 who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, meeting the prespecified immunobridging criteria for both the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and the seroresponse difference with serore sponse defined as achieving at least 4 -fold rise in SARS -CoV -2 NT50 from baseline (before Dose 1). The GMR of the SARS -CoV -2 NT50 1 month after Dose 2 in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) to that of young adults 16 to 25 years of age was 1.04 (2 -sided 95% CI: 0.93, 1.18). Among participants without prior evidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, 99.2% of children 5 to 11 years of age and 99.2% of participants 16 to 25 years of age had a 214 seroresponse at 1 month after Dose 2. The difference in proportions of participants who had seroresponse between the 2 age groups (children - young adult) was 0.0% (2- sided 95% CI: - 2.0%, 2.2%). This information is presented in Table 10. Table 10.

Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after booster dose A booster dose of Comirnaty was given to 401 randomly selected participants in Study 3. Effectiveness of a booster dose in ages 5 to 11 is inferred by immunogenicity. The immunogenicity of this was assessed through NT50 against the reference strain of SARS -CoV -2 (USA_WA1/2020) . Analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to before the booster dose demonstrated a substantial increase in GMTs in individuals 5 through 11 years of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after the dose 2 and the booster dose.

Two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for VE is derived based on the Clopper and Pearson method adjusted for surveillance time. Vaccine efficacy in participants with or without prior S ARS -CoV -2 infection was similar to those participants without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection. Severe COVID -19 criteria (as described in the protocol, based on FDA definition and modified for children) were fulfilled for 12 cases (8 COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine and 4 placebo) among participants 6 months to 4 years of age. Among participants 6 months through 23 months of age, severe COVID -19 criteria were fulfilled for 3 cases (2 COVID- 19 mRNA Vaccine and 1 placebo). Immunogenicity analyses have been performed in the immunobridging subset of 82 Study 3 participants 6 to 23 months of age and 143 Study 3 participants 2 to 4 years of age without evidence of infection up to 1 month after Dose 3 based on a data cut -off date of 29 April 2022. SARS -CoV -2 50% neutralising antibody titres (NT50) were compared between an immunogenicity subset of Phase 2/3 participants 6 to 23 months of age and 2 to 4 years of age from Study 3 at 1 month after the 3 -dose primary course and a randomly selected subset from Study 2 P hase 2/3 participants 16 to 25 years of age at 1 month after the 2- dose primary course, using a microneutralisation assay against the reference strain (USA_WA1/2020). The primary immunobridging analyses compared the geometric mean titres (using a geometr ic mean ratio [GMR]) and the seroresponse (defined as achieving at least 4 -fold rise in SARS -CoV -2 NT50 from before Dose 1) rates in the evaluable immunogenicity population of participants without evidence of prior SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 3 in participants 6 to 23 months of age and 2 to 4 years of age and up to 1 month after Dose 2 in participants 16 to 25 years of age.

Paediatric population The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID -19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not applicable. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. General toxicity Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekl y, generating relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible. Genotoxicity /Carcinogenicity Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids and mRNA) are not expect ed to have genotoxic potential. Reproductive toxicity Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to matin g and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat due to body weight differences, spanning between pre -mating day 21 and gestational day 20). SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no vaccine -related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo- foetal or offspring development. No Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk. 219 6.

For instructions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6. Single dose vials Single dose vials of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 contain 1 dose of 0.3 mL of va ccine. Withdraw a single 0.3 mL dose of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5. Discard vial and any excess volume. Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. Multidose vials Multidose vials of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 contain 6 doses of 0.3 mL of vaccine. In order to extract 6 doses from a single vial, low dead- volume syringes and/or needles should be used. The low dead -volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of no more than 35 microlitres. If s tandard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle: Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine. If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 mL, discard the vial and any excess volume. Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 229 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. General recommendations Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine. Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. No further dose of the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of Comirnaty. Myocarditis and pericarditis There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males (see section 4.8) . Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been observed. Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immedi ate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this condition. Anxiety -related reactions Anxiety- related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stressrelated reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alteratio ns in blood pressure, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. Stress -related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. Concurrent illness Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low -grade fever should not delay vaccination. Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders As with other intramuscular injections , the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals. 230 Immunocompromised individuals The efficacy and safety of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 may be lower in immunocompromised individuals. Duration of protec tion The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials. Limitations of vaccine effectiveness As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 may not protect all vaccine recipients. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination . 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interacti on No interaction studies have been performed. Concomitant administration of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 with other vaccines has not been studied. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 during pregnancy. However, a large amount of observational data from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown an increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes. While data on pregnancy outcomes following vaccination during the first trimester are presently limited, no increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indi rect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or post -natal development (see section 5.3). Based on data available with other vaccine variants, Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 can be used during pregnancy. Breast -feeding No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 during breast -feeding. However, n o effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of breast -feeding woman to the vaccine is negligible. Observational data from women who were breast -feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 can be used during breast-feeding. Fertility Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 has no or negligible influence o n the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. 231 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of safety profile The safety of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 is inferred from safety data of the prior Comirnaty vaccines . Comirnaty 30 mcg Participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses In Study 2, a total of 22 026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine and a total of 22 021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vac cine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 20 519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty. At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut -off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo- controlled blinded follow -up period up to the participants' unblinding dates, a total of 25 651 (58.2%) participants (13 031 Comirnaty and 12 620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15 111 (7 704 Comirnaty and 7 407 placebo) participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10 540 (5 327 Comirnaty and 5 213 placebo) participants 56 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia (> 40%), chills (> 30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (> 10%) and were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age. The safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receiving Comirnaty, that were seropositive for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population. Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses In an analysis of long- term safety follow -up in Study 2, 2 260 adolescents (1 131 Comirnaty and 1 129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1 559 adolescents (786 Comirnaty and 773 placebo) have been followed for 4 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. The safety evaluation in Study 2 is ongoing. The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain ( > 90%), fatigue and headache (> 70%), myalgia 40%), arthralgia and p yrexia ( > 20%). Participants 12 years of age and older - after booster dose The safety of a booster dose of Comirnaty in participants 12 years of age and older is inferred from safety data from studies of a booster dose of Comirnaty in participants 16 years of age and older. A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the original Comirnaty 2 -dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 6 months (range of 4.8 to 8.0 m onths) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow -up time of 8.3 months (range 1.1 to 8.5 months) and 301 participants had been followed for 6 months after the booster dose to the cut -off date (22 Novem ber 2021). The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia (> 30%), chills and arthralgia (> 20%). 232 In Study 4, a placebo- controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5 081 participants), or placebo (5 044 participants) at least 6 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow -up time of 2.8 months (range 0.3 to 7.5 months) after the booster dose in the blinded placebo- controlled follow -up period to the cut -off date (8 Febr uary 2022). Of these, 1 281 participants (895 Comirnaty and 386 placebo) have been followed for 4 months after the booster dose of Comirnaty. No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. Participants 12 years of age and older - after subsequent booster doses The safety of a booster dose of Comirnaty in participants 12 years of age and older is inferred from safety data from studies of a booster dose of Comirnaty in participants 18 years of age and older. A subset of 325 adults 18 to 55 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 90 to 180 days after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty had a median follow -up time of 1.4 months up to a data cut -off date of 11 March 2022. The most frequent adverse reactions in these participants were injection site pain (> 70%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia and chills (> 20%), and arthralgia (> 10%). In a subse t from Study 4 (Phase 3), 305 adults > 55 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 5 to 12 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty had a median follow -up time of at least 1.7 months up to a data cut -off date of 16 May 2022. The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty booster (fourth dose) was similar to that seen after the Comirnaty booster (third dose). The most frequent adverse reactions in par ticipants > 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 60%), fatigue (> 40%), headache (> 20%), myalgia and chills (> 10%). Booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID -19 vaccine In 5 independent studies on the use of a Co mirnaty booster dose in individuals who had completed primary vaccination with another authorised COVID -19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose), no new safety issues were identified (see section 5.1). Omicron -adapted Comirnaty Participants 12 years of age and older - after a booster dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 (fourth dose) In a subset from Study 5 (Phase 2/3), 107 participants 12 to 17 years of age, 313 participants 18 to 55 years of age and 306 participants 56 years of age and o lder who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) -5 (15/15 m icrograms ) 5.4 to 16.9 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 had a median follow -up time of at least 1.5 months. The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 booster (fourth dose) was similar to that seen after 3 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 12 years of age and older were injection site pain (> 60%), fatigue (> 50%), headache (> 40%), muscle pain (> 20%), chills (> 10%), and joint pain (> 10%). 233 Tabulated list of adverse reactions from clinical studies of Comirnaty and Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 and post -authorisation experience of Comirnaty in individuals 12 years of age and older Adverse reactions observed during clinical studies are listed below according to the following frequency categori es: Very common ( 1/100), Rare ( 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000), Very rare (< 1/10 000), Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

In participants 5 years of age and older, a higher frequency of lymphadenopathy was reported after a booster ( 2.8%) dose than after primary ( 0.9%) doses of the vaccine. b. The frequency category for urticaria and angioedema was rare. c. Through the clinical trial safety follow -up period to 14 November 2020, acute peripheral facial paralysis (o r palsy) was reported by four participants in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group. Onset was Day 37 after Dose 1 (participant did not receive Dose 2) and Days 3, 9, and 48 after Dose 2. No cases of acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) were reported in the placebo group. d. Adverse reaction determined post -authorisation. e. Refers to vaccinated arm. f. A higher frequency of pyrexia was observed after the second dose compared to the first dose. g. Facial swelling in vaccine recipients with a history of injection of dermatological fillers has been reported in the post-marketing phase. h. Most cases appeared to be non -serious and temporary in nature. Description of selected adverse reactions Myocarditis and pericarditis The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see section 4.4). Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that i n a period of 7 days after the second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12- 29 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the second dose there were 0.56 (95% CI 0.37 - 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16 -24 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactio ns via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 4.9 Over dose Overdose data is available from 52 study participants included in the clinical trial that due to an error in dilution received 58 micrograms of Comirnaty. The vaccine recipients did not report an increase in reactogenicity or adverse reactions. 235 In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, code: J07BN01 Mechan ism of action The nucleoside -modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which enable delivery of the non- replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the SARS -CoV -2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane -anchored, full -length S with two point mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and cellular immun e responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against COVID -19. Efficacy Omicron -adapted Comirnaty Immunogenicity in participants 12 years of age and older - after the booster (fourth dose) In an analysis of a subset from Study 5, 105 participants 12 to 17 years of age, 297 participants 18 to 55 years of age, and 286participants 56 years of age and older who had previously received a 2- dose primary series and booster dose with Comirnaty received a booster (fourth dose) o f Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5. In participants 12 to 17 years of age, 18to 55 years of age, and 56 years of age and older, 75.2%, 71.7% and 61.5% were positive for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline, respectively. Analyses of 50% neutralizing antibody titres (NT50) against Omicron BA.4- 5 and against reference strain among participants 56 years of age and older who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 in Study 5 compared to a subset of participants from Study 4 who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty demonstrated superiority of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 to Comirnaty based on geometric mean ratio (GMR) and noninferiority based on difference in seroresponse rates with respect to anti -Omicron BA.4- 5 response , and noninferiority of anti -reference strain immune response based on GMR (Table 2). Analyses of NT50 against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 among participants 18 to 55 years of age compared to participants 56 years of age and older who received a booster (fourth dos e) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 in Study 5 demonstrated noninferiority of anti -Omicron BA.4 -5 response among participants 18 to 55 years of age compared to participants 56 years of age and older for both GMR and difference in seroresponse rates (Table 2). The study also assessed the level of NT50 of the anti -Omicron BA.4- 5 SARS -CoV-2 and reference strains pre- vaccination and 1 month after vaccination in participants who received a booster (fourth dose) (Table 3). 236 Table 2.

SARS -CoV -2 NT50 were determined using 384-well assay platform ( original strain 1/2/3 randomised, placebo- controlled, observer -blind dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age 238 and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the 56-year stratum. The study excluded participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVI D-19. Participants with pre -existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV). Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approximately 44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of the initially approved COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID -19. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine. In the clinical study, partic ipants were required to observe a minimum interval of 60 days before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the study in order to receive either placebo or COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine. The population for the an alysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years of age and older (18 242 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2 through 7 days after the second dose. In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older (804 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group). At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic COVID -19 for in total 2 214 person- years for the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 2 222 person- years in the placebo group. There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at risk of severe COVID -19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID -19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) 30 kg/m 2, chroni c pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension).

In the updated efficacy analysis, efficacy of COVID -19 mRNA Va ccine in preventing first COVID -19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2 compared to placebo was 91.1% (95% CI of 88.8% to 93.0%) during the period when Wuhan/Wild type and Alpha variants were the predominant circulating strains in participants in the evalua ble efficacy population with or without evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2. Additionally, the updated efficacy analyses by subgroup showed similar efficacy point estimates across sexes, ethnic groups, geography and participants with medical como rbidities and obesity associated with high risk of severe COVID -19. Efficacy against severe COVID -19 Updated efficacy analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing severe COVID19. As of 13 March 2021, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID -19 is presented only for participants with or without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection (Table 6) as the COVID -19 case counts in participants without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection were the same as those in participants with or without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection in both the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine and placebo groups. 241 Table 6.

Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow -up duration of > 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 005 partici pants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who rece ived vaccine and 18 cases in 1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0). Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID -19 cases accrued during blinded placebo- controlled follow -up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population. In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were no cas es in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 242 1 030 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 30 cases in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0). In Study 2, an analysis of SARS -CoV -2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, co mparing the response in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170). The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years of age group was 1.76, with a 2- sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5- fold noninferiority criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2- sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was > 0.67. Immunogenicity in participants 18 years of age and older - after booster dose Effectiveness of a booster dose of Comirnaty was based on an assessment of 50% neutralizing antibody titres (NT50) against SARS -CoV -2 (USA_WA1/2020) in Study 2. In this study, the booster dose was administered 5 to 8 months (median 7 months) after the seco nd dose. In Study 2, analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to 1 month after the primary series in individuals 18 through 55 years of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after the booster vaccination demonstrated noninferiority for both geometric mean ratio (GMR) and difference in seroresponse rates. Seroresponse for a participant was defined as achieving a 4-fold rise in NT50 from baseline (before primary series). These analyses are summarized in Table 7. Table 7.

Relative vaccine efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older - after booster dose An interim efficacy analysis of Study 4, a placebo- controlled booster study performed in approximately 10 000 participants 16 years of age and older who were recruited from Study 2, evaluated confirmed COVID -19 cases accrued from at least 7 days after booster vaccination up to a data cut -off date of 5 October 2021, which represents a median of 2.5 months post -booster follow -up. The booster dose was administered 5 to 13 months (median 11 months) after the second dose. V accine efficacy of the Comirnaty booster dose after the primary series relative to the placebo booster group who only received the primary series dose was assessed. The relative vaccine efficacy information for participants 16 years of age and older without prior evidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection is presented in Table 8. Relative vaccine efficacy in participants with or without evidence of prior SARS -CoV -2 infection was 94.6% (95% confidence interval of 88.5% to 97.9%), similar to that seen in those participants without evidence of prior infection. Primary COVID -19 cases observed from 7 days after booster vaccination were 7 primary cases in the Comirnaty group, and 124 primary cases in the placebo group. Table 8.

Immunogenicity of a booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID -19 vaccine Effectiveness of a Comirnaty booster dose (30 mcg) in individuals who completed primary vaccination with another authorised COVID -19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose) is inferred from immunogenicity data from an independent National Institutes of Health ( NIH) study phase 1/2 open- label clinical trial (NCT04889209) conducted in the United States. In this study, adults (range 19 to 80 years of age) who had completed primary vaccination with Moderna 100 mcg 2 -dose series (N = 51, mean age 54\u00b117), Janssen single dose (N = 53, mean age 48\u00b114), or Comirnaty 30 mcg 2-dose series (N = 50, mean age 50\u00b118) at least 12 weeks prior to enrolment and who reported no history of SARS -CoV -2 infection received a booster dose of Comirnaty (30 mcg). The boost with Comirnaty induced a 36, 12, and 20 GMR -fold rise in neutralising titres following the Janssen, Moderna, and Comirnaty primary doses, respectively. Heterologous boosting with Comirnaty was also evaluated in the study (EudraCT 2021- 002175- 19), a multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial of third dose booster vaccination against COVID -19, in which 107 adult participants (median age 71 years of age, interquartile range 54 to 77 years of age) were randomised at least 70 days post 2 doses of AstraZeneca COVID -19 Vaccine . After heterologous Comirnaty booster (n = 95). Immunogenicity in participants > 55 years of age - after a booster dose (fourth dose) of Comirnaty (30 mcg) In an interim analysis of a subset from Study 4 (Substudy E), 305 participants > 55 years of age who had completed a series of 3 doses of Comirnaty received Comirnaty (30 mcg) as a booster dose (fourth dose) 5 to 12 months after receiving Dose 3. For the I mmunogenicity subset data see Table 7. Immunogenicity in participants 18 to 55 years of age - after a booster dose (fourth dose) of Comirnaty (30 mcg) In Substudy D [a subset from Study 2 (Phase 3) and Study 4 (Phase 3)], 325 participants 18 to 55 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty received Comirnaty (30 mcg) as a booster dose (fourth dose) 90 to 180 days after receiving Dose 3. For the Immunogenicity subset data see Table 9. Table 9.

Paediatric population The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID -19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not applicable. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. 246 General toxicity Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekl y, generating relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible. Genotoxicity /Carcinogenicity Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential. Reproductive toxicity Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a c ombined fertility and developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat due to body weight differences , spanning between pre -mating day 21 and gestational day 20). SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no vaccine- related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo- foetal or offspring development. No Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk. 6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 10 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside modified) 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION This is a multidose vial with an orange cap and must be diluted before use. One vial (1.3 mL) contains 10 doses of 0.2 mL after dilution, see sections 4.2 and 6.6. One dose (0.2 mL) co ntains 10 micrograms of raxtozinameran , a COVID- 19 mRNA lipid nanoparticles). Raxtozinameran is a single -stranded, 5'- capped messenger RNA (mRNA) produced using a cell -free in vitro transcription from the corresponding DNA templates, encoding the viral spike (S) protein of SARS -CoV -2 (Omicron XBB.1.5). For the full list of excipients, see sec tion 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Concentrate for dispersion for injection (sterile concentrate). The vaccine is a white to off-white frozen dispersion (pH: 6.9 - 7.9). 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 10 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID -19 caused by SARS -CoV -2, in children aged 5 to 11 years. The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 10 micrograms /dose is administered intramuscularly after dilution as a single dose of 0.2 mL for children 5 to 11 years of age regardless of prior COVID-19 vaccination status (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID- 19 vaccine, Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 should be administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a COVID -19 vaccine. 253 Severely immunocompromised aged 5 years and older Additional doses may be administered to individuals who are severely immunocompromised in accordance with national recommendations (see section 4.4). Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 10 micrograms /dose should be used only for children 5 to 11 years of age. Paediatric population There are paediatric formulation s available for infants and children aged 6 months to 4 years. For details, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for other formulations. The safety and efficacy of the vaccine in infants aged less than 6 months have not yet been established. Method of administration Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 10 micrograms /dose concentrate for dispersion for injection should be administered intramuscularly after dilution (see section 6.6). After dilution, vials of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 contain 10 doses of 0.2 mL of vaccine. In order to extract 10 doses fro m a single vial, low dead- volume syringes and/or needles should be used. The low dead- volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of no more than 35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient vol ume to extract 10 doses from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle: Each dose must contain 0.2 mL of vaccine. If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.2 mL, discard the vial and any excess volume. Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. The preferred site is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. Do not inject the vac cine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally. The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4. For instructions re garding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 254 General recommendations Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis Events of anaphylaxis ha ve been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine. Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccina tion. No further dose of the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of Comirnaty. Myocarditis and pericarditis There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males (see section 4.8) . Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been observed. Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myoca rditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this condition. Anxiety -related reacti ons Anxiety- related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stressrelated reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. Stress -related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. Concurrent illness Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low -grade fever should not delay va ccination. Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders As with other intramuscular injections , the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haem ophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals. Immunocompromised individuals The efficacy and safety of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 may be lower in immunocompromised individuals. 255 Duration of prote ction The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials. Limitations of vaccine effectiveness As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 may not protect all vaccine recipients. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination . 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed. Concomitant administration of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 with other vaccines has not been studied. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 during pregnancy. However, a large amount of observational data from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown an increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes. While data on pregnancy outcomes following vacc ination during the first trimester are presently limited, no increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or post -natal development (see section 5.3). Based on data available with other vaccine variants, Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 can be used during pregnancy. Breast -feeding No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 during breast -feeding. However, n o effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of breast -feeding woman to the vaccine is negligible. Observational data from women who were breast -feeding after vaccination with the init ially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 can be used during breast -feeding. Fertility Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respec t to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of safety profile The safety of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 is inferred from safety data of the prior Comirnaty vaccine . 256 Comirnaty Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after 2 doses In Study 3, a total of 3 109 children 5 to 11 years of age received at least 1 dose of the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine 10 mcg and a total of 1 538 children 5 to 11 years of age received placebo. At the time of the analysis of Study 3 Phase 2/3 with data up to the cut -off date of 20 May 2022, 2 206 (1 481 Comirnaty 10 mcg and 725 placebo) children have been followed for 4 months after the second dose in the placebo- controlled blinded follow -up period. The safety evaluation in Study 3 is ongoing. The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in participants 5 to 11 years of age was similar to that seen in partici pants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 50%), headache (> 30%), injection site redness and swelling ( 20%), myalgia, chills, a nd diarrhoea (> 10%). Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after booster dose In a subset from Study 3, a total of 401 children 5 to 11 years of age received a booster dose of Comirnaty 10 mcg at least 5 months (range of 5 to 9 months) after completing the primary series. The analysis of the Study 3 Phase 2/3 subset is based on data up to the cut -off date of 22 March 2022 (median follow -up time of 1.3 months). The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after the primary course. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age were injection site pain (> 70%), fatigue (> 40%), headache (> 30%), myalgia, chills, in jection site redness and swelling (> 10%). Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses In an analysis of long- term safety follow -up in Study 2, 2 260 adolescents (1 131 Comirnaty and 1 129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1 559 adolescents (786 Comirnaty and 773 placebo) have been followed for 4 months after the second dose. The safety evaluation in Study 2 is ongoing. The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain ( > 90%), fatigue and headache (> 70%), > 20% ). Participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses In Study 2, a total of 22 026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty 30 mcg and a total of 22 021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 20 519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty. At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut -off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo- controlled blinded follow -up period up to the participants' unblinding dates, a total of 25 651 (58.2%) participants (13 031 Comirnaty and 12 620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15 111 (7 704 Comirnaty and 7 407 placebo) participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10 540 (5 327 Comirnaty and 5 213 placebo) participants 56 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in pa rticipants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia (> 40%), chills (> 30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (> 10%) and were usually mild or modera te in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age. The safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receiving Comirnaty, that were seroposi tive for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population. 257 Participants 16 years of age and older - after booster dose A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the original Comirnaty 2 -dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 6 months (range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow -up time of 8.3 months (range 1.1 to 8.5 months) and 301 participants had been followed for 6 months after the booster dose to the cut -off date (22 November 2021). The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in p articipants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia (> 30%), chills and arthralgia (> 20%). In Study 4, a placebo- controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5 081 participants), or placebo (5 044 participants) at least 6 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow -up time of 2.8 mo nths (range 0.3 to 7.5 months) after the booster dose in the blinded placebo- controlled follow -up period to the cut -off date (8 February 2022). Of these, 1 281 participants (895 Comirnaty and 386 placebo) have been followed for 4 months after the booster dose of Comirnaty. No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. Booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID -19 vaccine In 5 independent studies on the use of a Comirnaty booster dose in individuals who had completed primary vaccination with another authori sed COVID- 19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose), no new safety issues were identified. Omicron -adapted Comirnaty Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after the booster (fourth dose) In a subset from Study 6 (Phase 3), 113 participants 5 to 11 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 (5/5 mcg) 2.6 to 8.5 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 had a median follow -up time of at least 1.6 months. The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 booster (fourth dose) was similar to that seen after 3 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 5 to 11 years of age were injection site pain (> 60%), fatigue (> 40%), h eadache (> 20%), and muscle pain (> 10%). Participants 12 years of age and older - after a booster dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 (fourth dose) In a subset from Study 5 (Phase 2/3), 107 participants 12 to 17 years of age, 313 participants 18 t o 55 years of age and 306 participants 56 years of age and older who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comi rnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 (15/15 mcg) 5.4 to 16.9 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 had a median follow -up time of at least 1.5 months. The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 booster (fourth dose) was similar to that seen after 3 doses. T he most frequent adverse reactions in participants 12 years of age and older were injection site pain (> 60%), fatigue (> 50%), headache (> 40%), muscle pain (> 20%), chills (> 10%) , and joint pain (> 10%). 258 Tabulated list of adverse reactions from clini cal studies of Comirnaty and Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 and post -authorisation experience of Comirnaty in individuals 5 years of age and older Adverse reactions observed during clinical studies are listed below according to the following frequency categories: Very common ( 1/10), Common ( 1/100 1/100), Rare ( 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000), Very rare (< 1/10 000), Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

The frequency category for urticaria and angioedema was rare. c. Through the clinical trial safety follow -up period to 14 November 2020, acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) was reported by four participants in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group. Onset was Day 37 after Dose 1 (participant did not receive Dose 2) and Days 3, 9, and 48 after Dose 2. No cases of acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) were reported in the placebo group. d. Adverse reaction determined post -authorisation. e. Refers to vaccinated arm. f. A higher frequency of pyrexia was observed after the second dose compared to the first dose. g. Facial swelling in vaccine recipients with a history of injection of dermatological fillers has been reported in the post - marketing phase. h. Injection site redness occurred at a higher frequency (very common) in children 5 to 11 years of age. i. Most cases appeared to be non -serious and temporary in nature. Description of selected adverse reactions Myocarditis and pericarditis The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see section 4.4). Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the second dose there were about 0.2 65 (95% CI 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12- 29 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the second dose there were 0.56 (95% CI 0.37 - 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16 -24 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 4.9 Overdose Overdose data is available from 52 study participants included in the clinical trial that due to an error in dilution received 58 micrograms of Comirnaty. The vaccine recipients did not report an increase in reactogenicity or adverse reactions. In the ev ent of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended. 260 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01 Mechanism of action The nucleoside -modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which enable delivery of the non- replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the SARS -CoV -2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane -anchored, full -length S with two point mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses to the spik e (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against COVID -19. Efficacy Omicron -adapted Comirnaty Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after the booster (fourth dose) In an analysis of a subset from Study 6, 103 participants 5 to 11 years of age who had previously received a 2 -dose primary series and booster dose with Comirnaty received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omi cron BA.4- 5. Results include immunogenicity data from a comparator subset of participants 5 to 11 years of age in Study 3 who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. In participants 5 to 11 years of age who received a fourth dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 and participants 5 to 11 years of age who received a third dose of Comirnaty, 57.3% and 58.4% were positive for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline, respectively. The immune response 1 month after a booster dose (fourth dose), Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 elicited generally titres compared with the titres in the comparator group who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 also elicited similar reference strain -specific titres compared with the titres in the comparator group. The vaccine immunogenicity results after a booster dose in participants 5 to 11 years of age are presented in Table 2. 261 Table 2.

In participants 12 through 17 years of age, 18through 55 years of age, and 56 years of age and older, 75.2%, 71.7% and 61.5% were posit ive for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline, respectively. Analyses of 50% neutralizing antibody titres (NT50) against Omicron BA.4- 5 and against reference strain among participants 56 years of age and older who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 in Study 5 compared to a subset of participants from Study 4 who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty demonstrated superiority of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 to Comirnaty based on geometric mean ratio (GMR) and noninf eriority based on difference in seroresponse rates with respect to anti -Omicron BA.4- 5 response, and noninferiority of anti -reference strain immune response based on GMR (Table 3). Analyses of NT50 against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 among participants 18 through 55 years of age compared to participants 56 years of age and older who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 in Study 5 demonstrated noninferiority of anti -Omicron BA.4 -5 response among participants 18 through 55 years of age compared to participants 56 years of age and older for both GMR and difference in seroresponse rates (Table 3). 262 The study also assessed the level of NT50 of the anti -Omicron BA.4- 5 SARS -CoV-2 and reference strains pre- vaccination and 1 month after vacc ination in participants who received a booster (fourth dose) (Table 4).

SARS -CoV -2 NT50 were determined using ed 384-well assay platform ( original randomised, placebo- controlled, observer -blind dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the 56-year stratum. The study excluded 264 participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVI D-19. Participants with pre -existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV). Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approxi mately 44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of the initially approved COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID -19. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were requir ed to observe a minimum interval of 60 days before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the study in order to receive either placebo or COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine. The population for the analysis of the prim ary efficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years of age and older (18 242 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2 through 7 days after the second dose. In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older (804 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group). At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic COVID -19 for in total 2 214 person- years for the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 2 222 person- years in the placebo group. There were no meaningful clini cal differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at risk of severe COVID -19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID -19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) 30 kg/m 2, chronic pulmonary disease , diabetes mellitus, hypertension). The vaccine efficacy information is presented in Table 5. Table 5.

Efficacy of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing first COVID -19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2 compared to placebo was 94.6% (95% confidence interval of 89.6% to 97. 6%) in participants 16 years of age and older with or without evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2. Additionally, subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed similar efficacy point estimates across genders, ethnic groups, and partici pants with medical comorbidities associated with high risk of severe COVID -19. Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID -19 cases accrued during blinded placebo- controlled follow -up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population.

In the updated efficacy analysis, efficacy of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing first COVID -19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2 compared to placebo was 91.1% (95% CI of 88.8% to 93.0%) during the period when Wuhan/Wild type and Alpha variants were the predominant circulating strains in participants in the evaluable efficacy population with or without evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2. Additionally, the updated efficacy analyses by subgroup showed similar efficacy point estimates across sexes, ethnic groups, geography and participants with medical comorbidities and obesity associated with high risk of severe COVID -19. Efficacy against severe COVID -19 Updated efficacy analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the COVID- 19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing severe COVID19. As of 13 March 2021, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID -19 is presented only for participants with or without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection (Table 7) as the COVID -19 case counts in participants without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection were the same as those in participants with or without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection in both the COVID- 19 mRNA Vaccine and placebo groups. 267 Table 7.

Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow -up duration of > 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 005 participa nts who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0). Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID -19 cases accru ed during blinded placebo- controlled follow -up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population. In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 268 1 030 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain. In pa rticipants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 30 cases in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0). In Study 2, an analysis of SARS -CoV -2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170). The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years of age group was 1.76, with a 2- sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5- fold noninferiority criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2- sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was > 0.67. Efficacy and immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after 2 doses Study 3 is a Phase 1/2/3 study comprised of an open- label vaccine dose- finding portion (Phase 1) and a multicentre, multinational, randomised, saline placebo -controlled, observer -blind efficacy portion (Phase 2/3) that has enrolled participants 5 to 11 years of age. The majority (94.4%) of randomised vaccine recipients receiv ed the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Initial descriptive vaccine efficacy results in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior SARS -CoV -2 infection are presented in Table 8. No cases of COVID -19 were observed in either the vaccine group or the placebo group in participants with evidence of prior SARS -CoV -2 infection. Table 8.

Pre-specified hypothesis -driven efficacy analysis was performed with additional confirmed COVID -19 cases accrued during blinded placebo- controlled follow -up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population. 269 In the efficacy analysis of Study 3 in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were 10 cases in 2 703 participants who received the vaccine and 42 cases out of 1 348 who received placebo. T he point e stimate for efficacy is 88.2% (95% confidence interval 76.2, 94.7) during the period when Delta variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 12 cases in the 3 018 who received vaccin e and 42 cases in 1 511 participants who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 85.7% (95% confidence interval 72.4, 93.2). In Study 3, an analysis of SARS -CoV -2 50% neutralising titres (NT50) 1 month after Dose 2 in a randomly selected subs et of participants demonstrated effectiveness by immunobridging of immune responses comparing children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 3 to participants 16 to 25 years of age in the Phase 2/3 part o f Study 2 who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, meeting the prespecified immunobridging criteria for both the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and the seroresponse difference with seroresponse def ined as achieving at least 4 -fold rise in SARS -CoV -2 NT50 from baseline (before Dose 1). The GMR of the SARS -CoV -2 NT50 1 month after Dose 2 in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) to that of young adults 16 to 25 years of age was 1.04 (2 -sided 95% CI: 0.93, 1.18). Among participants without prior evidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, 99.2% of children 5 to 11 years of age and 99.2% of participants 16 to 25 years of age had a seroresponse at 1 month after Dose 2. The difference in proportions of participants who had seroresponse between the 2 age groups (children - young adult) was 0.0% (2- sided 95% CI: - 2.0%, 2.2%). This information is presented in Table 9. Table 9.

The sample NT50 is defined as the reciprocal serum dilution at which 50% of the virus is neutralised. g. n = Number of participants with seroresponse based on NT50 1 month after Dose 2. h. Exact 2 -sided CI based on the Clopper and Pearson method. i. Difference in proportions, expressed as a percentage (5 to 11 years of age minus 16 to 25 years of age). j. 2-Sided CI, based on the Miettinen and Nurminen method for the difference in proportions, expressed as a percentage. k. Immunobridging based on seroresponse rate is declared if the lower bound of the 2- sided 95% CI for the seroresponse difference is greater than -10.0%. Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after booster dose A booster dose of Comirnaty was given to 401 randomly selected participants in Study 3. Effectiveness of a booster dose in ages 5 to 11 is inferred by immunogenicity. The immunogenicity of this was assessed through NT50 against the reference strain of SARS -CoV -2 (USA_WA1/2020) . Analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to before the booster dose demonstrated a substantial incre ase in GMTs in individuals 5 through 11 years of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after the dose 2 and the booster dose. This analysis is summarized in Table 10. Table 10.

GMRs and 2 -sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean difference of the logarithms of the titres (1 -Month Post -Booster Dose minus 1- Month Post -Dose 2) and the corresponding CI (based on the Student t distribution). Paediatric population The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID -19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not applicable. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. General toxicity Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekly, generating relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (incl uding basophils and eosinophils) consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible. Genotoxicity /Carcinogenicity Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential. Reproductive toxicity Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and developmental toxicit y study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat due to body weight differences, spanning between pre -mating day 21 and ge stational day 20). SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no vaccine -related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo- foetal or offspring development. No Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk. 272 6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 10 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside modified) 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION This is a single dose or a multidose vial with a blue cap. Do not dilute prior to use. One single dose vial contains 1 dose of 0.3 mL, see sections 4.2 and 6.6. One multidose vial (2.25 mL) contains 6 doses of 0.3 mL, see sections 4.2 and 6.6. One dose (0.3 mL) contains 10 micrograms of raxtozinameran , a COVID- 19 mRNA Vaccine lipid nanoparticles). Raxtozinameran is a single -stranded, 5'- capped messenger RNA (mRNA) produced using a cell -free in vitro transcription from the corresponding DNA templates, encoding the viral spike ( S) protein of SARS -CoV -2 (Omicron XBB.1.5). For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Dispersion for injection. The vaccine is a clear to slightly opalescent frozen dispersion (pH: 6.9 - 7.9). 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 10 micrograms/ dose dispersion for injection is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS- CoV -2, in children aged 5 to 11 years. The us e of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 10 micrograms /dose dispersion for injection is administered intramuscularly as a single dose of 0.3 mL for children 5 to 11 years of age regardless of prior COVID -19 vaccination status (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). For individuals who have previously been vac cinated with a COVID- 19 vaccine, Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 should be administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a COVID -19 vaccine. 281 Severely immunocompromised aged 5 years and older Additional doses may be administered to individuals who are severely immunocompromised in accordance with national recommendations (see section 4.4). Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 10 micrograms /dose should be used only for children 5 to 11 years of age. Paediatric population There are paediatric formulation s available for infants and children aged 6 months to 4 years. For details, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for other formulations . The safety and efficacy of the vaccine in infants aged less than 6 months have not yet been established. Method of administration Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 10 micrograms /dose dispersion for injection should be administered intramuscularly (see section 6.6). Do not dilute prior to use. The preferred site is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally. The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4. For instructions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6. Single dose vials Single dose v ials of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 contain 1 dose of 0.3 mL of vaccine. Withdraw a single 0.3 mL dose of C omirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5. Discard vial and any excess volume. Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. Multidose vials Multidose v ials of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 contain 6 doses of 0.3 mL of vaccine. In order to extract 6 doses from a single vial, low dead- volume syringes and/or needles should be used. The low dead -volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of no more than 35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles a re used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle: Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine. If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose o f 0.3 mL, discard the vial and any excess volume. Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 282 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. General recommendations Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine. Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommen ded following vaccination. No further dose of the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of Comirnaty. Myocarditis and pericarditis There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males (see section 4.8) . Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been observed. Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop s ymptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this conditi on. Anxiety -related reactions Anxiety- related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stressrelated reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, paraesthesia, hypoaesthe sia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. Stress -related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. Concurrent illness Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low -grade fever should not delay vaccination. Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders As with other intramuscular injections , the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagula tion disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals. 283 Immunocompromised individuals The efficacy and safety of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 may be lower in immunocompromised individuals. Duration of protection The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials. Limitations of vaccine effectiveness As with any vaccine, vaccination with C omirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 may not protect all vaccine recipients. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination . 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interact ion studies have been performed. Concomitant administration of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 with other vaccines has not been studied. 4.6 Fertility, p regnancy and lactation Pregnancy No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 during pregnancy. However, a large amount of observational data from pregnant women vaccinated with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine during the second and third trimester have not shown an increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes. While data on pregnancy outcomes following vaccination during the first trimester are presently limited, no increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or post -natal development (see section 5.3). Based on data available with other vaccine variant s, Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 can be used during pregnancy. Breast -feeding No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 during breast -feeding. However, n o effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the syste mic exposure of breast -feeding woman to the vaccine is negligible. Observational data from women who were breast -feeding after vaccination with the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine have not shown a risk for adverse effects in breastfed newborns/infants. Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 can be used during breast -feeding. Fertility Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use ma chines. 284 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of safety profile The safety of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 is inferred from safety data of the prior Comirnaty vaccine . Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after 2 doses In Study 3, a total of 3 109 children 5 to 11 years of age received at least 1 dose of the initially approved Comirnaty vaccine 10 mcg and a total of 1 538 children 5 to 11 years of age received placebo. At the time of the analysis of Study 3 Phase 2/3 with data up to the cut -off date of 20 May 2022, 2 206 (1 481 Comirnaty 10 mcg and 725 placebo) children have been followed for 4 months after the second dose in the placebo- controlled blinded follow -up period. The safety evaluation in Study 3 is ongoing. The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in participants 5 to 11 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 50%), headache (> 30%), injection site redness and swelling ( 20%), myalgia , chills , and diarrhoea (> 10%). Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after booster dose In a subset from Study 3, a total of 401 children 5 to 11 years of age received a booster dose of Comirnaty 10 mcg at least 5 months (range of 5 to 9 months) after completing the primary series. T he analysis of the Study 3 Phase 2/3 subset is based on data up to the cut -off date of 22 March 2022 (median follow -up time of 1.3 months). The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after the primary course. The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age were injection site pain (> 70%), fatigue (> 40%), headache (> 30%), myalgia, chills, in jection site redness and swelling (> 10%). Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses In an analysis of long- term safety follow -up in Study 2, 2 260 adolescents (1 131 Comirnaty and 1 129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1 559 adolescents (786 Comirnaty and 773 placebo) have been followed for 4 months after the second dose. The safety evaluation in Study 2 is ongoing. The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection s ite pain ( > 90%), fatigue and headache (> 70%), 40%), arthralgia and pyrexia ( > 20%). Participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses In Study 2, a total of 22 026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty 30 mcg and a total of 22 021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 20 519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty. At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut -off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo- controlled blinded follow -up period up to the participants' unblinding dates, a total of 25 651 (58.2%) participants (13 031 Comirnaty and 12 620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15 111 (7 704 Comirnaty and 7 407 placebo) participant s 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10 540 (5 327 Comirnaty and 5 213 placebo) participants 56 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia (> 40%), chills 285 (> 30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (> 10%) and were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age. The safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receiving Comirnaty, that were seropositive for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population. Participants 16 years of age and older - after booster dose A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the original Comirnaty 2 -dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 6 months (range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow -up time of 8.3 months (range 1.1 to 8.5 months) and 301 participants had been followed for 6 months after the booster dose to the cut -off date (22 November 2021). The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia (> 30%), chills and arthralgia (> 20%). In Study 4, a placebo- controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5 081 participants), or placebo (5 044 participants) at least 6 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow -up time of 2. 8 months (range 0.3 to 7.5 months) after the booster dose in the blinded placebo- controlled follow -up period to the cut -off date ( 8 February 2022 ). Of these, 1 281 participants (895 Comirnaty and 386 placebo) have been followed for 4 months after the booster dose of Comirnaty. No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. Booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID -19 vaccine In 5 independent studies on the use of a Comirnaty booster dose in ind ividuals who had completed primary vaccination with another authorised COVID -19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose), no new safety issues were identified. Omicron -adapted Comirnaty Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after the booster (fourth dose) In a subset from Study 6 (Phase 3), 113 participants 5 to 11 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 (5/5 mcg) 2.6 to 8.5 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 had a median follow -up time of at least 1.6 months. The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 booster (fourth dose) was similar to that seen after 3 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 5 to 11 years of age were injection site pain (> 60%), fatigue (> 40%), headache (> 20%), and muscle pain (> 10%). Participants 12 years of age and older - after a booster dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 (fourth dose) In a subset from Study 5 (Phase 2/3), 107 participants 12 to 17 years of age, 313 participants 18 to 55 years of age and 306 participants 56 ye ars of age and older who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comi rnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 (15/15 mcg) 5.4 to 16.9 months after receiving Dose 3.

Description of selected adverse reactions Myocarditis and pericarditis The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see section 4.4). Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12- 29 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the second dose there were 0.5 6 (95% CI 0.37 - 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16 -24 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in children age d 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspe cted adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 4.9 Overdose Overdose data is available from 52 study p articipants included in the clinical trial that due to an error in dilution received 58 micrograms of Comirnaty. The vaccine recipients did not report an increase in reactogenicity or adverse reactions. In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital funct ions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended. 288 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01 Mechanism of action The nucleoside -modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which enable delivery of the non- replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the SARS -CoV -2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane -anchored, full -length S with two point mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to pr otection against COVID -19. Efficacy Omicron -adapted Comirnaty Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after the booster (fourth dose) In an analysis of a subset from Study 6, 103 participants 5 to 11 years of age who had previously received a 2 -dose primary series and booster dose with Comirnaty received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5. Results include immunogenicity data from a comparator subset of par ticipants 5 to 11 years of age in Study 3 who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. In participants 5 to 11 years of age who received a fourth dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 and participants 5 to 11 years of age who received a third dose of Comirnaty, 57.3% and 58.4% were positive for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline, respectively. The immune response 1 month after a booster dose (fourth dose), Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 elicited generally titres compared with the titres in the comparator group who received 3 doses of Comirnaty. Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 also elicited similar reference strain -specific titres compared with the titres in the comparator group. The vaccine immunogenicity results after a booster dose in participants 5 to 11 years of age are presented in Table 2. 289 Table 2.

SARS -CoV -2 NT50 were determined using validated 384-well assay platform ( original strain randomised, placebo- controlled, observer -blind dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the 56-year stratum. The study excluded participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological 292 diagnosis of COVI D-19. Participants with pre -existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV). Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approxim ately 44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of the initially approved COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their fi rst vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID -19. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to ob serve a minimum interval of 60 days before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the study in order to receive either placebo or COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine. The population for the analysis of the primary effi cacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years of age and older (18 242 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2 through 7 days after the second dose. In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older (804 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo gr oup). At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic COVID -19 for in total 2 214 person- years for the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 2 222 person- years in the placebo group. There were no meaningful clin ical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at risk of severe COVID -19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID -19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) 30 kg/m 2, chronic pulmonary diseas e, diabetes mellitus, hypertension).

In the updated efficacy analysis, efficacy of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing first COVID -19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2 com pared to placebo was 91.1% (95% CI of 88.8% to 93.0%) during the period when Wuhan/Wild type and Alpha variants were the predominant circulating strains in participants in the evaluable efficacy population with or without evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2. Additionally, the updated efficacy analyses by subgroup showed similar efficacy point estimates across sexes, ethnic groups, geography and participants with medical comorbidities and obesity associated with high risk of severe COVID -19. Efficacy against severe COVID -19 Updated efficacy analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing severe COVID19. As of 13 March 2021, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID -19 is presented only for parti cipants with or without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection (Table 7) as the COVID -19 case counts in participants without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection were the same as those in participants with or without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection in both the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine and placebo groups.

Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow -up duration of > 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 1 110 participants who received placebo. This als o indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0). Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID -19 cases accrued during blinded placebo- controlled follow -up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population. In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 1 030 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 296 30 cases in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0). In Study 2, an analysis of SARS -CoV -2 neutralising titres 1 month a fter Dose 2 was conducted in a randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (n = 190) to partici pants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170). The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years of age group was 1.76, with a 2- sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5- fold noninferiority criterion wa s met as the lower bound of the 2- sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was > 0.67. Efficacy and immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after 2 doses Study 3 is a Phase 1/2/3 study comprised of an open- label vaccine dose- finding portion (Phase 1) and a multicentre, multinational, randomised, saline placebo -controlled, observer -blind efficacy portion (Phase 2/3) that has enrolled participants 5 to 11 years of age. The majority (94.4%) of randomised vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Initial descriptive vaccine efficacy results in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior SARS -CoV -2 infection are presented in Table 8. No cases of COVID- 19 were observed in either the vaccine group or the placebo group in participants with evidence of prior SARS -CoV -2 infection. Table 8.

Pre-specified hypothesis -driven e fficacy analys is was performed with additional confirmed COVID -19 cases accrued during blinded placebo- controlled follow -up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population. 297 In the efficacy analysis of Study 3 in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were 10 cases in 2 703 participants who received the vaccine and 42 cases out of 1 348 who received placebo. T he point estimate fo r efficacy is 88.2% (95% confidence interval 76.2, 94.7 ) during the period when Delta variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or wit hout evidence of prior infection there were 12 cases in the 3 018 who received vaccine and 42 c ases in 1 511 participants who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 85.7% (95% confidence interval 72.4, 93.2 ). In Study 3, an analysis of SARS -CoV -2 50% neutralising titres (NT50) 1 month after Dose 2 in a randomly selected subset of part icipants demonstrated effectiveness by immunobridging of immune responses comparing children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 3 to participants 16 to 25 years of age in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 2 who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, meeting the prespecified immunobridging criteria for both the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and the seroresponse difference with seroresponse defined as achieving at least 4 -fold rise in SARS -CoV -2 NT50 from baseline (before Dose 1). The GMR of the SARS -CoV -2 NT50 1 month after Dose 2 in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) to that of young adults 16 to 25 years of age was 1.04 (2 -sided 95% CI: 0.93, 1.18). Among participants without prior evidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, 99.2% of children 5 to 11 years of age and 99.2% of participants 16 to 25 years of age had a seroresponse at 1 month after Dose 2. The difference in proportions of participants who had seroresponse between the 2 age groups (children - young adult) was 0.0% (2- sided 95% CI: - 2.0%, 2.2%). This information is presented in Table 9. Table 9.

Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after booster dose A booster dose of Comirnaty was given to 401 randomly selected participants in Study 3. Effectiveness of a booster dose in ages 5 to 11 is inferred by immunogenicity. The immunogenicity of this was assessed through NT50 against the reference strain of SARS -CoV -2 (USA_WA1/2020) . Analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to before the booster dose demonstrated a substantial increase in GMTs in individuals 5 through 11 years of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after the dose 2 and the booster dose.

Paediatric population The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID -19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not applicable. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. General toxicity Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekl y, generating relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible. Genotoxicity /Carcinogenicity Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential. Reproductive toxicity Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a c ombined fertility and developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat due to body weight differences , spanning between pre -mating day 21 and gestational day 20). SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no vaccine- related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo- foetal or offspring development. No Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk. 300 6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 3 micrograms /dose COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside modified) 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION This is a multidose vial with a maroon cap and must be diluted before use. One vial (0.4 mL) contains 10 doses of 0.2 mL after dilution, see sections 4.2 and 6.6. One dose (0.2 mL) contains 3 micrograms of raxtozinam eran, a COVID- 19 mRNA Vaccine lipid nanoparticles). Raxtozinameran is a single -stranded, 5'- capped messenger RNA (mRNA) produced using a cell -free in vitro transcription from the corresponding DNA templates, encoding the viral spi ke (S) protein of SARS -CoV -2 (Omicron XBB.1.5). For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Concentrate for dispersion for injection (sterile concentrate). The vaccine is a white to off- white frozen dispersion (pH: 6.9 - 7.9). 306 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 3 micrograms /dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID -19 caused by SARS -CoV -2, in infants and childre n aged 6 months to 4 years. The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology Infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age without history of completion of a COVID -19 primary course or prior SARS -CoV-2 infection Comirnaty 3 micrograms /dose is administered intramuscularly after dilution as a primary course of 3 doses (0.2 mL each). It is recommended to administer the second dose 3 weeks after the first dose followed by a third dose administered at least 8 weeks after the second dose (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). If a child turns 5 years old between their doses in the primary course, he/she should complete the primary co urse at the same 3 micrograms dose level. Infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age with history of completion of a COVID -19 primary course or prior SARS -CoV-2 infection Comirnaty 3 micrograms /dose is administered intramuscularly after dilution as a single dose of 0.2 mL for infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age. For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID- 19 vaccine, Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 should be administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a COVID -19 vaccine. Severely immunocompromised aged 6 months to 4 years Additional dose s may be administered to individuals who are severely immunocompromised in accordance with national recommendations (see section 4.4). Interchangeability The primary course may consist of ) but not exceeding the total number of doses required as primary course. The primary course should only be administered once. The interchangeability of Comirnaty with COVID -19 vaccines from other manufacturers has not been established. Paediatric population There are paediatric formulation s available for children 5 to 11 years of age . For details, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for other formulations. The safety and efficacy of the vaccine in infants aged less than 6 months have not yet been established. 307 Method of administration Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 3 micrograms /dose concentrate for dispersion for injection should be administered intramuscularly after dilution (see section 6.6). After dilution, vials of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 contain 10 doses of 0.2 mL of vaccine. In order to extract 10 doses from a single v ial, low dead -volume syringes and/or needles should be used. The low dead- volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of no more than 35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extra ct 10 doses from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle: Each dose must contain 0.2 mL of vaccine. If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.2 mL, discard the vial and any excess volume. Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. In infants from 6 to less than 12 months of age, the recommended injection site is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. In individuals 1 year of age and older, the recommended injection site is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh or the deltoid muscle. Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally. The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4. For instructions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. General recommendations Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine. Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. No further dose of the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of Comirnaty. Myocarditis and pericarditis There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger 308 males (see section 4.8) . Available data indicate that most cases recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been observed. Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this condition. Anxiety -related reactions Anxiety- related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stressrelated reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterati ons in blood pressure, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. Stress -related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. Concurrent illness Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low -grade fever should not delay vaccination. Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders As with other intramuscular injections , the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoa gulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals. Immunocompromised individuals The efficacy and safet y of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 may be lower in immunocompromised individuals. Duration of protection The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials. Limitations of vaccine effectiveness As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 may not protect all vaccine recipie nts. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their vaccination . 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed. Concomitant administration of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 with other vaccines has not been studied. 309 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 3 micrograms /dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is not intended for individual s older than 5 years of age. For details for use in individuals older than 5 years of age, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for those formulations . 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive, cycle, and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive, cycle, or use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of safety prof ile The safety of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 is inferred from safety data of the prior Comirnaty vaccines .

Description of selected adverse reactions Myocarditis and pericarditis The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see section 4.4). Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12- 29 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the second dose there were 0 .56 (95% CI 0.37 - 0.74) extra cases of myocarditis in 16 -24 year old males per 10 000 compared to unexposed persons. Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal prod uct. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available. 4.9 Overdose Overdose data is available from 52 study participants included in the clinical trial that due to an error in dilution received 58 micrograms of Comirnaty. The vaccine recipients did not report an increase in reactogenicity or adverse reactions. In the ev ent of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended. 314 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BN01 Mechanism of action The nucleoside -modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which enable delivery of the non- replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the SARS -CoV -2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane -anchor ed, full -length S with two point mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against COVID -19. Efficacy Omicron -adapted Comirnaty Immunogenicity in infants and children 6 months to 4 years of age - after the booster (fourth dose) In an analysis of a subset from Study 6, 60 participants 6 months to 4 years of age received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 (1.5/1.5 mcg) after receiving 3 prior doses of Comirnaty 3 micrograms dose concentrate for dispersion. Results include immunogenicity data from a comparator subset of participants 6 months to 4 years of age in Study 3 who received 3 doses of Comirnaty 3 micrograms dose concentrate for dispersion. At 1 month after a booster dose (fourth dose), a booster dose with Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 titres (regardless of baseline SARS -CoV -2 status) compared with the titres in the comparator group who received 3 doses of Comirnaty 3 micrograms dose concentrate for dispersion. Comirnaty Original/Omicron also strain -specific titres compared with the titres in the comparator group.

Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the 56-year stratum. The study excluded 319 participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVI D-19. Participants with pre -existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV). Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approxi mately 44 000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of the initially approved COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID -19. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were requir ed to observe a minimum interval of 60 days before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the study in order to receive either placebo or COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine. The population for the analysis of the prim ary efficacy endpoint included 36 621 participants 12 years of age and older (18 242 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18 379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2 through 7 days after the second dose. In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1 616 participants 75 years of age and older (804 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group). At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic COVID -19 for in total 2 214 person- years for the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 2 222 person- years in the placebo group. There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at risk of severe COVID -19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID -19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) 30 kg/m 2, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension). The vaccine efficacy information is presented in Table 6. Table 6.

Efficacy of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing first COVID -19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2 compared to placebo was 94.6% (95% confidence interval of 89.6% to 97.6%) in participants 16 years of age and older with or without evidence of prior infecti on with SARS -CoV -2. Additionally, subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed similar efficacy point estimates across genders, ethnic groups, and participants with medical comorbidities associated with high risk of severe COVID -19. Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID -19 cases accrued during blinded placebo- controlled follow -up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population.

In the updated efficacy analysis, efficacy of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing first COVID -19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2 compared to placebo was 91.1% (95% CI of 88.8% to 93.0%) during the period when Wuhan/Wild type and Alpha variants were the predominant circulating strains in participants in the evaluable efficacy population with or without evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2. Additi onally, the updated efficacy analyses by subgroup showed similar efficacy point estimates across sexes, ethnic groups, geography and participants with medical comorbidities and obesity associated with high risk of severe COVID -19. Efficacy against severe COVID -19 Updated efficacy analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing severe COVID19. As of 13 March 2021, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID -19 is presented only for participants with or without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection (Table 8) as the COVID -19 case counts in participants without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection were the same as those in participants with or without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection in both the COVID- 19 mRNA Va ccine and placebo groups. 322 Table 8.

Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow -up duration of > 2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1 005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 c ases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 1 110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0). Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional co nfirmed COVID -19 cases accrued during blinded placebo- controlled follow -up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population. In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of prior in fection, there were no cases in 1 057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 323 1 030 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 100.0) during the period when Alpha variant was the predomina nt circulating strain. In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1 119 who received vaccine and 30 cases in 1 109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95 % confidence interval 87.5, 100.0). In Study 2, an analysis of SARS -CoV -2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up t o 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170). The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years of age gr oup was 1.76, with a 2- sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5- fold noninferiority criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2- sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was > 0.67. Efficacy and immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after 2 doses Study 3 is a Phase 1/2/3 study comprised of an open- label vaccine dose- finding portion (Phase 1) and a multicentre, multinational, randomised, saline placebo -controlled, observer -blind efficacy por tion (Phase 2/3) that has enrolled participants 5 to 11 years of age. The majority (94.4%) of randomised vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Initial descriptive vaccine efficacy results in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior SARS -CoV -2 infection are presented in Table 9. No cases of COVID -19 were observed in either the vaccine group or the placebo group in participants with evidence of prior SARS -CoV -2 infection. Table 9.

Pre-specified hypothesis -driven efficacy analysis was performed with additional confirmed COVID -19 cases accrued during blinded placebo- controlled follow -up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population. 324 In the efficacy analysis of Study 3 in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were 10 cas es in 2 703 participants who received the vaccine and 42 cases out of 1 348 who received placebo. T he point estimate for efficacy is 88.2% (95% confidence interval 76.2, 94.7) during the period when Delta variant was the predominant circulating strain. In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 12 cases in the 3 018 who received vaccine and 42 cases in 1 511 participants who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 85.7% (95% confidence interval 72.4, 93.2). In Study 3, an analysis of SARS -CoV -2 50% neutralising titres (NT50) 1 month after Dose 2 in a randomly selected subset of participants demonstrated effectiveness by immunobridging of immune responses comparing children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 3 to participants 16 to 25 years of age in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 2 who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, meeting the prespecified immunobr idging criteria for both the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and the seroresponse difference with seroresponse defined as achieving at least 4 -fold rise in SARS -CoV -2 NT50 from baseline (before Dose 1). The GMR of the SARS -CoV -2 NT50 1 month after Dose 2 in c hildren 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) to that of young adults 16 to 25 years of age was 1.04 (2 -sided 95% CI: 0.93, 1.18). Among participants without prior evidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, 99.2% of c hildren 5 to 11 years of age and 99.2% of participants 16 to 25 years of age had a seroresponse at 1 month after Dose 2. The difference in proportions of participants who had seroresponse between the 2 age groups (children - young adult) was 0.0% (2- sided 95% CI: - 2.0%, 2.2%). This information is presented in Table 10. Table 10.

Immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) - after booster dose A booster dose of Comirnaty was given to 401 randomly selected participants in Study 3. Effectiveness of a booster dose in ages 5 to 11 is inferred by immunogenicity. The immunogenicity of this was assessed through NT50 against the reference strain of SARS -CoV -2 (USA_WA1/2020) . Analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to before the booster dose demonstrated a substantial increase in G MTs in individuals 5 through 11 years of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after the dose 2 and the booster dose.

Vaccine efficacy in participants with or without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection was similar to those participants without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection. Severe COVID -19 criteria (as described in the protocol, based on FDA definition and modified for children) were fulfilled for 12 cases (8 COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine and 4 placebo) among participants 6 months to 4 years of age. Among participants 6 months through 23 months of age, severe COVID -19 criteria were fulfilled for 3 cases (2 COVID- 19 mRNA Vaccine and 1 placebo). 327 Immunogenicity analyses have been performed in the immunobridging subset of 82 Study 3 participants 6 to 23 months of age and 143 Study 3 par ticipants 2 to 4 years of age without evidence of infection up to 1 month after Dose 3 based on a data cut -off date of 29 April 2022. SARS -CoV -2 50% neutralising antibody titres (NT50) were compared between an immunogenicity subset of Phase 2/3 participants 6 to 23 months of age and 2 to 4 years of age from Study 3 at 1 month after the 3 -dose primary course and a randomly selected subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants 16 to 25 years of age at 1 month after the 2- dose primary course, using a microneutralisation assay against the reference strain (USA_WA1/2020). The primary immunobridging analyses compared the geometric mean titres (using a geometric mean ratio [GMR]) and the seroresponse (defined as achieving at least 4 -fold rise in SARS -CoV -2 NT50 from before Dose 1) rates in the evaluable immunogenicity population of participants without evidence of prior SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 3 in participants 6 to 23 months of age and 2 to 4 years of age and up to 1 month after Dos e 2 in participants 16 to 25 years of age. The prespecified immunobridging criteria were met for both the GMR and the seroresponse difference for both age groups (Table 13). Table 13.

Note: Seroresponse is defined as achieving a 4-fold rise from baseline (before Dose 1). If the baseline measurement is below the LLOQ, a postvaccination assay result 4 \u00d7 LLOQ is considered a seroresponse. a. N = Number of participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified assay at the given dose/sampling time point for GMTs and number of participants with valid and determinate assay results for the specified assay at both baseline and the given dose/sampling time point for seroresponse rates. b. GMTs and 2 -sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean logarithm of the titres and the corresponding CIs (bas ed on the Student t distribution). Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 0.5 \u00d7 LLOQ. c. GMRs and 2 -sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean difference of the logarithms of the titres (younger age group minus 16 to 25 years of age) and the corresponding CI (based on the Student t distribution). d. For each younger age group (2 to 4 years, 6 to 23 months), immunobridging based on GMR is declared if the lower bound of the 2- sided 95% CI for the GMR ratio is greater than 0.67 and the point es timate of the GMR is 0.8. e. SARS -CoV -2 NT50 were determined using the SARS -CoV -2 mNeonGreen Virus Microneutralisation Assay. The assay uses a fluorescent reporter virus derived from the USA_WA1/2020 strain and virus neutralization is read on Vero cell m onolayers. The sample NT50 is defined as the reciprocal serum dilution at which 50% of the virus is neutralised. f. n = Number of participants with seroresponse for the given assay at the given dose/sampling time point. g. Exact 2 -sided CI based on the Clopper and Pearson method. h. Difference in proportions, expressed as a percentage (younger age group minus 16 to 25 years of age). i. 2-sided CI, based on the Miettinen and Nurminen method for the difference in proportions, expressed as a percentage. j. For each younger age group (2 to 4 years, 6 to 23 months), immunobridging based on seroresponse rate is declared if the lower bound of the 2- sided 95% CI for the difference in proportions is greater than - 10.0% provided that the immunobridging criteria based on GMR were met. Paediatric population The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID -19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not applicable. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. General toxicity Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekl y, generating relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible. 329 Genotoxicity /Carcinogenicity Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids and mRNA) are not expect ed to have genotoxic potential. Reproductive toxicity Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to matin g and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat due to body weight differences, spanning between pre -mating day 21 and gestational day 20). SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no vaccine -related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo- foetal or offspring development. No Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk. 6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET 395 Package leaflet: Information for the user Comirnaty 30 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection Adults and adolescents from 12 years COVID- 19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside modified) tozinameran This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects. Read all of this leaflet careful ly before you receive this vaccine because it contains important information for you. Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in th is leaflet. See section 4. What is in this leaflet 1. What Comirnaty is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you receive Comirnaty 3. How Comirnaty is given 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Comirnaty 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Comirnaty is and what it is used for Comirnaty is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS- CoV -2. Comirnaty 30 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is given to adults and adolescents from 12 years of age and older. The vaccine causes the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID -19. As Comirnaty does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give you COVID-19. The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 2. What you need to know before you receive Comirnaty Comirnaty should not be given if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) Warnings and precautions Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine if: you have ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or after you were given this vaccine in the past. you are feeling nervous about the vaccination process or have ever fainted following any needle injection. you have a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, you can have your vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold. 396 you have a bleeding problem, you bruise easily or you use a medicine to prevent blood- clots. you have a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine such as corticosteroid that affects your immune system. There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of m yocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and se ek immediate medical attention should these occur. As with any vaccine, Comirnaty may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected. The efficacy of Comirnaty may be lower in people who are immunocompromis ed. If y ou are immunocompromised, you may receive additional dose s of Comirnaty. In these cases, you should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID -19. In addition, your close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss ap propriate individual recommendations with your doctor. Children Comirnaty 30 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is not recommended for children aged under 12 years. There are paediatric formulations available for infants aged 6 months and above and children below 12 years of age. For details, please refer to the Package Leaflet for other formulations . The vaccine is not recommended for infants aged under 6 months . Other medicines and Comirnaty Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines or have recently received any other vaccine. Pregnancy and breast -feeding If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you receive this vaccine. Comirnaty can be used during pregnancy. A large amount of information from pregnant women vaccinated with Comirnaty during the second and third trimester have not shown negative effects on the pregnancy or the newborn baby. While information on effects on pregnancy or the newborn baby after vaccination during the first trimester is limited, no change to the risk for miscarriage has been seen. Comirnaty can be given during breast -feeding. Driving and using machines Some of the e ffects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily affect your ability to drive or use machines. Wait until these effects have worn off before you drive or use machines. Comirnaty contains potassium and sodium This vaccin e contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'potassium -free'. 397 This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium -free'. 3. How Comirnaty is given Comirnaty is given after dilution as an injection of 0.3 mL into a muscle of your upper arm. You will receive 1 injection , regardless whether you have received a COVID -19 vaccine before . If you were previously vaccinated with a COVID -19 vaccine, you should not receiv e a dose of Comirnaty until at least 3 months after the most recent dose. If you are immunocompromised, you may receive additional dose s of Comirnaty . If you have any further questions on the use of Comirnaty, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 4. Possible side effects Like all vaccines, Comirnaty can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Very common side effects: may affect more than 1 in 10 people injection site: pain, swelling tiredness headache muscle pain chills joint pain diarrhoea fever Some of these side effects were slightly more frequent in adolescents 12 to 15 years than in adults. Common side effects: may affect up to 1 in 10 people injection site redness nausea vomiting enlarged lymph nodes (more frequently observed after a booster dose) Uncommon side effects: may affect up to 1 in 100 people feeling unwell arm pain insomnia injection site itching allergic reactions such as rash or itching feeling weak or lack of energy/sleepy decreased appetite dizziness excessive sweating night sweats Rare side effects: may affect up to 1 in 1 000 people temporary one sided facial drooping allergic reactions such as hives or swelling of the face 398 Very rare side effects: may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or inflammation of the lining outside the heart (pericarditis) which can result in breathlessness, palpitations or chest pain Not known (cannot be estimated from the avai lable data) severe allergic reaction extensive swelling of the vaccinated limb swelling of the face (swelling of the face may occur in patients who have had facial dermatological fillers) a skin reaction that causes red spots or patches on the skin, that may look like a target or \"bulls -eye\" with a dark red centre surrounded by paler red rings (erythema multiforme) unusual feeling in the skin, such as tingling or a crawling feeling (paraesthesia) decreased feeling or sensitivity, especially in the skin (hypoaesthesia) heavy menstrual bleeding (most cases appeared to be non- serious and temporary in nature) Reporting of side effects If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

What Comirnaty is and what it is used f or Comirnaty is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS- CoV -2. Comirnaty 30 micrograms/dose dispersion for injection is given to adults and adolescents from 12 years of age and older. The vaccine causes the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID -19. As Comirnaty does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give you COVID-19. The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 2. What you need to know before you receive Comirnaty Comirnaty should not be given if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) Warni ngs and precautions Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine if: you have ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or after you were given this vaccine in the past. you are feeling nervous about the vaccination process or have ever fainted following any needle injection. you have a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, you can have your vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold. 407 you have a bleeding problem, you bruise easily or you use a medicine to prevent blood- clots. you have a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine such as corticosteroid that affects your immune sys tem. There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palp itations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur. As with any vaccine, Comirnaty may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected. The efficacy of Comirnaty may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. If y ou are immunocompromised, you may receive additional dose s of Comirnaty. In these cases, you should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID -19. In addition, your close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your doctor. Children Comirnaty 30 mi crograms/dose dispersion for injection is not recommended for children aged under 12 years.

What you need to know before your child receives Comirnaty 3. How Comirnaty is given 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Comirnaty 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Comirnaty is and what it is used for Comirnaty is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS- CoV -2. Comirnaty 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is given to infants and children from 6 months to 4 years of age. The vaccine causes the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID -19. As Comirnaty does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give your child COVID-19. The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 2. What you need to know before your child receives Comirnaty Comirnaty should not be given if your child is allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) Warnings and precautions Talk to your child's doctor, pharmacist or nurse before your child is given the vaccine if your child: has ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or after having been given this vaccine in the past. is feeling nervous about the vaccination process or has ever fainted following any needle injection. has a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, your child can have the vaccination if he/she ha s a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold. 429 has a bleeding problem, bruises easily or uses a medicine to prevent blood- clots. has a weakened i mmune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine such as corticosteroid that affects the immune system. There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccina tion and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitatio ns and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur. As with any vaccine, Comirnaty may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long your child will be protected. The efficacy of Comirnaty may be lower i n people who are immunocompromised. If your child is immunocompromise d, he/she may receive additional dose s of Comirnaty . In these cases, you r child should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID -19. In addition, your child's close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your child's doctor.

How to store Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 is and what it is used for Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS -CoV -2. It is given to children from 5 to 11 years of age. The vaccine causes the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID -19. As Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give your child COVID-19. The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 2. What you need to know before your child receives Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 should not be given if your child is allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) Warnings and precautions Talk to your child's doctor, pharmacist or nurse before your child is given the vaccine if your child: has ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or after having been given this vaccine in the past. is feeling nervous about the vaccination process or has ever fainted following any needle injection. has a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, your child can have the vaccination if he/she has a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold. 460 has a bleeding problem, bruises easily or uses a medicine to prevent blood- clots. has a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine such as corticosteroid that affects the immune system. There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccina tion and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared with ages 12 to 17 years. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur. As with any vaccine, Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long you r child will be protected. The efficacy of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. If your child is immunocompromise d, he/she may receive additional doses of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5. In these cases, you r child should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COV ID-19. In addition, your child's close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your child's doctor.

How to store Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 is and what it is used for Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS -CoV -2. It is given to infants and children from 6 months to 4 years of age. The vaccine causes the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID -19. As Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give your child COVID-19. The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 2. What you need to know before your child receives Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 should not be given if your child is allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) Warnings and precautions Talk to your child's doctor, pharmacist or nurse before your child is given the vaccine if your child: has ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or after having been given this vaccine in the past. is feeling nervous about the vaccination process or has ever fainted following any needle injection. 482 has a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, your child can have the vaccination if he/she has a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold. has a bleeding problem, bruises easily or uses a medicine to prevent blood- clots. has a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine such as corticosteroid that affects the immune system. There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccin ation, and more often in younger males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur. As with any vaccine, Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long your child will be protected. The efficacy of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5, may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. If your child is immunocompromise d, he/she may receive additional doses of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5. In these cases, your child should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID -19. In addition, your child's close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your child's doctor. Children Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 (1.5/1.5 micrograms)/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is not recommended for children aged 5 yea rs to 11 years. There are paediatric formulations available for children 5 to 11 years of age. For details, please refer to the Package Leaflet for other formulations . The vaccine is not recommended for infants aged under 6 months.

Pregnancy and breast -feeding Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 (1.5/1.5 micrograms )/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is not intended for individuals older than 5 years of age. For details for use in individuals older than 5 years of age, please refer to the Package Leaflet for those formulations . Driving and using machines Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily affect your child's ability to use machines or undertake activities such as cycling. Wait until these effects have worn off before resuming activities that require your child's full attention. 3. How Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 is given If your infant is from 6 months to less than 12 months of age, he/she will be given Co mirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 after dilution as an injection of 0.2 mL into a muscle of the thigh. If your infant or child is 1 year of age or older, he/she will be given Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5 after dilution as an injection of 0.2 mL into a muscle of the thigh or into a muscle of the upper arm. 483 If your child has not completed a COVID- 19 primary vaccination course or has not been infected by COVID -19 in the past, your child will receive a maximum of 3 injections (the total number of doses required as primary course ). It is recommended to receive the second dose 3 weeks after the first dose followed by a third dose at least 8 weeks after the second dose to complete the primary course. If your child has previously completed a COVID- 19 primary vaccination course or has had COVID -19 your child will receive 1 injection. If your child was previously vaccinated with a COVID -19 vaccine, your child should not receive a dose of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 until at least 3 months after the most recent dose. If your child turns 5 years old between their doses in the primary course, he/she should complete the primary course at the same 3 micrograms dose level. If your child is immunocompromised, he /she may receive additional dose s of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5. Interchangeability Your child may receive either Comirnaty or Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4- 5 (or a combination of both) for the primary course. Your child should not receive more than the total number of doses needed as primary course . Your child should only be administered t he primary course once. If you have any further questions on the use of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4 -5, ask your child's doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 4.

Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 is and what it is used for Comirnaty Omic ron XBB.1.5 is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS -CoV -2. Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 10 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is given to children from 5 to 11 years of age. The vaccine causes the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection again st COVID-19. As Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give your child COVID-19. The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 2. What you need to know before your child receives Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 should not be given if your child is allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) Warnings an d precautions Talk to your child's doctor, pharmacist or nurse before your child is given the vaccine if your child: has ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or after having been given this vaccine in the past. is feeling nervous about the vaccination process or has ever fainted following any needle injection. 504 has a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, your child can have the vaccination if he/she has a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold. has a bleeding problem, bruises easily or uses a medicine to prevent blood- clots. has a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine such as corticosteroid that affects the immune system. There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccina tion and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpita tions and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur. As with any vaccine, Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long your child will be protected. The efficacy of Comir naty Omicron XBB.1.5 may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. If your child is immunocompromise d, he/she may receive additional dose s of Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5. In these cases, your child should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID -19. In addition, your child's close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your child's doctor. Children Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 10 micrograms /dose concentrate for dispersion fo r injection is not recommended for children aged under 5 years. There are paediatric formulations available for infants and children aged 6 months to 4 years. For details, please refer to the Package Leaflet for other formulations . The vaccine is not recommended for infants aged under 6 months.
