T wo of the 11 proteins encoded b y these viruses' single-stranded RNA genome\u2014hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N)\u2014ar e commonly used to identify viral subtypes (e.g., H3N2). The hemagglutinin unit is essential for inv asion of the host and is host-specific. The neuraminidase unit allows the virus to pr opagate and release viral progeny. Influenza continues to be a r elevant infection because both the H and N units can adapt and mutate thr ough antigenic shift and antigenic drift. A ntigenic shift is recombination of entire H and N genes. This occurs in permissive hosts, such as swine or fo wl, that are infected by two strains of influenza simultaneously . The recombination of entir e subunits can ultimately lead to the cr eation of new influenza strains that are then shed b y the permissive hosts and may infect new hosts or ne w species. Antigenic drift is the result of small mutations within the H or N genes that alter the str ucture of viral surface proteins. Antigenic drift incr eases diversity within cir culating virus strains, leading to varying lev els of pathogenicity. Occasionally, small mutations can lead to a significant alteration in pathogenicity for an influenza strain. CANINE INFL UENZA STRAINS An influenza vir us that has adapted to allow transmission among dogs is consider ed a canine influenza vir us (CIV). Both H3N8 and H3N2 CIVs ar e currently active in the United States. A number of other influenza type A vir uses have occasionally been found to infect dogs but ar e not capable of dog-to-dog transmission. H3N8 I n North America, there is evidence that H3N8 jumped fr om horses to dogs around 1999 ( FIGURE 1). 1 Before this time, equine H3N8 had occasionally been found in dogs with dir ect INFECTIOUS DISEASEC anine Influenza: N ew DACVIMT exas A&M University College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, College Station, TexasSICK A S A DOG In the U .S., 2 strains of canine influenza virus\u2014H3N8 and H3N2\u2014ha ve been identified.

This jump was possible due to antigenic drift within the H gene. M ultiple host-specific factors and defenses make the dev elopment of an entirely new strain of influenza that is capable of sustaining infection within a ne w host species incredibly unusual. In 2004, the first outbreak of canine influenza A (H3N8) was documented in racing gr eyhounds in F lorida. Samples of respiratory tissue from these dogs used for vir us culture confirmed the presence of a type A influenza. F urther genetic analysis revealed that the strain isolated fr om the dogs shared many similarities to the H3N8 equine influenza vir us, leading to the FIGURE 1.

Genetic analysis of influenza viral RNA isolated from infected dogs during the initial influenza outbreak showed that the virus shar ed >96% of genes with equine-adapted H3N8. Before this time, dogs with direct contact with horses could become inf ected with H3N8, but there was no sustained transmission from dog to dog. Through antigenic drift, the H3N8 influenza virus gained the ability t o not only infect dogs but also spread from dog to dog.Equine H3N8E quine H3N8Equine odaysveterinarypractice.com JULY/AUGUST 2019 39conclusion that the virus had jumped from horses to dogs as depicted in FIGURE 2 . 2F rom 2004 to 2006, there were additional disease outbr eaks at 14 racetracks in 6 states across the United S tates.2 The H3N8 virus was subsequently reported in shelter dogs, pr oving that it was able to infect non-gr eyhound dogs.3 H3N8 spread slowly through the canine population and has no w been documented in mor e than 40 states (FIGURE 3 ). 4H3N2 I n 2007, H3N2 was isolated from a dog in South K orea with respiratory signs and was determined to be of avian origin. This H3N2 strain was experimentally sho wn to infect research dogs.5 Several cases of H3N2 w ere then reported throughout China and shown to be closely r elated to the avian influenza viruses isolated fr om dogs in South Korea.6I n 2015, the first outbreak of H3N2 in dogs in the U nited States was reported in Chicago, Illinois. Shortly ther eafter, another outbreak was reported in Atlanta, G eorgia. A serologic study performed in the summer of 2015 looked at 452 dogs fr om 13 states and found ser oconversion for H3N2 to be low (2.21%), with all positiv e dogs coming from Indiana and Illinois.7 This finding suggests that in 2015, H3N2 exposur e was low in cer tain geographic locations, and a large portion of the U.S. canine population would likely be highly susceptible to infection. S ince 2015, H3N2 has been reported sporadically from mor e than 30 states. Genetic analysis of material isolated from infected dogs indicates that subsequent r eintroductions of H3N2 from Asia have contributed to additional U.S. outbr eaks.8 Most U.S. CIV outbr eaks in recent years have been due to H3N2.9H5N2 I n 2009, H5N2 was isolated from a dog with r espiratory signs in China. This strain was proven to spr ead among dogs housed together and through experimental inoculation of healthy dogs. 10 The clinical signs of illness w ere mild, and no fatalities were associated with the infection. To date, this strain of influenza has not been r eported in the United States.O THER INFLUENZA TYPE A VIRUSES S everal other influenza viruses may infect dogs and cause clinical signs, but they hav e not been demonstrated to spr ead among dogs. Awareness of these agents is impor tant to understand the multispecies natur e, and adaptive potential, of influenza A vir uses. H1N1, colloquially kno wn as \"the swine flu,\" caused a pandemic in humans fr om 2009 to 2010. In 2009, H1N1 was detected in a dog with r espiratory signs in N ew York; this dog had apparently contracted the disease fr om its owner.11 A recent serologic study in O hio showed that 4% of dogs in a convenience sample of 1082 dogs sho wed seroconversion to H1N1, pr esumed to be due to exposure to humans with this infection. 12H5N1 is a highly pathogenic avian influenza strain that has been sho wn to infect dogs exposed to infected poultr y in high-density housing conditions. Equine H3N8 (not the dog-adapted v ersion) dogs.CANINE UENZAC urrently, is strains of H3N8 and H3N2. Although CIV has continued to spr ead throughout the United States since 2004, canine influenza is still a r elatively novel infectious disease in the canine population ( BO X 1). S pecies with high exposur e to endemic influenza viruses (humans, birds, and pigs) hav e a certain level of background immunity that pr ovides a degree of protection against similar strains encounter ed in the future; however, most dogs FIGURE 3. This map depicts the current 46 states with document ed cases of either H3N2 or H3N8 CIV JULY/AUGUST 2019 todaysveterinarypractice.comhave never been exposed to an influenza virus and ther efore lack natural immunity. In such naive populations, the influenza vir us is highly infectious and most animals that come into contact with the vir us become infected. I n the United States, the CIV morbidity\u2014that is, the number of dogs that become infected and sho w clinical signs\u2014has been r eported as high as 80% in naiv e canine populations. In initial outbreaks of H3N8, mor tality within the greyhound population r eached 36%. Fortunately, CIV has proven to be less lethal, and mor tality in the general population of dogs is generally estimated to be 1% to 5%. B ased on these v alues, most dogs will become infected when exposed to the vir us but only a very small per centage will die of the disease. There was no differ ence in the clinical signs or case fatality rate (3%) of dogs infected in the 2015 A tlanta H3N2 outbr eak compared with previous H3N8 outbreaks.13T ransmissionLike other influenza A vir uses, CIV is spread through r espiratory secretions, respiratory aerosols, A 2- to 3-day incubation period follo ws infection, during which vir us replication and viral shedding are high. A t the end of the incubation period, most exposed dogs dev elop clinical signs and viral shedding begins to rapidly decline. D ogs infected with H3N8 CIV continue to shed the vir us for approximately 7 to 10 days after infection. V iral shedding of H3N2 CIV in nasal secretions was documented in a gr oup of infected shelter dogs in Chicago for more than 21 days after infection.14 It is impor tant to note that dogs infected with CIV shed vir us before developing clinical signs and can continue to shed vir us after clinical signs have resolved, which can continue for mor e than 3 weeks for H3N2. Clinical Signs D ogs clinically affected with CIV have signs of an upper r espiratory infection, such as sneezing, serous to mucopur ulent nasal discharge, and cough. They may also hav e evidence of systemic illness, such as fever, lethargy , and decreased appetite. Clinical signs of CIV infection ar e essentially indistinguishable from those of other pathogens that cause canine infectious r espiratory disease (CIRD), and ther efore diagnosis based on histor y and clinical signs alone is not possible. Due to the lack of natural immunity , CIV typically spreads mor e rapidly than other CIRD pathogens in a population of naiv e dogs. Dogs with CIV or any other cause of CIRD also commonly hav e a suspicious exposur e history, such as being at a boarding facility, kennel, dog sho w, or shelter. In severe cases, an initial infection with CIV can lead to the dev elopment of pneumonia, likely secondar y to compromised airway defenses allo wing bacterial colonization. A sev ere, peracute form of illness was reported in the initial CIV outbr eak affecting racing greyhounds; this form may hav e been due to co-infection or some risk factor within the gr eyhound population r esulting in more severe disease. It resulted in sev ere pulmonary, pleural, and mediastinal hemorrhage and death. 2 This disease manifestation is not common in the pet population. Diagnosis M ultiple diagnostic laboratories offer either serology or polymerase chain r eaction (PCR) testing for canine influenza. The preferred clinical diagnostic test for acute disease is influenza PCR, using an assay that has demonstrated detection of both H3N8 and H3N2 subtypes. Testing should be done as soon as possible in the course of disease, when viral shedding is at its peak. B ecause of the delay from infection to clinical signs, it is r ecommended to perform PCR within the first 4 to 5 days of clinical illness, since b y this time the animal has likely been infected anywher e from 6 to 8 days, par ticularly for H3N8 CIV. If samples are collected later in the course of disease when viral shedding is declining, the risk of a false-negativ e result increases. BOX 1 C anine Influenza OutbreaksC IV was expected to spread rapidly across the United States a s a pandemic. In the 15 years since its emergence, there h ave been regional outbreaks of the disease, but overall its s pread has been more sporadic than initially anticipated. S ome investigators use the term \"popcorn outbreaks\" b ecause the disease appears suddenly and spreads rapidly t hroughout a focal community or region. The rate of d iagnosis of new cases declines in a matter of months, p resumably as the community is exposed to CIV and d evelops resistance. The infection then emerges suddenly a nd spreads rapidly somewhere else. In the case of H3N2, p eriodic reintroductions of H3N2 CIV from Asia have c ontributed to these sporadic localized outbreaks.8 P EER REVIEWED CONTINUING EDUCATIONt odaysveterinarypractice.com JULY/AUGUST 2019 41PCR may be of use in detecting H3N2 later in the course of disease due to its pr olonged shedding period. I deal specimens for PCR are obtained from deep nasal or phar yngeal swabs. To increase diagnostic sensitivity, specimens fr om multiple sites, including both nostrils and the or opharynx, should be collected and pooled. U se of a sterile sampling swab with a plastic handle is r ecommended for specimen collection. The specimen should then be placed into a sterile tube, r efrigerated, and shipped o vernight on ice to the diagnostic laborator y according to the laboratory's specific collection and handling instr uctions. Some labs request dr y samples15 and others request samples sent with sterile saline. 16 Improperly storing or shipping the specimen will significantly decr ease diagnostic yield. S erology can be performed in combination with PCR if the patient has been ill longer than 5 days and/or a false-negativ e PCR result is suspected. Both acute and conv alescent CIV titers are needed to confirm diagnosis of canine influenza. When CIV was first described, any positiv e serology result was consistent with infection. N ow that CIV is present in most states and some dogs hav e been vaccinated, a single positive ser ology result is no longer sufficient for diagnosis. I f infection is suspected, serology samples should be collected at initial examination and conv alescent CIV titers measur ed 2 to 3 weeks later. Infection is confirmed b y a fourfold increase in convalescent influenza titers. F or example, a dog that has been v accinated for CIV and is infected with a different CIRD pathogen should hav e a positive acute CIV titer but should exhibit a minimal or z ero increase in CIV titer at the 2- to 3-w eek recheck. It should also be noted that ser ologic detection of antibodies against H3N8 does not distinguish betw een the equine and canine-adapted influenza subtypes. T reatmentTher e is no definitive or specific treatment for canine influenza. As with all CIRD infections, most CIV infections ar e self-limiting and resolve over several w eeks (\"uncomplicated\" CIRD). T reatment revolves ar ound supportive care. Dogs with any respiratory illness should be r ested, provided optimal nutrition, and kept w ell hydrated, clean, dry, and warm. A subset of patients will dev elop clinical signs or radiographic evidence of pneumonia (\" complicated\" CIRD). These patients may require more aggressive therapy, including antibiotic therapy, intravenous fluids, supplemental o xygen or nebulization, and decoupage. I deally, tracheal wash or bronchoalveolar lav age should be performed for aerobic and anaerobic cultur e to guide appropriate antibiotic choice. If this is not possible, empirical br oad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is r ecommended for these patients.17 Cough suppr essants should not be used in patients with a pr oductive cough or evidence of pneumonia.T o decrease the risk of creating antimicrobial resistance, curr ent guidelines encourage clinicians to be conscientious when pr escribing antibiotics when a bacterial infection is not confirmed. 18 A recent review r ecommended that antibiotics be considered for suspected cases of CIRD only when evidence of a bacterial component is pr esent, such as a patient pr esenting with lethargy, inappetence, and fever in combination with mucopur ulent discharge or evidence of br onchopneumonia.17 In the absence of bacterial pneumonia, pr ophylactic antibiotics may be unnecessar y, even for geriatric, young, or immunocompr omised patients.Ther e is often a question as to whether antiviral therapy is beneficial in the tr eatment of canine influenza. Antiviral medications used in human medicine, such as oseltamivir , block the release of viral pr ogeny from infected cells. Thus, they would theor etically be most effective early in the course of CIV infection, when a r eduction in viral burden would still be possible. This window has often passed by the time dogs pr esent to a veterinarian and infection is confirmed. A dditionally, in most patients, canine influenza is self-limiting and ther e is no evidence that antiviral therapy is effectiv e or improves outcome. To decrease the risk of creating an timicrobial resistance, c urrent guidelines encourage c linicians to be conscientious w hen prescribing antibiotics w hen a bacterial infection i s not confirmed.18 C ONTINUING EDUCATION PEER REVIEWED42 JULY/AUGUST 2019 todaysveterinarypractice.comFurther, antivirals, like antibiotics, can induce r esistance in viral strains. Appropriate antiviral ste wardship is needed to prevent the emergence of r esistant influenza strains. Pr eventionI n 2009, a killed, adjuvant, monovalent vaccine for H3N8 CIV was appr oved for use in dogs. A vaccine for H3N2 CIV became av ailable in 2015. In 2016, a biv alent vaccine was produced containing both H3N2 and H3N8 CIV . Multiple formulations now exist on the mar ket. The CIV v accine is considered a non-core vaccination accor ding to the 2017 AAHA canine vaccination guidelines. 19 Vaccination against CIV is recommended for patients with lifestyles that may incr ease their risk of exposur e or factors that may increase their risk of a mor e severe illness if infected. Dogs that are frequently boar ded, compete in sporting events, frequent dog par ks or dog shows, or are in a shelter/kennel envir onment have higher risk of coming into contact with dogs infected with CIV and should be v accinated. D ogs with risk factors that justify the use of non-core Bor detella bronchiseptica or parainfluenza vaccine should also be v accinated against CIV. Due to the pr evalence of both strains in the United States and the unpr edictable nature of CIV outbreaks, the authors believ e that dogs at risk of exposure should be v accinated against both H3N2 and H3N8. I nformation about the field efficacy of CIV vaccines is limited. B ased on experimental studies, vaccination against H3N8 did not prevent disease in all vaccinated dogs but did significantly decr ease the severity of infection, viral load, and viral shedding. 20 The H3N8 v accine has been shown to provide protection against multiple H3N8 isolates. 21 Vaccinated dogs that w ere exposed to H3N8 and co-infected with S treptococcus zooepidemicus, a member of the CIRD complex, exhibited milder clinical signs for a shor ter duration than dogs that w ere unvaccinated.22While additional r esearch is needed to fully understand the field efficacy of CIV v accines, it is r ecommended to vaccinate dogs at risk of exposure or dogs at risk of sev ere complications if infected.Inf ection Control Q uick detection of potential cases of canine influenza is imperativ e in preventing an outbreak within a facility. P atients that present with clinical signs consistent with canine influenza and a compatible exposur e history should be tr eated as though they could be highly infectious. I t is important to minimize exposure of other animals b y keeping possible cases of canine influenza isolated. G iven that CIV is a respiratory pathogen and is spr ead through respiratory secretions, aerosols, and fomites, suspected cases should be physically separated fr om other animals in an enclosed room. All dogs with suspected CIV infection should be tested. I f a patient tests positive, it is important that appr opriate precautions are taken within the clinic or shelter to help pr event spread of infection. Positive test r esults also need to be communicated to owners, who should be urged to isolate their pets until clinical signs ar e fully resolved and the shedding period has passed. P atients exposed to infection should also remain quarantined until the incubation period has passed, or until they dev elop and recover from clinical signs and the shedding period has passed. P roper cleaning and decontamination are necessary to pr event spread of the virus. The influenza virus is easily killed with quaternar y ammonium compounds, accelerated hy drogen peroxide compounds, and bleach. Contaminated ar eas should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected befor e healthy animals are reintroduced. V eterinarians, veterinary nurses, and owners who are in contact with an infected animal need to be car eful to ensur e that they do not act as fomites by spreading the vir us to other animals on their hands, gloves, or clothing. Dogs that are frequently b oarded, compete in sporting e vents, frequent dog parks or d og shows, or are in a shelter/k ennel environment have higher r isk of coming into contact w ith dogs infected with CIV a nd should be vaccinated. P EER REVIEWED CONTINUING EDUCATIONt odaysveterinarypractice.com JULY/AUGUST 2019 43PUBLIC HEALTHA t this time, there are no reports of transmission of canine H3N2 or H3N8 fr om dogs to humans. A study fr om China recently reported that co-infection with H1N1 and H3N2 r esulted in recombination of the vir uses in dogs, leading to the creation of new r ecombinant strains.23 This finding sparked concern that dogs carr ying these new strains of influenza could pose a z oonotic risk to humans. These concerns have not y et become reality. The influenza vir us is constantly changing and adapting, and it will continue to be impor tant to identify ne w and emerging strains. As CIV continues to spr ead within the canine population, incr eased awareness, vaccination, public health considerations, and sur veillance are necessar y to keep clients and pets safe.
