In fact, some dangerous crystals must not be soaked, heated, or even touched with bare hands. What are the most dangerous crystals in the world? How to use them safely? The most dangerous crystals in the world contain toxic elements, like Aluminum, Lead, Copper, Sulfur, Chromium, and Uranium. Read on to learn about the most dangerous crystals in the world and how to use them safely. 15 Asbestos Crystals and Their Risks One of the biggest markers of toxic crystals is crystals with asbestos. You should never use asbestos-containing crystals with water or salt water. More importantly, avoid cutting, polishing, or tumbling them without safety gear. Instead, you can use them for crystal grids and altars. Here's a list of gemstones with asbestos and what they do: Actinolite One of the lesser known crystals, Actinolite is a big no-no for elixirs, soaking, and other rituals with water and salt water. That said, the Hazard Risk of Actinolite is low. Brucite If you're a fan of the pearly luster of Brucite crystals, keep a watch out because they're toxic and soluble in acids. But they're good for abundance when used safely. Brucite forms rosettes and masses in yellow or greenish-yellow colors. Binghamite Also popular as Cuyyunite and Silkstone, it's an Agate found exclusively in Minnesota with asbestos. Never use it for elixirs and wet rituals. Although it's a good stone for courage and willpower, you should use it sparingly. Cat's Eye There aren't any Cat's Eye stones because it's an optical property of the stone. Cat's Eye illusion or Chatoyancy in Green Quartz indicates asbestos. If your crystal shows this, be safe than sorry by avoiding ingesting or inhaling it. Denisovite Asbestos fibers on Denisovite crystals are green in color and highly toxic. You should never use it for making elixirs or direct infusions. Wash your hands after use. Mesolite Mesolite is a fibrous zeolite that contains asbestos and is also carcinogenic. Although toxicity levels of Mesolite are low, you shouldn't use it directly for elixirs. Pietersite Much like Tiger's Eye crystals, Pietersite contains Blue Crocidolite asbestos. You should not soak it directly to make elixirs. Asbestos in Pietersite crystals is dangerous only when you inhale its dust when cutting, polishing, or shaping the crystal. It's a good crystal for divination. Serpentine A well-known crystal, fibrous Serpentine also contains asbestos. Did you know Serpentine can lead to respiratory disorders when inhaled? Moreover, the asbestos in this crystal ranges from 1% to 25%. Avoid using them for direct elixirs. Chrysotile is another Serpentine crystal with asbestos you need to care for mindfully. Scolecite Scolecite is an asbestos crystal from the zeolite family with high vibration. It's typically used for psychic abilities and cleansing. While the toxicity of Scolecite is negligible, it has a fibrous structure. We suggest avoiding it in direct infusions for making gem water. Tremolite With a low risk of toxicity, Tremolite is another crystal with asbestos you need to handle carefully. Although it's a good love crystal, you should avoid it in direct infusions. Wash your hands after touching Tremolite. Tiger's Eye Although Tiger's Eye crystals contain asbestos, Crocidolite asbestos crystals are buried deep inside the Quartz. Hence, they're safe unless you inhale their powders. Blue Tiger's Eye or Hawk's Eye may contain a higher amount of asbestos, so use them carefully and stick to indirect crystal elixir methods for all Tiger's Eye varieties. Tokkoite While Tokkoite also contains the toxic Fluorine, asbestos is more worrying. Tokkoite is a psychic vision stone found exclusively in Russia. It also forms with Charoite. Avoid making direct crystal elixirs with either. Ulexite Another higher-power stone for intuition, clairvision, and fortune telling, Ulexite is a soft mineral that loses its luster and (some) asbestos when soaked in water. You should avoid using it for crystal infusions, as it contains toxic Boron. Fun Fact: Ulexite is also called T.V. Rock! Yuksporite One of the rare crystals from Russia, Yuksporite contains asbestos in its yellow, red, and pink varieties. It's a unique crystal that balances the higher and lower chakras. We suggest avoiding it in direct infusions. Zebra Jasper Another variety of Chrysotile asbestos is found in Zebra Jasper. The stone is excellent for harmony and peace, besides having a negligible risk of toxicity from touching or wearing it. Fun Fact: Most people confuse Grossular and Hessonite Garnets as asbestos-based crystals because they're from Asbestos in Quebec, Canada. Hence, these two Garnet varieties have zero asbestos in them. List of Toxic Crystals Other than asbestos, other elements like Sulfur, Arsenic, Copper, Lead, Mercury, Zinc, Chromium, and Uranium can also add to the toxicity of crystals.
