By Regina Schoenberger The United States Covid-19 vaccine rollout continues with two different available vaccines as a means to combat and contain the ongoing global pandemic. Pfizer and Moderna, both of which are two-dose vaccines, are currently available, while the one-and-done Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been paused due to blood clot issues in several women. Two other vaccines remain in clinical trials and data will determine if they will be approved for use in the United States. Side effects for each vaccine range widely from individual to individual, but can [ include](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html): - Fever - Chills - Fatigue - Headache - Body Aches - Inflammation - Pain at Injection Site The Vaccine Detox Supplement Kit offered by Princeton Integrative Health is designed to support all human biological systems. There are various plant-based components in the kit to help your body mitigate the side effects and respond to the new pathogen introduced by the vaccine. Humans possess the innate ability to cleanse from within through our detox organs - the liver, kidneys, and sympathetic system, all of which are proof of this amazing human characteristic. However, it's always best to support and enhance these systems, especially when introducing a unknown substance that the body doesn't recognize, which is what this kit offers. Each kit includes a combination of four supplements listed below which work to boost your immune system & elimination channels: SPM Supreme Serum Protein Modulators (SPMs) sourced from fractionated fish oil help aid the body's healing processes. These molecules are derived from naturally occurring omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids and help the body rebuild damaged tissue. Often, SPMs are not sufficiently produced in the body alone, so many people are deficient. [SPM Supreme provides a groundbreaking, anti-inflammatory response and tissue health support.](https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-020-02569-5) Cytodetox Cytodetox is a homeopathic remedy that helps combat the possible side effects associated with the COVID19 vaccine and supports your body's natural ability to detoxify. [Cytodetox contains the mineral Zeolite,](https://cytodetox.com/) a natural detoxifier formed from fossilized volcanic ash and seawater. Commonly, patients also use this supplement to eliminate lead, metals, and other harmful toxins. ATP 360 Our mitochondria provide power to our cells. [Chemical energy produced by the mitochondria is stored in a small molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). According to Research Nutritionals,](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Mitochondria#:~:text=Mitochondria%20are%20membrane%2Dbound%20cell,called%20adenosine%20triphosphate%20(ATP).) ATP 360 provides patients with energy through: - Supporting mitochondrial membrane health with specialized phospholipid matrix - Managing mitochondrial cytokine activity - Promoting a healthy electron transport chain with nutrients such as NADH & CoQ10 - Supporting Krebs Cycle & mitochondrial mitogenesis with R-Lipoic Acid & PQQ A properly functioning mitochondrion is essential to healthy aging and it is necessary to provide nutrients to protect it from oxidative stress and prevent any damage from occurring. Essential Pro Glutathione is the body's master detoxifier. Essential Pro is designed to increase the systemic bioavailability of glutathione using phosphatidylcholine-enriched liposomes. [ This powerful oxidative damage to our cells.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6523540/) Dr. Leonti recollects instances as an Emergency Room physician when he saw the true power of glutathione. Intravenous glutathione was administered to patients who overdosed on Tylenol and it was the only option to save their liver. Dr. Leonti emphasizes the importance of detoxification and immune support and believes both are crucial in today's environment. In the 1980s, studies show there were around 10,000 chemicals in our environment but that figure has now skyrocketed to 80,000 and includes metals, mold, and other harmful toxins. This kit prepares your body with the best possible defense to adapt to the vaccine in addition to cleansing our body from harmful toxins of everyday modern life.
