In a majority of the population, the effectiveness of the protection given by the recommended three vaccines against severe coronavirus disease remains at a very good level for a long time. COVID-19 vaccines are less effective against the infection and milder forms of the disease. Consequently, it is important that you use your discretion in keeping a safe distance from other people, wear a mask where necessary, wash your hands and follow other instructions issued to prevent infections also when you have been vaccinated. Effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines: FAQ - Two doses of any coronavirus vaccine used in Finland provide good protection against serious disease requiring hospitalisation due to the omicron variant. After the second vaccine dose, the protection declines slightly over the course of six months. The third vaccine dose improves the protection to an excellent level again (to approximately 90 per cent) and the protection remains at almost the same level as after the vaccination for at least 9 months. It is likely that the protective effectiveness against a severe disease will not decrease significantly even after that time. The need to boost vaccine coverage with booster doses varies by group and situation. [Getting vaccinated against COVID-19: how, why and when?](/en/web/infectious-diseases-and-vaccinations/what-s-new/coronavirus-covid-19-latest-updates/vaccines-and-coronavirus/getting-vaccinated-against-covid-19-how-why-and-when-) In a UK study, the protection after three coronavirus vaccines against a disease requiring hospitalisation due to the omicron variant was 90% for patients over 65 years of age. The protection is excellent, as it is the elderly who have the greatest risk of serious disease. Thanks to the vaccinations, an ever smaller proportion of people with coronavirus end up dying. In 2022 alone, the number of lives saved in Finland by the coronavirus vaccines was many times greater than the number of deaths from coronavirus. - Three vaccine doses give about 90% protection against severe coronavirus protection among the working age population, with a long-lasting effect. This means that about 90% of serious cases are prevented by three vaccine doses in working-age people. The longest follow-up time in any study has been 9 months. During the 13-month monitoring period in Finland, healthy working-age people who have been vaccinated three times have sustained a good level of protection against a serious form of the disease. It is likely that protection will remain at a high level even after this. THL continuously monitors the research data accumulated on the effectiveness of vaccines and the incidence of hospitalisation, i.e. the number of new hospital-treated cases per week. Two vaccine doses and having had the disease provide 95% protection against a serious form of the disease for at least 12 months. Studies indicate that this protection seems to remain unchanged even past one year. How well do the original vaccine products protect against infection? The original vaccine products give about 90% protection against serious disease. Effectiveness against Omicron and a mild version of the disease was about 40-50% for two months while the main variants were Omicron BA.1 and BA.2. This means that approximately 40-50% of people who would have been infected or had a mild disease if they had been unvaccinated were spared for two months after vaccination. After three months, the vaccine no longer protected against infection or mild disease. A person who has been infected with coronavirus can spread the virus further regardless of whether they have symptoms. The vaccine's ability to reduce infectiousness decreases over time. After a booster dose, infectiousness returns to its original level after approximately three months. How well do variant-tailored vaccines protect against serious disease and infection? In risk groups, protection against serious disease declines somewhat after the third dose. Variant-tailored vaccines restore protection against serious disease to the original level of about 90%. Healthy working-age people do not gain significant additional protection from a variant-tailored vaccine if they have received three doses of an original vaccine. Studies have shown that the protective effect of variant-tailored vaccines against infections caused by current variants is similar to that of the original vaccines. Two studies have been conducted in the United States to investigate the omicron vaccines tailored for the BA.4-5 strain and their effectiveness against infection in the working age population. In the first study, the vaccine offered 25-50% protection against infection during the first two months. The protective effect depended on how many doses a person had previously received and when they had received the most recent dose. During the study, the most common variants were the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants and their sublineages. In the second study, the vaccine tailored for BA.4-5 offered protection against symptomatic infection by 30% over a period of three months. Subjects were compared to people who had not received a variant vaccine. In these two studies of the BA.4-5 variant-tailored vaccine, the protective effect was calculated as an average of the study period. The efficacy of the vaccine was probably higher during the first month and declined towards the end. Does the vaccine reduce sick leave days? A Greek study has been conducted on the protection of the third vaccine dose for sick leave days among working-age people. The third vaccine dose reduced sick leave by 1.6 days, i.e. about 17% compared to people who were not fully vaccinated. The effect lasted under 4 months after vaccination. Previously infected people were excluded from the study, which nowadays covers a major part of the working age population. Becoming infected with coronavirus enhances immunity, which can alleviate the next infection. In this case, the reduction in sick leave days would not be as high as among people who have not had the disease. The greatest benefits of vaccinations come from the first three doses Generally speaking, healthy working-age people benefit the most from the first two vaccine doses. The third dose still further enhances protection significantly. Instead, any additional benefit from a fourth vaccine dose is clearly lower. The benefits of the vaccination are also impacted by the fact that symptoms caused by Omicron are less severe than those of previous variants. People in risk groups do benefit from further booster doses.

Vaccine (2022); 40:7660-7666 - Protection against the infection and protection against severe disease are partly based on different mechanisms. Protection against the infection is based on neutralising antibodies. Their number declines during the months following the infection or the vaccination. In addition, only some of the remaining antibodies recognise the mutated viruses, so the virus variants are able to get around this antibody-mediated immunity. As the incubation time of an infection through mucous membrane is very short, a high level of antibodies is generally needed to prevent infection. Protection against severe disease in turn is additionally based on cell-mediated immunity and memory cells. When the virus is encountered again, cell-mediated immunity recognises the infected cells and launches the body's defence mechanism. As a result of the infection, the memory cells are also activated and produce more antibodies. Cell-mediated immunity stays for a long time and the mutations of the viruses do not essentially affect the ability of cell-medicated immunity to recognise variants. - The vaccines are effective although infections occur in spite of them. The purpose of the coronavirus vaccination is, in particular, to protect you against a severe disease requiring hospitalisation, the aftereffects and death caused by the disease. Protection against severe disease is clearly better and longer than protection against infection. If you contract a coronavirus infection despite having been vaccinated, your disease is likely to be milder than if you had not been vaccinated. Many other vaccines work in this way, too: the flu vaccine, for example, primarily prevents serious cases of influenza. What kind of protection do the vaccines give against infections? During the first 2 to 3 months, the protection provided by two vaccine doses against infection caused by omicron is approximately 20% to 40%. After three months, there is practically no protection against mild infection or becoming infected. The protection against infection provided by the third and any subsequent boosters is approximately 40-50 per cent at first, but it gradually declines until it is gone approximately after three months. The omicron variant has been observed to evade antibody-based protection against infection more often than previous variants. Before omicron, vaccines provided a long-lasting and good protection against infections caused by variants current at that time. From the perspective of protection against the infection, even those who have had the disease will get short-term benefits from the vaccinations, but additional doses do not bring significant benefits, as protection against reinfections always decreases to a lower level after a short period of time. Hybrid immunity created by a COVID-19 infection and vaccine doses may slightly extend the duration of the protection against infection compared to those who have only received vaccine doses. Vaccines tailored to specific variants are primarily used as booster doses to broaden the range of the immunological response. [Two doses of the coronavirus vaccine provide good protection against serious disease caused by omicron, 3rd dose gives excellent protection (THL press release, 11 January 2022)](/en/web/thlfi-en/-/two-doses-of-the-coronavirus-vaccine-provide-good-protection-against-serious-disease-caused-by-omicron-3rd-dose-gives-excellent-protection) - The body's defence mechanism is activated immediately after the vaccination. - After the first dose, it takes less than three weeks with mRNA vaccines and around three weeks with adenovirus vaccines for protection to develop. - After the second dose, the protection improves faster than this, or in about one week. - After a third vaccine dose and later booster doses the protection increases quickly in about a week. To get as good and as long-lasting protection as possible it is important to take a full series of vaccines. The interval between the doses is also significant. The best effectiveness is reached when the two doses are administered with an interval of six weeks or longer. In Finland, a second vaccine dose is recommended after 6 months for those who have received the Janssen vaccine. The protection provided by the vaccines appears to decline more quickly in older persons and persons in medical at-risk groups than in the rest of the population. - Studies indicate that there is little difference in the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines used in Finland after two vaccinations have been administered. [Two doses of the coronavirus vaccine provide good protection against serious disease caused by omicron, 3rd dose gives excellent protection (THL press release, 11 January 2022)](/en/web/thlfi-en/-/two-doses-of-the-coronavirus-vaccine-provide-good-protection-against-serious-disease-caused-by-omicron-3rd-dose-gives-excellent-protection) - The protection gained by a person who has been vaccinated depends on - the number of doses administered - the interval between the doses - the person's age - the person's chronic illnesses and medication, and - the virus variants circulating at the time. The results reported in studies are affected by the study design, testing practices, the rate at which those who fall ill seek treatment, and the severity of the disease against which effectiveness has been studied. - According to a Nordic study in which THL participated, using different vaccine preparations in a series of coronavirus vaccinations worked as well as when the same vaccine was used for each dose. Similar findings have been made in studies conducted in Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom and Canada. [THL study: Full vaccination series provides excellent protection against severe coronavirus disease, also among those receiving two different vaccines (THL press release, 3 September 2021)](/en/web/thlfi-en/-/full-vaccination-series-provides-excellent-protection-against-severe-coronavirus-disease-also-among-those-receiving-two-different-vaccines) - The possibility that the COVID-19 vaccine may relieve the after effects of coronavirus disease and the so-called long covid is currently being studied. Recent research evidence indicates that infected persons who have been vaccinated have long-lasting symptoms considerably less often than those who have not been vaccinated. - As far as we currently know, only COVID-19 vaccines prevent coronavirus disease. Getting the influenza vaccination is particularly important during the coronavirus epidemic because, at worst, having influenza and the coronavirus disease at the same time can lead to more severe symptoms. Neither is having a simultaneous influenza and coronavirus epidemic ideal in terms of the health care system's carrying capacity.
