How to Find Safe Wood Plates If you're looking for safe and non-toxic wood plates, there are a few things you'll want to keep in mind. First, avoid any plates that have been treated with chemicals or finishes. These can leach into your food and be harmful to your health. Second, choose plates made from hardwoods like maple or cherry. Softwoods like pine or cedar are more likely to absorb chemicals and finishes, so they're best avoided. Finally, make sure the plates are food-safe. This means they won't transfer any harmful chemicals or toxins into your food. You can find safe wood plates at many kitchen and tableware stores. How to Care For Your Wood Plates? Your wood plates are an investment that should last for many years with proper care. Here are a few tips on how to keep your wood plates looking their best. Always hand-wash your wood plates with mild soap and water. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive scrubbers, as these can damage the wood. After washing, dry your plates immediately with a soft cloth. Never put your wood plates in the dishwasher or microwave, as this can cause warping and cracks. Store your plates in a cool, dry place. Avoid exposure to direct sunlight or excessive humidity, as this can cause the wood to warp or crack.
