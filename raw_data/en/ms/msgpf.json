Methods: Sixty-four cases of patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia were randomly divided into control and treatment groups. These groups were treated with piperacillin-tazobactam and piperacillintazobactam+ Tanreqing injection respectively. Clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters of these patients were observed and compared. Results: The clinical and bacteriological assessment efficacy of the two groups was significantly different. The attenuation of clinical symptoms in treatment groups were was better than that in control group. After treatment, the White Blood Cell (WBC) count and C-reaction protein level in the two groups were significantly different. Conclusion: Utilizing the combination of piperacillin-tazobactam and Tanreqing injection to cure acute hospital-acquired pneumonia showed a better clinical efficacy.Author(s): Chungang Wu "}
