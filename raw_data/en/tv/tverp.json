Seven comments in, and no one has made a comparison to Goop? \"Goop for sportsball fans.\" Boom. It's done. Move on. \"[N]asal flushing with herbal powders, oils, or clarified butter\" might definitely kill you, or at least give you an infection requiring real medical treatment.I will be honest, I skimmed the paragraphs but had to stop and slowly read the \"Be your own healer\" section. Wow! I've done some extreme activities that you are advised to stop eating a while beforehand and an enema is highly encouraged. But you need to learn how to handle it because there are impacts that you need to adjust your behavior to and time your outing into the world because it can make everything... ...not great. The process outlined above is going to be the gift that keeps giving for much longer than anyone is going to want to deal with. I don't think it will kill anyone, but the inconveniences involved are going to be significant. And that is an awesome bit of schadenfreude. Jesus Christ we're sliding back into the dark ages And our descent is being lubricated by excess enema oil.Jesus Christ we're sliding back into the dark ages Not much of a recommendation. Other things that went on for thousands of years: tapeworms, sexually transmitted diseases, high infant mortality, slavery...It's been going on for thousands of years... Why are people so obsessed with \"cleaning\" the organism? It does not work that way. If you have collected toxins over years, and if your liver and kidneys couldn't handle it, why do you think that purging your colon will suddenly resolve the issue? Yes, it's really strange, especially considering that actual treatment for toxic accumulation usually involve pissing rather than pooping.Why are people so obsessed with \"cleaning\" the organism?

I wonder if he's suffering from brain damage.Aaron Rodgers, the guy who alienated his family and is a renowned anti-vaxxer. I am not surprised. Seven comments in, and no one has made a comparison to Goop? \"Goop for sportsball fans.\" Boom. It's done. Move on. I was about to, but you pre-empted me. Good. Rodgers and Paltrow really need to combine forces. Can you imagine the power of their offspring? I mean, they wouldn't be fertile, but they'd be able to grift like a Trump... And the mental health aspect you alluded to does do wonders on the body to the point where a placebo treatment could lead to actual health improvements purely because you're tricking you brain to think it's helping. Which is fine if placebo is a sugar pill, not so much when the placebo 'treatment' is itself dangerous.Because it's a super attractive idea.Why are people so obsessed with \"cleaning\" the organism? It does not work that way. If you have collected toxins over years, and if your liver and kidneys couldn't handle it, why do you think that purging your colon will suddenly resolve the issue? You feel lousy, you've been eating like crap, you're stressed, whatever. Then someone tells you that they can wash all that away. It's a quick fix. It's 'easy' in that someone just does all this woo woo stuff and you spend a few days oiling your colon or snorting butter but then you're fast tracked to being your awesome self again. People want to believe that. And if it was pretty harmless, like just meditating and eating right for a bit while you try and relax it would probably be a great idea. Being mindful and taking care of yourself and letting go of stress sounds good to me. But yeah, this all sounds like it's potentially gonna mess you up instead. Like most shortcuts it's too good to be true. I'll admit I'm gonna miss Rogers when he's gone. His sideline whiny-ass pout when things don't go his way is second only to Brady's. Kyler Murray might take over the coddled QB tantrum mantle though. It's because they've been told they're full of shit but they think we meant it literally.Why are people so obsessed with \"cleaning\" the organism? It does not work that way.

Roughly translated as the \"knowledge of life,\" Ayurveda is a traditional method of medical treatment in India that has been practiced for more than 3,000 years. It is based on the concept that illness arises when the body's three systems, or doshas, are out of balance. To balance the nervous (Vata), the venous (Pitta) and the arterial (Kapha) systems, Ayurvedic practitioners primarily prescribe medicinal herbs and massage with oil. Additional healing methods can include yoga, sweat baths, meditation, medical enemas and nasal cleansing. Rooted in Hinduism, the philosophy of Ayurvedic medicine contends that the body, mind and soul are connected to the outer world. When the relationship among these elements of one's personality is out of balance, health problems arise. The practice has evolved in recent years to treat such modern health concerns as addiction, work stress, weight loss and infertility. Modern Indian society recognizes Ayurveda as a legitimate medical system. Practitioners receive state-licensed, institutionalized medical training. Approximately two-thirds of India's rural people, who comprise 70 percent of the population, use Ayurveda for their primary health care needs. In the United States, approximately 751,000 people have received Ayurvedic treatment, according to a 2004 National Center for Health Statistics study. I \"invented\" this one day when I was recovering from mild food poisoning (not actually believing myself to have invented anything, I was just out of oatmeal or semolina to make a bland porridge).@Beth I am Indian & I have never heard of this stuff....... ....and I wouldn't even think about doing any of that on season or off season The rice/lentil gruel \"kichiri\" is actually very easy to make & eaten with yoghurt It's very good if you have an upset stomach/food poisoning & is very mild cooked rice + boiled lentils (mashed) & drain excess water and eat it with plain white yoghurt.
