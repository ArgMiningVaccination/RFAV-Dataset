PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Suspension for injection. Clear l iquid with a white precipitate. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications IXIARO is indicated for active immuni sation against Japanese encephalitis in adults , adolescents, children and infants aged 2 months and older . IXIARO should be conside red for use in individuals at risk of exposure through travel or in the course of their occupation. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology Adults (18 to 65 years of age) The primary vaccination series consists of two separate doses of 0.5 ml each , according to the following conventional schedule: First dose at Day 0. Second dose: 28 days after first dose. Rapid schedule Persons aged 18 to 65 years can be vaccinated in a rapid schedule as follows: 3 First dose at Day 0. Second dose: 7 days after first dose. With both schedules, primary immuni sation should be completed at least one week prior to potential exposure to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) (see section 4.4) . It is recommended that vac cinees who received the first dose of IXIARO complete the primary 2 -dose vaccination course with IXIARO. If the primary immunization of two injections is not completed, full protection against the disease might n ot be achieved. There is data that a second injection given up to 11 months after the first dose results in high seroconversion rates (see section 5.1). Booster dose A booster dose (third dose) should be given within the second year (i.e. 12 - 24 months) after primary immunization, prior to potential re -exposure to JEV. Persons at continuous risk for acquiring Japanese encephalitis (laboratory personnel or persons residing in endemic areas) should receive a booster dose at month 12 after primary immuniz ation (see section 5.1). Long- term seroprotection data following a first booster dose administered 12 - 24 months after primary immunization suggest that a second booster should be given 10 years after the first booster dose, prior to potential exposure t o JEV. Elderly (>65 years of age) The primary vaccination series consists of two separate doses of 0.5 ml each, according to the following conventional schedule: First dose at Day 0. Second dose: 28 days after first dose. The p rimary immuni sation should be completed at least one week prior to potential exposure to Japanese encephalitis virus ( JEV) (see section 4.4) . It is recommended that vac cinees who received the first dose of IXIARO complete the primary 2 -dose vaccination course with IXIARO. If the primary immunization of two injections is not completed, full protection against the disease might not be achieved. There is data that a second injection given up to 11 months after the first dose results in high seroconversion rates (see section 5.1). Booster dose As with many vaccines, the immune response in elderly persons to IXIARO is lower than in younger adults. Duration of protection is uncertain in elderly persons , therefore a booster dose (third dose) should be considered before any further exposu re to JE virus . Long -term seroprotection following a booster -dose is not known. Paediatric Population Children and adolescents from 3 years to < 18 years of age The primary vaccination series consists of two separate doses of 0.5 ml according to the foll owing schedule: First dose at Day 0. Second dose: 28 days after first dose. Children from 2 months to < 3 years of age The primary vaccination series consists of two separate doses of 0.25 ml according to the following schedule: First dose at Day 0. Secon d dose: 28 days after first dose. 4 See section 6.6 for instructions on preparing a 0.25 ml dose for children aged 2 months to <3 years. It is recommended that vac cinees who received the first dose of IXIARO complete the primary 2 -dose vaccination course w ith IXIARO. Booster dose ( Children and adolescents ) A booster dose (third dose) should be given within the second year (i.e. 12 - 24 months) after primary immunization, prior to potential re -exposure to JEV. Children and adolescents at continuous risk for acquiring Japanese encephalitis (residing in endemic areas) should receive a booster dose at month 12 after primary immunization (see section 5.1). Children and adolescents from 3 years to < 18 years of age should receive a single 0.5 ml booster dose. Children from 14 months to < 3 years of age should receive a single 0.25 ml booster dose. See section 6.6 for instructions on preparing a 0.25 ml dose for children aged 2 months to <3 years. No long -term seroprotection data beyond two years after a first b ooster administered 1 year after primary immunization has been generated in children. Children below 2 months of age The safety and efficacy of IXIARO in children younger than 2 months has not been established. No data are available. Method of administr ation The vaccine should be administered by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle . In infants , the anterolateral aspect of the thigh may be used as injection site. IXIARO should never be injected intravascularly. When IXIARO is administered con comitantly with injectable vaccines, they should be given with separate syringes at opposite sites . Exceptionally, IXIARO can also be administered subcutaneously to patients with thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorders since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration. Subcutaneous administration could lead to a suboptimal response to the vaccine (see section 4.4). However, it should be noted that there are no clinical efficacy data to support administration by the subcutaneous route. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to the residue s protamine sulphate , formaldehyde, bovine serum albumin, host cell DNA, sodium metabisulphite (see section 2.) , host cell protei n. Individuals who show hypersensitivity reactions after receiving the first dose of the vaccine should not be given the second dose. Administration must be postponed in persons with acute severe febrile conditions. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions fo r use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervisio n should always be available to treat rare cases of anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine. Under no circumstances should IXIARO be administered intravascularly. 5 As with any other vaccine, vaccination with IXIARO may not result in protection in all cases . IXIARO will not protect against encephalitis caused by other micro -organisms. Like other intramuscular injections, this vaccine should not be administered intramuscularly to persons with thrombocytopenia, haemophilia or other bleeding disorders (see section 4.2). In adults a seroconversion rate of 29.4 % has been observed 10 days after the first i.m. vaccination, and 97.3 % one week after the second i.m. vaccination in the conventional schedule . After immunisation with the rapid schedule a seroconversion rate of 99% has been observed 7 days after the second i.m. vaccination. Hence, primary immuni sation should be completed at least one week prior to potential exposure to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Protection against Japane se Encephalitis is not ensured until the second dose has been received. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Concomitant administration of IXIARO with other vaccines : Concomitant administration of IXIARO with inact ivated hepatitis A vaccine and with inactivated rabies vaccine in two different schedules has been evaluated in clinical stud ies. There was no interference with the immune response to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) or to hepatitis A or rabies v irus vaccines (see section 5.1). The safety profiles of IXIARO and the other studie d vaccines were not compromised when administered concomitantly . In patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy or patients with immunodeficiency an adequate immune response may no t be obtained. Paediatric population No interaction studies have been performed in children and adolescents . 4.6 Fertility , pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy There are limited amount of data from the use of IXIARO in pregnant women. In animal studies fi ndings of unclear clinical relevance have been identified (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, the use of IXIARO during pregnancy should be avoided. Brea st-feeding It is unknown whether IXIARO is excreted in human milk. No effects on the breastf ed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of the breast -feeding woman to IXIARO is negligible. However, in the absence of data and as a precautionary measure the use of IXIARO during lactation should be avoided. Fertility A study in ra ts did not indicate vaccine- related effects on female reproduction, foetal weight, survival and development of the off -spring. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines IXIARO has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines . 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The safety of Ixiaro was assessed in controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies in 5,021 healthy adults (from non-endemic countries ) and 1,559 children and adolescents ( mostly from endemic countr ies). Approximately 40% of treated subjects experienced systemic adverse reactions and approximately 54% experienced injection site reactions. They usually occur within the first three days after vaccination, are 6 usually mild and resolve within a few days. No increase in the number of adverse reactions was noted between first and second doses or following a booster dose in adults . Most commonly reported adverse reactions in adults included headache (20% of subject s), myalgia ( 13%), injection site pain (33% ), injection site tenderness (33%) and fatigue (12. 9%). Most commonly reported adverse reactions in children and adolescents included pyrexia, diarrh oea, influenza like illness, irritability, injection site pain , injection site tenderness, and injection site redness (see table 1) . Adverse reactions are listed according to the following frequencies: common: 1/10 Adult and older adults ( >65 years) population Blood and lymphatic system disorders Uncommon: thrombocytopenia arthralgia Rare: pain in extremity General disorders and administration site conditions Very common: injection site pain, injection site tenderness , fatigue Common: influenza like illness, pyrexia, other injection site reaction s e.g. redness, hardening, swelling, itching Uncommon: chills, malaise , asthenia Rare: oedema peripheral 7 *reported also from post -marketing experience Paediatric population (2 months to <18 years of age) Table 1: Frequency of adverse reactions observed in children given the 0.25 ml dose ( 2 months to < 3 years of age ) and in children and adolescents given the 0.5 ml dose ( 3 yea rs to <18 years of age ) Frequency of adverse reactions (%) by dose /age System Organ Class Preferred Term 0.25 ml N=783 2 months to <3 years 0.5 ml N=628 3 to <18 years Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders Lymphadenopathy 0.1 0.0 Metabolism and Nut rition Disorders Decreased appetite 8.2 1.9 Nervous System Disorders Headache 2.9 6.1 Respiratory, Thoracic and Medistinal Disorders Cough 0.5 0.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders Diarrhoea 11.9 1.4 Vomiting 7.3 1.9 Nausea 3.9 1.9 Abdominal pai n 0.1 0.0 Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Rash 6.3 1.4 Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Myalgia 3.0 7.1 General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Pyrexia 28.5 10.4 Influenza like illness 10.9 2.9 Irritability 10.9 1.9 Fatigue 3.5 3.5 Injection site redness 10.0 4.1 Injection site pain 6.1 14.1 Injection site tenderness 4.2 14.7 Injection site swelling 3.6 2.2 Injection site hardening 1.2 1.9 Injection site itching 0.6 1.6 Investigations Hepatic enzym es increased 0.5 0.2 Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 8 Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcar e professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V . 4.9 Overdose No sym ptoms related to were reported . Paediatric population: No case of overdose has been reported in the p aediatric population. Inadvert ent administration of an 0.5 m l dose of IXIARO in children aged 1 to <3 years does not pose any safety concerns (section 5.1.) . 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, Viral vaccines, Encephalitis vaccines. ATC code: J07BA02 Mechanism of action The mechanism of action of Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine s is not well understood. Studies in animals have shown that the vaccine triggers the immune system to produce antibodies against Japanese encephalitis virus that are most often protective. Challenge studies were performed in mice that were treated with hu man IXIARO antisera. These studies showed that almost all mice that had a Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test titre of at least 1:10 were protected from a lethal Japanese encephalitis virus challenge. Clinical efficacy and safety No prospective efficacy trials have been performed. Immunogenicity of IXIARO was studied in approximately 3,119 healthy adult subjects included in seven randomized, controlled and five uncontrolled Phase 3 trials and in approximately 550 healthy children included in two randomiz ed, controlled and two uncontrolled Phase 3 clinical t rials. Pivotal immunogenicity trial (adults) Immunogenicity of the vaccine was evaluated in a randomized, active controlled, observer blinded, multicenter Phase 3 clinical trial including 867 healthy m ale and female subjects given IXIARO or the US licensed JEV vaccine JE VAX (on a 0, 7 and 28 day schedule by subcutaneous injection). The co- primary endpoint was seroconversion rate (anti J EV antibody titer 1:10) and geometric mean titers (GMT) at Day 56 as assessed by a Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) for the entire study population. By Day 56, the proportion of subjects who had seroconverted was similar for both treatment groups (96.4% vs. 93.8% for IXIARO and JE VAX, respectively). GMT increased by Day 56 to 243.6 for IXIARO and to 102.0 for JE VAX, respectively. The immune responses elicited by IXIARO were non inferior to those induced by JE VAX (Table 2). 9 Table 2: Seroconve rsion rates and geometric mean titers o f IXIARO and JE VAX in the Per Protocol Population. Neutralising antibody titers against JEV were measured against the JEV strain SA 14- 14-2.

There was no significant difference between seroconversion rates of IXIARO and JE -VAX in subjects aged <50 years compared to those aged 50 years at Day 28 or Day 56 following vaccination. Geometric mean titers were significantly higher at Day 28 in subjects aged <50 years than those aged 50 years in the JE VAX group (80.9 vs. 45.9, p=0.0236) but there was no significant difference at Day 56 for this treatment group. There were no significant effects of age on geometric mean titer in the group receiving IXIARO. There was no significant difference between seroconversion rates in subjects aged <50 years compared to those aged 50 years at Day 28 or Day 56 for eit her treatment group. Antibody persistence (adults) Antibody persistence was evaluated in an uncontrolled Phase 3 follow up clinical trial, enrolling subjects who had completed two pivotal studies, and who received at least one dose of IXIARO. Long term immunogenicity of IXIARO was assessed in a subset of 181 subjects up to month 24 (Intent -to-treat (ITT) population) and in 152 subjects up to month 36 after the first IXIARO vaccination. Rates of subjects with PRNT 501:10 and GMTs at Months 2, 6, 12, 24 and 36 are summarized in Table 3 for the ITT population. Table 3: Rates of subjects with PRNT 501:10 and geometric mean titers (GMT) at Month 2, 6 , 12, 24 and 36 after vaccination with IXIARO (ITT population) Rate of subjects with PRNT 501:10 GMT Time point % (n/N) 95% Confidence 52.6] 10 The observed decline in GMT is as expected and compares well with data from other inactiv ated JE vaccines. In another open- label, follow -up Phase 3 study, the persistence of antibodies up to 24 months after primary vaccination was assessed. A total of 116 subjects who had received the recommended primary schedule of IXIARO were included in this follow -up study. Rates of subjects with PRNT 501:10 were 82.8% (95% CI: 74.9, 88.6, Month 12 (95% CI: 49.1, 66.9, CI: 39.4, 57.3, N=116) of subjects who completed the recommended primary imm unization still had PRNT 50 titers of 1:10. GMT in these subjects was 16.2 (95% CI: 13.8, 19.0) at Month 24. Booster immunisation (adults) In an uncontrolled, open- label phase 3 study a single 6 mcg (0.5 ml) booster dose of IXIARO was given at month 15 a fter primary immunization. All of the 198 subjects treated were included in the ITT and Safety Populations . Rates of subjects with PRNT 501:10 and GMT over time are summarised in table 4: Table 4: Rates of subjects with PRNT 501:10 and GMT before and at months 1, 6 and 12 after a single 6 mcg (0.5 ml) booster dose administered to subjects at 15 months after recommended primary immunization with IXIARO (ITT population) Rate of subjects with PRNT 501:10 immunisation (adults) In an uncontrolled, open- label extension to the booster study described above, 67 subjects were followed up for determination of JEV neutralizing antibody titres at approximately 6 years after a booster dose. 96% of subjects (64/67) still had protective antibody levels ( 501:10 ), a GMT of 148 (95%CI: 107; 207). Mathematical modelling was applied to project the average duration of protection. Based on this model, it is estimated that average duration of protection will be 14 years and 75% of vaccinees will retain protective antibody levels ( PRNT 501:10 ) for 10 years. A second booster should therefore be given 10 years after the first booster dose, administered 1 year after the primary immunization, prior to potential exposure to JEV. Rapid immunisation schedule (adults) The immunogenicity of IXIARO administered in a rapid vaccination schedule was evaluated in a randomized, observer -blind, phase 3 study . A total of 217 subjects aged 18 to 65 years received IXIARO together with inactivated rabies vaccine (Rabipur) in a rapid immunisation schedule on Day 0 and Day 7 and 56 subjects received IXIARO alone in the conventional immunisation schedule on Day 0 and Day 28. The proportion of subjects that seroconverted by 7 and by 28 days after the last immunisation was similar for both schedules. Seroconversion rates and antibody titers also remained comparably high up to 12 months after the first immunisation in both schedules ( Table 5). The rapid schedule was tested for concomitant administration of IXIARO and Rabipur but it can also be used for administration of IXIARO alone, as no immune interference of the two vaccines has been observed ( see section 4.5). 11 Table 5: Seroconversion rates and GMT s for anti -JEV neutralizing antibodi es on Day 0, 14, 21, 35, 56 and 365 after immunis ation with IXIARO and inactivated rabies vaccine in a rapid schedule and IXIARO alone in a conventional schedule (P er Protocol population) Seroconversion Rate (Rate of subjects with PRNT 501:10 ) GMT (plaque reduction neutralization test) Rapid Schedule % (n/N) Conventional Schedule % (n/N) Rapid Schedule (N) Conventional Schedule (N) Vaccination scheme IXIARO Day 0,7 Rabipur Day IXIARO Day 0, 28 - Day 0 6 (13/215) 9 (5/55) 5.63 (215) 5.73 (55) Day 14 99 (206/209) NA 715 (209) NA Day 21 100 (207/208) NA 1255 (208) NA Day 35 99 (203/206) 100 (47/47) 690 (206) 376 (47) Day 56 98 (200/204) 100 (49/49) 372 (204) 337 (49) Day 365 94 (188/199) 88 (42/48) 117 (199) 39 (48) NA= not applicable Incomplete primary immuni zation (adults) The immunogenicity of booster doses was also assessed in the study investigating persistence of immunity following different primary immunization 6 mcg (0.5 ml) booster dose was administered at 11 or 23 months after the first dose to subjects, which were determined to be seronegative (PRNT 50 titers < 1:10) at month 6 and/or month 12 after the primary immunization. Results indicate that the second injection of the primary immunization series can be given up to 11 months after the first dose. The immune responses to further doses at different time points after complete or incomplete primary immunization are shown in table 6. Table 6: SCR and GMT at four weeks after a single 6 mcg booster dose administered to subjects with a PRNT 50 <1:10 (PRNT 50<1:10 means a subject is no longer seroprotected) at month 11 or month 23 after recommended primary immunization (2x 6 mcg) or incomplete (1x6 mcg) primary immunization with (ITT population) (n / N) SCR GMT [95% CI] Booster following recommended primary immunization (2x6 mcg) Booster at Month 11 (17 / 17) 100 % 673.6 [378. 7, 1198.2] Booster at Month 23 (27 / 27) 100 % 2536.7 [1467.7, 4384. 4] Second dose following incomplete primary immunization (1x6 mcg) Second dose at Month 11 (99 / 100) 99 % 504.3 [367.3, 692.3] Second dose at Month 23 (5 / 5) 100 % 571.4 [88.2, 3702.9] 12 Concomitant use (adults) Concomitant administration of IXIARO with inactivated hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccine (HAVRIX 1440) The concomitant use of IXIARO with inactivated hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccine (HAVRIX 1440) has been explored in one clinical trial. There was no interference with the immune response to the JE virus and HAV, respectively. Concomitant administration of IXIARO and inactivated hepatitis A vaccine was shown to be non- inferior to single vaccinations with regard to GMT of anti -JE virus neutralizing antibody and HAV antibody, and for seroconversion rates of both antibody types ( Table 7).

No interference was observed with regards to geometric mean titer (GMT) and seroconversion rates for anti JEV neutralizing antibodies (Table 8). There was also no interference with the immune response to Rabipur .

JEV neutralizing antibodies were determined 42 days after the second dose of the primary series (Day 70) . Elderly persons have a lower immune response to vaccination compared to younger adults or children, in terms o f seroconversion rates (percentage of subjects with PRNT 50 titer 1:10 ) and geometric mean titers (Table 9 ). 13 Table 9: Seroconversion rat es and geometric mean titer of JEV neutralizing antibody at Day 70 in the Intent -to-treat Population, for the entire study population and stratified by age Seroconversion rat es and geometric mean titer for JEV neutralizing antibody at Day 70 n / N SCR GMT 95% CI Total Study Population 42.2 19.2, 92.7 Paedi atric population In a phase 2 study in healthy Indian toddlers aged 1 year to <3 years , 24 children were vaccinated with 0.25 ml of IXIARO (the licensed dose for this age group) and 24 children received the adult 0.5 ml dose. Data are limited but there w ere no differences in the safety profile between the 0.25 ml and the 0.5 ml dose in this age group. Immunogenicity and safety of IXIARO in children and adolescents from a JEV -endemic country The safety and immunogenicity of IXIARO were evaluated in a rand omized, controlled, open- label clinical trial conducted in the Philippines, where JEV is endemic. The safety profile of IXIARO was compared to control vaccines Havrix ( Hepatitis A vaccine, p aediatric 720 was performed in a subset of the study population and included the determination of the seroconversion rate (SCR), defined as JEV neutralizing antibody titer 1:10, the proportion of subjects achieving an at least four - fold increase in antibody titers and the geometric mean titer (GMT) at Day 56 and Month 7, by dose and by age group. T he immune responses elicited by IXIARO are presented in Table 10 . 14 Table 10: Seroconver sion r ates, rates of subjects with at least 4-fold increase in JEV neutralizing antibody titers and Geometric Mean Titers at baseline, Day 56 and Month 7 stratified by age group, Intent To Treat Population Vaccine Dose 0.25 m l 0.5 m l Age Group 2 months - <6 months 6 months - <12 months 1 year - < 3 years 3 years - < 12 years 12 years - < 18 years Seroconversion 4 -fold Increase in JEV Antibody Titers % 5 (20) 5.52 (124) 6.54 (101) 13.08 (140) Day 687.35 (9) 377.79 (19) 258.90 (121) 213.67 (100) 175.63 (10) 64.00 (18) 38.91 (125) 43.60 (100) 86.61 (137) Negative Pre- Vaccination titers were imputed to 5. Safety and to lerability was evaluated in the entire study population. Parents or subjects recorded adverse events on a diary card for the first seven days after each vaccination. Parents or subjects were asked for any unsolicited AEs on the day of the second vaccination and at in- person visits including a medical exam 28 days (Day 56) and 6 months (Month 7) after the second dose. The safety profile of IXIARO was comparable to that of Havrix or Prevenar . Antibody persis tence and booster dose in children and adolescents from a JEV -endemic country The persistence of JEV neutralizing antibodies after primary immunisation and safety and immunogenicity of an IXIARO booster dose 12 months after primary immuni zation were evalua ted in a randomized, controlled, open- label clinical trial conducted in the Philippines, where JEV is endemic (300 children, mean age 5.3 years, range 1.2 - 17.3 years) . 150 children were followed- up for three years without booster, additional 150 children received a booster after 1 year (0.25 ml if aged <3 years at time of the booster, 0.5 ml if aged 3 years and above) and were followed -up for further two years. Se roprotection rate (S PR) defined as neutralizing antibody titer 1:10 and geometric mean titer s (GMT) are presented in Table 11 . The booster dose led to a pronounced increase in GMTs and seroprotection rate remained at 100% two years after the booster. 15 Table 11: Seroprotection Rates and Geometric Mean Titers with and without a booster of IXIARO a t Month 12, 13, 24 and 36, Intent To Treat Population Without Booster N = 150 Booster dose 12 months after primary immunization N = 149 Time point after primary immunization 0.25 mL Booster Dose N=81 0.5 mL Booster Dose N=67 Seroprotection 67 40 Month 13 n.a. 2911 1366 Month 24 50 572 302 Month 36 59 427 280 n.a. = not available Immunogenicity and safety in children and adolescents from non -endemic countries The safety and immunogenicity of IXIARO was evaluated in an uncontrolled, open- label clin ical trial conducted in the United States, Europe and Australia in healthy male and female subjects with planned travel to JEV -endemic areas. Children and adolescents aged 3 to < 18 years received two vaccine doses of 0.5ml and children aged 2 months to < 3 years received two vaccine doses of 0.25ml on Day 0 and Day 28 by intramuscular injection .

In a reproductive and pre -/post -natal toxicity study, no vaccine -related effects were detected on reproduction, foetal weight, survival and development of the off -spring. However, incomplete ossification of parts of the skeleton was observed in the group receiving 2 doses, but not in the group receiving 3 doses. It is currently difficult to explain if this phenomenon is treatment related or not. 6.

How to store IXIARO 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What IXIARO is and what it is used for IXIARO is a vaccine against the Japanese encephalitis virus. The vaccine causes the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against this disease. IXIARO is used to prevent infection with the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). This virus is mainly found in Asia and is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes that have bitten an infected animal (like pigs). Many infected people develop mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. In people who develop severe disease, JE usually starts as a flu -like illness, with fever, chills, tiredness, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Confusion and agitation also occur in the early stage of disease. IXIARO should be given only to adults , adolescents, children and infants aged 2 months and older travelling to countries , where JE is ende mic or who are at risk through work . 2. What you need to know before you and /or your child receive IXIARO Do not use IXIARO : If you and/or your child are allergic (hypersensitive) to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). If you and/or your child have developed an allergic reaction after receiving a former dose of IXIARO. Signs of an allergic reaction may include an itchy rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face and tongue. If you and/or your child are ill with a high fever. In this case, your doctor will postpone the vaccination. Warnings and precautions IXIARO must not be injected into a blood vessel. Primary immunization should be completed at least one week prior to potential exposure to JEV. 29 Tell your doctor: If you and/or your child have experienced any health problems after previous administration of any vaccine. If you and/or your child have any other known allergies. If you and/or your child have a bleeding disorder (a disease that makes you bleed more than normal) or a reduction in blood platelets, which increases risk of bleeding or bruising (thrombocytopenia). If you r child is younger than 2 months of age, s ince IXIARO has not been tested in infants younger than 2 months of age. If your or your child's immune system does not work properly (immunodeficiency) or you and/or your child are taking medicines affecting your immune system (such as a medicine called cortisone or cancer medicine). Your doctor will discuss with you the pos sible risks and benefits of receiving IXIARO. Please note that: IXIARO cannot cause the disease it protects against. IXIARO will not prevent infections caused by other viruses than the Japanese encephalitis virus. As with any other vaccine, vaccination wi th IXIARO may not result in protection in all cases. You should take appropriate precautions for you and your child to reduce mosquito bites (adequate clothing, use of repellents, mosquito nets) even after receiving IXIARO. Other medicines and IXIARO Studies in humans to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of medicines (clinical trial s) have shown that IXIARO can be given at the same time with hepatitis A vaccine and rabies vaccine. Tell your doctor if you and/or your child are taking or have recently taken , or might take any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription or have recently received any other vaccine.
