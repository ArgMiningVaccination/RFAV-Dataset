The course is specifically designed for personnel working in Iowa child care businesses. The course addresses the administration of oral medications, eye drops and ointments, ear drops, nasal drops and sprays, topical creams/ointments, nebulizer treatments and metered -dose inhalers. The course does NOT address the admin istration of rec tal or injectable medications. The course does NOT address the use of herbal medicine, folk treatments or home remedies. When a child's parent ask s the child care provider to give the child these types of treatments, the family should be informed that the child care business policy does not allow the business to administer these medicines or treatments. These types of treatments should be delivered at home by the parents. Administration of herbal medicine, folk treatments or home remedies increases the liability risk for the child care business. Many of these types of treatments are not supported by valid and reliable medical research. Personnel eligible to complete th e Medication Administration Skills Competency course : Applicants to the course shall be at least 18 years of age, have a high sc hool diploma or equivalent, and have reading and writing English proficiency. Individuals responsible for handling and administering medications must be competent to follow the strict procedures of h andling medications and be able to understand the English language pharmacy and commer cial product medication labels. Completion of Essentials for Medication in Child Care is required prior to enrolling in this course. Course Instruction: The instruction f or this course consists of two segments. First, there is classroom instruction which includes lecture, power point presentations, participant handouts, large and small group activities, and relevant reading materials provided by the instructor. Participan ts will practice/demonstrate measuring and giving medication. The duration of thi s segment is estimated to take two hours for a class of approximately 15 participants. Competency Skills Evaluation: Individuals responsible for administering medication shal l successfully complete the competency skills evaluation. During the evaluation, the participant will give an individual demonstration of their competency and skills in accurate and safe medication measurement, administration, and documentation, using simulated medications. The participant will be evaluated using the Competency Skill s Evaluation Checklist tools found in Chapter 4. Individuals will be scheduled into this segment of the course. The Competency Skill 6 Assessment is estimated to require one -hour per participant. If the individual does not successfully complete the Competency Skill Assessment after three attempts, the participant is req uired to repeat the two hour classroom segment of the course. Medication administration is a serious responsibil ity and accuracy is the prime focus. Participants are expected to have a minimum of a passing score of 80% to successfully complete the Competency Skill Assessment. Individuals responsible for administering medication shall successfully complete the Compet ency Skill Assessment on an annual basis. Particip ants who have completed the two hour Medication Administrati on Skills Competency course will have a maximum of 30 days to complete the one hour initial competency skills evaluation. To renew the certificat e the competency skills evaluation must be completed no later than 30 days after the expiration date on the certificate. After a period of 30 days, the participant wil l be required to repeat the two hour course. The provider is responsible for scheduling t heir reassessment evaluation and must provide a copy of the comp letion certificates for the two hour course and initial skills assessment. Standards: Safe medication administration in child care businesses is a critical child health issue strongly correlat ed to child morbidity and mortality. A medication administration course should be repeated as recommended by state and/or local regulation. \"At a minimum, skill and competency should be monitored annually or whenever medication administration error occurs\" (American Academy of Pediatrics, American Public Health Association, National Resource Center for Health and Safety in Child Care and Early Education, 2011, p. 143) Personnel administering medications who are found to have repeated medication administrat ion errors should repeat the Medication Administration Skills Competency course and the Competency Skills Evaluation . The written policy of the child care business shall be consistent with the course principles and practices for training an d competency sk ills evaluation. 7 Instructional Objectives *Learning as Knowledge The participant will: 1.

In Iowa, 75% of families with all parents working have children under age six (Iowa Child Care Re source and Referral, 2014). 2. Greater than 50% of U.S. Children are exposed to one of more medications per wee k (Yin et al., 2014). 3. \"Children 18 years of age and younger make over 70,000 emergency visits each year for medication overdoses\" (Shone, Yin, a nd Wolf, 2010, p.218). 4. Over 60,000 children less than six years of age experienced out -of-hospital medication errors annually (Smith et al. , 2014). 5. Children in child care may need medications in the short term, such as a topical medication for a diaper rash or an antibiotic for an acute infection, or the child may need medication on an ongoing basis for chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes or seizure disorder. 6. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 protects the needs of children with chronic conditions who are in child care. a. Case law has determined that children may not be excluded from child care programs because of these conditions. (United States Department of Justice, 1997) b. Child care programs must be prepared to administer medic ations, at the very minimum, as required by the ADA. c. Safe medication administration in child care programs is necessary to ensure high - quality care and enable child care providers to adhere to the Americans with Disabilities Act (1990). d. Safe medication adm inistration assures children an opportunity to continue participation in developmentally appropriate activities with their peers. Who is Available to Help? 1. Iowa Department of Human Services 2. Iowa Department of Education 3. Iowa Department of Public Health 4. Healthy Child Care Iowa 9 Regulations that Influence Medication Administration 1. Medication administration is a task that is often specifically designated in nurse practice acts or Boards of Pharmacy as a function of a licensed nurse or health care profe ssional. 2. Iowa pharmacy regulations allow medication to be administered after proper instruction has been received. 1 3. Iowa Department of Human Services regulations for licensed child care centers and registered child development homes address criteria fo r medication administration in the child care setting.2 4. The Iowa Department of Education has regulations pertaining to schools and medication administration. 5. Personnel training is needed to safely administer medications to children in any child care setting. 6. Registered nurses may teach this course by virtue of their professional license, however there are some concerns that in doing so the registered nurse is delegating a nursing duty and therefore responsible for any errors made by their trainees. Is a nurse who trains a child care provider to administer medications delegating a nursing task? The Iowa Board of Nursing indicates the RN is not held responsible because instruction does not meet the definition of delegation. 7. In the child care setting, provi ders need training in the principles and skills of medication administration. 8. The registered nurse teaches the set of skills to the child care provider, rather than transferring a specific task for a specific patient with a specific order from a health c are provider. 9. The goal of medication administration training is to ensure that child care providers implement the medication administration activities safely and that children receive the medications they need from well -trained providers. 1 Personal communication with Iowa Board of Pharmacy, T.

Non -prescription Cough and Cold Medications The Food and Drug Administration does not recommend the use of non -prescription cough and cold medications (CCMs) for infants and children less than two years of age The American Academy of Pediatrics states that CCMs are not e ffective for children less than six years of age and can result in serious adverse effects. 15 Communicate With Parents to Identify Allergies or Chronic Illness At the time of enrollment and annually thereafter the following information should be gathered by the child care provider. 1. Document all child allergies (food, medication, and environmental) and reactions 2. Document if a child has a chronic illness a. Asthma b. Endocrine Disorders (Diabetes, etc.) c. Seizure Disorders 3. Have a written health care plan addressi ng procedures to be implemented in the event of a reaction or emergency 4. Determine need for emergency medication a. Asthma -Metered -dose inhaler/nebulizer (i.e. Seizure Disorders -Rectal (Diastat) Precautions to prevent medication errors 1. Do not allow parents to add medication to food, containers of formula or human milk brought from home for personnel to administer to child. This practice can le ad to possible overdosing of the medication. 2. Personnel should never give any medications that the person has not personally prepared. 3. Keep accurate medication records for each child 16 Chapter 3: Safe Handling and Proper Storage of Medications Discuss saf e handling, proper storage and arranging of prescription and non -prescription medications. Handwashing Hands must be as clean as possible to prevent contamination of medication, the medication container and applicator and to prevent the subsequent transfer of germs or medication particles from one child to another or to personnel administering the medication. Handwashing Procedure 1. Wet hands with warm running water 2. Apply soap, the soap is not required to be antibacterial 3. Vigorously rub soapy hands t ogether for 20 seconds 4. Completely dry hands with paper towel 5. Use the paper towel to turn off water facet 6. Discard paper towel in a covered foot pedal controlled waste receptacle Safe Guard Medications Medications can be vital to the health of child ren. However, they are also dangerous : 1) If the wrong medicati on is given to the wrong child 2) Inaccurate dose is given; or 3) If medication is administered at the wrong time. Medications should always be inaccessible to children to prevent poisoning wh ich may result in illness or death If a medication error or unintentional poisoning occurs, call your local poison control center immediately at 1 -800-222-1222 Due to the potential for errors in medication administration, it may often be safer for a paren t/guardian to administer their child's medicine at home Prescription medications can often be timed to be given at home and this is encouraged. 17 Risks of Improper Handling 1. Medication errors 2. Altered effectiveness of medication 3. Child poisoning 4. Child injury, disability, or death 5. Increased risk of liability 6. Loss or theft of medication Storage Medications should be s tored in the following manner: 1. Kept in the original container provided by the manufacturer/pharmacy a. May ask pharmacy to f ill two containers of medication. i. A bottle for child care ii. A bottle for home 2. Labeled appropriately 3. Do not accept medication that has another person's name on the label 4. Have child resistant caps a. Child resistant packing greatly decreases poison exposure incidents 5. Be alert for medications that look similar to food items/household products 6. Be kept in an organized fashion 7. Stored away from food or chemicals 8. Stored at proper temperature a. Should not be stored on top of refrigerators as this may alter med ication potency 9. Inaccessible to children and unauthorized staff a. Should not be left in diaper bags/backpacks 10. Prevents spillage a. Consider a storage container that allows liquid medications to remain upright 18 Medication Storage Containers 1. All medicati ons should be completely inaccessible to children 2. Secure medication storage systems are available a. A small lock box can be utilized to store medications requiring refrigeration. Medications should be clearly marked and stored separate from food items b. All medications prescribed for life -threatening allergies and chronic conditions should not be stored in a locked cabinet/container as they must be immediately accessible to trained staff. However, they must be inaccessible to children. i. Trained staff should b e able to quickly and properly administer prescribed medications in the event of an emergency c. All non -emergency medications should be stored in a safe, secure, and preferable locked location. 3. All storage devices must be able to be cleaned and sanitized Arranging Medications in Storage The child care setting should have designated area and container to store each child's medication individually according to the storage instructions on the container. Because administering medications is a daily event in m any child care settings, child care providers should consider purchasing and installing specific medication storage units or carts. When planning for medication storage, consi der all of the following issues: 1. Liquid medications should be stored upright to p revent spilling and contamination of other medications or items . 2. Tablets and capsules should be stored where they will not become damp or exposed to temperature variations . 3. Parents shall be personally handed the medications rather than place medications in a child's back pack or diaper bag. Medications are not to be handed to the child or an older sibling to take home . Refrigerated Medication Storage 1. Medication requiring refrigeration should be clearly labeled. 2. Keep medication separate from food items t o prevent contamination 3. Monitor and record refrigerator temperatures a. 32\u00b0-40\u00b0F is recommended i. Thermometers with markings in no more than 2\u00b0 increments should be utilized b. Do not freeze medication unless instructions clearly state to do so 19 4. Children with re frigerated medications should have this noted on the medication record NOTE: Guidelines for storage of medication applies to all medications whether they are prescribed or over -the-counter. If storage instructions do not accompany the medication container , the child care provider should call a pharmacy to ask about proper storage. The child care provider should ask the pharmacy the specific storage temperature that is appropriate for the medication. When to Contact Pharmacy The child's pharmacy should be contacted for the following circumstances: 1. If prescription or non -prescription medication does not have storage instructions, 2. If a medication guide/prescription information sheet was not provided or is not available Document communication with the phar macy on the child's medication record Removing Medications for Storage When removing medications from storage: 1. Compare the medication label to the medication record 2. Medications returned to the parent should also be compared with the medication record a. You must hand medication to parent/guardian i. Do not return in diaper bag/backpack ii. Do not give medication to an older child to transport b. Parents should be required to sign and date the medication record to verify return of medication Medication Disposal In the event that it is necessary for a child care program to dispose of medication, the following steps should be performed: 1. Complete a medication disposal form a. An example form can be found in the Appendix 2. Follow specific manufacturer/pharmacy disposal instructions 20 3. If disposal instructions are not available, remove medications from the original container and place in a sealable bag a. Mix with an undesirable substance and throw into trash i. Ensure that the trash is inaccessible to children Medication dispos al programs may be available at your local pharmacy or law enforcement agency. Medication Storage Safety Concerns Accidental ingestion of medication is the #1 cause of emergency room visits for adverse drug events for children less than five years of age The poison control number, 1 -800-222-1222, should be posted near every phone and stored in mobile devices. Identify the different forms of medication most commonly used in child care settings, the different routes of administering medication, and the method of measuring for the correct medication dose. 21 Chapter 4: Different Forms and Routes of Medication Administration Right Child Verify child's name on medication authorization form (from the health provider or parent), monthly medication record, and medication container. Many child care facilities now take a photo of the child and place a copy of the photo on the monthly medication record . Use the child care facility policy for identifying the child who is to receive medication. NOTE: For home providers, it is best that the primary caregiver is the one administering medications because they would be more familiar with the child and the med ication admin istration policy/procedure. Substitutes need to be adequat ely trained if they will be administering medications (routine medications and/or emergency medications). Right Medication Read the monthly medication record Read the medication label on the container for medication name, dose, route, and time to be given Select the right medication from the storage area Read and compare the medication label three times to the monthly medication record Be alert for medication names that sound alike Look at the appearance of the medication; note odor and color, note if th e appearance has changed Six Rights of Medication Administration 1. Right child 2. Right medication 3. Right dose 4. Right time 5. Right route (method of administration) 6. Right recording (documentation) 22 Be alert for medications that look like other medications If the medication looks discolored or damaged, do not give the medication NOTE: Generic medications may look different the size or color of the medication may be different when the prescription is refilled. Call the dispensing pharmacy if there is any variation in the medication appearance. Right Dose Read the monthly medication record Read the medication label on the container for medication name and dosage and compare with medicatio n record and authorization form Use appropriate measuring device for each medication Measure dose accurately Make certain the child takes all of the medication that is prescribed or recommended on the medication label. Child care provider may ne ed to look into the child's mouth to assure all of the medication was swallowed. NOTE: Child care providers may ask the parents to bring \"unit dosed\" medications where each dose of medication is packaged individually. Most pharmacies are able to dispense m edications in \"unit dose\" packaging. Right Time Read the monthly medication record Read the medication label for the times or frequency interval for giving medication NOTE: Some medications are ordered to be given three or four times a day. The child care provider should consult with the parent to determine the times medication will be given at home in order to set the time for medication administration at the child care facility. This will assure even spacing of medication dosage. Child care providers sho uld encourage parents to space the medication time so that most of medication dosages are given at home if possible. Know and follow the child care facility policy for accurate intervals for administering medication. Example, what times of day will the chi ld care provider give medications that are ordered to be given three times a day? NOTE: Use the Iowa Department of Inspection and Appeals guidance that allow for medications to be administered 15 minutes before or 15 minutes after the prescribed or recomme nded time for medication administration on the medication label. Example: if a medication is ordered to be given at 9 a.m. the medication could be given as early as 8:45 a.m. or as late as 9:15 a.m. and still are considered to have been given on time at 9 a.m. 23 Right Route Know the routes for giving medications: oral, inhalation, rectal, topical, etc. Read label on medication container for prescribed route and compare with medication record and authorization form. Read the label on the medication contai ner to determine if there are special instructions, for example is the medication to be given with water or food or is the medication not to be given with water or food Keep the medication container and monthly medication record together until you have administered the medication AND documented the medication was given on the monthly medication record Right Documentation Know your child care business policy and the correct procedure for documenting medication administration Correctly document the follow ing items for every medication given o Name of child o Name of medication o Route of medication o Time medication give n o Name of person administering the medication o Medication reactions Document immediately after administering the medication NOTE: All documentati on shall be done after giving each child their medication. Do not wait until all children have been given their medications and then go back to medication monthly records to document. Medication Reactions/Adverse Effects 1. Monitor child for medication reacti ons 2. Report to your supervisor and document on the monthly medication record all unusual reactions to medication, examples: vomiting, diarrhea, skin reactions, dizziness etc. 3. Report adverse effects to the child's parents/guardians 4. Child care providers sha ll document when medications are omitted and the reason the medication was not given. Omitted doses of medication shall be reported immediately to the child care supervisor and to the parent. The parent shall be notified of any omitted medication dose by h aving the child care provider call the parent. 24 Problems in Medication Administration 1. Refusal or spitting -out medication a. You may have a child that refuses to take a medication. Try to find out why he/she doesn't want to take the medication b. Report th e refusal to your supervisor c. Report the refusal to the child's parent d. Document the refusal on the monthly medication record following your child care policy e. The child care provider should not force or restrain a child in order to administer medication 2. Naus ea or vomiting a. If a child is nauseated, they may be unable to keep the medication in their stomach. b. Report the child's nausea or vomiting of medication to the supervisor c. Report the child's nausea or vomiting of medication to the child's parent d. Document th e time from when the medication was given and the time when the child vomited e. Follow your child care policy regarding inclusion or exclusion of ill child 3. Difficulty swallowing a. Ask parent about obtaining medication in a form that the child can swallow b. Give a sip of water before administering the medication c. Do not rush the child when giving medications d. Use a straw verses a glass when giving tablets or capsules e. Give liquid medications slowly f. Watch for choking. Call for help immediately if choking occurs. i. Know how to conduct Heimlich maneuver, rescue breathing and CPR Medication Errors 1. A medication error is defined as any violation of the six rights of medication administration. Medication errors can result in a medical emergency. 2. If you have followed the si x rights, you should never have a medication error. 3. Each facility must have a written policy for reporting and documenting medication errors and a policy for medical emergencies arising from medication error. 4. If an error occurs, it must be reported immedia tely to your supervisor and to the child's parent. 5. As the medication administrator, you have the responsibility to be absolutely accurate and honest. 6. If a child is given another child's medication, call the poison control center immediately and follow thei r directions. Poison Control Center 1-800-222-1222 25 7. Notify the parents of the child who mistakenly received the wrong medication. 8. Notify the health care provider of the child who received the wrong medication, inform the health care provider of all emergency actio n and recommendations from the Poison Control Center that have been initiated. 9. Notify the health care provider who prescribed the medication about the medication error. This allows the prescribing physician to understand the decrease in amount of medicatio n available for the child whose medication was used. 10. Complete an injury/incident report form for the medication error give a copy of the report form to the parent of the child (who received the wrong medication). 11. Follow your business policy regarding docum entation on the medication record the medication error. Methods to Prevent Medication Errors 1. Do not record a medication until after the medication is given. 2. Do not leave medications unattended. 3. Do not remove medications from their locked storage until you are ready to prepare the medication for administration. 4. Do not use medications from an unmarked container. 5. Do not give medication prescribed or authorized for one child to another child, this includes children from the same family. 6. Do not prepare liquid m edication ahead of time for administration. 7. Do not crush or mix medications together without receiving authorization and guidance from the child's pharmacist or health care provider. 8. Do not use medication which has fallen on the floor. 9. Do not talk or conve rse with others when preparing medications for administration. 10. Do not give medications that have been measured or prepared by someone else including the parent. 11. Do not document medication was given if you have not personally administered them. 12. Do not forge t to wash your hands before administering medication and between giving children their medication. NOTE: Listen when a child questions a medicine. Reread the order, the label, and the monthly medication record to make sure you have the correct medication. Establish one area of the classroom, facility, or home where medications and medication administration supplies are stored, prepared, and documented. Keeping the supplies and medication together will prevent the child care provider from interrupting medi cation preparation to retrieve supplies . 26 Forms of Medication Tablet - Solid dosage form containing a medication, also called \"pills\" Capsule - Medication inside a gelatin container Liquid Preparations - Syrup, elixir, emulsion, and suspension Other - Suppositories, inhalants, drops, and topical creams/ointments and salves. Medication Administration Guidelines Oral Medications -Tablets/Capsules When using medication from a bottle, open lid of container, tilt bottle, and pour correct number of tablets or capsules into lid of the medication container. Do not touch medication or inside of bottle or lid. The medication should be transferred to a small medication cup for administration. When identifying the correct dose, determine if the tablet needs to be split. If the tablet must be split look for a score mark. If the tablet is not scored, you will need to use a pill cutter. Oral Medications -Liquids When preparing a liquid medication, read the label to determine if the medication should be shaken before opening the container. When pouring liquid medication, tilt the bottle with medication label pointing up, towards palm of hand, to avoid spilling on the label. Utilize a paper towel to wipe off any excess medication from the lip of the medication container , prior to replacing cap. When measuring liquid medication perform the following steps: 1. Place the medication cup on a level surface and read dosage at eye level 2. Read the volume of the medication at the low level a. Some medications may form a dome or sauc er appearance when they are poured into a medication measuring cup 3. Look at medication measuring device to determine if accurate dosing has been measured A variety of measuring devices are used to administer liquid medications. Measuring devices include: 1) Oral syringe; 2) Dropper; and 3) Dosing cup. The correct medication measuring device must be provided with the medication. 27 In a study performed by Yin et al. (2014) it was found that of 287 parents, 41.1% made a medication dosing error. Accurate measur ement requires utilizing the correct measuring device and the ability to interpret measurement units. Liquid medication should not be mixed together with other liquid medications. Liquid medication should also not be mixed in infant bottles, child beverag es, or food unless the medication label directions give specific instructions to do so. Topical Medications Utilize clean (or sterile ) water and gauze to clean skin lesions/wounds. Do not reuse gauze to wipe skin. Gauze should be used for one wipe and dis carded. Medication should be applied with a sterile gauze pad. If more medication is needed, utilize a clean pad for each application. Eye Drops/Ointments It is beneficial to have an assist ant available when administering eye medications to young childre n. When preparing the medication you should hold the medication container in your hands until the container is at body temperature. When eye medication is at body temperature, it is less likely the child will blink eyes when giving the ointment or drops. If an eye dressing is present, remove dressing by gently pulling the dressing away from the forehead, and then pull it down and away from the eye area. Use sterile water and gauze to clean any eye drainage or discharge from the eye. Discard each piece of ga uze after one wipe of the eye. Wipe eye from inner corner of eye to outer corner. If eyes are very mattered with dry crusting, soak gauze in sterile water and place water soaked gauze on the closed eyes of child, to soften dry crusting. When preparing to administer medication, remove lid/cap on container and place on a piece of sterile gauze to prevent the inside of the lid/cap from becoming contaminated. Be careful not to touch the inside of the lid/cap. When preparing eye ointment, s queeze a small amoun t of ointment onto a piece of sterile gauze to remove any crust that may have formed in the tip of the medication tube. Discard this gauze During administration of eye ointment, apply ointment in a thin ribbon from the inner aspect to the outer aspect of the lower lid. Do not instill medication directly onto the eye. 28 When preparing eye drops from an eye dropper, draw the prescribed amount of the medication into the dropper by squeezing the rubber tip or plastic reservoir on the dropper. Do not turn the d ropper upside down after drawing the medication into the dropper. When preparing to administer eye drops directly from container, turn the vial upside down to allow the medication to drop from the tip of the vial. During administration, steady the hand h olding the medication dispensing device against the center of the child 's forehead. Place a finger on the skin below the lower eyelid and gently move the lower eyelid downward to open. Instill the correct number of drops into the inner corner of the lower lid. Once the eye medication has been administered, instruct the child to gently close their eyes. Instruct the child to not tightly squeeze the eyes shut. Ear Drops It is beneficial to have an assist ant available when administering ear drops to young chi ldren. When preparing the medication you should hold the medication container in your hands until the container is at body temperature. When ear medication is at body temperature, it is less lik ely the child will jerk or flinch when the medication is given . The entry to the ear canal should be cleaned with sterile water and gauze/cotton ball. Do not insert anything into the ear canal. During administration, if there is drainage or discharge visible in the ear canal document the color, thickness, and odor of the discharge. If blood is present in the ear canal, report this to supervisor and parents prior to giving the medication . The child's ear should be gently pulled down and back to administer medication. Do not touch the dropper to any part of the ear. Children with an active ear infection may resist having the ear pulled down and back due to pain. Ensure that you are very gentle and discuss all actions that you are going to take before touching the child 's ear. Once the medication has been administered , the child should lay in the side lying position for 2 -3 minutes to allow the medication to move into the ear canal. If drops are ordered for both ears, wait at least five minutes before putting drops in the second ear. 29 Nasal Drops/Sprays It is b enefi cial to have an assist ant availa ble when administering nasal drops or spray to young children. When removing the medication from storage, look at the color of the nasal drops. Change in the color of nasal drops can occur rapidly, indicating contamination. When preparing the medication you should hold the medication container in your hands until the container is at body temperature. When nasal medication is at body temperature, it is less like ly the child will jump or move when the medication is given. The nose should be cleaned with clean water and gauze prior to administering medication. Discard each piece of gauze after one wipe of drainage from the nose. Do not reuse the gauze to wipe the nose again. If the nose if full of drainage, contact parent about whether to administer the medication. When preparing nasal drops, measure correct dosage on marked dropper. Nasal drops should be administered by holding the dropper just above nostril, in upright position. Once the dropper is in position, squeeze the bu lb to deliver medication into one nostril. Do not touch the dropper to any part of the nose. If ordered, repeat procedure for other nostril. After administration, any medication that remains in the dropper should be discarded. Do not return unused medicati on back into the medication container. When administering nasal spray, gently insert tip of container into one nostril while holding opposite nostril closed. Spray medication into nostril as child sniffs. Repeat procedure for other nostril. If the child i s developmentally capable, let the child hold a tissue to blot away any excess medication that may drain from the nose. Do not let the child blow nose for several minutes as medication is absorbed. After administration, wipe the piece inserted into the nos tril with a clean tissue prior to replacing cap. Inhalation Medication Inhalant medication is administered by breathing into the respiratory system. This type of medication is administered through an inhaler or nebulizer. A metered dose inhaler is a pres surized canister that releases a fixed dose of medication in the form of an aerosol. A nebulizer is a device that delivers medication in the form of a mist to the airways. When preparing medication, pay close attention to special instructions. Some inhale rs must be shaken before use. A spacer is often required for inhaler medication. A spacer is a hollow tube that attaches to the inhaler. The spacer holds the medicine from the inhaler until the child is able to breathe it into their lungs. 30 When administer ing medication by an inhaler, position the child sitting comfortably and attach the spacer to inhaler. For young children, place the spacer into child's mouth, instruct the child to take a slow, deep breath as you depress the inhaler. For an older child, h ave child place spacer into mouth and instruct child to depress inhaler as they inhale slowly and deeply. Child should hold their breath for 10 seconds. Repeat steps if a second dose is prescribed. Replace cap on inhaler. It is beneficial to have an assis tant available when ad ministering a nebulizer treatment as the procedure takes several minutes to complete. You should perform the procedure in a comfortable environment and provide the child with an age appropriate, quiet activity. Nebulizer treatments ma y trigger coughing or vomiting. Tissues and a small waste container should be available. Perform the following steps when setting up a nebulizer: 1. Place medication in reservoir and attach reservoir top 2. Attach reservoir to tubing 3. Attach mouthpiece or mas k 4. Ensure tubing is secured to nebulizer device 5. Turn on machine when child has mouthpiece or mask in position. Children will require different positions, equipment, and technique depending on their developmental age: 1. Infants a. Held by caregiver or positio ned upright b. Place mask over child's nose and mouth 2. Young Child a. Sitting comfortably b. Place mouthpiece or mask over child's nose and mouth c. Ask child to take slow, deep breaths 3. Older Child a. Sitting comfortably b. Have child place mouthpiece or mask c. Ask chi ld to inhale slowly and deeply Inhaler, spacer, and nebulizer equipment should be cleaned per manufacturer guidelines. 31 Competency Skills Evaluation Checklist Oral Medications (Tablets/Capsules) Oral Medications (Liquids) Topical Medications Eye Drops /Ointments Medications (Tablets/Capsules) Performance Action Yes No 1 Wash Hands 2 Identify and gather supplies: Medication cup, pill cutter, appropriate measuring device, etc. 3 Review medication record 4 Read label on medication container and compare with medication record and authorization form (Medication check #1) 5 Identify the Right Child 6 Identify the Right Medication 7 Identify the Right Dose 8 Identify the Right Time 9 Identify the Right Route 10 Read medication label for special instructions or preparation 11 Check the expiration date on the bottle 12 Read label on medication container and compare with medication record and authorization form (Medication check #2) 13 Open medication container and dispense correct number of tablets/capsules into lid of container Note: Do not touch medication or inside of b ottle or lid 14 Pour the medication dose into a small medication cup 15 Replace the lid on the medication container 16 Take medication and supplies to the child and discuss the procedure 17 Review the medication label and again compare wit h medication record and authorization form (Medication check #3) 18 Put on gloves 19 Have child place tablet/capsule in mouth directly from the medication cup or assist the child with placing tablet/capsule in mouth 20 Allow child time to swal low medication 21 Give child a drink of water (if allowed) 22 Ensure the medication is swallowed and observe for choking or spitting out medication 23 Remove Gloves 24 Wash Hands 25 Document medication given on the child's medication re cord 26 Return medication container to proper storage area 33 Performance Action Yes No 27 Clean medication preparation area and supplies 28 Return unused equipment/supplies to storage area 29 Observe child for adverse reactions to medication Competency Skill Asses Medications (Liquids) Performance Action Yes No 1 Wash Hands 2 Identify and gather supplies: Medication cup, ap propriate measuring device, etc. 3 Review medication record 4 Read label on medication container and compare with medication record and authorization form (Medication check #1) 5 Identify the Right Child 6 Identify the Right Medication 7 Identify the Right Dose 8 Identify the Right Time 9 Identify the Right Route 10 Read medication label for special instructions or preparation Note: Do not mix liquid medications together.
