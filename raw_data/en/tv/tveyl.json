Cells in our body have a predictable 24-hour cycle of division that is regulated by a mix of genetic and environmental cues, such as exposure to light, temperature, and hormone levels. The Finkielstein Lab offers a critical foundation for the emerging field of chronotherapeutics - the study of time-of-day medicine. This new discipline integrates the cellular and molecular biology of circadian rhythms to inform decision-making about when a therapeutic should be administered to yield the best results. A fundamental feature of all living organisms is the presence of two 24h-oscillating cyclic systems. One, the circadian clock, dictates the timing of many physiological responses and provides the cell with information that can be used to anticipate daily environmental changes. The second highly periodic system is devoted to controlling cell division and mediates the entry into and exit from the cell cycle. We now know that the proper timing of cell division is a major factor contributing to the regulation of normal growth and emerges as a fundamental process in the development of most cancers. Thus, the Finkielstein Lab investigates some of the basic mechanisms that regulate cell cycle transitions, the contribution of environmental cues to ensure timely progression throughout it, and how both cycles are interlocked at the molecular level. Accordingly, a second area of research focuses in the role of circadian clock proteins as important endogenous factors that contribute to cancer development and progression. Core circadian clock genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms (from the Latin circa diem, \"about a day\"). Several studies have shown that about 7% of all circadian-controlled genes regulate either cell-cycle progression or apoptosis. These observations made scientists wonder whether the circadian and cell cycle systems operating within an individual cell might be interlocked by sharing some critical elements. Specifically, the Finkielstein Lab explores the means by which loss of circadian function impairs apoptosis in response to ionizing radiation, leading to genomic instability and accumulation of damaged cells. The methodologies we use are cellular and molecular biology, structure-based analysis, and systems biology. Period 2 (Per2) is a transcriptional regulator placed at the core of the circadian clock mechanism that is responsible for generating the negative feedback loop that sustains the clock. Its relevance to human disease is underlined by alterations in its function that impacts numerous biochemical and physiological processes. When absent, it results in the development of various cancers and an increase in the cell's susceptibility to genotoxic stress. The Finkielstein Lab's most recent findings place the circadian factor Period 2 (Per2) at the heart of the checkpoint response in cells by showing that Per2 interacts directly with the tumor suppressor p53 and its oncogenic regulator Mdm2, thereby participating in the control of downstream p53 signaling. The lab found that Per2 binds the C-terminus half of human p53 (p53) and forms a stable trimeric complex together with p53's negative regulator Mdm2. They determined that Per2 binding to p53 prevents Mdm2 from being ubiquitinated and targeting p53 by the proteasome. Accordingly, down-regulation of Per2 expression directly impacts p53 levels whereas its overexpression influences both p53 protein stability and transcription of targeted genes. Overall, the lab's findings place Per2 directly at the heart of the p53-mediated response by ensuring that basal levels of p53 are available to precondition the cell when a rapid, p53-mediated, transcriptional response is needed. Because of the relevance of p53 in checkpoint signaling, Finkielstein and her team hypothesize that Per2 association with p53 acts as a regulatory module that influences p53's downstream response to genotoxic stress. Unlike the trimeric complex whose distribution was confined to the nuclear compartment, Per2/p53 was identified in both cytosol and nucleus. At the transcriptional level, a reporter containing the hp21WAF1/CIP1 promoter, a target of p53, remained inactive in cells expressing a stable form of the Per2/p53 complex even when treated with ionizing radiation. Lastly, the lab established that Per2 directly acts on the p53 node, as checkpoint components upstream of p53 remained active in response to DNA-damage. Quantitative transcriptional analyses of p53 target genes demonstrated that unbound p53 was absolutely required for activation of the DNA-damage response. The lab's work provides evidence of the mode by which the circadian tumor suppressor Per2 modulates p53 signaling in response to genotoxic stress. More recently, our findings showed that Per2 and p53 rhythms were significantly out-of-phase relative to each other in cell lysates and in purified cytoplasmic fractions. These seemingly conflicting experimental data motivated the use of a combined theoretical and experimental approach focusing on the role played by Per2 in dictating the phase of p53 oscillations. Systematic modeling of all possible regulatory scenarios predicted that the observed phase relationship between Per2 and p53 could be simulated if: i) p53 was more stable in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm, ii) Per2 associates to various ubiquitinated forms of p53, and iii) Per2 mediated p53 nuclear import. These predictions were supported by a 7-fold increase in p53's half-life in the nucleus and by in vitro binding of Per2 to the various ubiquitinated forms of p53. Lastly, p53's nuclear shuttling was significantly favored by ectopic expression of Per2 and reduced because of Per2 downregulation. Our combined theoretical/mathematical approach reveals how novel clock regulatory nodes can be inferred from oscillating time course data. In a third area of research, the Finkielstein Lab investigates how circadian factors sense metabolic changes and, consequently, act in cell-fate decisions. Here, a multi-technique approach, spanning from the atomic to the cellular level, will be used to elucidate the structural-functional properties of circadian transcription factors. Our objectives are to i) define crosstalk mechanisms among cell cycle, circadian and metabolic components that influence cell cycle transitions ii) study the significance of metabolic signals for circadian rhythmicity and in cell death processes, and iii) determine the structural basis for sensing metabolic changes by circadian proteins. This project will help advance various areas of research by providing a mechanistic explanation for physiological changes accompanying cell division and by elucidating more fully the interplay among cellular mechanisms. Most of the cancer malignancies arise from malfunction of genes that control the cellular responses to DNA-damage as well as cell growth and division. The fact that cancer results from the combined action of multiple oncogenic alterations argues that single-agent therapies will remain the exception. The identification of appropriate targets is based on a detailed understanding of the molecular changes underlying tumor growth and progression. Recent preclinical studies have suggested that radiotherapy in combination with other targeting agents enhances the therapeutic ratio of ionizing radiation alone. However, resistance of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs and radiotherapy represents a major obstacle in anti-cancer therapy. Our research aims to precisely define why some tumors fail to respond to radiotherapy in the first place, and how to interfere with this resistance pathway so that more effective treatment modalities can be developed. Finkielstein's previous work showed that the cell cycle is arrested and cell death (apoptosis) prevented in Xenopus embryos treated with high doses of ionizing radiation at any time after the mid-blastula transition. This phenotype results from the activation of a concerted number of mechanisms that lead to cell cycle arrest at the G1/S boundary, as observed for most radiation resistant tumors as well. Thus, the Finkielstein Lab's research takes advantage of the simplicity of this model organism while using an interdisciplinary approach to identify key fundamental processes and define relevant players relevant to the response of the tumor to ionizing radiation. The lab's initial work challenged the long-standing conventional view of radiation-induced apoptosis in which increasing exposure doses results in augmented apoptosis in a biological system, with a threshold below which radiation doses do not cause any significant increase in cell death. The consequences of this belief impact the extent to which malignant diseases and non-malignant conditions are therapeutically treated and how radiation is used in combination with other therapies. The Finkielstein Lab's research challenges the current dogma of dose-dependent induction of apoptosis and establishes a new paradigm, based a parallel with the photoelectric effect, that the photon energy provides the true threshold for induction of apoptosis in biological systems. The lab explored how the energy of individual X-ray photons and exposure time, both components of the total dose, influence the occurrence of cell death in early Xenopus development. Overall, the lab's published results established that the energy of the incident photon determines the outcome of the biological system and, therefore, suggests that biological organisms display properties similar to the photoelectric effect in physical systems. These results provide new insights into how radiation-mediated apoptosis should be understood and utilized for therapeutic purposes. MANIPULATION OF PLATELET AGGREGATION Protein activators and inhibitors of blood clotting modulate platelet-mediated coagulation. Manipulating activity of these molecules is one of the major targets to control undesired effects that occur with blood clotting. Virginia Tech scientists have identified a novel protein target for intervention in thrombosis. It is a platelet aggregation inhibitor that specifically binds and modulates the progression of platelet-mediated coagulation. Expression of this inhibitory protein is restricted to platelets, some tumor cell types, and very early stages of embryogenesis, so small molecules or other therapeutics can be tailored to intervene in a very target-specific manner. APPLICATIONS - Downregulation of haemostasis in patients prone to various diseases ranging from stroke to heart disease - Controlling bleeding during surgery - Pro- or anti-thrombotic modulation to restore haemeostasis ADVANTAGES - The technology targets a specific molecule released in response to platelet activation. - The targeted system is inherently reversible. - Intervention can be tightly regulated to increase or decrease thrombosis - Various routes of administration are possible. TECHNOLOGY Antithrombotic drugs often fail in the long run due to the emergence of significant compliance and safety issues, including increased bleeding. Thus, this new technology is unique in that it targets a specific molecule that is released in response to platelet activation and otherwise remains intracellular. Analogs can be delivered in a nanoparticle-based system to provide high stability, higher carrier capacity, selective release, and feasibility of incorporation of hydrophobic molecules. This approach will allow drug delivery by variable routes of administration, including oral and inhalation. An important concern about antithrombotic drugs is how to reverse their effects in the event of bleeding. The inherent reversibility of our molecule system allows the design of a counter-regulatory intervention. Drug-based nanoparticles can also be designed to allow controlled (sustained) drug release from the matrix, thus avoiding numerous secondary or side effects caused by accumulation of residual drug in the body.
