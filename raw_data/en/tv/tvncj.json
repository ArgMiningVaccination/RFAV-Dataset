Page | 3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2008, the European Union (EU) undertook a survey of campylobacters in chicken broiler meat in 26 member -states, Norway and Switzerland (Anonymous, 2011). The United Kingdom was ranked tenth worst in terms of absolute Campylobacter prevalence with 75% of samples testing positive. Poultry meat is a significant source of campylobacteriosis in humans and responsible for the majority of the 280,000 estimated cases of foodborne disease in the UK caused by the bacterium. The response of a joint industry and government working (JWG) group established to combat Campylobacter colonisation of chicken broilers was to commence a programme of research and intervention aimed at reducing colonisation of poultry with Campylobacter . In addition, a target for reduced nu mbers of colonised birds and lower numbers of campylobacters on carcasses was agreed. This study was concerned with the identification of risk factors that influenced the numbers of Campylobacter on broiler chicken carcasses post -chill. There were four ma in strands to the study. The first was concerned with the type of broiler carcass sample that was tested for campylobacters. The previous surveillance organised by the EU used a combination of neck skin and neck extension (i.e. breast) skin to assess the degree of carcass contamination. However, in the UK, there was a strongly -expressed, industry preference that the sample used for statutory Salmonella testing - three pooled neck skins, be used. The basis of the industry preference was that the statutor y sample had to be taken anyway and a portion of the same homogenised sample could be cost -effectively removed by the laboratory for Campylobacter testing. As part of this study, the implications of changing the sample type from neck and neck extension to three pooled neck skins was investigated. Neck skin was found to be more heavily contaminated with campylobacters than breast skin. The JWG -agreed reduction target involved reducing the percentage of heavily contaminated samples (>1000 cfu/g) from 27% t o 10% by the end 2015. The reduction was set against what was considered possible from the results of the original EU baseline survey in the UK. A conclusion of this work was that a change of test sample to pooled neck skin would make it more difficult t o achieve the JWG -agreed reduction. A second purpose of this study was to undertake testing under commercial processing conditions and otherwise accumulate laboratory test results derived from neck skins from post -chill broiler carcasses. Most of Page | 4 the tes ts were paid for by the UK poultry processing industry. Since the results were generated by more than twenty testing laboratories, there was a requirement to determine if the results were equivalent between labs. To assess the abilities of the labs, a pr oficiency testing (PT) scheme for counting numbers of campylobacters was established. Acceptable PT performance was required before test results could be accepted for use in the project. One use for the collected test results was as a performance indicat or of progress towards the JWG target. The third strand of the study was to collect supplementary information matched with the Campylobacter test results. The supplementary information described the physical layout of farms, the farming conditions for ind ividual crops of birds, the physical layout of processing plants and the operating conditions inside those plants as birds were processed. The general strategy was to use the supplementary information to construct a statistical model that could predict th e numbers of c ampylobacters on post -chill broiler neck skins. A model was constructed to predict Campylobacter numbers on post chill neck skins using data collected between November 2011 and March 2014. The model that revealed there were around nine units of variation in an initial dataset. The source of 2/9 of this variation was caused by environmental conditions in the plant at the time of processing. The remaining 7/9 of the observed variation was caused by on-farm factors. Thus, an important findin g from this project was that on -farm factors were three and a half times more important than processing plant factors in influencing numbers of campylobacters on post -chill broiler neck skins. The factors influencing bird colonisation on farms were theref ore further investigated using numbers of campylobacters in broiler house litter as model targets for prediction as the final work thread of the project. Two farm models were constructed using litter test results and supplementary information collected between October 2014 and September 2015. Independent farms supplying low -throughput slaughterhouses and integrated farms owned and operated by high throughput processors were investigated separately. For independent farms, bird gender, age at slaughter, s hed size and construction material were significant predictors of numbers of Campylobacter in litter. F eed-withdrawal time was initially also statistically significant, with longer times increasing the numbers of campylobacters. However, this effect was masked in later model iterations; possibly because sample s representing hi gher risk, longer feed -withdrawal times were under -represented as a coincidental consequence of the types of farms that participated in the study. The Page | 5 processing line speed in a typical low -throughput slaughterhouse is 5000 -6000 birds per hour; however, in a larger -throughput plant, the line speed can be twice as fast. In addition, larger throughput plants can run for up to 20 hours per day. Investigations revealed that independ ent farms partly depopulate birds from houses up to eight times before the shed is completely cleared, largely because of the limited capacity of the smaller processing plants. In addition, on independent farms, numbers of campylobacters in litter from la rger sheds constructed of steel tended to be higher than in smaller sheds made of wood, and this seemed to be related to the higher numbers of birds in the larger sheds. The higher numbers of birds in larger sheds required even more depopulations. The mu ltiple breaking of shed biosecurity during depopulation was a likely explanation for the increased risk of high numbers of campylobacters in litter from older birds and in sheds constructed of steel. For integrated farms supplying high -throughput slaughte rhouses, the factors which increased numbers of campylobacters in litter were identified to be higher bird age, the exclusion of dogs from broiler houses, the presence of darkling beetles (which are an indirect indicator of litter wetness) and whether the sample was a first, second or final depopulation (high -throughput processors tend to depopulate sheds only once or twice). This study harnessed the efforts of researchers and industry activity to identify on -farm factors that significantly influenced the n umbers of Campylobacter on post chill carcass neck skins and in broiler house litter. However, to confirm and investigate further the mechanisms that are operating, additional experimental work is required. Some of the additional studies could be underta ken at small expense, by making use of existing standard operations within some companies. For example, one UK processor sexes birds and holds different genders in different houses. Therefore, the consequences of gender on Campylobacter colonisation coul d readily be investigated further using birds farmed by that company. Page | 6 KEY OVERVIEW OF THE FINDINGS OF THIS STU DY Discussions with the UK broiler processing industry revealed a strong industry preference for the use of three pooled neck skins as a single test sample to determine the degree of carcass contamination by campylobacters. Previous surveillance had used a combination sample composed of neck and breast skin. When the two sample types were compared, the pooled neck skins were found to be significa ntly more heavily contaminated with campylobacters compared with breast skin. Consequently, a change of test sample to pooled neck skin would make it more difficult to achieve any contamination reduction target set from previous surveillance. Informatio n relating to the farm rearing of chicken broilers and the slaughter and dressing of chicken carcasses was collected from the UK processors. Matched to the collected growing and processing information was a quantitative test result of campylobacters in ei ther broiler house litter and/or from five sets of three pooled neck skins from each flock processed. The quality of the donated Campylobacter test result was assessed by proficiency testing. Test results from ineffectively -performing laboratories were n ot used for this study. In combination ; the farm, process and laboratory testing information was used to construct models that attempted to predict Campylobacter numbers initially on carcasses. The initial model revealed that on -farm factors were 3.5x more important than processing plant factors in influencing the numbers of campylobacters on post -chill broiler neck skins . Page | 7 In the slaughterhouse, the initial model identified the chilling, washing and de -feathering process stages as being statistically -significantly correlated with the numbers of campylobacters on carcasses Further investigations were targeted towards the on -farm growing of birds because changes there would have the most impact in reducing carcass contamination. For processor -owned int egrated farms supplying high -throughput slaughterhouses a second model was constructed. T he factors which increased numbers of campylobacters in litter were identified to be o Bird age, with other birds more likely to be colonised o Allowing dogs into broil er houses o The presence of darkling beetles (which are an indirect indicator of litter wetness) o Whether the Broiler shed had been previously depopulated For independent ly-owned farms supplying lower -throughput slaughterhouses a third model revealed the significant predictors of numbers of Campylobacter in house litter were o Bird gender o Age at slaughter o Shed size o Shed construction material Modelling is useful in identifying what exerts influence on Campylobacter contamination but it does not provide informat ion on the mechanisms operating that cause any influence. The significant factors identified are discussed in the report in the context of previously -published literature. Some of the identified risk factors require experimental work to determine the nat ure of the influence.

Page | 13 A COMPARISON OF CAMPYLOBACTER NUMBERS RECOVERED F ROM TWO DIFFERENT CHICKEN BROILER -DERI VED SAMPLE TYPES. BACKGROUND AND JUSTI FICATION FOR A COMPA RISON OF TWO DIFFERE NT CHICKEN BROILER -DERIVED SAMP LE TYPES In 20 08, the European Union (EU) undertook a survey of campylobacters in chicken broiler meat in 26 member -states, Norway and Switzerland (Anonymous, 2011), which showed that the UK produced more broilers than any other country in the EU. However, the UK was r anked tenth worst in terms of Campylobacter prevalence of broiler carcasses with around 75 % of samples testing positive. Around 67% of the samples had contamination of more than 10 colony forming units (cfu) campylobacters/g skin sample. The findings of the EU survey broadly agreed with an earlier report by Adak et al . (2005) who estimated tha t over 250,000 cases of campylobacteriosis and that several dozen deaths were caused annually in England and Wales as a likely consequence of the campylobacters associated with poultry meat. In response to the EU survey findings, a working group was establ ished with members drawn from UK government branches (e.g. the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and the Department of Rural Affairs (defra)), the British Poultry Council (BPC; a trade poultry processer association), poultry processors, retailers and the British Retail Consortium (BRC; a trade association for larger retailers). The primary purpose of the working group was to identify and implement interventions aimed at reducing the numbers of campylobacters on British poultry meat. In addition, the group pledg ed to undertake continuous monitoring of processed broiler samples post chill in BPC -member slaughterhouses as one way of monitoring progress towards a reduction target agreed with the Food Standards Agency. Three bands for Campylobacter numbers (lowest < 100, medium 100 -1000 and highest >1000 cfu/g) were set, along with reductions to the percentages of the test samples which fell within each banding. The target for the highest band was a reduction from 27% of samples tested to 10% by the end 2015. The no t insignificant costs of the slaughterhouse -based continuous monitoring programme were met by the UK poultry processing industry who donated the results of examinations of three pooled poultry neck skin samples taken from five sets of carcasses. The testi ng methodology was based on ISO-10272 -2 (2006) and Page | 14 plants collected test samples on a weekly basis. The test sample was chosen because it is widely used for statutory Salmonella testing of poultry carcasses in the EU under the auspices of EC regulation 20 75 (2003). For the EU campylobacters survey, the testing protocol was also based on ISO-10272 -2. However, the sample collected for microbiological testing comprised a piece of neck skin and the skin from between the neck and breast region (called the neck extension region) of a single chicken carcass. Thus, a significant barrier to using the EU survey results as a baseline, and measuring changes against it, was the use of a different test sample. Consequently, this study reports the findings of a statistical comparison of Campylobacter enumerated on both sample types collected from the same flock, with a view to determining the differences in the results consequent on the two sample types. A secondary consideration when using donated test results was that the testing had been undertaken in a number of testing laboratories rather than the single testing facility per country used for the EU survey. Previously, we have reported that the uncert ainty associated with the ISO-10272 -2 test method can be significant (Hutchison et al ., 2006) when identical samples were analysed in just two different laboratories. To determine how consistently campylobacters were enumerated in the participating testin g laboratories, a ring trial that involved the testing of subsamples from a homogenous preparation were undertaken. We report the results of a series of proficiency tests of identical samples tested on the same day in different test laboratories. Finally, after removing the test results generated by outlying laboratories, we report the progress of the British Poultry Industry over a six -year period from 2011 to 2016 towards reducing the numbers of campylobacter s associated with poultry meat. This section of the report is concerned with the delivery of the project scope objectives listed in Table 1. Page | 15 Table 1 Scope objective s contributed to b y this section of the study Objective Number Objective Description 01 Collection of UK poultry processing industry Campylobacter test results data and an assessment of the implications of change of sample 03 The creation of systems to summarise and report captured information (with appropriate identity safeguards) to make it available to partner projects, industry representatives and Agency staff 06 Extended collection of UK poultry processing industry Campylobacter test results (without making a significant contribution to the collection of matched farm and processing information ) MATERIALS AND METHOD S Sample collection. Excision -based sample collection was undertaken on moving lines during normal commercial processing immedia tely after the chilling phase of processing. For neck skins, sampling involved turning a sterile 304mm x 177mm stomacher bag (Seward, Thetford, England) inside out over a gloved hand and excising a carcass neck skin to provide a sample mass of at least 10 g without removing the carcass from the processing line. Neck and neck extension skin samples were obtained from a single carcass which was typically removed from the processing line to allow sampling. The neck and neck extension skin samples were stored in separate stomacher bags each labelled with a unique carcass identifier. All skin samples were excised using sterile scissors and stored in the stomacher bags on crushed ice until the commencement of microbiological Microbiological examina tion. Maximum recovery diluent to each sample (9:1, w/w) before homogenisation for 1 minute using a stomacher (Model number BA 6021, Seward, UK). Volumes of diluent were removed from the sample for quantitative det ermination of campylobacters directly, or for mixing with other samples to form a combination sample. In both cases, the removed volumes Page | 16 were vortex mixed (Genie, Fountain Valley CA USA; vortex mixer 2) for 10s to ensure a homogenous distribution of bacte ria. Campylobacter were enumerated using the ISO-10272 -2 protocol (International Organization for Standardization 2006) . All decimal dilutions were made using MRD and plating was onto modified charcoal cefoperazone desoxycholate for 48h. Confirmation of Campylobacter spp. was by phase contrast microscopic examination of five colonies picked from Columbia blood agar subculture to confirm corkscrew motili ty, in addition to a lack of visible growth at 25 \u00b0C under microaerobic conditions and at 41.5 \u00b0C under aerobic incubation after 48h. In addition, presumptive colonies were confirmed by oxidase activity and an inability to ferment lactose and sucrose. Colle ction and reporting of UK poultry processing industry test results . A relational database (SQL Server 2008, Microsoft Corp. Redmond WA. USA ) was used to store the microbiological test results. Three methods for the collection of industry test results wer e used. Copies of l aboratory test result certificates were collected from participating plants. The laboratory test method was checked to e nsure compliance with the ISO-10272 - 2 reference method, and the data were entered into the database by manual ly retyping. Data entry errors were identified by periodic double entry of a portion (~10%) of the test results and comparison of the two datasets. An inputting error of 1% (1 error in 100 entered fields) triggered retyping of all data from an entire sessi on by a different person and subsequent re-comparison of both data sets. Results were also collected as electronic documents (e.g. spreadsheets (MS Excel 2010; Microsoft ) or comma -separated value files) directly from testing laboratories. Electronic resu lt submissions were electronically transformed (Excel) if required (i.e., to convert test results into a standard reporting format of cfu/g ) and directly pasted into the database. All transformations were independently checked to ensure electronic submiss ion was free from data manipulation errors. Three slaughterhouses enter ed their own test results into the database using a web interface; an approach that was not widely adopted . Basic validation of dates, bacterial nu mbers, and sample types that were en tered into the web database wa s undertaken to ensure sensible and appropriate inputs and to prevent the introduction of malicious computer code designed to disrupt the database. No independent verification of t est results was undertaken for w eb-based resu lts entry. Processors were provided with an anonymised identity code that was used for all reporting. Results were reported in a manner agreed with the poultry processors supplying the test results. A range of reports were Page | 17 constructed, which included sum maries for individual plants, a comparison between individual plants and the national dataset that contained all participating plants and group summaries for larger processors with multiple line and processing plants. Results reporting was also made avail able to research collaborators after authorisation by the FSA project officer and to comply with Scope objective number three. Examples of typical reports that were created and available in real time are presented below as Figure 1. Statistical Analyses. The bacterial numbers counted from neck extension skin or neck skin samples obtained from the same carcass were compared using the methodology of Bland and Altman (19 86). In brief, the range between the two sample types was compared by evaluating bias, assessed as the mean log difference between the two sets of counts and \u00b1 twice the standard deviation of the differences, and bias tested using a paired t - test. Chi Sq uared or Fisher's exact tests were used as appropriate to test for any significant differences in the distribution of test results grouped as scores derived from counts into histogram -style bins. For all tests, the threshold for significance was P<0.05 unless otherwise stated. Page | 18 Figure 1 Typical real -time summary reports of the industry -provided test results made available to the UK poultry processors and research collaborators. Page | 19 RESULTS AND DISCUSSI ON Table 2 shows the results when the calculated log 10 mean of three randomly -selected, independently -tested chicken neck skin samples were compared with the log result of the same three sampl es physically combined into a single test sample. Statistical comparison by t -test showed that there were no significant differences between the calculated mean and physically -combined results. The observation was sustained across samples collected from four individual plants and also when the results for all four plants were compared en bloc . When the comparison was treated as two different methods for measuring the same parameter (Bland and Altman 1986), there was also no meaningful difference between the two sets of measurements. These findings mean that it is possible to test chicken skin samples individually for Campylobacter numbers and use those results to calculate what the test results of a physically -combined test would have been. A similar r esult has been shown previously for swab samples taken from red meat carcasses (Hutchison et al ., 2005) ; although we believe this is the f irst time a similar finding has been reported for excised chicken skin. The finding is important for this study because , using the general approach, it is possible to compare the campylobacters associated with different skin sample combinations to circumvent the fact that traditional microbiology does not allow samples to be tested more than once.

The lower counts of appr oximately 1 log for the neck extension skin ( Table 3) were significant (paired t -test, P <0.05) for all four plants where samples were collected and also when the test results from all four plants was compared en bloc . Figure 2 is a Bland and Altman plot showing the mean of the paired counts against their differences. There was a marked positive slope in the relationship between mean and difference (P = 0.35), however, this was strongly driven by the two points on the right -hand side of the plot and significance was lost when they were removed (P = 0.77), meaning it is only safe to assume a constant offset when converting from one measure to the other. The finely dashed lines in Figure 2 shows the 95% 'l imits of agreement' (the mean difference \u00b1 2 x SD of the mean difference) between the two measures as being from -0.44 to 2.27 log cfu/g, that is the variability that could be expected when converting from one measure to another. Given such poor limits of agreement it is obviously not practicable or useful to convert between two individual measurements. However, if multiple measures are taken then the 0.92 difference does provide a useful guide to the difference that would be expected overall between the t wo different types of measure.

The solid horizontal line shows the average difference between the two types of measure and the lightly dashed lines the 'limits of agreement' (equal to the mean difference \u00b1 2 SDs). The calculated approach was used to further investigate th e real -world implications of using the EU surveillance data as a baseline to measure progress towards the reduction target taking into consideration the higher counts on neck skin compared with neck extension skin. The studies used the results of individu ally-tested sample components and a calculated combined result. The comparisons were the calculated combined neck and neck extension skin taken from the same carcass compared with the same neck skin combined with two neck skins taken from near -adjacent bi rds on the processing line. The results ( Table 4) show that for three out of the four plants where samples were collected, the counts from the two sample types were significantly different. For the remaining plant, P was 0.05; which was on the cusp of significance. When the results from all four plants were analysed en bloc , the two sample types were strongly significantly different. It was more cost -effective for the UK poultry processing industry to take one sample for statutory Salmone lla testing and to use that same sample for the voluntary Campylobacter testing. However, changing Page | 24 the skin type tested from a combination of neck and neck extension skin to pooled neck skin would make it more difficult to achieve the UK target for Campyl obacter reductions on broiler carcasses if compared with the EU surveillance as a baseline, due to the greater numbers on the latter samples.

Based on the test results of samples collected in four high -throughput chicken processing plants, it wa s apparent that the three pooled neck skin samp le had higher numbers of test results in the highest banding compared with the sample type used for the baseline survey.

Test results we re sorted into the contamination ranges used for monitoring progress towards the UK Campylobacter reduction target for poultry meat. Skin sample type (number of samples) Number of samples in 6.00 ( 15) 34.00 ( 85) An exact Chi square test using the UK baseline survey bin values as the expected range showed the differences in sample numbers assigned to each bin were significant ly elevated (P<0.001) for the pooled neck skins compared with the EU baseline survey sample type. Progress towards the 2015 Campylobacter reduction target was also assessed over an almost six -year period using test results donated by the UK poultry processing industries. An anonymous, percentile -based overview of the distribution of the donated test results by year is shown as Figure 3 and progress towards the performance target is shown as Table 6. The shapes of the graphs shown in Figure 3 between the 30 th and 95 th percentiles were similar across all six years. However, for years 2015 and 2014, there were small numbers of exceptionally highly contaminated neck skins which contained more than 7 log cfu/g neck skin. In general, the ma jority of neck skin samples were contaminated below 4 log cfu/g. The results depicted in Figure 3 and Table 6 are from a survey representing more than 95% of the UK national throughput over a period of several years. A Chi Square test of the table as a whole showed a highly significant difference between banding between years. In particular, the 2015 dataset had elevated numbers of neck skins in the most contaminated band and reduced numbers of neck skins in the least contaminated band compared with the other years (Table 6). Thus, using industry -supplied test results, and a dataset of around 15,000 results for 2015, the JWG reduction target that the highest level of contamination, (>1,000 cfu/g neck skin) would fall to 10% by the end 2015 was Page | 26 not met. Howeve r, the least contaminated chickens (<100 cfu per gram), did not get any worse than the measured baseline of around 42% ( Figure 4).

Three laboratories analysed the samples with Scottish samples (n=794) analysed at one laboratory, Northern Irish samples at another (n=797) and English and Welsh samples (n=3,275) at the third. The results (Anon. 2003) showed the respective prevalences of Campylobacter to be 75.4%, 76.7% and 45.4%. Contemporaneous surveys of retail chickens running around the same time found Campylobacter prevalences of 83% in chickens in England (J\u00f8rgensen et al. 2002), and 71% in Wales (Meldrum et al. 2004). The dispar ity in campylobacter prevalences between surveys running at similar times and different testing laboratories suggested that in the FSA survey, the laboratory attempting to isolate campylobacters from English and Welsh samples may have had significant defic iencies. Subsequently the FSA strategic plan for 2005 -2010 set the aim: 'We will work with industry to achieve a 50% reduction in the incidence of UK -produced chickens which test positive for Campylobacter by the end of December 2010'. However, the baseli ne set was that found in the problematic survey of 2001, noted above. A second FSA survey to determine the prevalence of Campylobacter in retail chicken in the UK was undertaken in 2007 and 2008 (n=3,274). During the study , a subset of samples (n=927) was analysed by both enumeration and enrichment and combining both methods the prevalence for the subset was 65.2%. However, the enrichment method used showed a prevalence of only 33.9% for all samples, and for the subset it had a false negative rate of 62% when compared with the corresponding quantitative result . A similar survey undertaken in Northern Ireland, incubating samples at both 37\u00b0C and 42\u00b0C, found a prevalence of 91% (n=336) (Moran et al. 2009). Additionally, in 2008, the European Union (EU) unde rtook a survey of broiler carcasses to determine the prevalence of Campylobacter , and the UK prevalence was 86% (Anon. 2010). Thus , the enrichment Page | 30 methodology used in the FSA survey may have been less than optimal for the detection of poultry -associated campylobacters. This section of the study had a primary aim to provide appropriate quality -assured test materials for all laboratories undertaking FSA -funded research relating that enumerated campylobacters in poultry . Where laboratories were found not be operating proficiently, the intent was that the project team would proactively assist laboratories to ensure appropriate standards were met on all FSA related studies and help prevent issues of the type described above . This section of the study contributes to the project scope objectives listed as Table 7. Table 7 Scope objectives delivered by this section of the study. Objective Number Objective Description 04 Undertake assessments of the Campylobacter testing results and the provision of assistance to atypically -performing laboratories 08 Extended proficiency testing of laboratories that test for campylobacters MATERIALS AND METHOD S Preparation and management of contact details . Initially, participation in proficiency testing was made a compulsory requirement for those processors who had agreed to supply chicken skin test results for incorporation into the database. As the PT scheme expanded, organisations such as universities an d government agencies, who were undertaking Campylobacter testing for research or surveillance purposes on behalf of the FSA, were also subject to mandatory participation. For the participating processing plants, a request was made through the Joint Worki ng Group (JWG) that at least one processing plant -based contact be Page | 31 nominated and their phone number and an email address provided. Although those details were the minimum requirement, what was typically provided by plants were the contact names and detail s for the plant technical manager, a laboratory contact, a senior plant manager, the corresponding details for a retailer supplied by the plant and an FSA -nominated contact (typically the original FSA project manager). Also included were the address detai ls of the processing plant and the testing laboratory (if different). For the universities and government agencies, contact details were for a FSA -nominated contact, a laboratory manager and a senior manager within the organisation. Systems were put in pl ace to handle logistical and administrative exceptions and anomalies. For example, a number of processors did not operate their own labs and used external contract laboratories. The same contract laboratory was occasionally used by two or more different processors. Similarly, several processors supplied the same retailer and so there was duplication of retailer contacts. Some contract testing laboratories were located at more than one site, but one senior laboratory contact was provided for all the sites. The contact lists were used to notify the processors, researchers, retailers and laboratories of upcoming PTs. The laboratory address details were used to courier the test samples to the labs. The logistical and administrative systems installed ensur ed that each contact with duplicated details received notifications of upcoming trials only once; that each testing lab received only one set of test samples; that each retailer contact received the result reports for all of processing plants that supplied their stores. Contact details were held in a relational database (MS -SQL server) and were changed throughout the duration of the PT scheme as appropriate. The main basis of prevention of duplication was use of the SQL SELECT DISTINCT command to retrieve a single instance of contact information. Notification of trials . Typically, notifications and results were sent electronically using mail merge to populate email addresses and unique form fields such as contact names, processing plants and other details. Over the course of the PT scheme several standardised documents for notification of an upcoming trial were created. These documents were sent not less than one month before the sample arrival date and included a notification letter (Appendix 1 ), a flow chart showing key dates ( Figure 5), an initially detailed protocol that was reduced to outline over time (at the request of the JWG), and two forms (A and B; Appendix 3) for the provision of reported results and the raw counts used to calculate the reported results, respectively. Page | 32 Sample preparation . For trial one, four of the samples were lyophilised le nticules containing Campylobacter , purchased and quality -assured by PHE, Colindale. For all the other PTs, samples were microbiological suspensions prepared in -house at the University of Bristol. To ensure that test samples had an authentic background mi cro-flora, all test samples (even those from un -colonised birds) were derived from UK broiler neck skins collected post -chill in a range of different slaughterhouses. Samples were typically collected when members of the project team were visiting plants f or other purposes. Two types of flocks were targeted; final clearance flocks, which served as a source of positive samples whilst first clearance flocks were regarded as likely sources of samples containing no or low numbers of campylobacters. To prepare PT samples without campylobacters, neck skins from first -clearance flocks were frozen and thawed at least twice. Neck skins for the generation of samples containing campylobacters were stored refrigerated (2 -3oC) for not more than 48h before the commence ment of analysis. Such storage does not cause significant reductions to numbers of campylobacters on broiler neck skins (Hutchison et al ., 2006a). To ensure samples had a homogeneous distribution of campylobacters, neck skins were stomached for 5 minutes in maximum recovery diluent (MRD; Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) (1:9) and the a 0.45 m nitrocellulose filter (Sartorius, Epsom, UK) to remove fat and other gross detritus. The resulting MRD containing campylobacters was decanted into s terile universals and the headspace gassed using a custom - formulated mixture of 8% (v/v) carbon dioxide, 7% (v/v) oxygen, and dford, UK) . Vials were vortexed for 2 minutes and gently agitated during the remo val of 200 l aliquots into pre -labelled sterile bijoux bottles. The headspace in the bijoux bottles was also replaced with a microaerophilic gas mixture. The samples were shipped in refrigerated biobottles to laboratories for next day delivery, before no on. Testing to determine homogeneity of campylobacters between samples . The homogeneity of the test samples was checked by a single researcher within the food safety microbiology group in the School of Veterinary Sciences at the University of Bristol. Ten replicates of each of the six samples that were typically used for a PT were tested . The samples were selected randomly from the pool of prepared mater ials prior to dispatch to the participating laboratories. T he relative repeatability standard deviation (RSD) was calculated. Page | 33 Sample homogeneity was considered to be acceptable if it was below the 52% variance limitations of colony counting generally as quoted by ISO 10272 -2:2006 (Cowell and Morisett 1969). The repeatability values for the multiple sample examinations were provided to participants as part of the test report . Calculations, outliers and extremes and ranking by absolute Z score determination . In keeping with the IHPPTA protocol, proficiencies were calculated as follows. Calculations were performed using the raw plate counts reported by laboratories on Form A to determine if calculation errors had been made. Although there is no correct method for this conversion, the protocol described by section 10 of ISO 10272:2 (2006) was used as a reference to identify gross mistakes giving rise to order of magnitude errors, such as an incorrect handling of dilution factors. For those samp les where errors were made, laboratories were contacted and asked to explain how the results had been worked out. The error was noted on their PT report and the corrected result was used for subsequent analyses. Page | 34 Figure 5 An e xample flowchart of key dates relating to a typical proficiency test Page | 35 All results were log 10 transformed prior to calculation. A group geometric mean value and standard deviation was calculated for each sample from all of the results submitted by all pa rticipating labs. The standard deviation was assigned a value of Z=1 and results reported as more than Z=2 away from the group mean were termed outliers. Results more than Z=3 away from the group mean were termed extremes. Outliers and extremes were rem oved from the group dataset and the labs that had submitted the results were ranked jointly last for the samples in question. After removal of the outliers and extremes, the geometric mean value and standard deviation were recalculated. Laboratories were then ranked by their results, using the absolute distance from the group mean in terms of Z. RESULTS AND CONCLUSI ONS Eight rounds of PT were undertaken as part of this scheme (including the first two rounds that were merged into a single PT). The numbe rs of participating laboratories differed between trials as laboratories joined or left the scheme in response to the end of research projects, the sale of laboratories into larger groups with re - organisation, and repeated poor PT performance leading to di smissal by the customer. The labs were in the UK as well as in continental Europe. A summary of the numbers of participating labs for each trial and the trial testing dates is shown on Table 8. On average there were more than 20 participating laboratories for each PT. Several laboratories subdivided their samples and had multiple technicians undertake testing. Although every lab was provided with a detailed individual report for every technician during this study, for every trial, this resulted in more than 300 collated reports overall. Therefore, only a selection of randomly -chosen reports is provided ( Appendix 4).

Trial one was undertaken in November 2011. O f the 16 participating laboratories only 13 returned meaningful test results. The temperature of the test bottle s on receipt of samples by the laboratories ranged from 4\u00b0 to 14\u00b0C. Statistical analyses showed that these different temperatures had not significantly influenced the numbers of campyl obacters in the test samples . Checks on each laboratory's spreadsheet of results showed that several laboratories had difficulties with the basic task of calculat ing correctly bacterial numbers of campylobacters per lenticule or per ml neck -skin sample from raw plate counts. In add ition, two laboratories reported that campylobacters were present in samples from a campylobacter -negative flock and one laboratory reported campylobacters in a PHE-certified, sealed, sterile control lenticule. Each laboratory was ranked by its mean Z-score, (also commonly referred to as a standard score ) allowing performance comparisons between labs to be made. It was noted that a small number of laboratories had subdivided their Page | 37 samples and ma de multiple returns for different technicians. In the test reports, it was stressed that the results of a single initial PT should be interpreted cautiously , since they were a snapshot of how a single technician (or a small number of technicians) performe d over a short period of time . All the participating laboratories were offered free tuition in the application of the ISO 10272 -2:2006 protocol, the identification of different Campylobacter colony morphologies plates and of presumptive campylobacters. The worst -performing laboratories were most aggressively targeted. During a training day, six participating laboratories attended, along with the FSA project officer. However, none of the worst -performing labs partici pated in the day's training, which took place in February 2012. TRIAL TWO In summary, trial two also revealed that some laboratories would benefit from guidance in the conversion of raw plate counts to reportable numbers. Consequently, some tutorial mater ials for the calculations and answers were prepared and made available to any participating laboratories that requested them. As a response to queries from PT1, a variety of approaches were tried for laboratories that reported no detections in samples wit h small numbers of campylobacters. Trial two made some attempt to address feedback made by the JWG on PT one. In brief, there were a small number of poorly -performing laboratories in PT one. A significant amount of effort was expended by the researchers addressing multiple rounds of queries from multiple labs aimed at finding flaws in the trial approach or justify their performance. Whilst these queries were tolerated, the effort stopped short of providing the raw datasets for recalculation (on the grou nds it was sensitive, although anonymous). One common query from PT one was how non -detections of campylobacters in samples containing low numbers of campylobacters were handled. In general, a variety of similar approaches are commonly used to allow log transformations of microbiological test results below the limit of detection (LoD) of a test method. These included the substitution of half the LoD for counts below the test method sensitivity (Hutchison et al., 2007), which was the method used by PT on e. In Page | 38 addition, the replacement of below -LoD values with 1 (Jackson et al., 2000;Roberts et al., 1980); the addition of a low count of <1 such as 0.9 (Bauermeister et al., 2008) or 0.1 (Russell and Axtell 2005) or lower are also common in the literature. More involved methods of solving the issue include the addition of 1 to zero values before log transformation followed by subtraction of the same amount after the transformation (Saathoff et al., 2004). Overall, these solutions can all be summarised as va riations on the general strategy of substitution of a low value for a result below the LoD of the test method. For PT two, the results were calculated using the three simplest approaches and the findings were prepared. A low value (e.g. 0.000001 cfu/ml) s ubstitution log transf ormed to -6. When calculating Z -scores, it is the distance from th e mean of all test results that is important. For example, if the mean test result for all the laboratories was 50 cfu/ml (unlogged) and one laboratory recorded a res ult of 28 cfu/ml, the result's distance from the group mean was -22 cfu/ml. Conversely, a result of 85 cfu/ml would be 35 cfu/ml from the mean. Since it is the absolute distance from t he mean which is important for Z -scores, the minus sign is removed from all results below the average. For that reason, the 0.000001 log transformation to -6 becomes 6 during the Z-score calculation. In PT two, 6 logs were equivalent to 2 -3 standard deviations for all the samples containing campylobacters. Since there wer e six samples which contained countable numbers of campylobacters for this roun d of testing, when the average Z -score was calculated, the low value substitution resulted in a penalty weighting of between 0.3 and 0.5 for each instance of a non -detection of campylobacters in samples containing the bacterium. A substitution of a very low value had the most impact on the PT two rankings, but the impact of that substitution was quite minimal overall. The other two alternative methods of allowing log transformat ion of results (a substitution of 1 or using half LoD) below the detection limit of the method caused very minor differences in the rankings. At the proficient end of the scale, the top three labo ratories had their positions re -arranged by both methods. At the least proficient end, three of the bottom four laboratories (labs 9, 11 and 2) had a minor re -arrangement of their ranking. Although overall, most of the participating laboratories which did not report a result below the LoD had their rank improved by two or three places, labs 6, 12 and 17 did not report a below LoD for a sample containing campylobacters and were disadvantaged by up to three ranks because of the substitution to 1x10-6 cfu/ml. The general improvements for most labs were at the expen se of the laboratories who had reported below an LoD for a sample containing measurable numbers of campylobacters. Each with at least a single Page | 39 report of a below LoD for a sample containing campylobacters, the most affected were labs 3 (reduced by 3 ranks) , 5 (reduced by 7 ranks), 8 (reduced by 2 ranks), 9 (reduced by 1 rank), 11 (reduced by 1 rank) and 15 (reduced by 7 ranks; Table 3 ). In general, the range of mean Z -scores tended to be smaller, although not significantly so (paired t -test; P=0.47) when 1 x10-6 was used as the substitute. The sole exception was the least proficient laboratory which did not detect any campylobacters in any samples and thus accumulated six penalty weightings and a mean Z -score of 3.32. The narrower range may have a possible consequence of requiring mean Z -score calculation to four significant figures. Since the rank differences for each of the different strategies was minimal, the original approach of substituting half the LoD of the test method was retained for future tria ls. In PT two, we also saw similar issues with the calculations required for the conversion of raw counts to reportable numbers of campylobacters. Therefore, tutorial materials were prepared that were designed to inform on the various rules and special ca ses specifically described by ISO 10272 -2 and more generally by ISO 7218. The general idea was that work sheets ( Appendix 5) were sent to all partici pating laboratories to be returned by a deadline. Once a return had been made a series of answers (and workings if required) were sent back to the laboratory. A summary of the laboratories' abilities to convert raw counts to reportable values is shown as Table 9. It was considered very important by the project team and the JWG that laboratories were able to accurately convert raw plate counts to repor table values. Thus, quite detailed feedback on their performance was provided back to the participating laboratories. Laboratory 2 had grasped the basics of conversion and was, overall , able to correctly calculate straightforward counts. However, the l ab did not have an apparent awareness that both ISOs define special cases. Consequently, lab 2 treated plates with excessively high counts of >300 the same as plates with counts >10 and <150. The lab was unable to correctly calculate plates which used a volume that was not 100 l; consistently overestimating the counts for 333 l platings by a factor of x10. The percentage of correct calculations for lab 2 was 38.9%. Laboratory 4 completed the calculations to a very high standard. Q7 and 14 had minor brea ches in how the presentation of >300 cfu on a plate were handled. Like many labs, for Q 18 all three counts at the neat dilution Page | 40 and all three at the x10 dilution were used. Since one of the neat counts was >300 cfu, it should have been excluded. The perc entage of correct answers for lab 4 was 83.3%. Laboratory 7 was difficult to assess. The lab converted all the plate counts to reportable values and provided these calculations. In addition, the lab attempted to apply the various rules and special cases described by the ISO and reported these. The typical answer format was 'a number OR other number calculated after applying a special case'. For a few answers three choices were offered. Most of the time, one of the answers was correct. The two special cases that were missed were Q6 which should have been reported as \"Organisms present but less than 4 cfu/ml\"; and Q18 where the lab did not use two of the three counts at the neat dilution and all three at the x10 dilution. Credit was given if one of the answers provided was correct; the percentage of correct answers was 88.9%. Laboratory 8 also showed a basic ability to correctly calculate bacterial numbers from raw counts. However, the lab showed a poor awareness of special cases and used very low and v ery high counts in their calculations. There was one instance of a rounding error and another where a decimal place was dropped. Laboratory 8 could not calculate a reportable value using two counts from one set of 333 l dilutions and three from another set of 333 l dilutions. The percentage of correct answers for lab 8 was 33.3%. Laboratory 9 provided a set of comprehensive notes to accompany their answers and employed a 'multiple answers ' strategy similar to Lab 7. The email returning the lab's answer s was headed 'queries for you to answer!' (sic) and was quite aggressive in tone. This laboratory was disappointed with its performance in the first round of proficiency and there was extended dialog with the lab owner who felt strongly customers should n ot have been shown the proficiency results. It seemed likely that L ab 9 saw these tests as a challenge to try and catch the research team out rather than an opportunity for assistance. How the PT results were distributed was a matter decided by the FSA p roject officer and the JWG rather than the research team. Many the points in the notes were of the type \"you can't have this as a count because it exceeds the limit of 150 stated in the ISO\", when the point of the exercise was to see how the labs would ha ndle such counts if they encountered them on a raw plate.

Lab 9 was treated the same way as Lab 7 and credited with a correct answer if one of the options was correct. A minor rounding error in Q18 was the only point of trivial note. The per centage of correct results was 94.4%. Page | 42 Laboratory 10 also demonstrated proficiency in converting raw counts to numbers. Only minor issues were identified; the laboratory was able to identify when too low or too high counts were encountered, but it did not always follow the ISO advice for special cases. However, the reports all stated the problem with a count and, typically, provided an estimate result. There were some issues with Laboratory 11. In summary, the lab was able to convert basic raw plate counts to reportable values without issue. However, the lab had only a rudimentary awareness of special cases. The researchers considered it likely the laboratory did not read the relevant sections of both ISO documents. The special cases missed include d: use of counts >300 cfu and <4 cfu, an inability to report in the form >150 cfu/ml for high counts and the incorrect selection of the most appropriate dilutions when counts over three orders of magnitude were provided. Like most laboratories; for Q18, laboratory 11 was unable to successfully calculate a reportable value using two counts from one set of 333 l dilutions and three from another set of 333 l dilutions. Laboratory 14 also provided good evidence they could reliably convert raw plate counts to reportable values. The laboratory manager at Lab 14 was off sick and so the calculations were done by a junior staff member. Minor issues were that for Q4 both dilutions were used for the calculation but only the one <300 cfu should have been used. Ther e was an apparent arithmetic error for Q7 which was incorrect by one order of magnitude. A special case of not using an arithmetic mean was missed for Q13 and not excluding counts of <4 cfu for Q15. Finally, for Q18; the lab did not use two of the three counts at the neat dilution and all three at the x10 dilution. The percentage of correct answers was 72.2%. Either Laboratory 15 undertook calculations using a method which was different to the ISO method, or they were unable to round numbers to 2 signifi cant figures effectively. Consequently , almost every answer was incorrect. To be fair to the laboratory however, the answers provided were very close in most cases (only one or two decimals difference). The laboratory correctly -handled special cases for Q7, Q14 and Q15. The percentage of correct answers was 16.7%. Laboratory 17 completed the exercise to a high standard. The only issues of note were for Q15 low counts at the 1/100 dilution were used for the calculation and for Q18, the >310 count was us ed for the calculation. The percentage of correct answers was 88.9%. Page | 43 Laboratory 18 had also grasped the basics of conversion; the majority of the answers were either correct or within an acceptable margin as a consequence of rounding. In addition, when r ounding to 1 dp (the ISO states 2 significant figures), there were inconsistencies of the type that 1.43 was rounded to 1.5 in one instance and 364 was rounded to 360 in another. The laboratory used counts in excess of 300 colonies and less than 4 colonie s for calculations. Where counts were too high for use in calculations and were to be reported as (for example) >3.00 x 108. The lab consistently reported as 50% of the upper limit e.g. > 1.50 x108. The root of that issue is that one ISO says it's fine to use plates with up to 300 colonies whereas the other limits colony numbers to 150 of the target organism. The percentage of correct calculations was 72.2%. In summary, because of the tutorial for the conversion of raw counts to reportable numbers, it was apparent that almost all of the laboratories (with the exception of Lab 15) had read the relevant sections of each of the ISOs and could convert raw plate counts to reportable values without issue for standard cases. Things become less clear when the counts fell into the ISO -defined special cases. Overall, most laboratories were aware that some of the raw counts were atypical and thus required special handling. Whether the special handling applied was correct (as defined by the ISOs) was quite hit -and-miss. It was apparent that compared with their performance in the first round of proficiency testing most laboratories had shown improvement in their ability to convert raw plate counts to reportable values. A further set of laboratory -based proficiency testing was scheduled towards the end of April 2012. Prior to the commencement of PT3, labs were provided with an Excel spreadsheet template, which accepted raw plate counts and made appropriate consideration of the ISO special cases to accurately conver t raw counts to reportable numbers. One final consideration for PT2 was that there were complaints made regarding the method used to anonymise participating laboratories. Until PT two, the labs had been sequentially numbered in the (broadly random) order they had signed up to the PT scheme. There were several laboratories undertaking surveillance on behalf of the FSA included in PT two. Although not individually identifiable, these laboratories could be identified as one of the new group by their high se quential number. Therefore, the way in which laboratories Page | 44 were anonymised was changed after PT2. A three letter alphanumeric was randomly generated and assigned to each participating laboratory. TRIAL THREE There was nothing of note revealed by trial th ree. A small number of laboratories were still struggling with conversion of raw counts to reportable values, and there were a small number of mistakes made at the level of individual technicians. However, there was no widespread issues identified and th e research team were hopeful that the PT scheme was beginning to have an impact on testing and driving improvements to the quality of information donated by the UK poultry processing industry. As trial three was in preparation, several labs requested for more than one set of test samples so that they could make multiple returns from multiple technicians. The requests indicated that the PT trials were perceived to be useful by the participating labs. Multiple samples were provided when requested (rather than increasing sample volume in case that changed conditions, and consequently numbers of campylobacters in the vials). As before, analyses of each laboratory's testing and reporting practices and their test results showed a range of capabilities. For example, one laboratory produced high outliers (overestimates) for three of the five samples whereas another laboratory produced three low outliers (underestimates). The other laboratories showed no bias in the distribution of any outli ers they returned. There was some slippage of the improvements to plate counts to reportable values calculations noted after the tutorial run after PT2. For PT three, two laboratories were asked to clarify how they had calculated numbers of colony -formin g units (cfu) of campylobacters per ml from their colony counts. For one of these laboratories, the revised calculations supplied as a response used a recognised (non -ISO) method for the calculations. For the other laboratory, the results from three diff erent technicians had been grouped together but had not been labelled as such. Other issues of minor note related to the responses to questions. In two cases, labs answered confirmation questions in a confusing manner claiming that (for example) 5/5 pres umptive colonies grew under aerobic conditions on Columbia Agar at 41.5oC but returning a greater than LoD result. However, despite these small Page | 45 issues; for the first time, none of the laboratories reported campylobacters to be present in a negative sample (sample 4). In keeping with what was observed for PT two, a number of laboratories had difficulty in measuring Campylobacter numbers in a sample that contained low numbers of cells (sample 3; mean test result 1.24 log cfu/ml). TRIAL FOUR For PT four, there was increase in returns that were not useable. There were 12 results excluded overall because of reporting a false negative or a high or low outlier or extreme . One laboratory reported four high outliers, and another reported two outliers which we re significantly lower than the participating laboratories average results. One laboratory returned negative Z -scores for all samples which is evidence of consistent under -reporting of Campylobacter numbers. Other laboratories showed no bias in the distr ibution of any outliers and Z -scores that they returned. There was still some slippage with the improvements to plate counts to reportable values calculations noted after PT two. For PT four, four laboratories were asked to clarify how they had calculate d numbers of colony -forming units (cfu) of campylobacters per ml from their colony counts. For three of these laboratories, the project team corrected the supplied results. None of the laboratories reported campylobacters to be present in a negative samp le (sample 4). In contrast to what was observed for PT three, most laboratories showed an improvement by measuring Campylobacter numbers in a sample which contained low numbers of cells (sample 6; mean test result 1.52 log cfu/ml). TRIAL FIVE A summary of the findings from trial five were that the majority of the laboratories made robust returns that lacked anything of concern to the project team. The main observation of note was that previous PTs used samples with an upper limit of around 1000 cfu/ml. By accident, some of the broiler neck skins used to generate the samples for PT five were exceptionally highly contaminated with campylobacters. A number of laboratories were caught out by the need to plate dilutions of 104 or 105 in order accurately re port the counts in one sample. Page | 46 For PT five, there were three results excluded overall as a consequence of reporting a high outlier and one result excluded on the grounds it was a low outlier. In addition, one laboratory reported two high outliers, a false negative and failed to enumerate the atypically high numbers of Campylobacter inoculated into sample 4. Investigations revealed that the technician that normally undertook Campylobacter testing was not available and the testing had been completed by a d ifferent technician. It was not clear whether the replacement technician had ever previously tested for campylobacters, or just not participated in proficiency testing. The disappointing results were largely a consequence of not plating six volumes, each of 333 l, for the 10 -1 dilution. A number of technicians were caught out by the high numbers of campylobacters in sample 4 reported their result as a 'greater than' value. There were four laboratories that returned negative Z -scores for all samples, wh ich is evidence of consistent under -reporting of Campylobacter numbers. Other laboratories showed no bias in the distribution of any outliers and Z -scores that they returned. There were no significant issues with the conversion of raw plate counts to repo rtable numbers of cells by any participating laboratory for this round of testing. None of the laboratories reported campylobacters to be present in the negative samples (samples 2 and 5). In keeping with what was observed for PT4, most laboratories were able to measure Campylobacter numbers in the sample that contained low numbers of cells (sample 6; mean test result 5.75 cfu/ml). TRIAL SIX As for the previous PT trial (PT five), there were no widespread significant issues were identified with this trial. In addition, there were only minor, isolated instances with the conversion of raw plate counts to reportable numbers of cells by the participating laborator ies. For PT six, twenty -six participating laboratories were sent samples. Of these 26 labs, 23 made valid returns. One laboratory declined to participate in the current or any future tests. The same laboratory had failed to make a return for PT five. A different laboratory could not participate in testing schedule due to the personal Page | 47 circumstances of the person that was responsible for PT trials. However, one week later, this laboratory examined the samples using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based method, although the results confirmed only the presence or abs ence of the pathogen in each sample. In the format provided, these returns could not be included in any quantitative analyses. The final laboratory that failed to make a valid return provided their results a considerable interval past the required deadli ne and reported their results as 'lower than' values, which also couldn't be used for statistical analysis. A number of labs made returns from multiple technicians. In total 30 valid returns were made and multiple submissions from single labs were treate d as separate and independent returns for the purpose of Z -score calculation. One of thos e laboratories compared two different Campylobacter plating media. Following initial analysis, six results were excluded as a consequence of reporting a high or low outliers. One laboratory reported two high outliers, two low outliers, a false negative and a false positive. There were three laboratories that returned outlying results for sample number three, which contained low numbers of campylobacters. However, th e majority of the laboratories were able to accurately measure Campylobacter numbers in the samples that contained higher numbers of cells (samples 2, 4 and 6). The laboratory that submitted PCR data reported two false negative results for samples 1 and 3 but correctly confirmed the presence/absence of Campylobacter in the remaining samples. TRIAL SEVEN There was a relatively long time (8 months) between PT six and PT seven . Possibly, that was the reason for the return of issues with the conversion of r aw plate counts to reportable numbers of cells . For trial seven, four participating laboratories experienced difficulties with the calculations . In more detail, t wo laboratories reported results that were ten times lower than the correct result, and on e lab reported five times the correct value. All of the affected laboratories were contract labs, where staff turnover Page | 48 can be high. One contract lab re -submitted corrections to their calculations three times before they were correct. For those laborator ies that failed to submit corre cted calculations, researcher -corrected values were used for the PT calculations and a note was made on the report. Following initial analysis, sixteen results were excluded because of reporting a high or low outlier. One laboratory reported two high outliers, two low outliers, a false negative and a false positive, a return consistent with guessing the vial contents. There were nine laboratories that returned low outlying results for at least one of the samples, and there were seven high outliers, clustered round a single lab that made multiple returns. Most of the laboratories were able to accurately measure Campylobacter numbers in the samples that contained high numbers of cells ( samples 1 and 5) and lower numbers (samples 2, 4 and 6). Sample 3 did not contain any campylobacters, but there were three returns from one lab that reported a false positive result. The same laboratory did not detect any campylobacters in sample 1 and r eported three instances of a false negative. It is plausible that sample 1 and sample 3 were mixed up at that laboratory. A second laboratory also reported campylobacters in sample 3. TRIAL EIGHT As for PT seven, there were issues with the conversion of raw plate counts to reportable numbers of cells by four participating laboratories for this round. The labs were exclusively contract labs. In summary, t wo laboratories reported all results ten times lower than the correct result. One lab reported results calculated from decimal dilutions ten times higher than the correct value, although calculations from neat plates were correctly calculated. One lab reported a single result that was x10 too low. For this round, in response to unacknowledged repeat ed requests for revised calculations, the reported numbers that were submitted were used. Following initial analysis, ten results were excluded because of reporting a high or low outlier. There was no discernible pattern of laboratories consistently repor ting high or low values. Most of the laboratories were able to accurately measure Campylobacter numbers in the samples that contained high numbers of cells Page | 49 (samples 2 and 4) and lower numbers (samples 1, 3 and 5). Sample 6 did not contain any campylobact ers. There were three false positive reports, clustered round a single lab that made multiple returns. Page | 50 A SUMMARY OF THE PRO FICIENCY TESTING SCH EME Several commonly -encountered themes emerged over the duration of the PT scheme. Although no specific analyses were attempted based on the laboratory type, there was a tendency for government and university laboratories to submit results closer to the group mean compared with the contract laboratories. The basis of the better performance was not clear, al though it is possible that in the former laboratories, staff would perhaps have better qualifications and education. In addition, the experience of some members of the project team who have worked in government organisations, commercial labs and universit y posts is that government organisations are better equipped than other laboratories. Although similarly well -equipped, university laboratories are used by students and so at least some of the equipment found there is damaged and in need of repair. It is likely that equipment such as air displacement pipettes, which can be set to measure specific volumes are more common in government and university laboratories. Calibrated automatic pipettes are more accurate compared with the generic motorised guns wit h volumes operator -estimated from disposable pipettes that are prevalent in most larger contract laboratories. All the contract laboratories and some of the government laboratories participating in the PT scheme were independently accredited for quantita tive Campylobacter testing by a third party such as UKAS or CLAS (Campden Laboratory Accreditation Scheme). None of the university laboratories were accredited, despite having a relatively proficient performance. The results of the PT scheme were used as an indicator of the quality of the industry -supplied test results. All the supplied results were from either a company -owned laboratory or a contract laboratory. The criteria for exclusion from the national dataset was set by the JWG. If a laboratory su bmitted a PT return that contained three or more major errors in a single round, their results were subject to exclusion. Major errors were defined as the reporting of a false positive (i.e. a count for a sample that contained no campylobacters) or false negative (a negative result for a sample containing campylobacters) result. In addition, major errors also Page | 51 included the submission of outlier or extreme results, and any calculation error that resulted in a reported result that was outside of 0.2x or 5x t he corrected result. Over the duration of the study, there were 11 sets of results excluded, five of which came from a single testing laboratory. The periods that exclusions were applied were also set by the JWG as the midway points between the problemat ic round and the previous and future PT rounds. For example, Table 8 lists the test dates for PT two, three and four as 26/04/2012, 08/09/2012 and 08/05/2013 respectively. Midway between PT two and three is 02/07/2012 and between three and four is 07/01/2013. The results from a lab that had three or more errors for PT three would be excluded from the national dataset between 02/07/2012 and 07/01/2013. Page | 52 APPENDIX 1 A GENERAL HISTORIC AL BACKGROUND DESCRI BING A NEED FOR PROFICIENCY TESTING In overview, this study was concerned with the large -scale collection of Campylobacter test results generated from the examination of chicken broiler neck skins and supplementary data relating to those microbiological test results. The general project strategy was to determine if the collected supplementary information could predict the nu mbers of campylobacters in the test samples, thereby identifying factors that influenced the degree of contamination of chicken carcasses. In more detail, the supplementary information was used as the basis of a multivariate statistical model for the pred iction of Campylobacter numbers associated with neck skin excised from chicken broiler carcasses sampled after the chilling stage of processing. Before any modelling could be undertaken there were several considerations that were required, which related to both the Campylobacter test results and the supplementary information. This section of the study focussed on an important issue relating to the laboratory -derived test results. In the main, this study used Campylobacter test results that were donated by the UK processing industry and were generated by a constantly -changing number of different testing laboratories. The testing labs were a diverse group comprising commercial c ontract laboratories, processor -owned labs located in or near slaughterhouses, government -owned labs and laboratories undertaking commercial testing that were attached to a variety of research organisations. For reliable statistical analyses to be undertaken, there was a requirement that all of the laboratory testing outputs were bro adly equivalent. Consequently, as part of this study, a proficiency testing (PT) scheme based on standardised samples was designed and established to allow an assessment to be made of the relative quality of the test results donated by industry. At the t ime this study commenced, there was no commercial quantitative PT scheme for campylobacters available in the UK (although a qualitative scheme was operated by Defra under the auspices of the Food Analysis Performance Assessment Scheme [FAPAS]) . Formal qual ity assurance of laboratory outputs by PT is a relatively -recent innovation, gathering momentum in the late 1960s. Wood et al. (1998) noted that formalised PT emerged in the United States from largely - informal, ad hoc , inter -laboratory testing between rel ated laboratories. Early PT operated with a dual purpose that allowed laboratories to demonstrate their proficiency in undertaking a specific measurement and to certify reference test materials for internal laboratory quality -assurance purposes (Wood et al., 1998). In Page | 53 modern laboratories, reference material certification and PT have become largely separated, with each having diverged into a separate specialism. In the UK, PT became commonplace because medical biochemists involved in large clinical trial s identified a need for reliable results that were comparable between different hospitals and institutions. As PT evolved globally, standards for the approach and design of trials and the interpretation of reported results emerged. Most recently, a colla boration between the International Organisation for Standards (ISO), the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and the Association of Analytical Communities (AOAC) has resulted in a set of standard guidance intended for use in the food sector called the International Harmonised Protocol for the Proficiency Testing of Analytical Laboratories (IHPPTA). The IHPPTA protocol has become a widely adopted international standard, mostly because of being endorsed by a number of influential organi sations including the Codex Alimentarius Commission, the World Health Organisation (WHO), AOAC International and the European Union (Thompson et al ., 2006). Since the late 1990s, there has been a PT participation requirement for all well -regarded laborato ry accreditation schemes such as those operated by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS). The IHPPTA protocol is involved; summary overviews of the technical aspects of the protocol run to more than 50 pages (de Albano and ten Caten 2014;Thompson et al ., 2006). In addition, there are a number of pre - requisites for running a n IHPPTA -compliant PT scheme that extend into areas such as staff organisation and responsibilities, the procurement of all materials used in the preparation of certified stand ards and document version control. Collectively, the IHPPTA pre -requisites underscore the importance of good quality control for all aspects of a PT scheme that is intended to be run indefinitely, with the long -term spread of the associated scheme establi shment costs. Clearly, it is beyond the scope of a research project of a few years' duration, and concerned with a single analytical measurement, to mimic full IHPPTA -compliant scheme establishment. However, for the purposes of this study many of the imp ortant IHPPTA scheme requirements such as scheme design by a qualified statistician; audit, review and verification of calculations by independently -operating researchers; verification of sample homogeneity; equipment calibration and formal documentation o f all records were adopted. The PT scheme for quantitative estimation of campylobacters in chicken skin -derived samples to determine the relative quality of the test results was run on eight occasions between December 2011 and March 2015.

Trial five Each participating laboratory will receive six liquid samples from homogenised poultry neck -skins (without pieces of skin) and a bottle of sterile water labelled \"control\". The laboratories will be notified on the 6th September 2013 to expect the arrival of th e samples on the 2nd October 2013. Laboratories will be asked to examine for numbers of colony -forming units of campylobacters by direct plating and to confirm a proportion of the colonies as Campylobacter species. The samples will be sent chilled, to ar rive by 12.00 noon on Wednesday 2nd October, and the laboratories will be asked to record the time of arrival and measure the temperature of the bottle containing sterile water as soon as the samples arrive. Test samples should be examined on the day of r eceipt. Results should be sent by email or post to Monika Tch\u00f3rzewska (M.Tchorzewska@bristol.ac.uk ) to arrive no later than the 25th October 2013. Trial results will be reported to participating labs by the 30th November 2013. Laboratories should notify Dr Monika Tch\u00f3rzewska by email ( M.Tchorzewska@bristol.ac.uk ) or phone (0117 3319129 ) that their test samples have arrived, stating the temperature in the control bottle, and confirming that they will plate the samples out the same day (if they arrive after 2 pm, plating can be done the following morning). Laboratories are asked to record all of the information required in the two results forms (A and B) . Numbers of Campylobacter colonies on all plates should be recorded unless numbers are >150 per plate. Results should be calculated as cfu campylobacters per ml sample. If no campylobacters are detected the laboratory should determine their own limit of detection (x per ml liqui d sample) and express the result as \"less than x....\". OUTLINE PROTOCOL FOR EXAMINATION OF LIQU ID SAMPLES FROM POUL TRY NECK SKINS The samples should be processed following your normal laboratory procedure for counting Campylobacter spp.; for example , as described in paragraph 9.0 onwards of the ISO 10272 -2 method. Plate out the neat suspension and dilutions to 10-2. Pick up to five colonies per sample and check for identity as Campylobacter . Do not determine to species level. Make sure you record the information required in the two result s forms (A Page | 55 and B). Numbers of Campylobacter colonies on all plates should be recorded unless numbers are >150 cfu per plate. Record the results on the form provided and calculate the number of cfu Campylobacter per ml suspension for each sample after considering the results of any confirmations of presumptive colonies that you undertake.

AN EXAMPLE OF A PERFO RMANCE REPORT FROM TRIAL ON E. (PARTICIPANT REPORT OF THE FSA PROFICIENCY TEST FOR THE ENUMERA TION OF CAMPYLOBACTE RS FOR LABORATORIES TESTING IN THE CONTE XT OF THE JOINT GOVERNMENT -IND USTRY WORKING GROUP ON CAMPYLOBACTER. FEBRUARY 2010 ). Sixteen laboratories which either undertook testing for UK slaughterhouses and retailers, or for research purposes, participated in a proficiency test for campylobacters during late November 2011. A laboratory, in the Department of Clinical Veterinary Science, University of Bristol, prepared four pulsified samples from chicken neck -skins for testing. The neckskins were taken from Campylobacter -infected and -free flocks collected from slaughterhouses after the chill stage of processing. These samples were dispatched chilled, for next day delivery, together with four samples of lenticules supplied by the HPA containing known numbers of campylobacters. Each participating laboratory received eight samples in total. Laboratories were asked to test t he samples on the day that they were delivered to determine numbers of colony -formi ng units of campylobacters by direct plating using their usual test method. Ten replicates of each of the eight samples were examined by the Bristol Laboratory after simulated chilled transport and on the same day as the samples were examined by the other laboratories. Laboratory calculations were checked for accuracy and corrected if necessary. Statistical analysis of the corrected test res ults was undertaken using all of the laboratory -supplied data by log transforming bacterial numbers before the cal culation of the mean log and standard deviation of the mean log for each sample. Each laboratory was ranked by its mean Z-score (defined as the distance of the reported result away from the mean of all test results in units of standard deviations) calcula ted from the sum of its absolute Z-score s for each test sample. Box and whisker plot summaries of the entire range of test results from all participating laboratories are shown in Figure 6 for lenticules and Figure 7 for suspensions. Both figures should be interpreted as f ollows: the buff -coloured boxes represent the 25th to 75th percentiles for the range of test results reported. The lower tip of the whisker (i.e. the structure which look s like an error bar) is the lowest test result value reported and the highest whisker tip is the highest value reported. The black band running through the box is the median value (50th percentile) of the data. Also displayed on the plots are outlying values (o) and extreme values (*). The extreme and outlying values shown on 1 and 2 we re not used for the calculations of mean log test results, the standard deviation of the mean log or the distances of individual labs from the mean for all test samples ( Z-score s). Outliers and extremes however were included when calculating the Z-score s for each pa rticipating laboratory. The first table is a ranked summary of the average Z-score for all of the test samples for par ticipating laboratories. The second table contains laboratory -specific comments Of the 16 participating laboratories, 13 ret urned meaningful test results. The temperature of a test bottle on receipt of samples ranged from 4\u00b0 to 14\u00b0C. Statistical analyses showed that these different temperatures had not significantly influenced the numbers of campylobacters in the test samples. Checks on each laboratory's spreadsheet of results showed that many laboratories struggled to calculate correctly bacterial numbers of campylobacters per lenticule or per ml neck -skin sample from raw plate counts. Page | 62 In addition, two laboratories reporte d that campylobacters were present in samples from a Campylobacter -negative flock and one laboratory reported campylobacters in a sterile lenticule. Each laboratory was ranked by its mean Z-score , allowing performance comparisons between labs to be made. However, the numbers of samples that were prepared and tested were quite low. For that reason, the results of this initial trial should be interpreted cautiously since the initial results are a snapshot of how a single technician (or a small number of technicians) performed over a short period. Subsequent planned proficiency tests will allow this initial snapshot of performance to be expanded and create a more balanced overview of the performan ce of each laboratory over time. The next proficiency trial is scheduled for April 2012. As part of the activities of the Joint Industry and Government Campylobacter working group, support is available for laboratories who would like to address any issue s highlighted by this initial round of proficiency testing.

As for the previous trial, the participating labs undertook testing for UK poultry producers, poultry processors or retailers, research purposes or food safety investigations purposes. Samples were derived from neckskins of Campylobacter -colonised and -free flocks. The skin samples were collected from slaughterhouses after the chill st age of processing. The samples found to be Campylobacter - negative were frozen after examination and before use in the trial, in order to further assure that they were negative. Test samples were dispatched by next -day delivery to the participating testing laboratories under refrigerated conditions. Laboratori es were asked to examine the samples on the day that they were delivered, and to determine numbers of campylobacters per ml of suspensions using their usual test method. All 23 participating laboratories returned test results. The homogeneity of the samp les was checked by Bristol University by examining 10 replicates of each of the eight samples. The repeatability of these multiple examinations are shown as Table 12. Table 12 Measurement of repeatability for samples used for the second round of proficiency testing. RSD is the repeatability standard deviation of ten examinations of randomly selected samples from a batch under i dentical conditions within a short (1 -2 h) time interval. A dash ( -) denotes a sample which did not contain campylobacters. Sample Number RSD (log cfu/g sample) 1 - 2 0.09 3 - 4 0.10 5 0.09 6 0.16 7 0.08 8 0.06 Laboratories were asked on receipt to measure the temperature in a control bottle of sterile water included with their samples. These temperatures varied from 2.0oC to 10.4oC. Analyses of each laboratory's testing and reporting practices and their test results showed a range of ca pabilities. One laboratory found no campylobacters in any sample. Dramatic improvement compared to the first trial was observed in the proportion of laboratories which correctly calculated numbers of colony -forming units (cfu) of campylobacters per ml fr om their colony counts. In addition, only one laboratory reported campylobacters to be present in one sample which did not contain campylobacters. However, a number of laboratories had difficulty in measuring Campylobacter numbers in samples containing l ow numbers. Page | 66 Statistical analysis of the test results was undertaken using all of the laboratory -supplied data, by converting all cfu detected in Campylobacter positive samples to log 10 before the calculation of the mean log and standard deviation of the mean log for each sample. Each laboratory was ranked by its Z-score for each sample (defined as the distance of the reported result away from the mean of all test results, except the re sults of the homogeneity test, in units of standard deviations). The rankings for your laboratory are given in Table 13 together with the mean z scor e and mean log cfu/ml for each sample. As for the first trials, although the statistical analysis allowed ranking and comparisons between labs to be made, the numbe rs of samples that were prepared and tested were quite low. For that reason, the result s of these trials should also be interpreted cautiously since the results datasets are still small enough to be considered a snapshot of how a single technician (or a sma ll number of technicians) performed over a short period of time. Subsequent proficien cy tests may allow this initial snapshot of performance to be expanded and create a more balanced overview of each laboratory's abilities over time.

On occasion, recalculation after the removal of outliers can result in z scores of more than 2 for some laboratories, as was the case for samples 2 and 7. For this round of testing, ranks were not calculated for laboratories where a value below the method limit was reported for a sample which contained campylobacters (i.e. a fa lse negative result). Labs reporting a false negative result were ranked 23rd for that sample (or 22nd equal etc if more than two labs reported a false negative). No overall ranking was calculated for this trial. An anonymised summary of the distances f rom the mean are shown as Figure 8. The figure has been provided to show how closely clustered some Z-score s were and how ranking alone based on a Z-score may not provide an indication of proficiency relative to other partici pating laboratories. Each laboratory should look at their Z-score on each of the graphs in Figure 8 relative to the Z-score s of the other participants to judge their performance Page | 68 Page | 69 Figure 8 Anonymised Z -score distributions for FSA Campylobacter proficiency test two and the six samples which contained campylobacters.

Page | 71 MULTIVARIATE STATIST ICAL ANALYSIS OF COL LECTED INFORMATION T O DETERMINE WHAT PROCESSING PRACTICES INFLUENCE BIRD COLONISATION O N FARM AND CARCASS CONTAMINATI ON BY CAMPYLOBACTER S DURING PROCESSING . INTRODUCTION In response to EU -wide surveillance that ranked the UK tenth worst in terms of Campylobacter prevalence amongst 26 EU member states plus Norway and Switzerland, a group composed of i ndustry and government representatives was established. The purpose of the group, named the joint working group (JWG), was to reduce the numbers of campylobacters on British poultry meat . In addition, industry pledged to undertake continuous monitoring o f processed broiler samples post chill in slaughterhouses as a way of monitoring progress towards a n agreed Campylobacter reduction in the percentage of chickens that had the highest contamination (>1,000 cfu/g), from the EU -measured baseline of 27% in 2008 to 10% by the end of 2015 . Of particular interest to the JWG was one of the recommendations of the EFSA Baseline B Campylobacter in Broilers analyses report (Anonymous 2010b). In brief, the EU -wide survey identified that some slaughterhouses were bett er at removing campylobacters from broiler carcasses compared with others. Consequently, it was recommended that \"further national studies to identify more closely, at batch - and slaughterhouse - level, the factors that put broiler batches and carcasses at risk of becoming respectively colonised or contaminated with Campylobacter in a country\". This report outlines the findings of the FS241051 A (MO1056 ) study, commissioned as part of a programme by the FSA, aimed at the identification of poultry risk fact ors for campylobacter s on broiler meat in the UK. The statistical approach chosen for risk factor identification was multilevel modelling. The methodology was chosen because it extends traditional statistical techniques to take appropriate account of po pulation context. Batches of broilers held in sheds on farm have a hierarchical, or nested structure because consecutive batches of birds are raised in the same sheds on the same farms and potentially exposed to similar or identical risk factors . These s ame birds are further exposed to similar or identical risk factors during processing in one of the several participating slaughterhouses . Much of the mathematics relating to multilevel statistical analyses was developed by social scientists (Nuttal et al ., 1989) . A common example in the literature is the statistical analyses of multi -year data describing consecutive years of students in classrooms within schools (Nuttal et al ., 1989) , which has a high degree of analogy with consecutive batches of birds i n houses on farms. In order to fully account for the fact that different batches of birds are not fully independent from flocks raised previously in the same farm environments and processed in a slaughterhouse environment , specific consideration of the data hierarchy is required (Nuttal et al ., 1989) . A multi -level modelling approach fulfils the required specific consideration because the analysis undertakes an evaluation of the hierarchical data structures simultaneously and makes redundant any uncertain ties relating to the depth of analyses , which can plague single -level models such as multiple regressions (Bland and Altman 1986) .

FSA project FS241063 ( MO1055 ) was concerned with the characterisation of 23 slaughterhouse process lines to determine any basis in the UK for the EU assertion that some poultry processing plants were able to control campylobacters on carcasses better than others. Neck skins collected post chill were one of the process stages evaluated by MO1055 and the results of that testing were shared with this study. In addition, both the MO1055 study and this project undertook joint discussions with industry to agree a standardised test sample f or an industry -led monitoring programme. The agreed sample comprised of three pooled neck skins. In total, there were 16 slaughterhouses across the UK that undertook testing of post chill neck skins and the results of these tests were collecte d as part o f the current study . The quality of the laboratory testing was assessed by proficiency testing, also undertaken as part of this study. Testing laboratories with three or more calculation errors or outlying results per round were assessed as inadequate an d their donations were excluded from the results dataset. Finally, as part of separately -commissioned work, FSA employees collected post -chill neck skins samples as part of a baseline survey to determine the degree and prevalence of contamination of broil er carcasses in the UK. Testing of these samples was undertaken by the Animal Health Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA) in Weybridge (now renamed as Animal and Plant Health Agency [APHA]). The test results were also collected by this study ; surveilla nce used in this project extended from April 2012 to June 2014. Questionnaires matched to each test result. The questionnaires used for this project were created after in -depth discussions with UK processors. There were and initial two meetings with p rocessing industry representatives and five meetings with technical staff in individual processing plants, where draft versions of the questionnaires were discussed and refined. It is particularly important to note that this study was heavily reliant on t he cooperation of the UK processors and that a key issue for industry was the information used to answer the questionnaires should not require excessive amounts of staff effort to collate and supply. The approach of using multiple questionnaires for this study was a strategy agreed with industry to minimise asking for information that was unlikely to change on multiple occasions. The questionnaire contents were also influenced by knowledgeable industry representatives both from a technical viewpoint and a s a strategy to prevent poor responses by using easy to obtain information. It is also important to note that the questionnaires were a negotiated balance between the goodwill of the UK poultry processing industry and the investigatory aspirations of the research team. For each test result collected, food business operators (F BOs) were requested to donate a corresponding amount of supplementary information for use in the identification of risk factors . In brief, t he additional information comprised: Page | 74 Farm infrastructure; which asked four questions relating to a farm only once . The answers to these questions were unlikely to ever change (e.g. What was the farm postcode? and County Parish Holding number?). Flock Information; which asked 14 questions that were batch -specific and described the conditions during the farming of the birds (e.g. Were antibiotics given to the birds?; How long was the shed empty before populating with the current batch of birds?). These questions were asked for each batch of birds processed that was tested, because the answers could differ for each batch. Plant infrastructure ; which asked 44 questions as a way of describing the basic layout and operations of the plant. These quest ions were also asked only once . As for the farm infrastructure, the answers to most of these questions were unlikely to ever change (e.g. Was bird stunning by gas or electricity? How many plucker banks does the line have?). Plant Operations during the p rocessing of individual slaughter batches; which asked 16 questions relating to processing conditions in the plant at the time the batch of birds were slaughtered and processed (e.g. What was the scald tank temperature?; How long were the birds held in lai rage before shackling to the line?). These questions were asked for each batch of birds processed, because the answers could differ for each batch. Plant operations on sampling day; which asked six questions relating to processing conditions in the plant on the day of slaughter and was designed to minimise duplicate information where multiple batches of birds were sampled in a single processing day (e.g. How many days has it been since the chiller was last cleaned?). These questions were asked once for e ach processing day , even if multiple flocks were sampled on a single day . The questionnaires used for the capture of the supplementary information collected for each plant, farm and processed batch of birds sampled are provided as Appendix 6. Development of the on -line data collection and reporting facilities. The questionnaires (Appendix 6) were converted into web forms and systems were established to allow processors to securely log in to a website located on a subdomain of the former FSA website using the URL (universal resource locator) www.ukmeat.org. The recruitment process was that processors were informed about the study from a variety of sources such as the British Poultr y Council, the FSA and an industry -government steering committee called the Joint Working Group (JWG), and routine visits to 23 processing lines in 16 different poultry slaughterhouses were then made by the project team. Processor technical staff used a w eb browser to visit the website and those that agreed to participate were assigned a username and password that allowed them to supply some basic descriptions of their operations, including a valid email address and a mobile phone number. The provided ema il address was verified by sending an activation link for the logon details. Initially, t he inclusion criteria were chiefly that the slaughterhouse and associated farms were part of an established integrator company that was willing to provide information describing their farms and flocks for en masse risk factor identification . Information from related FSA -funded work (project reference FS101123) that involved smaller farms and processors was used as the study progressed . The Page | 75 web site was organised in a manner that automatically guided each approved user through the processing plant infrastructure questionnaire once only. Plants were provided with a choice of methods for the entry of neck skin laboratory test results. Periodic batches of test results we re accepted by email en masse in a variety of spreadsheet formats. Plants could also manually type in test results. Both methods t riggered email -based automated systems that prompted for farm descriptions, batch -specific flock growing conditions and also asked about the conditions during processing . The technical details of the website were that it was built using the Microsoft (MS; Redmond, WA, USA) ASP.NET framework v2.5 on a webserver running the MS Server 2008 operating system . The site used cooki e-less coding strategies such as the use of an encrypted page viewstate to hold data, in preparation for an EU e -privacy directive 2009/136 adopted in the UK on 25th May 2011 . Customised active webpages were coded using either the C#.NET or VB.NET program ming languages, and the questionnaire -response data was collected and stored in an instance of the MS-SQL (structured query language) database programme version 2008. All data saved and retrieved from the database was as parameterised, HTML -en/de- coded qu eries that prevented malicious script injection into the database and unintended manipulation of the page script. Technically -advanced coding methodologies such as dynamic page control placement during the page load event ( Figure 9) and retrieval of dynamic control data from the page viewstate were used to make the site as easy to use as possible for processors. Figure 9 Dynamic control placement was used to create customised data entry forms on a farm -by-farm basis to make the site easy -to-use for users . In the figure above, the form for the shed detail data was dynamically -created in response to a previous question tha t asked 'How many sheds are there on the farm?'. Page | 76 Modelling to identify factors that predicted the numbers of campylobacters on broiler neck skins. In preparation for statistical analyses, the information in the relational database was required to be com bined into a single flat-form spreadsheet. The general approach to assembling the information in the required format was to begin with the slaughter batches. For each slaughter batch, the corresponding farm information was linked to it in a single data t able. A number of FBOs take birds from farms typically in a repeating cycle of between 45 and 55 days. Thus, there were some instances where different batches of birds were taken from different farms on different days. In these cases, a complete set of farm infrastructure data was included for every instance of birds. Farmed batches of birds were linked based on farm county parish holding (CPH) number (or the red tractor assurance number as decided by the FBO), the FBO plant operations identifier (form erly the plant licence number). The structured query language (SQL) used to fetch the linked information is provided as Appendix 7. Information colle cted by the website was held in the database tables as standard English language ASCII (American standard code for information interchange) text. The first stage of modelling was to encode the text responses into numeric information (e.g. House construction frame wood =1, House construction frame metal = 2) . The two main types of variable were defined as nominal or categorical. Nominal information bore some relation to the encoded number. For example, the first clearance of birds from a house was encoded as '1', the second removal of birds as '2'. For categorical variables, there was no relationship between the value of the number and the information encoded. Numerical information such as bird age in days or house age in years wa s used without further conversion. Data were sorted in MS Excel (version 2010; Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA, USA) by slaughterhouse identifier, then farm identifier and then shed identifier prior to import into the modelling software, as a formatting requi rement of the software. The software package MLwiN (Rasbash et al ., 2009) was used to construct a hierarchical linear model to account properly for the correlation structure within the collec ted data. In the initial model, a two -level hierarchy was speci fied as the slaughterhouse and supply farm identifiers . In subsequent models, a broiler house identifier was included in a model that included subsequent batches of birds. For all of the model s developed, the assumptions necessary for fitting models of t his type (e.g. normally distributed residuals and homogeneity of their variance) were verified as satisfactory. The modelling process proceeded by alternately fitting predictor variables to a model that attempted to predict the log numbers of campylobacte rs and removing those that were not significant at 0.05, using a Chi -square test of the change in likelihood (Wald test) . Variables that had been removed were then retested in later iterations as the model was developed until only statistically signif icant predictor variables remained. The model was developed starting from a base model which included a constant and a categorical variable which specified an additive effect for each sample collected. A key to describe the shortened variable names presented in the analysis is included towards the end of Appendix 6. Page | 77 Microbiological testing to determine Campylobacter numbers on broiler neck skins . Excision -based sampling of neck skins was undertaken on moving lines during normal commercial processing. Sample collection was immediately after the chilling phase of processing. Sample collection involved turning a sterile 304mm x 177mm stomacher bag (Seward, Thetford, England) inside out over a gloved hand, selecting carcases with neck skins of an appropriate len gth and excising a 10g sample using a pair of sterile scissors into the stomacher bag . Three combined neck skins were processed as a single sample . Nine volumes of maximum recovery diluent (MRD, Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) were added to each sample before homogenisation for 1 minute using a stomacher (Model number BA 6021, Seward, UK). Campylobacter 10272 -1:2006 standard method . All decimal dilutions were made using MRD and plating 48h. Confirmation of Campylobacter spp. was by microscopic examination of 5 colonies per plate to confirm corkscrew motility; an inability to show visible growth at 25oC after 72h, positive testing for oxidase and the inability to ferment lactose and sucrose . Bacterial numbers on all deci mally -diluted plates converted into cfu g -1 or cfu ml -1 as appropriate according to the criteria described by ISO 6887 -1:1999. Modelling to identify factors that predicted the numbers of campylobacters in broiler house litter. In essence, the genera l approach taken to determine risk factors for flock colonisation was analogous to that used for the prediction of numbers of campylobacters on neck skins. The main difference was the sample type used for the farm studies and the test methodology. The sa mple tested was broiler house litter, collected by farm staff walking through the broiler house wearing Tyvek overshoes worn over disposable polythene overshoes. Detailed sample collection instructions have been previously published (FSA study FS241049 final project report; (Madden et al ., 2014) ). Litter -derived samples were tested by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). qPCR. Each reaction was supplied from the manufacturer as a lyophilised mix of primers and labelled probe, which was reconst ituted as a master mix. 5l of the master mix, was aliquoted into each test well of a 96 well RT (real time) PCR plate (Life Technologies Waltham, MA , USA). qPCR plates were sealed with adhesive film (MicroAmp Optical Adhesive Film, Life technologies) an d briefly centrifuged (5000g, 30s) before thermal cycling. Reactions were undertaken on an Applied Biosystems ABI7500 instrument running 7500 fast systems sequence detection software (v1.4.0.27). The instrument cycling conditions were an initial heat to 95oC for 5 minutes to activate the HotStarTaq Plus DNA Polymerase. Followed by 40 cycles of a three -step amplification cycling: Denaturation, 15s at data collection at 60oC Extension, 10s at 72oC Page | 78 The detection repor ter excitation and emission channels for Campylobacter DNA were 495 and 520 nm respectively. The internal controls used excitation at 524nm and detection at 557 nm. As part of FSA study FS241049 , a calibration curve was constructed for the qPCR assay by plotting the detection cycle values of the Campylobacter DNA standards against known numbers of cells. The range spanned six decimal dilutions of a Campylobacter type culture (1x107 to 1x102 cfu/ml). At least five separate amplifications were used for ea ch point on the standard curve. The standard curve was used to convert the detection cycle to numbers of campylobacters. Page | 79 RESULTS AND DISCUSSI ON DATA MANIPULATIONS P RIOR TO ANALYSES Critical inspection of the raw data revealed there were several issues that were required to be resolved prior to multivariate statistical analyses. The first issue related to inadvertent duplicat ion of data entry. In many instances, FBOs had entered the same information more than once. Data entry errors of that type were readily identifiable if the information were ordered by sample collection date and grouped by the FBO plant operations identifier. Overall there were 23 instances of identical results being entered for the batch farming conditions (n=13), individual slaug hter batch questionnaires (n=8) and processing conditions on the day of slaughter (n=2). The majority of duplicate entries were identical copies (n=18), however , there were five instances of duplication where the information was not identical. These inst ances were handled on a case -by-case basis. In one case, an early information save contained answers to all of the questions asked. However, a second save less than 8 seconds later had some of the answers changed to \"Not answered\". The original save was used in that instance. There were three instances of 'accidental save' where the questions at the beginning of the form had been answered, but those towards the end of the questionnaire had not been completed (identified by saving the default response fo r the later questions). In those instances, the latest version of the saved information was used. One processor appeared to be providing deliberately unreliable information. An example of the type of errors that were evident in the submissions fro m the plant are shown as Table 15. The same CPH number was used for multiple farms over a period of several months. The FBO had been a reluctant participant and reta iler/FSA intervention had been required to clear two large data backlogs , each of several months. Since the provision of unreliable information had the potential to derail the whole modelling process, a ll of the information supplied by the FBO i n question was excluded from the analyses as a unanimous decision of the project team (including the FSA project officer). After parsing to remove duplicate and suspicious data, the dataset was imported into the MLwiN software for statistical analyses. Page | 80 Table 15 Selected example data from a single FBO that entered a single farm CPH number for farms with different postcodes ( yellow highlight ) and different CPH numbers for a farm with the postcode OF THE STATISTICAL PROCESS The approach of the current study was to record information about already -operating farm and processing plants and to analyse that information to determine if there were factors that influenced the numbers of campylobacters. In recent years, the collection of data, and in some cases, big data, and stat istical analyses has become an accepted scientific method for the identification of factors influencing a target of interest. The range of applications includes effective disease treatment identifications, better strategies for educating children and risk prediction for insurance industries. Although it is now firmly established, the approach is not perfect. In the current study, our role was to observe systems already operating to identify risk factors. Specifically, no attempt was made to ensure there were broadly equal numbers of different responses across the datasets. For the initial analyses, some of the responses provided were unevenly balanced e.g. there were only around 150/1780 sheds that contained beetles at harvest for the independent farm s tudies. In order for the statistics to be able to make credible comparisons, a larger number of sheds containing beetles would strictly be required. In addition, for those factors where there was sufficient representation across all responses our identif ication of specific risk factors involved an original assessment to identify a broad area of risk, followed by more detailed investigations. Some attempt was made for this study to investigate the basis for the observed elevated and protective risk factor s. However, these efforts focussed mainly on the published literature and since the study aims were to identify previously unknown risk factors, little further detail that was concrete was identified. Although the experience of the project team was that the participating farmers and processors were enthusiastic, the response rates to some questions were quite low. For example, for the independent farm studies, there were around 400 positive responses made that probiotic supplements had been used when gro wing birds, but less than 200 follow -on responses describing the type of prebiotic used. A typical drawback of the statistical process is that it can identify factors that are correlated with Campylobacter numbers, but does not provide much explanation of the reasons for the association. As a general strategy, modelling is useful to Page | 81 identify promising factors as a precursor to an experimental investigation that is balanced and appropriately replicated. Consequently, any discussion of the current study findings might be open to a criticism of being speculative. However, bearing that in mind, there was considerable discussions with farmers and knowledgeable industry representatives regarding the study findings. There is much that seems to be credible ex planation of what may be occurring in plants, and on farms, and so should be recorded and discussed because it may be helpful to others working to tackle the same issues. As an initial step, a Poisson model was constructed from the hierarchical supplement ary information linked with the neck skin test result. In total around 1250 rows of information were initially collected. When those rows that did not have a Campylobacter count above the LoD of the test method (10 cfu/g) were removed, 964 rows of inform ation remained. This data was used to undertake an initial run, in which only the seasonal variation was factored in to the model. It is already well established that counts follow a broadly sinusoidal pattern, linked with season. The results of which are shown as Figure 10. Figure 10 The results of an initial run of a Poisson regression within a multilevel framework prior to the addition of any potential risk factors to explain variance. Suffixes i, and j refer to farms and slaughterhouses respectively. The model sim ply calculated the seasonal change with time of year (expressed as sin and cos transformation of sequential day number mapped to a 360\u00b0 scale, together with a linear effect (decrease) from the start to the end of the year), and their significan t influence on the log 10 Campylobacter count on carcass neck skins. 0 is the constant in the equation. An important f inding from this initial model was that it quantified the total variation described by the data and also the gross factors influencing the numbers of campylobacters on neck skins in processing plants. Overall, 0.886 total units of variance were identified by the model. Around 23.7% (0.210/0.886) of the observed variation was from factors associated with the slaughterhouse, with the remaining variance (76.3%; 0.676/0.886) associated with on -farm factors. Thus, although it was reported previously that slau ghterhouses differ in their ability to hygienically process colonised birds into carcasses (Anonymous, 2010b), what occurred during the rearing of the birds on farm was more than three times more important in terms of the final carcass Campylobacter load. The errors between the actual plate count and the model prediction are shown in Figure 11. The numbers on the y -axis are the residual difference between the measure d count and model predicted count. These we re typically of the order of 0.1 -0.2 log cfu/g neck skin on counts of up to five or six log cfu/g .

The model was expanded by the addition and removal of factors to account for the observed variation. A n emphasis was placed on slaughterhouse factors because there was a more comprehensive dataset associated with birds during processing compared with rearing. In addition, the identified importance of the on -farm factors meant a more in -depth investigation would be appropriate. We investigated why there were less complete datasets for the farm data compared with the processing information. In brief, the result of discussions revealed there was a widely -adopted organisational structure within processing plants. The re were commonly two separate streams of personnel that have a single senior manager. The first stream was responsible for the processing of the birds within the plant. The second stream oversaw the agricultural aspects of chicken production such as feed and chick ordering and the scheduling of birds by weight or age to meet customer requirements. To answer the questions associated with farm infrastructure and batches of birds during rearing, the assistance of the agricultural team was required. However, the main interactions between the FSA, JWG and the industry were with the personnel stream that handled processing of birds. Whilst there was good 'buy -in' from the process stream staff, who reliably supplied the requested information relating to process ing, the goodwill extended to asking but not pursuing agricultural staff for the growing phase information. The agricultural stream staff were not well informed Page | 83 about the study or industry efforts to control campylobacters and so we believe they did not a ssign a high priority to the supply of farm data. The final best -fit Poisson model is shown as Figure 12. A visual depiction of the differences betwe en the model predictions and the measured numbers of campylobacters is shown as Figure 13. It is important to note that the straight line towards the left -hand side o f Figure 13 is a artefactual consequence of the limit of detection of 10 cfu/g of the ISO 10272 -2 laboratory test method. The limit of detection imposes a non -zero ba seline below which there were no counts.

The process ing model revealed several variables that had significant influence on the numbers of campylobacters contaminating post chill neck skins. It has been previously reporte d that e ffective cold water washing causes typical reductions in Campylobacter numbers from 2. 58 log cfu /ml chick en carcass rinse to 1.15 log cfu /ml (Berrang and Bailey 2009) . Consequently, it was no surprise that early iterations of the model highlighted the importance of rapid repair of the inside outside (IO) washer were it to fail or operate inefficiently during processing. In the final version of the model however, the time taken to implement corrective actions to ineffective IO washing fell just out side the threshold for significance. However, there were other factors that were significant which included the post chill carcass temperature (P=0.032); with lower temperatures associated with fewer campylobacters. It is also established that freezing c hickens (Haughton et al ., 2012) and chicken meat (Harrison et al ., 2013) can lower Campylobacter numbers. In some UK plants chilling that is effective enough to turn neck skins hard with visible surface ice formation occurs, especially when processi ng larger birds, which may necessitate a slower line speed and consequent increased chilling time. We consider it likely the exceptionally low temperatures achieved on these carcasses can cause freeze -mediated stress and cellular death. The likely mechanism fo r the rates of cooling found in commercial carcass chillers, is that freezing commenced in small isolated volumes of water (Archer 2004) . The freezing of these small pockets caused dissolved molecules to be displaced into the surrounding unfrozen fluid, t hereby increasing the osmotic potential of that liquid (Dumont et al ., 2004) . As the extracellular fluid became more concentrated, it began to remove water from the cytoplasm of the campylobacters by osmosis (Dumont et al ., 2004) . Ice crystals, formed from the water remaining inside the cytoplasm, are the primary method Page | 85 of cellular damage during freezing (Toner et al ., 1990) . However, when cooling rates of liquids are low (a few degrees per minute), it is possible that all of th e intracellular water can be removed from the cell before ice crystal formation (Dumont et al. 2004) . In addition, there is evidence that superoxide radicals form during freezing, which are similarly concentrated in unfrozen pockets of water and consequent ly contribute towards the death of campylobacters (Stead and Park 2000) . Most poultry processing plants set themselves performance criteria for key processing stages that are aimed at maintaining effective processing. One common performance target is the effectiveness of plucking (defeathering). Plucking equipment is adjusted to take account of different bird breeds (shapes) and sizes. Effectiveness is assessed by presence of faecal leakage after plucking and the numbers and degree of carcass damage. M eeting the plucking effectiveness target was identified by the model as beneficial in terms of reduced Campylobacter load on carcasses (P=0.0082). The finding is not surprising because the defeathering of chicken broiler carcasses has been identified as a high risk area for cross - contamination between birds and flocks (Allen et al ., 2003a;Allen et al ., 2003b;Allen et al ., 2008) . Furthermore, Campylobacter contamination of carcasses after plucking is highest compared with all of the other processing stages (Aburuwaida et al ., 1994;Hinton et al ., 2004) . Takahashi and colleagues (2006) further investigated the mechanisms of how the contamination of carcasses was increased using basic genetic fingerprinting of the campylobacters as an indication of source . Existing populations of campylobacters around the pluckers were shown to become more diverse as birds from different farms were processed. Furthermore, the new strain types observed were isolated more frequently after defeathering as compar ed to other proce ssing steps. Takahashi et al . (2006) concluded that d ifferent strains of campylobacters were spread between carcasses sourced from different farms because of the plucking stage . Given the Takahashi conclusion, it seems reasonable to assume the model has identified that properly -adjusted plucking equipment might minimise cross -contamination of campylobacters between different flocks (Takahashi et al ., 2006) . The model also identified the chiller cleaning frequency being met as important (P=0.018). Chil ler cleaning is notoriously difficult to accomplish in poultry processing plants because the chillers are seldom empty, and processing typically occurs 18-20 hours per day. Air chilling is almost exclusively used in broiler processing in the UK and there are reports that chilling can reduce the numbers of Campylobacter measured from carcasses . Reductions in the numbers of campylobacters was observed i n six out of 10 batches of birds examined just before and j ust after chilling (Allen et al ., 2008) . However, although the observed reductions were significant ( P<0.001), they were quite small and in only three of the positive batches was the reduction greater than one log. The authors remarked that the effect of chilling on carcass contamination was hig hly variable between different batches and between different plants. Cross-contamination of campylobacters between carcasses in the chiller was suspected to be one of the reasons for the variable results, although the mechanism of spread was not pursued. Allen et al ., 2008 also showed that chilling with added water sprays , which is commonly observed in British plants, can increase bacterial counts from the cavity of the carcass, especially for Pseudomonas spp. The use of water to aid chilling meant that some parts of the carcass were likely to retain enough moisture during the storage to allow for survival of Campylobacter and to withstand the drying process that occu rs at the same time as chilling. Although the model has identified chiller cleaning freq uency as a risk factor, there is currently little in the literature to explain the mechanisms operating. Page | 86 There are many reports of the seasonality of Campylobacter colonisation of birds and also human illness (Chowdhury et al ., 2013;Friedrich et al ., 2016 ;Yun et al ., 2016) . Therefore, it was not surprising that the model included a highly significant sinusoidal pattern of change associated with season (the Sin and Cos terms in the model). The final information noted by the model was that there was a si gnificant linear trend of reducing numbers of campylobacters across the entire study (P=0.045). The observed reduction was 0.0033 log cfu/g of neck skin per day. A POISSON MODEL IDEN TIFYING RISK FACTORS FOR THE COLONISATIO N OF BROILER CHICKEN S ON INDEPEN DENT FARMS Since the farm phase was identified by the initial model as important, there was further activity to identify on -farm risk factors. A significant difference between the initial work and the farm -focussed work was that a litter derived sample was used to assess the bird status and degree of any colonisation rather than a post -chill neck skin. Two different categories of farm were investigated. These were smaller, independent farms supplying lower -throughput integrated or independent processor s. Typical processor line speeds were 4000 -5,000 birds per hour. Integrated farms owned by high -throughput (10,000 -12000 birds per hour) processing plants, were also examined. The final independent farm model developed using MLWinN is shown as Figure 14. Figure 14 The final model for independent farms produced from the MLwiN multilevel analysis. Parameter estimates are in green with their standard errors shown within the brackets. The statistical significance of the individual terms can be calculated by dividing the parameter estimate by its standard error and referring the result to a normal distribution. Suffixes i, j and k refer to farms, broiler houses and farm batches respectively and depict the respective impact of each term to the observed variance. Farm categories (NewFmCat x) are listed in Appendix 8. Page | 87 The small farm model calculated the terms exerting significant influence on the log 10 Campylobacter count. The constant in the equation is tied to the first category of each categorical variable and to a bird age of zero. Thus, for example, to calculate the predicted (mean) count for a flock of age 42 days of bird gender category 3 (mixed gender birds), in a house with house construction category 2 (metal framework) but otherwise within the first group of the remaini ng categorical variables, the equation shown in Figure 15 would be used: Log10 Count = -8.561 + (0.331 x 42 (days)) - 0.785 + 0.462 Figure 15 An example of the use of the equation shown in Figure 14. Here the calculation shows the predicted (mean) log10 Campylobacter count for a flock of age 40 days for mixed gender birds, in a metal framed broiler house. Overall the analysis in Figure 14 showed that, between an a ge of 26 to 50 days, for every one -day increase in the age of a flock there was a mean increase in log 10 Campylobacter litter counts of 0.331 cfu/g (p < 0.001). There was also an overall protective effect for some bird genders. Houses containing exclusiv ely female birds had a geometric mean that was 1.107 log 10 cfu/g lower compared with sheds containing male gender birds (p < 0.001). Mixed gender sheds also tended to have significantly lower counts of 0.785 log 10 cfu/g compared with sheds containing only male birds (p = 0.020). From a practical viewpoint on farm, both male and females will be placed into houses on the same day and will generally be sourced from the same breeding stock (i.e. the farmer will get males and females from the same parent flock ). In around 50% of cases, the day -old chicks are delivered to independent farms with the males and females mixed together. Whether the gender and age predictors were correlated was also investigated and it was determined that there was no relationship. Furthermore, there was no significant gender and age interaction influence on the change in Campylobacter numbers between the different gender categories. It is common in the UK for the lighter female birds to be cleared from houses first, with the males allowed to grow on to a greater weight. The underlying reason for that practice is because cocks have the capacity to grow to a heavier weight and because cocks achieve a better feed conversion ratio (FCR, an index of how effectively the energy content o f feed is converted to bird muscle) compared with pullets (a young female chicken). In the current statistical model, it was determined that although females were cleared in preference to males for roughly half of the time, there were some processors that would harvest males first if they reached a set target weight before the females, thereby potentially masking any effect for age by gender. In contrast to integrated processors, independent slaughterhouses tend to favour heavier weight birds because a higher percentage of carcasses tended to be boned out for breast fillet rather than sold whole. One further contributing factor might be that final clearance male birds may experience catching in their house as many as five times during their life. Initial thinnings will most likely involve the females before commencing on lighter males. The employees undertaking Page | 88 catching are a risk factor for Campylobacter colonisation by birds in a house (Allen et al ., 2008;Hue et al ., 2010) . Thus, if catching occurs in large sheds many times before some birds are caught, then there is an increasing likelihood the remaining mostly male birds will become colonised with Campylobacter . For each day a bird was farmed, there was a mean increase in log 10 Campylobacter numbers of 0.331 cfu/g litter and investigations were undertaken to make sense of that finding. As a result of discussions between members of the project team and integrated and independent processors, it became clear that most integrators will thin only once i.e. one thin, and then houses are fully cleared. Independent processors however, will practice multiple thinnings before a shed is cleared. Farms with very large sheds, such those containing more than 50,000 birds; might thin as many as 6 -8 times before final clearance. The long clearance times are a consequence of independent processors servicing customers that want a range of weights between 1.35 kg live weight and 3.5 kg live weight and most independent processors having a relatively low proces sing capacity compared with integrated slaughterhouses. There was also an overall effect of the type of house construction on Campylobacter numbers with those broiler houses constructed from metal frames having 0.462 log 10 counts greater than those with wooden frames (p < 0.001). Although there was a mean increase of 1.438 log 10 numbers in type 3 (other frame type) construction houses compared with wooden framed houses, this was not statistically, significantly different (p = 0.088). An attempt was mad e to reclassify the originally - assigned farm categories to take account of farms with larger houses and determine any influence on log 10 Campylobacter numbers. The attempt was partly successful, although it was not possible to identify house areas (only t he bird numbers typically placed) for all farms from the information collected. Thus, testing for an interaction between shed size and age to determine whether the rate w as different between different shed sizes was not possible. Independent farms supply ing integrated processors would be expected to thin fewer times and these types of farm did have lower counts in their litter compared with farms supplying independent processors. We also observed that two categories of farms supplying two separate indepe ndent processors had counts which were significantly lower than the general group of independent farms supplying independent processors. The houses on these two farm groups were predominantly wood -framed and it was these two farm groups that were mainly r esponsible for a study finding of a protective effect for wood framing as the house material. We hypothesise that steel frames are generally stronger than the equivalent timber ones. Consequently, steel frames can be used to construct larger sheds than timber -framed ones. Larger sheds can hold larger numbers of birds, and so the protective effect of wood framing may simply be a proxy of numbers of birds placed and the number of depopulations, stress events and exposure to catchers required to clear the shed. We also noted that in contrast to metal, unpainted and pressure stained wood is porous. Thus, it might generally be expected that an exposed porous wooden surface would provide a niche for campylobacters. An alternative possible explanation for w ood being beneficial is that there are natural antimicrobial resins in wood, and pressure impregnated preservatives have at least the potential to be antimicrobial (Willfor et al ., 2004) . The species of wood used and its structure in terms of knots influe nce the distribution and concentration of antimicrobials contained with the structure (Willfor et al ., 2004) . Page | 89 If prebiotics were fed to birds, the mean log 10 count was increased by 1.400 (p < 0.001). Prebiotics are compounds that function in a wide -ranging manner. Generally, their mechanism of action is to influence gut microbiota either by providing a nutrient preferentially to a specific group of bacteria or specific inhibition of the growth of some bacterial groups. However, prebiotics can also influence immunological targets and adhesion to gut columnar epithelia and thereby indirectly promote or inhibit bacterial populations (Pourabedin and Zhao 2015) . Further investigation of the nature of the risk for prebiotic use was not possible. Although a number of farmers responded that prebiotics had been used, there were too few specific products listed for robust analyses. The use of prebiotics and the mech anisms causing the increased risk are subjects that will be investigated as further work. In the early stages of the study we observed significance for short feed withdrawal time and lower Campylobacter numbers. The significance did not extend to the end of the project or survive multivariate analyses. However, we noted during the study duration that every time birds were thinned, feed was withdrawn from all the birds in the house, not just those being thinned. Feed withdrawal stresses birds and so larg er sheds with multiple birds will have birds that were stressed multiple times. As was stated previously modelling can provide clues to important factors and follow up work can be properly designed to investigate such clues. The early significance of fee d withdrawal time may be a clue it is important and that the influence was masked because the sample representing higher risk, longer feed times was under -represented as a coincidental consequence of the types of farms that participated in the study. Farm category also exerted an influence on log 10 Campylobacter numbers. More specifically, compared with independent farms supplying independent processors, independent farms supplying integrated processors had lower counts in their litter by around 1.091 log 10 cfu/g (p = 0.001). Furthermore, there were two categories of farms supplying two different independent processors that had counts which were 2.459 log 10 cfu/g lower (p = 0.001) and 1.237 log 10 cfu/g lower (p <0.001) than a general group of independent farms supplying independent processors. The remaining categories of farm were not significantly different from category 1 (independent farms supplying independent processors), although an elevated log 10 count for the category 13 farms (a mix of farms supp lying a single specific independent processor) that was 1.789 higher and only just failed to reach statistical significance (p = 0.062). A POISSON MODEL TO D ETERMINE RISK FACTOR S FOR BIRD COLONISAT ION ON INTEGRATED FA RMS For the integrated model, litter testing and supplementary data collections were undertaken from at least three different batches of birds on 50 different farms. There were 876 sets of supplementary information collected and the participating farms sent birds to eight processing lines in seven different slaughterhouses. The integrated model had two levels of hierarchy at the farm and house levels. The farm level explained 32.9% of the observed variation with the remaining 67.1% variance associated with individual broiler houses. Page | 90 A smal l number of edits were made to the data before it was used. All the sheds that were sampled had barriers in their anterooms and so these responses were excluded from the statistical analyses. In addition, the number of days that sheds were empty between consecutive batches of birds was unanswered on around 40% of the questionnaires and thus this data was also excluded from the analyses. It has been previously reported that extended periods between consecutive flocks is a risk factor for bird colonisation (Hog et al ., 2016) as a likely consequence of poorly maintained biosecurity in unused houses. The final model, manually assembled by assessing the impact of the on -farm factors and developed us ing MLwiN is shown as Figure 16. Figure 16 The final model produced for integrated farms by the MLwiN multilevel analysis. Parameter estimates are in green with their standard errors shown with in the brackets. The statistical significance of the individual terms can be calculated by dividing the parameter estimate by its standard error and referring the result to a normal di stribution. Suffixes i, and j refer t o farms and broiler houses respec tively and depict the respective impact of each term to the observed variance. The model calculated the terms exerting significant influence o n the log 10 Campylobacter count. The constant ( ) in the equation is tied to the first category of each categor ical variable and to a bird age of zero. Overall, the analysis in Figure 16 showed that between the ages of 26 to 50 days, for every one -day increase in the age of a flock there was a mean increase in log 10 Campylobacter litter counts of 0.087 cfu/g litter (p < 0.001). It has been reported previously, bird age was found to be a significant predictor of bird colonisation status. Within the Sahin et al ., (2015) review there are at least six previous reports of correlations between bird age and Campylobacter colonisation. A number of explanations have been proposed including the breaking of shed biosecurity by the chicken catchers, seasonal an d climate changes, the use of ventilators during summer, the number of broiler houses on farm and local fly populations for sheds that lacked fly screens (Sahin et al . 2015) . Allen et al ., (2008) reported that campylobacters were isolated from chicken cat chers, their clothing, vehicles and equipment immediately after arrival on farms. The isolations were from different sets of catchers working for a variety of UK processors in the mid -2000s, which was compelling evidence that, historically at least; the b reaking of biosecurity was credibly implicated with Campylobacter colonisation and bird age. Page | 91 Also related to biosecurity breaches, farmers that excluded their dogs from entry into the broiler houses showed a protective effect of significantly decreased numbers of campy lobacters in the litter (p<0.05). In the final iteration of the model, litter wetness was also initially significant. However, inclusion of 'dogs in sheds' into the model provided a better explanation of the observed variation and caused the degree of litter wetness to fall below the level of statis tical significance (p= 0.06). More generally, the presence of a dog on farm did not quite reach significance (P=0.057). The importance of dogs on bird colonisation status has previously been iden tified as important on Dutch broiler farms. Bouwknegt et al . (2004) report an increased Campylobacter prevalence (i.e. the percentage of farms testing positive for campylobacters) for farms where dogs lived (Bouwknegt et al ., 2004) . Ellis -Iversen et al . (2012) also report that animals such as cattle, dogs, wildlife and rodents were significantly associated with positive flocks, whilst other studies have reported that farms with non -poultry livestock in close proximity (<2km, (Jonsson et al. 2012) ) and th e density of non - poultry farming operations nea r to broiler farms (Sommer et al ., 2013) are risk factors. Although there are reports of other livestock increasing broiler colonisation prevalence in the literature, none of the other animals (cat, cattle, turkey, sheep, pig, horse, llama) assessed by this study had a significant impact on the numbers of campylobacters in the litter. However, it was quite rare for llamas, turkey, sheep and horses to be found on broiler farms. As might be expected for a basi c biosecurity practice, increasing the frequency of dipping boots in disinfectant was significantly protective for campylobacters in house litter. Campylobacters can be ubiquitous environmental inhabitants and, i n general, bacteria, including campylobacte rs, thrive in niches where ther e is moisture (Pitkanen 2013) . Ellis-Iverson et al . (2012) report that campylobacter s are routinely isolated from standing water (e .g. puddles) on broiler farms, whereas the dust extracted from mechanically -ventilated broile r houses also routinely contains campylobacters (Chinivasagam et al. 2009) . Our finding is contrary to the observations of Hog et al . (2016) who report the presence of boot dips on Danish farms is a risk factor for flock colonisation. However, Hog et al . (2016), when discussing their unexpected result, acknowledge previous studies of the type undertaken by Gibbens et al . (2001), who report that the frequency of replenishment of disinfectant in a boot dip should be at least twice weekly, otherwise there is no protective effect (Gibbens et al. 2001) . Other studies have concluded that insufficient active disinfectant within a boot dip can act as a reservoir for campylobacter s (McDowell et al ., 2008) . Although increasing litter moisture content was significa nt until dogs in sheds were included into the model, the presence of darkling beetles ( Alphitobius diaperinus ; also, commonly referred to as the lesser mealworm) in the litter was a significant risk factor (p<0.01). Japp et al ., (2010) report that a high degree of litter wetness is a risk factor for the colonisation of broiler houses by darkling beetles (Japp et al., 2010) . Thus, although litter wetness itself was excluded from the model in favour of dog access to sheds, indicators of high moisture conten t remained significant. Information in the literature is quite sparse on the role of beetles in spreading campylobacters, thus the finding is quite novel. One study artificially contaminated d arkling beetles b efore feeding them to broilers (Hazeleger et al., 2008) . The authors reported that campylobacters could be isolated from those birds that had consumed the artificially contaminated insects. However, artificially -contaminated campylobacters did not survive well on the beetles and could not be isolat ed from them one week after inoculation (Hazeleger et al ., 2008) . The Hazeleger study also collect ed limited numbers of naturally -contaminated insects from a commercial broiler farm and showed that when birds consumed these insects they also became coloni sed, Page | 92 albeit at low levels. A general conclusion of the work was that Campylobacter can be transmitted via beetles and their larvae, and the authors emphasised it was a likely scenario that such transfers applied to successive rearing cycles. House age was also identified as a risk factor, with older houses being more likely to contain colonised birds. Recently, Hog et al . (2016) identified the same risk factor, although their binomial model compared housed older and newer than five years. Hog et al ., (2016) briefly discuss that the basis of their finding could be that older houses are more likely to be in poorer repair and thus have a lower standard of biosecurity. Whilst that seems plausible, our observations are that older houses can have a less hygienic fundamental design and can be difficult to effectively clean and sanitise. For example, newer broiler houses with a modern design lack the horizontal roof spars common in older houses. The upper surface of the roof supports required a ladder to be cleaned and many houses have a layer of dust on these supports that is several years old. There are broiler houses still in operation in the UK that pre -date the identification of Campylobacter as a foodborne human pathogen. We consider it likely that improved hygienic design and ease of cleaning is at least partly responsible for the protective effect of modern broiler houses. The final risk factor identified by the model was sample type. Sample type is probably a proxy for bird age because the options of first clearance, second or later clearance and final clearance tend to occur at specific bird ages. The model reported that there was increasing colonisation risk with each subsequent clearance. Several authors have suggested the basis for the increased risk is the breaking of biosecurity (Alali and Hofacre 2016;Battersby et al ., Allen et al . (2008) report Campylobacter isolations from staff that harvest chickens, their boot grips, clothing and equipment, the insides of the vehicles they travel in as well as the bird transport crates, modules and fork-lifting machinery. GENERAL CO NCLUSIONS FROM THE M ODELS As discussed above, industry has provided some credible explanations as to why some of the on -farm factors identified influence Campylobacter numbers in litter. However, to confirm/investigate the mechanisms that are operating, f urther experimental work should be commenced. Some of the required studies could be undertaken at small expense, by making use of existing standard operations within some companies. For example, there is at least one integrated processor in the UK that r outinely sexes and grows birds in single sex houses on the same farm. The establishment of sample collections and testing on a series of suitable farms could form the foundation of further investigations to confirm our hypotheses or otherwise determine th e nature of the protective effect for the female gender. Similarly, there were a small number of farms contained within the current studies that had a mixture of metal and wooden framed houses. Extended study of these farms and an appropriate balanced mi xture of farms with exclusive different house frames might provide further clues regarding the nature of the protective effect of wooden framed houses on independent farms. In addition to the factors that remained significant through the multi -level, multi -variate modelling process, there were some factors that were significant for most of the duration of both farm studies but did not survive the final analyses. The most interesting of these was the length of time that feed was withdrawn from birds during thinning, with shorter Page | 93 withdrawal times having a protective effect. As was previously stated, the current study was observational and no attempt was made to recruit a balance of farms with broadly equal numbers for each of the different answer options on the questionnaires. Consequently, feed withdrawal time may be an important consideration that was masked by answer bias in the participating farms. Given feed withdrawal is likely to stress birds, and feed is withdrawn from all of the birds in a s hed (not just the ones being thinned), there may be merit in further investigation using a balanced range of withdrawal times. Possibly, the role of feed withdrawal could be investigated in isolation from the other stresses associated with thinning i.e . investig ation of feed withdrawal without exposure to potentially -contaminated catchers or the stress of the catching process. The final risk factor that could be investigated further is the use of prebiotics, which increased litter counts on average b y 1.4 log cfu /g on the independent farms. No significant influence was noted for the integrated farm studies. Prebiotics are compounds that manipulate gut microbiota using a diverse range of mechanisms. A general poor response to questions asking the full details of probiotic products used hampered better investigation of the mechanisms promoting bird colonisation by campylobacters for the independent study. However, it should be straightforward to design experimental work that compares colonisation in birds grown w ith and without popular prebiotic products.
