Here's what the research says. If you live with depression, you may feel like you want to tackle it from all directions: therapy, medication, lifestyle changes, and natural remedies. But which ones are safe? Complementary or alternative medicines (CAM) are becoming more respected in the Western model of medicine, as researchers study them in clinical settings. As with every depression treatment, there's no one-size-fits-all approach. Some remedies may help as-is if your symptoms are mild, but in most cases, they should be considered complementary to other therapeutic approaches, not a replacement for them. If you're interested in trying CAM to help treat your depression, it's important to work with your treatment team to figure out the best and safest plan for you. A note on supplements Getting nutrients from the foods you eat is almost always the better choice. If you're interested in trying a supplement to boost your intake of a certain nutrient, it's best to speak with a healthcare professional first to discuss the best dosage and any potential risks. Some supplements can interact with certain medications or be harmful if you take too much. Science has found a link between various vitamins and mood. In some cases, a deficiency in certain nutrients may be linked with depression symptoms, in other cases, a higher intake of certain vitamins may be associated with improved mood. Quite often, however, research is mixed. Vitamin D The research on vitamin D and depression is mixed. Several [studies](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/vitamin-d-deficiency-and-depression-in-adults-systematic-review-and-metaanalysis/F4E7DFBE5A7B99C9E6430AF472286860) have noted the link between vitamin D deficiency and depression symptoms. Yet a [recent study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768978) Still, you may find some benefits. You can get enough vitamin D through spending time in the sun, supplementing with cod liver oil, or eating certain foods. Dietary [sources of vitamin D](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/9-foods-high-in-vitamin-d) include: - beef liver - cheese - eggs - fortified products like milk - mushrooms - oily fish, like salmon and sardines Vitamin C Research shows that vitamin C helps regulate neurotransmitters like dopamine, the \"feel-good\" chemical, along with norepinephrine and epinephrine. Some [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6071228/) [others](https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-015-0609-1) A [review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955286320304915) of the existing literature suggests that more studies are needed to be sure. You may already know that oranges are rich in vitamin C, but that's not all. [Other sources](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-c-foods) include: - broccoli - Brussels sprouts - citrus fruits - peppers - potatoes - strawberries Magnesium [Research](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08039488.2018.1538388) shows a link between low magnesium levels and depression, but a consensus on how exactly the two are related has not been reached. Interestingly, a [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032718321050) of more than 17,000 adults found that daily magnesium supplementation was helpful for women but not men. Yet other studies show it can be helpful for all, regardless of sex. One [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0899900716302441) found that taking 500 milligrams a day for 8 weeks could improve symptoms of depression. In addition to supplements, magnesium can [be sourced from](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-foods-high-in-magnesium): - avocados - bananas - dark chocolate - legumes - nuts - tofu - seeds Calcium [Research](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/ppc.12533) [inconclusive](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0004867416676895). To try increasing your levels of [calcium through food](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/15-calcium-rich-foods), consider adding more: - cheese - dark leafy greens - milk - sardines - soybeans - yogurt Zinc While there is older [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3542443/) [research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0004867416676895) does not indicate statistically significant improvement. More research is needed. Still, you may find that it works for you. Beyond supplements, [zinc can be found in](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/best-foods-high-in-zinc): - beans - milk - nuts - seafood - seeds Folate (vitamin B9) Folate (vitamin B9) has long been [suggested](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15671130/) [research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022395617305927) shows that those with depression have lower folate levels. A combination of folate and vitamin B12 may ease symptoms, according to one [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12888-020-2455-2). Vitamin B9 exists in its natural form, folate, and as an artificial form, known as [folic acid](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/folic-acid-vs-folate). To ensure people get enough vitamin B9 through their diet, some foods like certain grains are often fortified with folic acid. Folic acid supplements are also available. However, getting too much folic acid through supplements may come with [health risks](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/folic-acid-side-effects), as unmetabolized folic acid can build up in your blood. [Food sources of vitamin B9](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods-high-in-folate-folic-acid) include: - asparagus - broccoli - Brussels sprouts - leafy greens - sunflower seeds - peanuts - fortified grains Niacin (vitamin B3) [Niacin](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Niacin-HealthProfessional/) There is not enough research to show that niacin can help improve depression symptoms alone, but some [studies](https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/abs/10.1024/0300-9831/a000720?journalCode=vit) suggest that a combination of B-vitamins may help. There have also been positive [findings](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5852710/) [Sources of niacin](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods-high-in-niacin) include supplements, as well as: - eggs - dairy products - fish - legumes - nuts - poultry Vitamin B12 There is some older [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3856388/) While there is not enough new [evidence](https://www.cureus.com/articles/42615-vitamin-b12-supplementation-preventing-onset-and-improving-prognosis-of-depression) to show that B12 can directly improve mood, there is a correlation between low levels of this vitamin and depression symptoms. Supplements aside, [dietary sources of vitamin B12](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-b12-foods) include: - eggs - fish - milk - nutritional yeast - poultry - tempeh If you find it challenging to get all the nutrients you need from diet alone, supplements may help. Still, it's important to speak with a healthcare professional before trying a new supplement to determine the best dosage and discuss potential side effects or medication interactions. Probiotics [Probiotics](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/probiotics-101) are live bacteria that aid your digestion and destroy cells that cause disease. [Some say](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4662178/) [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5319175/) One recent [study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.618279/full) showed that people with [major depressive disorder (MDD)](https://psychcentral.com/depression/major-depressive-disorder) had improved symptoms in just 8 weeks. [Sources of probiotics](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/11-super-healthy-probiotic-foods) include: - kefir - kimchi - acids [Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/17-health-benefits-of-omega-3) give your heart, immune system, and endocrine system (hormones) ample energy to function. A recent [review study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-019-0515-5) Other [studies](https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/502652) have shown that omega-3 fatty acids are safe for pregnant women, children, and seniors alike, and they do not have [side effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5481805/) Omega-3s [can be found](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/12-omega-3-rich-foods) in fish or vegan algae oil capsules, as well as: - chia seeds - cold-water fish - flaxseeds - walnuts - soybeans SAMe [S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe)](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/sadenosyllmethionine-same-in-depth) While there have been at least 40 studies on SAMe and depression with some positive results, the evidence is not conclusive. One [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6457972/) Another [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5501081/) Still, you may find it helps. Beyond supplements, sources of [methionine](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/methionine) include: - Brazil nuts - egg whites - seafood - sesame seeds - sunflower seeds NAC [N-acetyl cysteine (NAC)](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/nac-benefits) is a precursor to L-cysteine, an amino acid found in your body. Research from [2018](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-018-1845-1) [2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019701861930364X) explored this supplement as adjunctive therapy to [treatment-resistant depression](https://psychcentral.com/depression/treatment-resistant-depression) and depression-induced anxiety with promising results. [Studies](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2018/2469486/) have shown that it can also be used alongside antidepressant medications, though more research is needed in this area. You can supplement with NAC or find it in foods high in protein, including: - eggs - legumes - poultry - sunflower seeds - yogurt GABA [Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)](https://www.healthline.com/health/gamma-aminobutyric-acid) is a neurotransmitter produced by the body to promote relaxation, regulate sleep, and prevent depression. For those who live with depression, [research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089662731930220X) shows there may be abnormalities with the GABA system in the brain. Currently, there is not much evidence on how well GABA reaches the brain in supplement form. [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4594160/) A [2020 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33041752/) It's too soon to say whether this is an effective treatment for depression. It may be more beneficial to do activities that promote GABA, like exercise and meditation. Apart from supplements, foods that stimulate GABA include: - berries - brown rice - lentils - seafood - potatoes - tomatoes Melatonin [Melatonin](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/melatonin) is a hormone naturally produced by your body. It keeps your circadian rhythm in check and lets you know when it's time to go to sleep. The research on whether a supplement of melatonin can help depression is mixed. A [2016 study](https://www.longdom.org/open-access/the-potential-role-of-melatonin-on-mental-disorders-insights-fromphysiology-and-pharmacology-2472-1077-1000105.pdf) found that it may actually cause short-term depression. On the other hand, both a [2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acps.12755) [2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30073921/) You can support melatonin production with supplements or [foods](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5409706/) - cherries - eggs - fish - grapes - peppers - tomatoes - mustard seeds Creatine [Creatine](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-is-creatine) is an organic compound obtained through animal products like: - milk - poultry - red meat - seafood It's stored in your muscles and used to build lean muscle mass and improve energy. It's a popular sports supplement, but recent [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6769464/) New [research](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.16.21251840v1) also suggests that increasing creatine in the prefrontal cortex of your brain may improve mood, but more research is needed. Herbal remedies have been used around the world for centuries to help relieve symptoms of depression. It's good to keep in mind that research on the effectiveness of these herbs is often limited. St. John's wort [St. John's wort](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/is-st-johns-wort-safe-080615) is a flowering plant native to Europe. It's well-documented to improve mood in the short term. In fact, [research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032716315920) shows it's on par with SSRI medications for mild to moderate depression. A word of caution St. John's wort should not be used with certain antidepressant medications because it could cause [serotonin syndrome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6734608/) - is a flowering plant native to Arctic European regions. It's an adaptogenic herb, meaning it helps your body adapt to stress. So far, a small body of [research](https://globalpsychiatry.co.uk/article_1318.html) suggests that rhodiola may be effective for treating mild to moderate cases of depression, though more studies are needed. A [2020 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032719331398) even found that rhodiola was safe to use in tandem with sertraline (Zoloft) and that it's effective for symptoms of major depressive disorder. Turmeric What can't [turmeric](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/top-10-evidence-based-health-benefits-of-turmeric) do? This ancient Indian spice, and its main active ingredient curcumin, seems to cover a wide [array of ailments](https://www.phytojournal.com/archives/2017/vol6issue1/PartA/6-1-17-211.pdf), depression included. While more research is still needed, several [clinical trials](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7728608/) To date, no adverse effects [have been reported](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1525861016306752) in any studies. Saffron [Saffron](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/saffron) is a rich crimson spice from Iran. It's been used medicinally since ancient times. An older [meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4643654/) More recent [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3731881/) One [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6266642/) There are no known negative drug interactions for saffron, though you shouldn't take it if you're allergic to olives. Chai hu Chai hu is a flowering plant that's been used in Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) for more than 2,000 years. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5036551/) A recent [systematic review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5816377/) Maca [Maca](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/benefits-of-maca-root) comes from a plant native to Peru. It's typically ground up into a fine powder. In 2015, a small [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24931003/) Recent [research](http://mail.phcogj.com/article/1334) on rats shows that maca can have an antidepressant effect while increasing learning and memory. To support your treatment, there are several lifestyle modifications you can make. Exercise [Research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0091743517302943) shows that exercise can be effective in reducing symptoms of depression, due to the release of feel-good neurochemicals, like endorphins. Depression symptoms can make it hard for some people to get motivated to lift weights or do vigorous physical activity. Some other movement ideas include: - bicycling - dancing - gardening - swimming - walking Meditation A large body of [research](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13607863.2020.1793901) suggests that [meditation can reduce symptoms of depression](/depression/meditation-for-depression) and anxiety, among other mental health conditions. Some [studies](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/vitamin-d-deficiency-and-depression-in-adults-systematic-review-and-metaanalysis/F4E7DFBE5A7B99C9E6430AF472286860) show that it's even on par with or, or effective than, physical exercise. [Studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30597302/) Yoga [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5871291/) [studies](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2020/04/05/bjsports-2019-101242?utm_content=americas&utm_campaign=usage&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=trendmd) suggest the more times a week you do it, the better you may feel. Note that some [research](https://www.aafp.org/afp/2019/0515/p620.html?cmpid=em_AFP_20190318) has shown that yoga may not be an appropriate stand-alone treatment for therapy-resistant depression. You may find it helpful to try free YouTube yoga instructions like [Yoga with Adrienne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sxddnugwu-8) at home, or book a restorative or yin yoga class at a nearby gym or studio. There is growing support behind psychedelic therapy for the treatment of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and other mental health conditions. The psychedelics most commonly used for drug-assisted showed positive outcomes for treatment-resistant depression. After two doses of psilocybin in a therapeutic setting, the majority of the study participants still had reduced symptoms of depression 3 and 6 months later. A [small 2020 study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2772630) [psilocybin](/depression/psilocybin-for-depression) provided \"large, rapid, and sustained antidepressant effects.\" A [2021 study](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-45660-001) of 164 participants noted a marked improvement in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, such as rumination. An important note on legality Psychedelics are still illegal in the majority of states and countries around the world. There are some exceptions in clinical settings. To locate an upcoming study near you, refer to the [Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS)](https://maps.org/participate/participate-in-research). Due to something called the gut-brain axis, [research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12888-020-2455-2) shows that a healthy diet is linked with reduced symptoms of depression. Vitamins and minerals linked with lowered depression can be found in a variety of ingredients. These include: - citrus fruits for vitamin C - dark chocolate for magnesium - eggs for niacin - fish for omega-3 fatty acids - leafy greens for calcium - nuts for zinc - poultry for vitamin B12 - seeds for folate [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5319175/) Many [studies](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1028415X.2019.1620425) on the Mediterranean diet, in particular, show reduced symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. This lifestyle emphasizes whole, unprocessed, nutrient-rich foods including: - ancient and whole grains - fruits - lean cuts of meat of fish - nuts - olive oil - seeds - vegetables For those with moderate to severe depression, between [40% and 60%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK361016/) Natural remedies are a bit [trickier to measure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2786903/) In either case, your symptom relief will depend on how severe your symptoms are. Keep in mind that some supplements, like [St. John's wort](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/st-johns-wort-and-depression-in-depth) Always speak with your doctor before you add a new element to your self-care regimen. [Depression](https://psychcentral.com/depression/depression) is complex. There's no one-size-fits-all treatment. What works for one person may not work for you. An [integrated approach](https://psychcentral.com/depression/depression-treatment) \u2014 like talk therapy, medication, lifestyle changes, and natural remedies \u2014 may help you improve your symptoms. If possible, consider a diet of whole, unprocessed, nutrient-dense food to get the most vitamins and minerals working for your mind and body. You may also want to incorporate a regular meditation practice, exercise, or yoga. Most importantly, try not to lose hope. With the right treatment plan and some patience, depression is manageable. You are not alone and healing is possible. "}
