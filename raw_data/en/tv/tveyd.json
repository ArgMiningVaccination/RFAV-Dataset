A random selection of 30 female, postmenopausal volunteers aged 60-70 years, including 15 cases without osteoporosis and 15 cases with the KYD pattern of osteoporosis, were enrolled at the Physical Examination Center of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Venous blood was extracted and the serum was separated. The hFOB 1.19 cells were treated with 10% KYD pattern-serum or control serum from postmenopausal women of the same age range without osteoporosis. It was found that the KYD pattern-serum significantly decreased the cell viability, activity of alkaline phosphatase and number of calcified nodules, as expression of osteocalcin and osteoprotegerin (OPG) and upregulated that of receptor activator of nuclear factor B ligand (RANKL) in the hFOB 1.19 cells. In addition, the present results showed that the concentrations of estradiol (E2), OPG and insulin-like factor-1 (IGF-1) in the were lower than those in the control serum. In combination, these findings suggest that the downregulation of E2, OPG and IGF-1 in the KYD pattern-serum inhibits the OPG/RANKL system, leading to a decrease in bone formation in the hFOB 1.19 cells. This indicates that the alterations in E2, OPG and IGF-1 may account for the susceptibility of certain postmenopausal women to the KYD pattern of osteoporosis. Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO), a common disease characterized by bone reduction and microarchitectural deterioration of the bone, has a serious effect on the quality of life of the patients, particularly the elderly ( According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory, PMO can be classied into different Kidney-Yin and Yang deciency patterns ( Ethical approval for the present study was obtained from the Clinical Trial Ethics Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian University of TCM (Fuzhou, China), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the experiment. A random selection of 30 postmenopausal female volunteers aged 60-70 years, including 15 women with and 15 without osteoporosis, was enrolled in the study from the Physical Examination Center of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian University of TCM. The diagnosis of PMO was defined by a bone mineral density (BMD) T-score of 2.5 standard deviations below the young normal gender-matched BMD of the reference database, in accordance with the World Health Organization criteria ( The TCM diagnosis of the participants was based on the information obtained from four diagnostic processes, including looking, smelling, asking and touching. The diagnostic criteria of the KYD pattern included a sensation of cold and aching in the loins and knees, cold limbs and body, sexual hypoesthesia, infertility due to cold in the uterus, dispiritedness and lassitude, early morning diarrhea or frequent micturition, clear and profuse urine, profuse nocturnal urine, loose stools, bright whitish or blackish complexion and a light-colored tongue with white fur, as well as a deep and weak pulse ( Venous blood was collected in the morning between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m. and centrifuged for 10 min at 1,200 \u00d7 g within 30 min, and the serum was separated and stored at 80\u00b0C. An hFOB 1.19 human osteoblastic cell line from the Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology (Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco-BRL, Grand Island, NY, in humidified incubator with 5% CO2. When the cells reached 80% confluence, they were harvested with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution and then seeded in 96- and 12-well plates at a density of 6\u00d7103 and 1\u00d7105 cells/well, respectively, in a medium of 10% FBS. Twenty-four hours after stabilization, the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline solution twice and treated with the KYD pattern-serum or control serum from postmenopausal women without osteoporosis. The cells were treated with 10% KYD pattern-serum for different periods of time. The medium was discarded and replaced with 10 \u00b5l MTT (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 37\u00b0C for 4 h and then 100 \u00b5l dimethylsulfoxide was added. The absorbance at 490 nm was measured on an ELISA reader (Model EXL800; BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). Following treatment with the KYD pattern-serum for 72 h, the cells were lysed with 0.05% Triton X-100 (Amresco, Inc., Solon, USA). The activity of ALP was determined by the conversion of Calcified nodules of the hFOB 1.19 cells treated with 10% KYD pattern-serum were demonstrated by Alizarin red S staining. The cells were seeded into 48-well plates at a density of 2\u00d7105 cells per well. The cells were subsequently treated with 10% KYD pattern-serum for 14 days and then fixed with 0.5 ml/well formalin:methanol:H2O (1:1:1.5) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were stained with 0.1% Alizarin red S (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min and images of the stained calcified nodules were captured using microscopy. Total RNA from the cells was isolated using TRIzol\u00ae reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). RT was performed using random primers and the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis system (Invitrogen Life Technologies). qPCR was conducted in an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System using the SYBR\u00ae Green PCR Master Mix (Invitrogen Life Technologies). The sequences of the GGA CTC was as follows: Denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min and 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 20 sec, 57\u00b0C for 10 sec, and 72\u00b0C for 30 sec. The amplification and melting curve data were collected. Fold-changes of the genes expression were estimated according to the comparative 2Ct method. Total cellular protein was extracted from the cells using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Beyotime Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), and the total protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay. Equal quantities of protein were separated using SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Invitrogen Life Technologies). blots were blocked with 5% skimmed milk powder (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at room temperature and were incubated with rabbit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) overnight at 4\u00b0C followed by a goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody IgG (1:10,000; ZB-2301; Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) at room temperature for 1 h. The immunoreactive proteins were visualized using Western Blot Chemiluminescence Luminol Reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Immunoblot bands were quantified using the Tocan 190 protein assay system (Bio-Rad). -actin was used as the loading control. The serum concentration of estradiol (E2), OPG, and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) was assessed using ELISA (Shanghai Jinma Biological Technology Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China). All commercial assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, ELISA plates were percolated with mouse anti-human immunoglobulin G, and standards, and samples were loaded into the wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. HRP-conjugated anti-human E2, OPG and IGF-1 detection antibodies were added and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction was visualized through color development and the absorbance (optical density) was measured at a 450-nm wavelength on an ELISA reader (Model EXL800; BioTek Instruments, Inc.). The conversion of optical density units for the study samples to concentration was achieved through a computer software-mediated comparison with a standard curve using the KC Junior (BioTek Instruments, Inc.). Data were analyzed using the SPSS 19.0 software for Windows (IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY, USA). The quantitative data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation. The statistical analysis of the data was performed using nonparametric tests for two independent samples. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. As shown in The activity of ALP was downregulated in the hFOB 1.19 cells treated with the KYD pattern-serum, compared with that in the cells treated with control serum (P=0.037) ( In order to further explore the mechanism of the KYD pattern in bone formation, the mRNA and protein expression of osteocalcin, OPG and RANKL was analyzed following KYD pattern-serum treatment using RT-qPCR and western blotting, respectively. The protein levels of osteocalcin and OPG in the hFOB 1.19 cells treated with the KYD pattern-serum were downregulated (P=0.047 and P=0.009), and the protein level of RANKL was upregulated (P=0.006), compared with the protein levels following treatment with control serum ( In order to obtain some insight into the underlying mechanism of the inhibition of bone formation by the KYD pattern-serum, the concentrations of E2, OPG and IGF-1 in the KYD pattern- and control serums were analyzed. As shown in According to TCM theory, the kidney regulates bone formation and development. Kidney deficiency leading to bone loss is associated with the pathological process of PMO ( Using the MTT assay, it was shown that the KYD pattern-serum significantly inhibited the viability of the hFOB 1.19 cells, suggesting that it also inhibited the proliferation of these cells. The possibility of the KYD pattern-serum controlling the mineralization of osteoblasts was explored by measuring the ALP activity, osteocalcin expression and formation of calcified nodules in the hFOB 1.19 cells. ALP, a classic biomarker of osteoblast cell differentiation, plays a crucial role in the early stage of extracellular matrix mineralization ( Previous studies showing that OPG mediates bone formation and RANKL mediates bone resorption have enhanced the understanding of bone remodeling regulation ( The risk of PMO develops increasingly with estrogen deficiency, which causes a series of changes in the blood and interrupts the balance between bone formation and resorption ( In conclusion, the present study has provided data showing that the alterations in the concentrations of E2, OPG and IGF-1 may account for the susceptibility of certain postmenopausal women to the KYD pattern of osteoporosis by inhibiting the OPG/RANKL system, which leads to a reduction in bone formation. The major limitation of this study was the small sample size, and thus a randomized, controlled trial with a larger sample size needs to be conducted. Furthermore, the fact that the KYD pattern-serum was the only pattern of kidney deficiency investigated, with regard to its effects on the function of osteoblasts, could be considered one-sided; therefore experiments on the other patterns will be carried out in the future.
