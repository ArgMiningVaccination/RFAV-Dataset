Regional incidence is decreasing: Since week 14, Fraser Health incidence decrease d (218 to 20 per 100K). Since week 13, Vancouver Coastal incidence decreased (19 2 to 10 per 100K). Since week 14, Interior Health incidence decreased (8 7 to 20 per 100K). Since week 13, Island Health incidence decreased (4 7 to 5 per 100K). Since week 13, Northern Health incidence decreased (119 to 11 per 100K). Age-specific incidences decreased from weeks 13 -14 to week 2 3 for all age groups. Sharpest declines were seen in the 15-39-year -olds. Single -dose vaccine coverage for 12+ year -olds reached 74% in week 23. Highest coverage was in 70+ year -olds at almost 90%, met by 35 cases in week 23, comparable to case counts in W ave 1 for that age group. Testing of MSP -funded specimens decreased by 60% from week 14 to week 23. Positivity of MSP -funded specimens has also been decreasing since week 14 (12.1%) , reaching 3.7% in week 23.

BCCDC COVID -19 Situational Report Week 23 Page 2 of 10 BELOW ARE IMPORTANT NOTES relevant to the interpretation of data displayed in this bulletin: Episode date s are defined by dates of illness onset. When those dates are unavailable, earliest laboratory date is used (collection or result date); if also unavailable, then public health care report date is used . Analyses based on episode date (or illness onset date) may better represent the timing of epidemic evolution. Episode -based tallies for recent weeks are expected to increase as case data, in particular onset dates, are more complete . The weekly tally by surveillance date (result date, if unavailable then report d ate) includes cases with illness onset date in preceding weeks. Episode dates for hospital admission, ICU, and death are defined by admission and death dates. When unavailable, surveillance date is used. As of June 15, 2021, per capita rates/incidences for year 2020 are based on Population Estimates 2020 (n= 5,139,568 for BC overall) and for year 2021 are based on PEOPLE 2020 estimates (n= 5,197,224 for BC overall). Laboratory data include Medical Service Plan (MSP) funded (e.g. clinical diagnostic tests ) and non -MSP funded (e.g. screening tests) specimens. Data sources include: health authority case line list data, laboratory PLOVER data , PHSA Provincial Immunization Registry (PIR), and hospital data (PHSA Provincial COVID19 Monitoring Solution (PCMS)). Case data were extracted on June 21, 2021 , laboratory data on June 18, 2021 , PIR vaccine coverage date on June 18, 2021, and PCMS hospitalization data on June 18, 2021 . A. COVID -19 case counts and epidemic curve s Provincially, up to week 23, 2021, there have been 146,615 cases, for a cumulative incidence of 2,817 per 100K ( Table 1 , Figure 1). As shown in Figure 1 , following the peak of Wave 3 in week 14 at 150 per 100K, incidence has decreased by 90% to reach 15 per 100K in week 23. The incidence in week 23 is comparable to early weeks of September 2020 during Phase 3 a. Rates may increase as data by episode date become mo re complete. Due to an update to the provincial population estimates used to calculate rates, there is a slight change in rates compared to reports in week 21 and earlier . As shown in Figure 2 , incidence decreased or stabilized in most health authorities in the 8 -9 weeks prior to week 23. Fraser Health (FH) and Interior Health (IH) have the highest incidence rate at 20 per 100K ; Vanc ouver Coastal Health (VCH) at 10 per 100K; No rthern Health (NH) at 11 per 100K ; and Island Health (VIHA) at 5 per 100K . Incidence has decreased in all health service delivery areas (HSDA), except in VIHA HSDAs where it increased slightly in week 23 . Rates may increase as data become more complete. Table 1.

Test rates and percent positive As shown by the darker -colored bars in Figure 4 , testing of MSP -funded specimens decreased by 60 % from ~67,500 specim ens in week 14 to ~27,500 in week 23 . Positivity of MSP -funded specimens has been decreasing rapidly si nce week 14 (12.1%) reaching 3.7% in week 23 . As shown in Panel A of Figure 5 , the per capita testing rates for MSP -only specimens ha ve been declining in all HAs since week s 14-15, but increased slightly in VIHA in week 23. As shown in Panel B , percent positivity for week 23 MSP -fund ed tests is highest in NH at 6.8% followed by IH at 4.9 %, FHA at 3.7%, VCH at 3.3%, and lowest in VIHA at 1.6 %. After decreasing since weeks 13 -14, Percent positivity increased in VIHA and NH in week 23. Figure 4.

Age profile - Testing and cases Testing rates and percent positivity by age group As shown by the bars in Figure 6 , testing rates in week 23 have decreased in all age groups since at least week 18 . The highest testing rate s in week 23 were in the 80+ year -olds at 796 per 1 00K and the 5 -9 year -olds at 733 per 100K. As shown by the black dots in Figure 6 , the percent positivity has decreased i n all age groups since weeks 18-19. The percent positivity in the 20 -39 and the 0 -4 year age groups have experienced the sharpest d ecline since week 17. In week 23 , the highest percent positivity w as in the 15 -19 year -olds at 5.2 % follow ed by the 20 -39-year-olds at 4.6 % and the 40 -59-year -olds at 4.5 %. The lowest percent positivity was in the 80+ year -olds at 1.1 %. Case distribution and weekly incidence by age group As shown in Figure 7 , the percentage contribution of the 30-39, 40-49, 20 -29 year -olds increased by 3.4%, 1.9%, and 1.7% since week 22 , met mainly by a decrease of 4.7% and 2.8% among the 15-19 year -olds and 10-14 year -olds, respectively. The remaining age groups' contributions remained relatively stable. As shown in Figure 8, age specific incidences decre ased from weeks 13 -14 to week 23 for all age groups. Sharpest declines were seen in the 20 -29-year -olds and 15 -19-year -olds from week 14 to week 23 (from 256 to 23 per 100k and 219 to 18 per 100k, respectively), a decrease of 91% in both age groups. I n the 30 -39-year-olds, incidence decreased by 89% from week 13 to week 23 (from 197 to 22 per 100k) . Week 23 age-specific incidences are likely to increase as data become more c omplete.

The vaccination of community - based older adults 70+ years of age started between weeks 10 and 14. As shown in Figure 9 , by week 23 , the single -dose vaccination coverage in this age group reached almo st 90% and was met with only 35 cases , comparable to case counts in Wave 1 for that age group. The vaccination of community -based (not residing in healthcare facilities, not healthcare workers and not clinically extremely vulnerable) adults 40 to 69 years of age st arted in weeks 15 -19; by week 23 , coverage reached 83%, 78%, and 75 % reflecting case c ounts of 44, 82, and 116 for the 60 -69, 50 -59, and 40 -49 year -olds, respectively. The vaccination of community -based adults 20 to 39 year of age started in weeks 19 -20; by week 23 , cove rage was 64% and 69% with ~165 cases for each of the 20 -29 and 30 -39 year -old groups. The lowest coverage was in children 12 -19 years of age at 53 % coverage in week 23 . Overall, single -dose vaccine coverage for all age groups 12+ years reached 74% by week 23 . Figure 9.

Severe outcome counts and epi -curve The number of weekly hospital admissions peaked in week 15 (384) and has declined by 83% since then, reaching 65 admissions in week 23 . The number of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions also peaked in week 15 (109) and has d ecreased by 85% since then, reaching 16 admissions in week 23 . The number of deaths has also declin ed from 31 deaths in week 19 to 12 deaths in week 23 (Table 3 , Figure 9 ). These numbers may increase in future reports as more data become available . Cumulatively, there have been 1 5 confirmed cases of Multi -system Inflammatory Syndrome in children and adolescents (MIS - C) in BC from January 1, 2020 to week 23 . The median age of these cases is 8 (range 1 -15) years. Table 3.
