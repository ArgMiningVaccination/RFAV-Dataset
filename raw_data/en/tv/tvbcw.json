The firstMaterials Research Symposium sponsored bytheInstitute for Materials Research was heldOctober 3-7, 1966, shortly afterNBS moved totheirnew laboratories inGaithersburg, Maryland. This first Symposium was alsosponsored bytheAnalytical Chemistry Division andwasconcerned with trace characterization ofmaterials. Subsequent tothatSymposium, more specialized conferences sponsored bythe Analytical Chemistry Division havebeen heldonsuch subjects asquan- titative Analytical Chemistry andthejournal /4/7fl/y//c<3/ Chemistry, andco-spon- sored bytheNBS Analytical Chemistry Division. More several workshop-type meetings sponsored orco-sponsored bytheDivision were held andAnalysis, over400 representing abroad spectrum ofindustrial, governmental, andeducational institutions from theUnited States and frommany foreign countries. Theformat oftheSymposium consisted of invited plenary speakers, whodiscussed specific topics intheareas of sampling, sample handling, data interpretation, analytical methodology, andanumber ofcontributed papers generally corresponding tothese top- ics.

Each simplicity ofsample preparation andinstrumental operation made atomic absorption spectrometry especially appealing to manywhohad little training inchemistry andnone inspectroscopy. Asa consequence, problems affecting results adequate is apositive error which canbeseveral hundred percent attrace levels, especially inbiological materials and alkali halides [3].The analytical error goes undetected inthetraditional method ofstandard additions because thebackground contribution totheabsorbance values forthe ignored orwere notaware oftheneed forbackground correction. however, is generally consistent intherecognition oftheeffect ofthisfactor, and methods arein some cases amajor fraction ofthetotal absorption signal, especially for trace metals inbiological materials; and the literature dealing with microsample atomic absorption methods hasmade astrong point ofthe ubiquitous nature ofbackground absorption and so-called peaks. This heightened canresult inoversights similar along theway inwhich theunwary analyst might incorrectly mistake specific absorption byatomic species fornonspecific background absorption, andthus incur significant negative errors inthe analytical results.

II.Characteristics ofAbsorption Signals from Nebulizer-Burner Systems Absorption signals from conventional solution-aspiration atomic absorption systems areessentially constant absorption light bytheparticulate matter andmolecular species originating from thesample. Correction techniques aremarkedly different from thesteady-state signals ofsolution-aspiration methods intwo principal ways. First, in microsampling techniques slfinite affect peak absorbance [12]. Absorption measurement methods involving peak height rather than thearea oftheabsorption profile must take these factors intoconsideration.

Another serious problem isthatformany reactions experimental cross sections andexcitation functions have schemes.
