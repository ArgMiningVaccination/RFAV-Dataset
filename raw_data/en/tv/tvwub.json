Many scientists believe climate change is occurring more rapidly than predicted. In addition to natural sources of environmental change, humans are increasingly contributing to the breakdown of natural cycles on Planet Earth. Many blame the greenhouse effect for the rapidly melting polar ice caps, thawing permafrost, changing seasona weather patterns, and rising sea levels. The industrialized world uses vast amounts of energy, but consumption is also increasing dramatically in developing countries such as China and India with their populations of over one billion each. Sources of fossil fuels are finite and overuse is harmful to the environment. So how should we meet global energy needs? The search for answers has begun. But it is not just government s and scientists that need to act. Every citizen can contribute to the solution in his or her own way. 264690 003 The Fuel that Never Ends What will power our cars in the future? Will it be ecologically produced E85 bio-ethanol?

Thousands of people, most of them children, die every day after being exposed in one way or another to polluted water. The United Nations has said it wants to reduce that number by at least half by the year 2015. A noble goal - but most experts doubt it can be achieved. The water crisis is real. But how to solve the problems of water shor tages and water pollution? 002662 Water for the Fields World-wide, the one human activity that consumes the greatest volume of water is also the one that wastes the most: agriculture. So, the greatest potential for saving water lies in the use of more efficient irrigation techniques and long-term planning. The motto has to be \"more crop per drop\". Documentary, 30 min.; SD, 2003; English, German, Spanish; WW, VoD, M 002663 Water for the Cities The urban water crisis is not an imminent threat - it has long been a present reality in the world's burgeoning metropolises. The challenges involved in supplying millions of people in urban spaces with potable water and disposing of their waste water must be acknowledged and faced up to. Documentary, 30 min.; SD, 2003; English, German, Spanish; WW, VoD, M 002664 Testing the Limits of Possibility Many politicians and technocrats seem convinced that colossal problems can only be solved through colossal projects. However, blind faith in concrete as a means of water management can often have devastating effects on natural landscapes and ecological systems. The search is on for new economically, socially and environmentally viable alternatives. Documentary, 30 min.; SD, 2003; English, German, Spanish; WW, VoD, M 002665 Water for Profit As the world population grows and pollution spreads, fresh water becomes increasingly rare. The moment demand outpaces supply, water becomes a trade good to be bought and sold on the market - a commodity in the global economy. But privatization remains bitterly controversial. Who owns the rights to water? And how can a price be set on water? Documentary, 30 min.; SD, 2003; English, German, Spanish; WW, VoD, M 002666 Waters of Discord About 40 percent of the world's population gets its drinking water from rivers that cross national boundaries. Some nations depend entirely on river water that flows in from other countries. So the control of water supplies has the potential to be used as an effective political weapon. Some analysts go so far as to predict that wars will be fought over water rights. Documentary, 30 min.; SD, 2003; English, German, Spanish; WW, VoD, M 002667 Watery Visions The problem of water shortages cannot be solved by technology alone. The best prospects for a long- term solution lie in a comprehensive program of water management. In the not-too-distant future, a number of major policy decisions will have to be made on how water supplies can be used more efficiently. We can start taking action now. Documentary, 30 min.; SD, 2003; English, German, Spanish; WW, VoD, M ENVIRONMENT For screening and comprehensive catalog information, please register online at b2b.dw.com Global Energy The demand for energy in emerging and developing nations is rapidly increasing, as is the need for renewable energy sources. For example, the wind energy sector in India is predicted to grow by 25 percent annually. The sustainable application of renewable energies in these countries is of huge significance to the world's climate as a whole. If it is at all possible, errors committed during periods of economic growth in industrialized countries - the conse-quences of which future generations are going to have to live with - should not be repeated. But what contribution can these types of energy production make to future energy supplies? Global Energy outlines the key alternative forms of energy and presents interna- tional examples of their applications, which meet the standards of best practice and can also be utilized elsewhere. 264774 001 The Eternal Cycle - Water Power Hydropower is the most widely used renewable energy, and currently prod uces a seventh of all the world's electricity. Using water to generate electrical power is regarded as a particularly well-developed technology that's also kind to the environment. However there are negative aspects. The construction of dams destroys habitats - people are displaced, precious natural bio- spheres are lost. But there is an alternative approach, as illustrated by these simple, local solutions in Brazil and Nepal. Documentary, 30 min., SD, 2011; Arabic, Chinese, English, German, Spanish; WW, VoD, M, IFE 264774 002 The Inexhaustible Source - Solar Energy In six hours, the amount of energy be ating down upon the deserts of the Earth is equal to the amount of power used by humans in one year. These deserts provide the perfect conditions for solar power stations. Morocco is the first African country to announce plans for large-scale invest- ment in such plants. In countries such as Ethiopia and India, where most people in rural areas are not linked up to the nation al grid, electricity could be generated from the sun by using small, local photovoltaic plants. Documentary, 30 min.; SD, 2011; Arabic, Chinese, English, German, Spanish; WW, VoD, M, IFE 264774 003 Clean Energy - The Boom in Wind Power The balance is currently shifting with regard to wind-generated power. While wind parks have become quite common in Western Europe and the US over the years, it is in China that the largest investments in new wind parks are now being made. Germany, a pi oneer in the sector, is involved in the transfer of technology and the provision of specialized training. Morocco aims to become an exporter of wind power to Europe. And India wants to harness the wind in order to provide electricity to the rural population throughout the country. Documentary, 30 min.; SD, 2011; Arabic, Chinese, English, German, Spanish; WW, VoD, M, IFE 264774 004 The Regeneration Principle - Biomass Bioenergy is increasing its share of the energy market worldwide, not least because of the rising price of oil. Renewable resources, including an increasing number of agricultural products, are the main sources of energy used here in the pro-duction of heat, electrical energy and fuels. But some biomass applications are controversial because of their own impact on the environment. Documentary, 30 min.; SD, 2011; Arabic, Chinese, English, German, Spanish; WW, VoD, M, IFE 264774 005 Fire from Within - Geothermal Heat Geothermics - the practice of harnessing thermal energy from the naturally occurring warmth of the Earth - may not be possible or useful every-where, but its worldwide po tential is still far from being fully exploited. Geothermal energy can be used directly to heat or cool, or to produce elec-tricity. The two functions can also be combined in cogeneration or 'combined heat and power' plants. Here too, ecological considerations are of major importance.

Hunted by the FBI, he faces a 225 year jail sentence in the US. Now Florian Hamm has given up the ruthless pursuit of money and started a new life. Rarely is Florian Homm seen in public without his cigar. If appearances are anything to go by, then the man is the pr ototype of an arch capitalist. His most successful years were those just after th e turn of the millennium. Back then, he was estimated to be worth about EUR 300 million. Although he's on the FBI's most-wanted list in the US, the man who prosecutors say has conspired to defraud investors and fixed stock pric es is free to roam in Germany. In interviews, the once ruthless stock speculator says he's reformed, and explains that it was greed that made him do it, saying, \"Somewhere there's that primeval feeling in a true capitalist. It's a drive that says, 'I want to own everything, it will all be mine!'\" Homm, who once led a life that whirled around stocks, cocaine and prostitutes, presents himself today as a devout Catholic and preaches to economics' students, \"Y ou do not have to forsake wealth, but you should not lose sight of what is good and important.\" 084868 Documentary, 45 min., HD, 2016; Arabic, English, German, Spanish LR AGRICULTURE For screening and comprehensive catalog information, please register online at b2b.dw.com Secret Power There are myths that tell of the divine origin of plants, see them as mediators between the worlds of the real and th e supernatural.

Over the next decades, 75 percent more food must be produced if widespread famine is to be prevented. Agricultural research scientists are producing the weapons to wage war on hunger. Politicians and other decision-makers are being requir ed to take up the challenge. The much-vaunted balance between North an d South must become a reality, and more must be invested in the developm ent of farming.

Some years, as much as 80 percent of the harvest in tropical countries is consumed by insects where it is stored. Which explains why the GTZ, the German Organization for Technical Co-operation, has made reducing post-harvest losses one of its prime aims. Since 1991 the trend has been away from giant silos, and interest has focused instead on small farmers, since they are the keepers of 80 percent of all the stores in Africa, Asia and Latin America. 144354 001 Unbidden Guests 144354 002 Back to the Future 144354 003 Preserving Techniques for House and Farm 144354 004 Gas against Parasites 144354 005 Silos for the Masses 144354 006 High-Tech Storekeeping 144354 007 Towards a Global Network Seeds The population explosion triggered the develop-ment of higher-yielding varieties of rice, maize and wheat. Genetic engineers now determine how much or how little water a plant must take up, how seeds germinate, and how successfully they can be stored. A few seed banks worldwide ensure the preservation of the genotype of useful plants. For other scientists, seeds are the \"fingerprints\" of the history of climate. They provide anthropologists with information about the development of teeth and the digestive system.

The conflict in Ukraine has long dominated people's lives here and irrevocably changed their way of thinking. Julia Segeda, a successful lawyer, and her husband have transformed their office into a collection point for relief supplies. Each week, the couple goes to the front line to deliver supplies directly to the soldiers there. Young mother Natalia Bornjakowa and her children had to flee from the Donetsk region and are happy to be safe, but they will never forget what they went through.

Many have recorded their dramatic stories them- selves in video on their cell phones, without the help of filmmakers or news teams. For most refugees, the cell phone is an indispensable tool in the organization of their escape. At the same time, they use their phones to store memories of home and to document the stations of their long and dangerous journeys. Social networks are buzzing with clips that tell of such flights. The documentary #MyEscape has gathered together some of these stories: the refugees' vide os tell of their homelands, their departure and the different stages of their escape.

In many countries around the world currently, democracy as it is practiced in Western industrialized countries is currently being put to the test. What role do free elections, majority rule, participation or fundamental and human rights play? Intellectuals and activists provide insight into the prodemocracy movements in their countries and explain why democracy must be understood as a process that emanates from the people and contributes to the tangible common good of all members of a society. 824832 001 Tunisia As a doctor Emna Menif has a demanding job, but that hasn't stopped her fr om getting involved in a movement for democracy.

Now he's a campaigner himself fighting against financial greed and calling for a sustainable environmental policy. 824832 003 Russia ''Power to the millions, not the millionaires,'' is Isabelle Magkoeva's motto. Magkoeva, who teaches Japanese, comes from an affluent family, but that hasn't stopped her from taking to the streets to protest against the unequal distribution of resources and to stand up for a better educational system in Russia. 824832 004 Greece Participation is important to Lila Bellou. She had little interest in politics until the crisis hit Greece. As a lawyer she is involved in a wide range of initiatives and wants to show people that they have rights and should use them. 824832 005 Spain Marc Masmiquel and his friend Monica Cuende want to do more than just protest. The young Spaniard is involved in the ''public economy'' movement for a more democratic and fair economic system. 824832 006 Brazil For the protest movement \"Juntos\", or \"Together\", Rio's soccer temple Maracan\u00e3 is a symbol of how Brazil wants to present itself to the outside world. The nation is putting on ai rs in the build-up to the 2014 soccer tournament, say the movement's members, and turning a blind eye to social woes in the process.

Since the early 1980s humankind has be en threatened by a new epidemic: AIDS. Despite intensive medical resear ch into possible cures, the immune deficiency syndrome has spread to all the world's continents. Africa is the worst-hit region. One of the many programs set up around the world to combat AIDS in Africa is DREAM, or Drug Resource Enhancement against AIDS and Malnutrition. For years international organizations ente ring the battle against AIDS focused almost exclusively on prevention, but this approach alone does not go far enough. DREAM has dedicated itself to merging the strands of prevention and therapy. The program is primarily aime d at mothers. Its goal is to reduce the numbers of pregnant women infect ing their babies with HIV and help ensure that HIV-positive mothers stay healthy enough to raise their children. C\u00e9lia and Helena are two young Mozambican women who are being looked after at one of DREAM's center s, of which there are more than 30 across Africa. Both are 29 years old, pregnant and - like millions of other women in Africa - HIV-positive. Transmis sion from mother to child is one of the most common causes of new HIV infection on the African continent. In Mozambique alone, more than 85 babies are infected with HIV daily: during pregnancy, at birth or as a result of breastfeeding. But with the right precau- tions and medication, this risk can be significantly reduced. C\u00e9lia and Helena are making full use of the treatment available. How do the women live with their disease? How do they manage their daily lives? What do they tell their fami ly and friends? What are their worries, their hopes and desires? We spent several months with C\u00e9lia and Helena until the birth of their babies. The result is a gripping and moving portrait of two women fighting for their own lives and the lives of their childr en.

Moreover, and almost more importantly, Goethe regarded the shaping of his life as a creative task. Thus arose what was in a way one of the first conscious au tobiographies of modern times, and even his contemporaries spoke of an \"exemplary existence\".

Literature's response to this tendency was the genre of \"Heimatdichtung\", or vernacular poetry. Theodor Storm's tale of \"The Little H\u00e4welmann\", and especially his famous novella \"The Rider on the White Horse\" movingly evoke the character of North Friesland's people, their ongoing battle against the sea, and their ties to the land.

Some of Lessing's works are among the most important contributions to the German Enlightenment move-ment, which was directed at humanizing national, social and cultural life. In his drama \"Nathan the Wise\", Lessing made a plea for human prejudices to give way to a spirit of humanity and tolerance. He was the most significant German writer to emerge since the time of Luther, the one great name in 18th century German literature until Goethe came on the scene.

And Nuremberg is still the premier toy town, if not as a manu-facturing base, then as host to the world's largest toy trade fair.

But Ludwig's obsession was expensive, and this, coupled with signs of advancing mental illness, led to his being certified mentally unstable on June 9, 1886. Four days later Ludwig II mysteriously drowned in the Starnberger See. Even today, we remain fasci-nated by the \"fairy-tale\" king.

They risk serious damage to their public image and loss of consumer confidence, which can go as far as a boycott of their products. More and more com-panies are nowadays recognizing the relevance of ecological measures as a strategic factor in competitiveness. BMW is the first automobile manufacturer to have all its production plants throughout the world certified as conforming to the internationally-recognized environmental protection standard ISO 14001. The man respon-sible for this is Manfred Heller, who has built up a system of ecological management unmatched anywhere else in the automotive industry.

Suddenly, all the world wanted a K\u00e4the Kruse doll. She always stuck to one principle: her dolls were hand-made, not mass-produced. And that is still the way it is today in the factory at Donauw\u00f6rth in southwest Germany.

He won his first major competition while still a student. Now, he has a staff of 120 working for him at his firm in D\u00fcsseldorf. Ingenhoven, Overdick and Partners have large-scale projects underway in all parts of the globe. Hardly any other German architect is in such demand outside his own country. That may well have something to do with the fact that his is one of the few European companies special-ized in designing skyscr apers. His best-known project to date is the RWE Tower in Essen, the first environmentally friendly skyscraper in the world. His prize-winning design for Stuttgart's new central train station has also raised a few eyebrows. Ingenhoven envisaged a kind of under-ground rail city.

One of its many responsibilities is the protection of the world's cultural and natural heritage. The basic idea is that exceptional cultural achievements and unique natural phenomena belong to all of humanity and that their protection is not solely the responsibility of individual states, but a duty of the international community as a whole. This concept of a universal heritage that should be preserved for future generations is anchored in the World Heritage Convention. It was adopted in 1972 and has been signed by many of the world's nations. Germany is one of the countries with the most world heritage sites. These include natural landscapes as well as architectural and industrial monuments. 324815 001 The Wadden Sea 324815 002 Berlin Modernism Housing Estates 324815 003 Collegiate Church, Castle and Old Town of Quedlinburg 324815 004 Upper Middle Rhine Valley 324815 005 Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin 324815 006 Regensburg 324815 007 Cathedral and Church of our Lady in Trier 324815 008 Pilgrimage Church of Wies 324815 Clips, 8 x 5 min., SD, 2013; English, German, Portuguese, Spanish WW, VoD, M, IFE 324811 Clips, 40 x 1 min., SD, 2013; English, German, Portuguese, Spanish WW, VoD, M, IFE CULTURE For screening and comprehensive catalog information, please register online at b2b.dw.com 324811 The Wadden Sea Bremen L\u00fcbeck Wismar Stralsund Ancient Berlin Modernism Housing Estates Memorials in Wittenberg Bauhaus Sites in Dessau Luther Memorials in Cathedral and St. Michael's Church in Hildesheim Fagus Factory in Alfeld Mines of Rammelsberg and the Upper Harz Water Management System Collegiate Church, Castle and Old Town of Quedlinburg Wartburg Castle in Eisenach Upper Middle Rhine Valley Castles of Augustusburg and Falkenlust in Br\u00fchl Cologne Cathedral Aachen Cathedral Zollverein Coal Mine Industrial Complex Classical Weimar and the Bauhaus Sites in Weimar Garden of Dessau-W\u00f6rlitz Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin Bad Muskau Park Upper Germanic Limes Messel Pit W\u00fcrzburg Residence and Court Gardens Bamberg Margravial Opera House Bayreuth Regensburg Cathedral and Church of our Lady in Trier V\u00f6lklingen Ironworks Lorsch Abbey Speyer Cathedral Maulbronn Monastery Monastic Island Reichenau Prehistoric Pile Dwellings Pilgrimage Church of Wies Wilhelmsh\u00f6he mountain park The Weserbergland Region - From H\u00f6xter to Hamlin CULTURE For screening and comprehensive catalog information, please register online at b2b.dw.com In Search of the Past This series deals with the lost cultures of bygone ages.

Its practioners have shown that their creativity and their messages have the power to move people deeply.

The Urban Playground City-dwellers in search of adventure have disco-vered the creative potential of public space: Rather than take the bus to work, some get there by scaling walls, jumping over railings or leaping from roof to roof; flashmob activists stage elaborate choreographies in shopping malls and stations to surprise and delight; while tilt-shift videos elevate the city itself into a work of art. Time Time can fly but it can al so crawl. Representing the passage of time allows for all kinds of tricks to stretch it or squeeze it. Internet video artists are in their element here.

The fact on the ground is that it has long done both. Some 6.75 million fo reigners now live in Germany - more than eight percent of its total population. Immigrants come to Germany for a whole range of reasons. Their professions may be in demand here; they may be in search of freedom and a better future; they may have been forced into exile by an oppressive regime. Or they may simply like Germany. Strangers follows five young immigrants from widely diverse cultures, nations and social backgrounds as they travel to Germany and attempt to start new lives here. It covers the first year from before their arrival through the trials and tribulations of getting settled in. What each immigrant has in common is their desire to live in Germany permanently and legally. The emphasis is on person al observations and everyday experiences in a new and strange country, cutting back and forth from one character to another and continuing from one part to the next. The film makers focus on the questions of what ideas, visions and dreams immigrants have of Germany before leaving their countries. What situations and difficulties, what positive and negative surprises do they encounter after their arrival? What obstacles do they have to overcome? How do they find jobs, apartments and new friends? How well do they cope with the authorities - and with everyday life? How do they go about learning the German language? How do they deal with homesickness? And not least: how do they see this strange land, Germany, and its people? What cultural differences and similarities do they see? 564692 001 Dreaming of Germany 564692 002 Hoping, but Homesick564692 003 Germany for Beginners 564692 004 A Time to Make Friends 564692 005 Keeping One's Head above Water 564692 006 Bread and Butter 564692 007 To Laugh or Cry 564692 008 Negotiations 6 Years Later The series Strangers accompanies young immi-grants from various nations, cultures and social strata as they head for Germany, and observes them as they try to gain a foothold in the country. The first series (8 parts) focused on their expe-riences during the first year: What impressions did they have of Germany before they left their homeland? Were there any positive or negative sur-prises upon arrival? How did they find a home, a job, and friends? And what about their dealings with the authorities and other aspects of daily life? How did they go about learning German? Were they homesick? What were the similarities and differences between their adoptive home and the one they left behind? Six years on, Strangers goes back to find out how the same protagonists are doing, and explores the following questions: How have they been faring in Germany? Have they managed to settle in? Have they found th e Germany they were looking for? Or have dreams and illusions long given way to sober reality? Are they happy with their work? Have they made friends with the locals, or mostly remained within their own communities? Would they have come to Germany if they had known then what they know now? 564692 009 564692 010 564692 011 564692 Documentary Series, 11 x 30 min., SD, 2007/2013; English, German, Spanish WW, VoD, M, IFE PEOPLE For screening and comprehensive catalog information, please register online at b2b.dw.com Faith Matters Faith provides many people with a framework for life and a moral code.

They can be found everywhere: close to expressways, on country lanes, in the moun- tains and in places of pilgrimage. Some are decidedly simple, others ornate artistic gems. But they all have one thing in common: They invite passers-by to pause for a moment and forget the stresses and strains of their daily lives - whether they be locals or travelers, young or old, Christians or non-Christians. In increasingly secular times, chapels can still address a need for some kind of spirituality.

How can we find happiness? These questions are the focus of Wilhelm Schmid's philosophical inquiries. The successful Berlin author's work builds on an al- most forgotten tradition: the art of living.

Our series describes the economic system of the Hanseatic League, traces its rise and decline, and asks whether the Hansa concept is relevant today in the light of the opening up of Europe's internal market. 000698 The Adventure of Maritime Trade in the Late Middle Ages In its heyday the Hanseatic League had some 200 seaboard and inland towns belonging to it. For all its size and power, however, over its almost 500 year history, the Hansa never acquired sover-eignty. Its strength was based solely on the will to dominate trade in Northern Europe. The Hansa would continue to exist - thus the simple mercantile principle - as long as it was economi- cally useful to its individual members. The history of the Hansa starts with the hazardous expedi-tions of the merchants and their attempt to limit the risks of trade by drawing up contracts and establishing settlements. The history of the Hansa is also the history of a new type of ship. Without the cog, the Hanseatic League would never have become so successful. Documentary, 30 min., SD, 1994; English, German, Spanish; WW, VoD, M 000699 The Travels of Hildebrand Veccinghusen With the help of account books, business correspondence and a few private letters, we can follow the trade routes and the movement of goods within the Hanseatic League. Likewise, this unique, almost completely preserved written record provides a remarkable insight into the everyday life of a typi cal merchant's family towards the end of the Middle Ages. The second part of our series on the German Hansa traces the life and travels of Hildebrand Veccinghusen, a successful businessman, who landed in the debtors' prison as a result of trading in risky merchandise. His life story puts the myth of the fabulously wealthy Hansa merchant into proper perspective. Documentary, 30 min., SD, 1994; English, German, Spanish; WW, VoD, M 000700 Decline into Legend It wasn't until it was beginning to break apart that the union of Hansa towns appointed a joint managing director whose job it was to consoli-date the contracts that still existed and whatever commitments and responsibilities continued to be shared. The move came too late. The Hansa towns had long ceased to be united - their eco-nomic interests were too far apart. From outside, too, the League came under political pressure. Those essential guarantors of flourishing trade, a secure peace and stable social conditions, had been dealt a serious blow. The Hansa was too conservative: instead of meeting the new chal-lenges, it insisted - in vain - on retaining its old privileges. Its influence diminished, but it left behind an extraordinarily rich cultural heritage. The last part of our series describes the economic system of the Hanseatic League, traces its decline and asks whether the Hansa idea is relevant today in the light of the opening up of Europe's internal markets.

This light-colored, bottom fermented, full bodied beer with its strong aroma of hops was the creation of Vilhofener brewer Josef Groll. On the eleventh day of the eleventh month in the year 1842, a tradition was born. On this day, in the Bohemian town of Pilsen, the first keg of the new barley brew was tapped. The delicious golden drink quenched many a thirst of body and soul and celebrated a roaring success among the drinkers of the day (brewed with a minimum of 12.5 percent beerwort, it's no wonder). Our feature report takes a somewhat less than sober look at Pilsener's story of success, and offers some fascinating facts on its background along the way.

They are marvels of engineering - some larger even than the Eiffel Tower. They are places where thousands of people work at jobs in heavy industry. And they stand up to the salt water, corrosion and the North Sea storms for years. But their life spans are limited. The European Commission has calculated that about 500 oil platforms will be taken out of service over the next two decades, amounting to a seagoing scrap heap of half a million tons of steel. Plans for their disposal are nowhere in sight. The confrontation over the Brent Spar got the deba te underway about what should be done with decommissioned oil platforms. Shell Oil was pressured into developing an alter-native to sending the Brent Spar to the bottom of the sea. It was towed to shore, broken up and recycled. Now, other corporations appear to have recognized the potential profits in recycling and have begun working on techniques to lift the artificial islands out of the sea and bring them to dry land.

It transcends boundaries, attracts people and unites them.\" This is the view of Horst Kriete, and it is shared by Bernd Storck and Michael Kr \u00fcger. The three German soccer coaches have worked abroad: Kriete in South Africa, Storck in Hungary, Kr\u00fcger in Sudan. One of the fascinat ing aspects of their work, they say, is being with people who have a different cultural background and mentality. \"It promotes tolerance,\" says Horst Kriete. \"It's not just a question of passing on what you know, you also learn things yourself.\" For example, the co aches have learned the importance of striking the right tone with players and officials. \"You have to approach them. You have to engage them. You have to be firm. But you also have to be able to overlook certain shortcomings.\" Then, they will be happy and you'll also feel comfortable in this community, he says. They have learned to be more relaxe d. A sentence Horst Kriete has heard time and time again during his many years in Africa is: \"You have the watch. But we have the time.\" They have learned not to view and judge everything from the perspective of rich European nations. During their postings in Africa, Kriete and Kr\u00fcger often met people \"who are happier and enjoy life more than some who come from wealthy western countries.\" The three coaches are proud of thei r achievements. Some players trained by Kriete now occupy key positions in the South African Football Association. Storck has done so much to change the face of Hungarian soccer that players are again keen to play in the national squad. As for Kr\u00fcger, although he's since stopped working in Sudan, many there still hope he will one day return and coach the national squad.

The 64 matches in the twelve World Cup arenas were watched by billions of soccer fans on all five continents - in addition to the hundreds of thousands lucky enough to have been present in the stadiums. Many of the arenas were re-built or modernized for the numbe r one sporting event world-wide. The task confronted architects of international renown with major challenges. This DW Transtel series presents the stadiums from an architectural aspect. 424662 001 Berlin With a capacity of 76,000, this all-seater stadium is the biggest in Germany. Because of its historical importance, reconstruction of the old Olympic Stadium had to take place within the framework of strict conservation requirements. 424662 002 Dortmund The eight 62 meter-high pylons of the modernized stadium tower up into the Dortmund skyline like giant yellow fingers. Visible from afar, during the World Cup the steel structures pointed the way to fans from all over the world. 424662 003 Frankfurt The old Wald Stadium has been completely rebuilt. The new arena has a gigantic video cube under a retractable roof.424662 004 Gelsenkirchen This multi-functional aren a with its retractable roof and removable pitch is regarded as one of the most modern stadiums in Europe. 424662 005 Hamburg The first stadium to undergo reconstruction for the World Cup, UEFA included it in its exclusive \"Five-Star Stadia\" club. 424662 006 Hanover Converted into an out-and-out soccer arena in just eighteen months, the stadium passed its test in the 2005 Confederations Cup. 424662 007 Kaiserslautern Towering high above the town like a modern-day fortress, the stadium creates a stunning impres-sion even from some distance away. 424662 008 Cologne Cologne's stadium, too, is a new generation arena. The roof of this state-of-the-art stadium is suspended from four 72 meter-high towers. Brightly illuminated at night matches, they are the architectural highlights of this soccer temple. 424662 009 Leipzig The stadium is the only venue in former East Germany. A true architectural achievement, the new arena was built on the site of the old Central Stadium so rich in tradition. 424662 010 Munich Glowing like a fireball or as airily blue as the Bavarian sky: many simile s have been coined to describe the futuristic facade of this avant-garde architectural work of art with its magical aura. 424662 011 Nuremberg As in Berlin and Stuttgart, the stadium is not an out-and-out soccer arena. Its running track means it can also be used for athletics events. The playing surface was lowered to increase the capacity of the arena. 424662 012 Stuttgart This stadium's most outstanding feature is the steel cable truss design of the membrane roof which protects every seat from the elements. 424662 Clips, 12 x 6 min., SD, 2007; English, Spanish WW, VoD, M SPORTS For screening and comprehensive catalog information, please register online at b2b.dw.com Sport-Spots with Ulli Sport is one of the most popular hobbies in the world and it's certainly one of the healthiest pastimes.

Evidently, he did not find the right libretti. The libretto for Fidelio was based on a French play written at the time of the Revolution and glorifying the maxim \"liberty, equality, fraternity\". Fidelio tells the story of Leonore, a devoted wife who disguises herself as a boy (Fidelio) and sets out to rescue her husband from a lingering death as the political prisoner of a powerful ruler. In securing his releas e along with all the other prisoners and bringing the tyrant to justice, her effo rts, though motivate d by love, become an act of political rebellion against the powers that be. Fidelio was first performed in Vienna in 1805.

That is to say they were written for performance during the church service on each of the three days of Christmas, on New Year's Day, on the Sunday after New Year's Day and at the Festival of Epiphany. It is not an oratorio in the usual sense of a dramatic portrayal of biblical histor y, but an account of the birth of Christ as told by the evangelist Luke, interwoven with lyrical reflections based on poetry by Picander. The Christmas Oratorio does not consist wholly of original writing by Bach: some parts of it he borrowed from older, secular works, merely providing them with new words. Nevertheless, there is no sense anywhere of a discrepancy between words and music. Bach himself united the cantatas into a single work, so there is every justification in performing them together as an oratorio.

In the course of the genre's four-hundred-year-old history, the form of opera has gone through considerable changes. The series presents works from the various periods. In each part, the focus is on the moments of high drama in the plot and the high points of performance by the soloists. 604005 001 George Frederick Handel Acis and Galatea The Armourer 604005 009 Richard Wagner The Mastersingers of Nuremberg 604005 010 Ambroise Thomas Mignon 604005 Documentary, 5 x 60 min., SD, 1982-1991; English, French, Portuguese, Spanish LR MUSIC For screening and comprehensive catalog information, please register online at b2b.dw.com Wagner and Bayreuth 663238 No city in the world is so closely identified with a composer as Bayreuth is with Richard Wagner.

Of his more than 50 operatic works, many are still part of the repertoire of opera companies all over the world. One of his less serious stage works is the pastoral opera \"Aci s and Galatea\", a cl assical piece based on the Roman poet Ovid. Acis the shep herd loves Galatea the nymph, but he has a rival, the one-eyed cyclops Polyphemus. Acis loses a duel with Polyphemus and dies. But Galatea's love makes Acis immortal and trans-forms him into an everlasting spring of water. The work underwent many alterations, some by Handel himself. Even Mozart, who published a number of Handel's works, re-orchestrated and enlarged the piece. 683747 Live Music, 86 min., SD, 1985; Original Version, Sung in English; WW 604005 001 Live Music, 60 min., SD, 1991; Abridged Version, Sung in English; WW MUSIC For screening and comprehensive catalog information, please register online at b2b.dw.com Rhythms that Speak Rhythms that are familiar world-wide often have their roots in social groups who found in music a way of expressing their socio-political problems and ideals. Often these rhythms are the expression of a very characteristic attitude to life. In many parts of the world, music and dance have cultic and religious origins. A message is conveyed to the listener or viewer which is only comprehensible to those who have grown up in that particular culture. In our series, th e various forms of music or dance will be traced back as far as possible to their origins, with the help of historical photo-graphic and film material where available. We try to show what influences the music was exposed to and what changes were brought about as a result. 663862 001 Waltz Documentary, 30 min., SD, 1993; English, French, Spanish; LR 663862 002 March Documentary, 30 min., SD, 1993; English, French, Spanish; LR 663862 003 Tango Documentary, 30 min., SD, 1993; English, French, Spanish; WW, VoD, M 663862 004 Samba Documentary, 30 min., SD, 1993; English, French, Spanish; WW, VoD, M 663862 005 Highlife Documentary, 30 min., SD, 1993; English, French, Spanish; WW, VoD, M 663862 006 Calypso Documentary, 30 min., SD, 1993; English, French, Spanish; WW, VoD, M 663862 007 Flamenco Documentary, 30 min., SD, 1993; English, French, Spanish; WW, VoD, M 663862 008 Blues Documentary, 30 min., SD, 1994; English, French, Spanish; WW, VoD, M 663862 009 Salsa Documentary, 30 min., SD, 1994; English, French, Spanish; WW, VoD, M 663862 010 Rai Documentary, 30 min., SD, 1994; English, French, Spanish; WW, VoD, M 663862 011 Rumba Documentary, 30 min., SD, 1994; English, French, Spanish; WW, VoD, M 663862 012 Reggae Documentary, 30 min., SD, 1994; English, French, Spanish; WW, VoD, M 663862 013 Capoeira Documentary, 30 min., SD, 1994; English, French, Spanish; WW, VoD, M MUSIC For screening and comprehensive catalog information, please register online at b2b.dw.com Rock & Pop o'Clock This series presents soloists and groups from the German and international pop and rock scenes.
