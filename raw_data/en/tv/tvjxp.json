Therefore the success of a vaccination program relies on the level of acceptance. This present study seeks to understand COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy in Nigeria by assessing the public's willingness to get vaccinated. Study design This is a population-based cross-sectional study. Data were derived through a structured online survey. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among adult residents in Nigeria in March 2021 using a structured online questionnaire. The questionnaire surveyed participants' demographic characteristics and perception of COVID-19 and the COVID-19 vaccine. Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics using Chi-square, as well as univariable logistic regression to determine the factors associated with acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine was conducted. Results Of the 618 respondents, 272 (44%) reported being willing to get vaccinated. Interestingly, of the 346 (56%) respondents that would not take the COVID-19 vaccine, the highest marginal reasons for non-acceptance were lack of trust in the government 163 (47.1%), followed by the belief that the vaccine is not safe 67 (19.4%), and no enough information about the vaccine 49 (13.6%). In addition, male respondents and those with a university degree or above were statistically significantly more likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusion A considerable proportion of the study population is unwilling to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. This observation highlights the need for the government, public health officials, and advocacy groups to implement immediate awareness-raising measures to sway the public towards COVID-19 vaccine acceptance.", "sitename": "AIMS Medical Science", "date": "2022-02-01", "cleaned_text": "A significant percentage of the population must be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity.
