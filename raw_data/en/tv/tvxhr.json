According to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16921-hair-loss-in-women), it's estimated that more than 50% of women will experience noticeable hair loss \u2014 and there are so many reasons why it can happen. Everything from hormones to diet and stress can affect the appearance and quantity of your hair. While there are plenty of hair care great products on the market that can help you get thicker and healthier locks, some come with a high price tag and a risk of [skin irritation](https://www.today.com/shop/colloidal-oatmeal-skin-benefits-t243962). But, there is a more natural and affordable option that may do the trick. One plastic surgeon previously went viral on TikTok after he [posted a video](https://www.tiktok.com/@tonyyounmd/video/6986304136279002374?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1) saying that rosemary oil could be as effective as minoxidil (the star ingredient in Rogaine products). As evidence, he cited a [2015 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/) that showed that the essential oil had the same effect on growth as minoxidil and it was less likely to cause scalp itching. Since then, many other users have posted their own success stories on the app \u2014 and videos featuring the [#rosemaryoil](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/rosemaryoil) tag have garnered 2 billion views. So we tapped [Dr. Michelle Henry](https://www.skinaestheticsurgery.com/), a board-certified dermatologist in New York City, to get all the details. Does rosemary oil help with hair loss? While there are a few essential oils that can help to stimulate hair growth, Henry said that rosemary oil tends to be a top choice. \"Rosemary oil is equivalent to 2.5% minoxidil, which is pretty impressive,\" she said. \"It's something that we can use during pregnancy or for patients who just don't want to use minoxidil or are intolerant to it,\" she said. Because it's non-toxic and tends to be well-tolerated with minimal side effects, so almost anyone could incorporate it into their routine. \"It's safe to use as long as you appreciate the scent \u2014 which many do,\" she added. While experts still aren't entirely sure how it works, the belief is that it improves circulation in the area, and that increased blood flow can lead to cellular turnover and growth, Henry said. As an added bonus, it's also anti-inflammatory, and because inflammation plays a big role in a lot of hair loss conditions, like central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA) or alopecia areata, it can be a helpful tool in managing and treating those issues.
