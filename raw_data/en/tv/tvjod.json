You still have the health bar itself on [Jacob Lee](https://www.thegamer.com/the-callisto-protocol-somehow-has-a-more-boring-protagonist-than-ethan-winters/), but rather than tapping a button to quickly replenish it, you enter an animation where he crouches down, whips out a stim, and injects some feel-good-juice into his neck. It's slow, and makes it much more difficult to get a pick-me-up in combat. However, it has been updated. It appears the animation has been sped up, essentially healing you faster. This was pointed out by [Twitch](https://www.thegamer.com/tag/twitch/) streamer and YouTuber Suzi Hunter, accompanied by a clip of Jacob jabbing his neck.

They can vary from getting your head quickly smashed in to a long-winded beat down that's closer to a [Mortal Kombat](https://www.thegamer.com/tag/mortal-kombat/) finisher than a survival horror death. Luckily, you don't have to watch them every time now. The sped-up healing has been corroborated by several others on Twitter, something that has been asked for since launch, along with the quicker weapon swaps. Now, players are asking for a dedicated dodge button, just to make combat that little bit more intuitive. Next: [Vampire Survivors DLC, Legacy Of The Moonspell, Is A "}
