With the increasing spread of COVID-19, the elderly and infants are the most vulnerable right now. But these risks can be lessened by having nutritious foods and supplements to boost the immune system. Are you wondering what supplements are? Well! Supplements are simple food that supplements the regular diet in order to provide adequate nutrition to our body. Food supplements refer to vitamins, amino acids, fatty acids, minerals. Today, in this blog we are going to tell you what supplements to take to boost your immune system? But before we directly jump on the supplements, let's first talk about immunity and its importance in the elderly. It will help us to understand the importance of having immunity booster supplements. What is immunity? Immune system is a defence mechanism of the human body that protects humans from external infections, unhealthy bacteria, viruses, toxins and other harmful elements. The pathogens in our surroundings enter our body through breath or food etc. and make us sick. Young adults with strong immune systems are less prone to any diseases. But as humans grow, their immune system starts deteriorating and they become more prone to catch diseases like cold, cold, fever, malaria, etc. In later stages of life, people fall ill very quickly or their body becomes weaker, which indicates a bad immune power. Increasing immunity is not rocket science. Young people can maintain a good immune power by changing the intake and adequate lifestyle, from sources of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, etc.; it becomes quite challenging for the elderly. Their appetite gets lowered down, thus they essentially require food supplements to boost their immune system. Vitamin Supplements To Boost Immune System Omega-3s You must have heard about Omega-3s. But do you know what omega 3 is? No? Omega 3 is a fatty acid. In fact, it is a nutrient that provides many benefits to you and helps to protect against many diseases. It is mainly of three types, in which ALA (alpha-linolenic acid) is found in omega plants, while DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) are in omega animal foods. It is an essential supplement to boost the immune system and keep elders healthy. Since most elders who are vegetarians can't rely on animal food for Omega-3, in such scenarios, other supplements are required. There are various Omega-3 capsules derived from the liver of codfish. The importance of Omega-3s is of that higher importance, that these days even vegetarians consume these supplements. Probiotics Probiotics are living bacteria, which are good for elderly health.

It plays an important role in maintaining brain function, nerve function, and heart health. It helps to keep the red blood cells healthy and increase its production in the body. There is an adequate amount of Vitamin B12 in your body which lasts for a long time. But stress, acidity, and intake of some medicines can interfere with its function, due to which it can be absorbed from the body quickly. If the elderly feel continuously tired and experience more pain in their feet, they may be deficient in Vitamin B12. How to deal with Vitamin B 12 deficiency in the elderly? Vitamin B12 supplements are a good option to deal with deficiency but these are especially for those who are deficient in it. Therefore it is important to consult your doctor before consuming it. Its deficiency should not be ignored in the elderly and if you have not yet checked the level of vitamin B12, then you must get it checked. Especially if you are a vegetarian and have been struggling with acidity or other medical problems for a long time, then in such a situation you should check it every 6 months. How much vitamin B12 does the elderly require? A person with vitamin B12 deficiency can consume 2,500 micrograms of vitamin B12 supplement every week. Its absorption declines with increasing age, so people over 65 years of age should consume only 1,000 micrograms.
