JUDY GENSHAF T Thank you for your interest in graduate education at the University of South Florida System. We invite you to explore USF's globally recognized acade mic programs and the many opportunities to learn and work alongside some of the world's most accomplished scholars, scientists and inventors. At USF, our graduate students play active and important roles in our growing national and international research s uccess, and are part of many significant projects that contribute to our rising institutional prestige. We are proud that the USF System is first in Florida in the percent of bachelor's and graduate degrees awarded in programs of strategic emphasis, includ ing STEM, health, accounting and education. USF also ranks fifth among Ame rican public universities and 12 th among universities worldwide in generating new U.S. patents. The continuing growth of our research enterprise is among the reasons that the Board of Governors of Florida's State University System this year designated USF as a Preeminent Public Research University. This means we meet rigorous standards and it confirms our standing as one of the state's top institutions of higher education. Only two other Florida universities have earned this impressive designation - and they are more than 100 years older than we are. Our strong interdisciplinary academic programs are coupled with a global focus to place USF on the leading edge of a number of discipl ines, including health and critically needed science, technology, engineering and math fields. USF's entrepreneurial spirit encourages our graduate students to have an immediate impact with their education. For example, the Student Innovation Incubator in USF's Office of Research & Innovation is home to 25 student -led companies, and graduate students are regularly found leading hands -on projects that directly serve our community, such as environmental research, urban design, music and the arts, and public h ealth. For those looking to link their interest in high -demand disciplines with new skills to start a business, USF has created several programs that couple a Master of Business Administration with STEM degrees. We offer a variety of opportunities for po stgraduate study through our numerous Master's and Graduate Certificate programs, many of which include online learning and are designed to prepare graduates to make immediate and relevant contributions in their professions and fields of study. We work in partnership with our region's top international corporations, including Nielsen, Raymond James, TechData, Jabil Circuit Corp., and Home Shopping Network to connect our talented students to these global powerhouses where they find exciting and rewarding ca reers. USF is situated in the heart of one of the nation's fastest growing and most diverse metropolitan regions, and our university is deeply connected to all aspects of the community. USF graduate students are creative, energetic and working to build a bright and successful future for themselves and their families. We look forward to being a partner in your educational, professional and personal journey.

Only Graduate Faculty, and Affiliate Graduate Faculty approved for such purposes, may serve as the Instructor of Record for graduate level courses. Graduate Faculty Definition Graduate Faculty is defined to consist of all tenure -track or tenured faculty appointed at the Assistant, Associate, or Professor rank, who holds a terminal degree or equivalent in their discipline. Graduate Faculty members are eligible to teach graduate courses an d may direct and serve on masters, specialist, and doctoral level committees. To chair a doctoral level committee, a Graduate Faculty member must engage in current and sustained scholarly, creative, or research activities, such as publications, performance s, exhibitions, patents, inventions and research grants. Affiliate Graduate Faculty membership may be granted by the Office of Graduate Studies Dean to individuals who do not meet the University definition of Graduate Faculty, but whose skills or experti se meet criteria established by the College. Affiliate Graduate Faculty membership is in effect for a specified period of time and specific purposes. Affiliate members may be eligible to serve on masters, specialist, and doctoral level committees, to direc t master's and specialist's level committees, and to co -direct doctoral level committees, at the discretion of the College. Affiliate Graduate Faculty can only serve as the Instructor of Record when they have a terminal degree in the discipline and are a pproved to teach graduate courses in that field. Emeritus Professors and retired or recently resigned professors may also be appointed as Affiliate Graduate Faculty with the approval of the College and Office of Graduate Studies Dean. For approval, a cur rent CV and request for approval, including the reason for the request (e.g. serving on a master's student supervisory committee), is submitted through the Major , the College, and the Office of Graduate Studies. For procedures, contact the Office of Gradua te Studies. Graduate Faculty Approval - Graduate faculty is defined as noted above; Colleges and Departments may have additional requirements. The Office of Graduate Studies will maintain a list of Graduate Faculty along with approval guidelines from th e Colleges and Departments. References: SACSCOC Comprehensive Standard 3.7.1, http://www.sacscoc.org/pdf/081705/faculty%20credentials.pdf for specific information and requirements in reference to the teaching of graduate courses. Also, note, per USF Policy 10- 115 - Faculty Credentials for Teaching Undergraduate and Graduate Courses - http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/policies -and-procedures/pdfs/policy- 10-115.pdf USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 4 Graduate Admissions 15 http://www.grad.usf.edu/ Section 4 Office of Admissions Office of Admissions University of South Florida Office of Admissions 4202 East Fowler Besterfield Interim Director Sean Gilmore U niversity Admissions Criteria and Policies USF Regulation USF3 -008: http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/regulations/pdfs/regulation -usf3.008.pdf S tatement of Principles In graduate admission decisions, multiple sources of information should be used to ensure fairness, promote diversity and balance the limitations of any single measure of knowledge, skill s, or abilities. The sources may include: undergraduate grade point average, letters of recommendation, personal statements, samples of academic work, portfolios, auditions, professional experience related to proposed graduate study, as well as nationally known, standardized test scores. It is the responsibility of each graduate major to select admissions criteria that best predict success in their specific field and to determine the weight given to each measure. N one of the sources of information, particularly standardized test scores, should be used in isolation nor should such scores be used in combination or separately to establish minimum or \"cut off\" scores. Major specific guidelines for the use of standardized test scores should be developed bas ed on the experience of a given department with its pool of applicants.1 1 Adapted from the GRE \"Guide to the Use of Scores\" 2003 -2003 16 http://www.grad.usf.edu/ Admission Requirements Each applicant to a graduate degree program at the University of South Florida is required to meet the following minimum requirements: 1. An applicant must have one of the following (a, b, or c): a. A bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited institution and satisfying at least one of the following criteria: i. \"B\" average (3.00 on a 4.00 scale) or better in all work attempted while registered as an undergraduate student working for a degree, or ii. \"B\" average (3.00 on a 4.00 scale) or better in all work attempted while registered as a graduate student working for a graduate degree. b. A bachelor's degree with a \"B\" average or better from a regionally accredited insti tution and a previous graduate degree with a \"B\" average or better from a regionally accredited institution. In cases where an applicant has a bachelor's and a graduate degree at the time of admission, the credentials and GPA of the graduate degree will b e the determining factor for admission. c. The equivalent bachelors and/or graduate degrees from a foreign institution. Bachelor's degrees from institutions in the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) are considered equivalent based on the Bologna Accord. For applicants with a 3- year Bachelor's Degree with less than 120 hours, from Non - Bologna Accord Institutions, a transcript evaluation from a NACES member is required to confirm equivalency. 2. Submission of standardized test scores if required by the gradua te degree program. For Graduate Major s that require the GRE, the Personal Potential Index (PPI) may be required. Refer to individual major admission requirements for information. 3. Applicants from countries where English is not the official language must a lso demonstrate proficiency in English* as outlined in the section on English Proficiency. Applicants who earn a baccalaureate or equivalent degree at a foreign institution where English is the language of instruction (for the institution and not just the major ) may meet this requirement. However, other related factors (including test scores) will also be considered. Medium of Instruction must be documented on the transcript or on an official Certificate of Medium of Instruction from the Institution 4. All specific and additional requirements of the graduate major to which admission is sought (including requirements to submit standardized test scores) consistent with the above Statement of Principles. The Department Chair and College Dean must approve any exceptions to these requirements before they will be considered by the Office of Graduate Studies . The reason for the waiver and related documentation must be included on the Graduate Application Referral form. *International students who are seeking employment as a teaching assistant (in departments that offer them) must meet additional English Language Requirements. 17 http://www.grad.usf.edu/ Application Process (How it works) Graduate applicants are urged to submit accurate and complete information as early as possible . Appl ications and supporting documents received after the application deadline will only be acted upon at the discretion of the graduate major . They will be kept on file for up to one year. At the request of the applicant or graduate major , they will be proce ssed for the next available term. The Graduate Admissions Office and the Graduate Department review your application for admission to graduate study at USF . Once the Graduate Department reviews your eligibility for its graduate major they will forward thei r decision to the Graduate Admissions Office which, in turn, will issue the official decision. If you are a foreign graduate applicant, the International Services Office ( http://global.usf.edu/is/ ) will evaluate your financial and immigration documents after yo u are admitted to determine your eligibility for a student visa. Your financial statement must be dated within 12 months of the starting the degree program. Each of these offices may request additional d ocuments from you to make a decision. For a complete list of graduate majors and deadline dates please visit the Office of Graduate Studies website at http://www.grad.usf.edu/programs.php 18 http://www.grad.usf.edu/ Graduate Admission Application Deadlines MASTER'S AND EDUCATION SPECIALIST DEGREES Admission for Fall Semester Admission for Spring Semester Admission for Summer Semester Applications received by the Priority Deadline will receive maximum consideration.

All transcripts must be in English; International applicants must submit orig inal language transcripts and a certified English translation. It is the applicant's responsibility to have transcripts translated and evaluated* before submitting them as part of the graduate application packet. If they are applying while still completing an undergraduate degree, they must submit transcripts of at least six (6) semesters of completed undergraduate work. 20 http://www.grad.usf.edu/ *All foreign transcripts that are not in English must be accompanied by a certified English translation. Documents signed by a notary or other public official with no affiliation to the institution of higher learning will not be accepted. Some graduate major s require a course -by-course evaluation. In the event that the university receives documentation that is questionable, or suspicious in any way, the university will require the applicant to obtain a course -by-course evaluation from a foreign transcript evaluation service. Refer to the Graduate Admissions' website for a list of evaluation services (http://www.usf.edu/admissions/graduate/application -requirements/transcripts -foreign.aspx ) Bologna Process - Applications from the European Higher Education Area USF accepts applications from prospective graduate students with undergraduate degrees from countries that subscribe to the Bologna Process.

Applicants who meet the criteria for disclosure must provide specified documents and be reviewed by the Vice President of Student Affairs or his/her designee, if warranted. \u0000 6. Florida Residency Policy: Graduate students are typically consid ered \"independent\" for tuition purposes. Applicants desiring classification as Florida residents for tuition paying purposes must sign and complete the Florida Residents section of the Florida Residency Classification page of the Graduate Application. Inco mplete or unsigned forms will be classified as non -Florida residents. The Office of Graduate Admissions will classify applicants as Florida residents if they have provided a minimum of two forms of documentation that verifies they began living in Florida a t least twelve months prior to the first day of classes of their admitted term of entry. Additional documentation other than what is required may be requested in some cases. All documentation is subject to verification. For assistance with residency ques tions contact gradadmissions@usf.edu Students are responsible for checking their residency classification when admitted to the University of South Florida. The residency classification is noted on the official acceptance letter. If students feel that the ir initial classification is in error, they have until the last day of the term to contact the appropriate admissions office and request a re- evaluation. After students have completed their first semester of study they may still seek to have their residenc y reconsidered ; however, they must then submit a Request for Reclassification Form with the Office of the Registrar. This must be filed by the 5th day of classes for the term being requested. For more information in on Residency refer to: Independent Student: the Registrar's webpage. For information on reclassification go to http://www.registrar.usf.edu/Residency/Deadlines.php Application Documents Access/Forward/Return Policy No appli cation, test scores, transcripts, letters of recommendations, or other documents submitted with the application packet will be returned to the applicant or forwarded to another institution/third party. The Office of Graduate Admissions applicant file is no t to be released to the applicant or other third parties. Requests, subpoenas, or court orders are to be forwarded to the Office of the General Counsel after review by the Assistant Director of Graduate Admissions. Applicants once admitted and enrolled dur ing the term of admission may request access to their student file at the Office of the Registrar. Letters of Recommendation that the applicant has waived the right to view (indicated on Request for Recommendation Form) are not to be given, copied or viewed by the applicant or third parties. Requests for degree/enrollment verification information should be referred to the Office of the Registrar. 24 http://www.grad.usf.edu/ The Office of Graduate Admissions graduate application files may be copied and released to USF staff conducting legitimate University business. Additional Requirements of Major s (If applicable) Many major s require additional application materials such as resumes, writing samples, or letters of recommendation. These items should be uploaded through the online applic ation. Check with the graduate major to see if you should also send the paper documents directly to the appropriate department/ major . These materials will be available electronically to the appropriate major if sent with the application packet . Final Adm ission C lassification Applicants accepted for admission whose final, official documents (transcripts and/or test scores) have been received by the Office of Graduate Admissions are admitted as \"Final.\" The admission file is complete. Provisional Admission Classification Applicants accepted for admission whose final, official documents ( e.g. transcripts) have not been received by the Office of Graduate Admissions are admitted provisionally pending receipt of these missing items. The final, official transcri pts documenting completion of the required degree prior to the start of graduate study at USF must be received before a second semester registration is permitted. During the first semester, the Office of Graduate Admissions will place a registration hold o n the student's file. When the missing documents are provided to the Office of Graduate Admissions the registration hold will be removed. Exception Admission C lassification The University may admit up to 10% of new enrollees as exceptions to the Board of Trustees minimum requirements. To be considered for an exception, applicants should present evidence that might account for the previous academic record and demonstrate potential for academic success. Examples of this evidence include excellent letters o f recommendation from trusted academicians, performance in graduate courses taken as a post - bachelor's student, professional experience in the discipline for a period of time, etc. Each request for a 10% exception must include a statement describing the special circumstances of the applicant. It is the discretion of the Major , College, and Office of Graduate Studies to accept exception application requests. Conditional Admission Criteria A major and/or college may admit students conditionally in anticipat ion of the applicant's successful completion of additional requirements separate from University minimum requirements. These conditions may include attendance in specific core or remedial courses and/or a specific earned GPA for those courses. Failure to s atisfy those conditions by the deadline established by the major will result in academic dismissal from the major . The College/Graduate Major will submit a Dismissal Form ( http://www.grad.usf.edu/student -forms.php ) to the Office of Graduate Studies to initiate dismissal Deferment of Admission Request An applicant's acceptance is granted for the semester and the particular major specified in the official acceptance notification.

Transient Student Form: http://www.registrar.usf.edu/forms/TSF20 08- 04-07_16_17_06.pdf Graduate Assistantships Research Assistantships (RA), and Teaching Assistantships (TA): Graduate Assistantships are intended to recruit quality students to graduate study at USF and to enhance the graduate learning experience. Graduate assistantships exist within academic departments or other university offices on campus. Graduate assistants may teach, conduct research, or perform other tasks that contribute to the student's professional development. Graduate students may be cl assified as Graduate Assistants (GAs), Graduate Teaching Assistants/Associates (GTAs), Graduate Instructional Assistants (GIAs), and/or Graduate Research Assistants/Associates (GRAs). All graduate assistants at USF work under a contract negotiated by the G raduate Assistants United (GAU) and the USF Board of Trustees. The GAU is the labor union certified as the exclusive bargaining agent for graduate assistants at USF. To receive an assistantship, the graduate student must meet the following eligibility req uirements: A ccepted in a graduate major ; Maintain an overall minimum grade point average (GPA) and major GPA of 3.00; Enrolled full -time during the semester(s) appointed as a graduate assistant; For teaching assistantships, demonstrate proficiency in spoken English (if student is not from an Englishspeaking country). F ull-time enrollment is considered nine (9) graduate credit hours in the fall semester, nine (9) graduate credit hours in the spring semester, and six (6) graduate credit hours in the summer semester. If a graduate assistant is enrolled in the last semester of his/her program of study, the number of registered semester hours may be less than the full -time requirement. Graduate assistants must comply with all Office of Graduate Studies enrollm ent requirements to retain their assistantship as stated in the Graduate Catalog . T he TA Training offered by ATLE as a requirement of training for all new Teaching Assistants (9183/9184 job codes) is designed in two parts to deliver blended instruction on the essentials of teaching at USF. First, TAs complete a set of seven media -rich and interactive modules that comprises an 8 -hour online course intended to equip USF Teaching Assistants with the skills needed to effectively plan and deliver compelling cou rses that will ensure USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 5 Registration and General Information 35 http://www.grad.usf.edu/ student success. Second, this online knowledge base is complemented by either an 8 hour one -day face -to-face session (for information: http://www.usf.edu/atle/events/ta -training.aspx ) course (for information: http://www.usf.edu/atle/events/pct -course.aspx ) that is ideal for any graduate student teaching at the college level, either while here with us at USF or in their future career. The focus of this component is on teaching college classes, and doing it well, which examines best practices in a number of topics related to course design and course delivery, so that by the end of the major , Teaching Assistants feel like they are well -equipped to build and deliver a college -level class on their own and will receive a certificate. Those who elect the 8 -week course will focus on instruction that is heavily tilted toward discussions, participation, and i ndividual presentations called micro - teaching. Further, the micro -teaching lab will give each student the opportunity to present a short (7 -10 minute) lecture from their discipline to fellow classmates, and receive informal feedback on their delivery. Thes e students will also receive co -curricular transcript credit and a certificate. F or specifics regarding Graduate Assistantship requirements, guidelines, and policies, refer to the Graduate Assistantships Resource Center online at http://www.grad.usf.edu/assistantships.php , the Graduate Catalog Academic Policies Section, and also the Graduate Assistants Policies and Guidelines Handbook.

Co urse Information A cademic Credit hours Reference - USF Policy cademic credit provides the basis for quantifying the amount of engaged l earning time expected of a typical student enrolled in traditional classroom settings, laboratories, studios, internships and other forms of experiential learning, and distance and correspondence education. Credit hours are a measure of learning, and suppo rt a wide range of activities, including the transfer of students from one institution to another, awarding financial aid, and credentialing for employment. Because of the significance of awarding credit hours, an institution is obligated to ensure that credit hours for courses and major s conform to the commonly accepted standards of higher education, as stated in the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) Federal Requirements 4.9 (Definition of Credit Hour) (http://sacscoc.org/pdf/081705/Credit%20Hours.pdf ) and the SACSCOC Credit Hours Policy Statement. This Policy is intended to ensure that all credit -bearing courses and programs offered by the University of South Florida System (USF System) meet the requirements of the Federal definition of a credit hour and the Credit Hours Policy Statement issued by the SACSCOC. I n determining the maximum number of credits that may be assigned to a course, the following guidelines apply. F or courses taught in a \"traditional\" classroom format in a 15 -week semester, the maximum number o f c redits to be assigned is limited to the weekly number of 50 -minute contact periods (or their equivalent) with the instructor. Underlying this statement is an assumption that each 50 -minute contact period requires a minimum additional two hours of student work outside of the class involving reading, exercises, etc. Where this assumption does not hold true (as may be the case with some laboratories, for example), then the maximum number of credits may be significantly less than the weekly number of 50 -minute contact periods .USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 5 Registration and General Information 37 http://www.grad.usf.edu/ oFor a lecture class, one unit is considered to be one hour of lecture class time and two hours per week of homework. For the typical three- unit class, a student spends three hours per week in class and should do six hours per week of homework. The total number of class contact hours per semester eq uals the credit hours multiplied by 15 weeks. oF or a laboratory class, the hours per week are considered to be all in class with no outside assignments. Thus, one unit is three hours per week of laboratory time. oW here a course includes \"by arrangement lab hours,\" these generally take the place of the hours assigned to homework, since the student is required to use supervised college facilities to do assignments related to homework. An example might be a 3 -unit lecture course which requires the student also to work two hours per week in the computer lab. There would be only four hours per week of additional homework required. In all cases, but particularly in cases such as online learning where seat time is non-verifiable, credit hours are awarded on the b asis of documented student learning outcomes that reflect the amount of academically engaged time for a typical student in a traditional format, and on the basis of documentationof the amount and type of work a typical student is expected to complete within a specified period o f a cademically engaged time. The number of credit hours awarded is based on the number and/or rigor of student learning outcomes, with the higher number of credit hours awarded yielding greater number and/or rigor of outcomes . A vailability of Courses USF does not commit itself to offer all the courses, major s, and majors listed in this catalog unless there is sufficient demand to justify them. Some courses may be offered only in alternate semesters or years, or even less frequently if there is little demand. M andatory First -Day Attendance Policy All students are required to attend class the first day a class meets, for both online and on -campus courses. Students unable to attend must contact the instructor prior to the first day to ensure they are not dropped from the course . This policy is not applicable to courses in the following categories: Educational Outreach, FEEDS Program, Community Experiential Learning (CEL), Cooperative Education Training, and courses that do not have regularly scheduled meeting days/times (such as, directed reading/research or study, individual research, thesis, dissertation, internship, practica, etc.). Students are responsible for dropping undesired courses in these categories by the 5th day of classes to avoid fee liability and academic penalty. (See USF Regulation - Registration - 4.0101, http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/regulations/pdfs/regulation -usf4.0101.pdf ) A ttendance Policy for the Observance of Religious Days by Students In accordance with Sections 1006.53 and 1001.74(10) (g) Florida Statutes and Board of Governors Regulation 6C - 6.0115, the University of South Florida (University/USF) has established the following policy regarding religious observances: http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/policies -and-procedures/pdfs/policy- 10-045.pdf C ross- listing 4000/6000 Courses It is expected that the 4000 and 6000 courses will have distinct syllabi demonstrating different depth and breadth of the subject matter as reflected in the course requirements. The courses presuppose different audiences, and the intention is to offer them at distinct levels. C ourse Currency All courses, with the exception of those approved for transfer of credit, should meet the time limit specified for the degree and be academically relevant as determined by the faculty in the graduate major . Courses used for the graduate degree requirements can be no more than ten years old at the time the degree is conferred. USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 5 Registration and General Information 38 http://www.grad.usf.edu/ Course Descriptions For a listing of the most current, approved course descriptions refer to the USF Course Inventory Database available online at http://ugs.usf.edu/course -inventory or in the course description listing in the Graduate C atalog. A dds After a student has completed his/her registration on the date assigned, he/she may add a course(s) during the drop/add week (i.e. through the fifth day of classes) through the OASIS system. Courses may be added with instructor approval and verification up to the last day to withdraw without academic penalty. See Academic Calendar for deadlines. Courses may not be added after the deadline to withdraw without academic penalty or retroactively except in cases of University Administrative erro r. D rops/Withdrawals Dr op A student may drop a course(s) during the drop/add periods (first five days of classes) in order for the course(s) not to appear on any permanent academic records. No tuition or fees will be assessed for course(s) dropped within that period. Courses may not be dropped after the last day of classes except in cases of University Administrative error. Withdrawal - A student may withdraw from a course(s) between the second and tenth week of the semester (except for summer sessions - see the Summer Schedule of Classes for dates). However , tuition and fees will be assessed for any course(s) withdrawn by the student after the first week. The student's academic record will reflect a \"W\" grade for any course(s) withdrawal between the second and tenth week of the semester. Under specific conditions, consideration for refund of tuition and fees may be requested if a Fee Adjustment Request form accompanied by verifiable supporting documentation is submitted to the Office of the Registrar with in six (6) months from the end of the semester to which any refund would be applicable. Students who withdraw may not continue to attend classes. E ffective Fall 2016, all graduate students will be limited to a total of two course withdrawals while enroll ed as a degree -seeking or a non -degree seeking taking graduate courses at USF. Only in extenuating circumstances will approval be granted for more than two course withdrawals. Appeals for additional course withdrawals due to extenuating circumstances must be submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies via the Graduate Petition process. F ee Adjustment Options Students who receive approval to drop a course during the second through tenth week of classes are liable for tuition and fees. However, the student may apply for a Fee Adjustment through the Registrar's Office if the student has any of the exceptional circumstances noted above in item 3. The Fee Adjustment form may be submitted after the petition to drop is approved and processed. The Registrar will d etermine if a fee/tuition refund is applicable. D eletes A \"delete\" completely removes the course from the record with no history that it was ever part of the record. Courses will not be deleted from a student's record except in cases of University Adminis trative error. Requests for course deletions must be submitted only during the semester in which the error has occurred and only with written explanation from college faculty verifying the error. Such requests must be submitted by the last day of classes and approved by the College Dean or designee and the Office of Graduate Studies Dean or designee. Retroactive requests for course deletions will not be approved. Faculty and students are encouraged to review course enrollment to verify accuracy of registra tion. In the event of extenuating circumstances such as documented medical emergencies, military leave or University error, students may request special consideration for deletions or retroactive deletions in writing to the Dean of the Office of Graduate S tudies . USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 5 Registration and General Information 39 http://www.grad.usf.edu/ Retroactive Actions Requests for retroactive actions will no longer be considered / approved. Also see Academic Record. A uditing Privileges and Fees A student who wishes to sit in on a class to review the course material may do so; however, the student is not allowed to take exams, earn grades, or receive credit. The student's status for that class is an audit and his/her presence in the classroom is as a listener. Audit status must be obtained only during the first five days of the term by filing an Audit Form and a date -stamped permit from the college/department on the campus where the course is being offered, with the Registrar's Office. IN -STATE fees are assessed for all audit courses. Procedure and forms for requesting to audit are available on the Registrar's website. C ancellation of Registration before First Class Meeting Students may cancel their registration by notifying the Office of the Registrar in writing prior to the first day of classes. If fees have already been paid, the student ma y request a full refund of fees and tuition from the Office of Purchasing and Financial Services. V oluntary Withdrawal (from the major ) A student may voluntarily withdraw from their graduate major . A Voluntary Withdrawal cannot be retroactive. The effecti ve date of the withdrawal will be entered into the student's record by the Office of the Registrar as the first business day after the end of the semester. Students who wish to withdraw must submit a Voluntary Withdrawal Form , available from the Office of Graduate Studies (www.grad.usf.edu ). Once processed, the student's status will be changed from Graduate Degree Seeking to Non -Degree Seeking. A change to Non -Degree Seeking status could adversely impact financial aid . Questions regarding this should be directed to the Financial Aid Department at (813) 974 -4700. The student will remain financially and academically responsible for any course(s) they have registered for. The student may request to drop or delete courses they are registered for by submitting a Office of Graduate Studies Petition. A cademic Dismissal S tudents may be academically dismissed from their graduate major for a variety of reasons. Once processed, the student's status will be changed from Graduate Degree Seeking to Non -Degree Seeking. A change to Non -Degree Seeking status could adversely impact financial aid. Dismissal cannot be retroactive. The effective date will be entered into the student's record by the Office of the Registrar as the First Business Day after the end of the Semester, except in cases of academic dismissal due to academic dishonesty or disruption of academic process. Some of the reasons for academic dismissal include*: F ailure to successfully satisfy requirements to meet Conditional Admission by the deadline establishe d by t he major . Receiving an \"FF\" grade Failure to maintain \"good standing\" Failure to make satisfactory progress * students may be dismissed for other reasons, such as violations of student conduct. Refer to the U SF Policy - 6.0021 ( http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/regulations/pdfs/regulation- usf6.0021.pdf ) for more information. T o be readmitted, the student will need t o reapply for admission, meeting the admission criteria in place at the time. Graduate students who are assigned an \"FF\" grade will be academically dismissed from the University and will not be eligible to apply to any graduate major at USF.

While advisors, directors, department chairpersons, and deans are available to assist the student meet these requirements, it is ultimately the responsibility of the student to be acquainted with all policies and regulations, and be responsible for completing requirements. If requirements for graduation have not been satisfied, the degree will not be granted. The information presented here represents the Univer sity Academic Policies. Colleges and departments may have additional requirements. Check with your College Graduate Coordinator or your Department Director for more information. Courses, major s, and requirements described in the Catalog may be suspended, deleted, restricted, supplemented, or changed at any time at the sole discretion of the University and the Board of Trustees. For a list of current course descriptions, refer to the USF Course Inventory database online at https://www.systemacademics.usf.edu/course- inventory/ S tudent Conduct M embers of the University community support high standards of individual conduct and human relations. Responsibility for one's own conduct and respect for the rights of others are essential conditions for academic and personal freedom within the University. USF reserves the right to deny admission or refuse enrollment to students whose actions are contrary to the purposes of the University or impair the welfare or freedom of other members of the University community. Disciplinary procedures are followed when a student fails to exercise responsibility in an acceptable manner or commits an offense as outlined in the Student Conduct Code. Refer to the U SF 6.0021, Student Code of Conduct at http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/regulations/pdfs/regulation -usf6.0021.pdf Res ponsible Conduct of Research Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) is a critical element in training for scholarship. USF has information about RCR available online at: www.grad.usf.edu/rcr.php E ffective Spring 2013, the Office of Graduate Studie s requires all new doctoral students to have basic RCR training by completing the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) module most relevant to the student's program of study. The CITI modules have been designed to introduce researchers to various elements of research conduct ranging from research misconduct to data management to mentoring. As this is a minimum requirement, specific doctoral major s may require training that goes beyond the basic components introduced in this module. Graduate Major s that have received Office of Graduate Studies approval for rigorous RCR training consistent with USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 42 http:/ /www.grad.usf.edu/ disciplinary standards and practices may exempt their students from the CITI requirement. Students must complete the module, or provide evidence of previous qualified RCR training to their Graduate Director and Office of Graduate Studies , in the first semester enrolled in a doctoral major . Previous RCR training should have been completed within the past year. Students will be unable to register for courses in a future semester until successful fulfillment of this RCR requirement. Once the training is completed, the Registration hold will be lifted. I ntellectual and Scholarship Integrity S hared Authorship and Research Education Policy U SF conta ins a broad range of academic major s in diverse disciplines, and the USF faculty recognize that the conventions on shared authorship and credit for scholarship vary among disciplines. In general, sharing in authorship implies both substantive intellectual contributions to the work and also approval of the work as it appears in public. Right to authorship credit is not automatically conveyed by being the instructor of a course, being a student's major professor, or being a research assistant working with fac ulty and professional researchers; neither is credit automatically prohibited because of such status. E ach college/ major that includes research education shall include an explicit discussion of shared authorship issues and disciplinary conventions as part of the formal curriculum addressing research methods and ethics, including the conventions of the discipline's publications. In addition, each college or major shall have a formal statement about shared authorship made available to students (such as on a college or major website) or given to students at the same time as they are given notice about other major and college expectations. E ach college/major shall also have a written procedure for resolving questions or conflicts about shared authorship wher e students are involved. The college and major may use the same procedure for resolving questions for non -s tudent employees, but the procedure for resolving questions or conflicts involving students must address the educational needs of students (e.g., explicitly asking about the nature of the research methods and ethics education as experienced by a student involved in the case at hand). T his written procedure must be made available to students (such as on a college or major website) or given to students at the same time as they are given notice about other major and university expectations.

Each Catalog is published and in effect for the academic term(s) noted on the title page. S tudent's Major Degree Requirements In order to graduate, students must meet all requirements specified in the USF Catalog of their choice, except as noted below. As the University is dynamic, changes and updates to the catalog are anticipated. In contract to major requirements, which are tied to a specific catalog, all students must comply with University policies and procedures that come into effect each catalog year. S tudents cannot choose a USF Catalog published prior to admission (or readmission) or during a n a cademic year in which they did not complete at least two terms. If a student is dropped from the system and must be reinstated, t he student's choice of Catalog is limited to the USF Catalog in effect at the time of readmission or any one Catalog published during their continuous re -enrollment. I f state law or certification requirements change, the student must comply with the most current standard or criteria. I f the College or Department makes fundamental changes to the major that necessitates changes in the degree requirements of enrolled students, the needs of those students will be explicitly addressed in theproposal for chang e and scrutinized by the Office of Graduate Studies . U SF policies and procedures not related to degree requirements such as academic grievance procedures, student conduct code and other procedural processes and definitions may be updated eachyear and the student will be held to the most current catalog and procedures available. U SF does not commit itself to offer all the courses, major s, and majors listed in this Catalog. If the student cannot meet all of the graduation requirements specified in the Catalog of choice as a result of decisions and changes made by the University, appropriate substitutions will be determined by the major to ensure that the student is not penalized. S tudent/Advisor Relationship Although it is ultimately the responsibility of the student to be acquainted with all policies and regulations, and be responsible for completing requirements, the Advisor's role is to guide students in all aspects of their academic major and to monitor and evaluate students' progress toward their degrees. He/she should be aware of any difficulties that students may be facing in their coursework or research experiences and should work with students in resolving these issues. It is recommended that the advisor and student understand each other's expectati ons and that effective means of communication are established. The advisor and student are encouraged to meet at appropriate intervals to critically evaluate the student's progress. These meetings may be requested by the student or the advisor. The advisor also has the obligation to express to the student any concerns he/she may have USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 44 http:/ /www.grad.usf.edu/ regarding the student's performance, to stipulate the level and quality of work expected, and to offer suggestions leading to student success. As such, the advisor neither gives the student excessive guidance nor allows the student to struggle needlessly. The goal of this relationship is to foster student independence, which results in successful completion of the program of study. S tudent's Program of Study In addition to the graduate major requirements as specified in the Graduate Catalog, each student should have a written, flexible program of study that includes the student's choice of Catalog year, choice of concentration, cognate, or other options available in the major , and a tentative identification of other appropriate choices available to the student in the program, which may (but does not need to) include specific courses. A program of study is not a guarantee that specific courses will be available in a specific sem ester or that statutory and regulatory requirements will not change during the student's enrollment in the major. As required or appropriate, the program of study should be revisited and modified by the student and the student's advisor/major professor(s). El ectronic Signatures Where procedures described in this catalog require signatures, requirements for original signatures may be satisfied by University -approved electronic signatures or other secure methods of verifying approval by advisors, major prof essors, committee members, or other University administrators, faculty, and staff. Assistantships G raduate Assistantships (GA), Research Assistantships (RA), and Teaching Assistantships (TA) Graduate Assistantships are intended to recruit quality students to graduate study at USF and to enhance the graduate learning experience. Graduate assistantships exist within academic departments or other university offices on campus. Graduate assistants may teach, conduct research, or perform other tasks that contr ibute to the student's professional development. Graduate students may be classified as Graduate Assistants (GAs), Graduate Teaching Assistants/Associates (GTAs), Graduate Instructional Assistants (GIAs), and/or Graduate Research Assistants/Associates (GRA s). All graduate assistants at USF work under a contract negotiated by the Graduate Assistants United (GAU) and the USF Board of Trustees. The GAU is the labor union certified as the exclusive bargaining agent for graduate assistants at USF. E ligibility To receive an assistantship, the graduate student must meet the following eligibility requirements: A ccepted in a graduate major ; Maintain an overall minimum grade point average (GPA) and major GPA of 3.00; Enrolled full -time during the semester(s) appointed as a graduate assistant. For Teaching Assistants, demonstrate proficiency in spoken English (if student is not from an Englis h s peaking country) A ppointments Graduate Assistants may be appointed up to a maximum of 0.50 FTE for a single assistantship. Major s who desire to appoint a Graduate Student, in any classification, more than 0.50 FTE up to 0.75 FTE, for single or multiple appointments, must submit justification to the Office of Graduate Studies for approval. Students hired in non- GA positions on campus must also not exceed 0.75 FTE for the combined position and assistantship appointments. It is preferred that students refrain from employment outside of the assistantship appointment. Departments may determine the maximum number of semesters fo r teaching assistantship appointments. USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 45 http:/ /www.grad.usf.edu/ Enrollment (Assistantships) Full-time enrollment is considered nine (9) graduate credit hours in the fall semester, nine (9) graduate credit hours in the spring semester, and six (6) graduate credit hours in the summer semester. If a graduate assistant is enrolled in the last semester of his/her program of study, the number of registered semester hours may be less than the full -time requirement. Graduate assistants must comply with all Office of Graduate Studies enrollment requirements to retain their assistantship as stated in the Graduate Catalog. For specifics regarding Graduate Assistantship requirements, guidelines, and policies, refer to the Graduate Assistants Policies and Guidelines Handbook N ote - Crimin al History Background Checks may be required depending on the appointment - reference USF Policy 0-615 - http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/policies -and-proced ures/pdfs/policy -0-615.pdf Enrollment Requirements S tudents receiving Veterans' Administration benefits should confirm their enrollment requirements with the Office of Veterans' Services or Veterans' Coordinator. M inimum University Regulations U SF Full-Time Student Definition Students taking a minimum of nine (9) hours toward their degree in the fall or spring semester, or taking a minimum of six (6) hours in the summer semester, will be classified as Full -Time students for academic purposes. Students may take a maximum of eighteen (18) hours in any given semester; exceeding eighteen (18) hours requires a signed program of study or written approval from the College. For financial aid enrollment requirements, refer to the Office of Financial Aid - http://usfweb2.usf.edu/finaid/other/enrollment.aspx . C ontinuous Enrollment for All Graduate Students All graduate degree -seeking students must be continuously enrolled. Continuous enrollme nt is defined as completing, with grades assigned, a minimum of 6 hours of graduate credit every three continuous semesters. Courses that receive a \"W\" grade do not fulfill continuous enrollment requirements. Colleges and major s may have additional requirements. Students on an approved leave of absence are not subject to the enrollment requirement for the time approved for the leave. Students who have been Admitted to Doctoral Candidacy must follow the Dissertation Hour Enrollment in place of the Continuous Enrollment requirement as specified here for all graduate students (not in candidacy). See also the Time Limitations Policy. R eadmission Following Non -enrollment A graduate student who is not registered and enrolled for a minimum of six (6) credits in a 12-month period is automatically placed in non -degree seeking (i.e. inactive) status. Students must be readmitted to the major to continue their studies. Readmission is at the discretion of the major and is not guaranteed. Refer to the Readmission Policy in the Graduate Admissions Section for more information. E nrollment during Comprehensive Exams and Admission to Candidacy During the term in which students take the comprehensive exams, students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit. If the exam is taken between semesters, the student must enroll for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit in the semester before or following the exam. Students must also be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate work in the s emester of admission to doctoral candidacy. D issertation Hours Students working on a dissertation must enroll for a minimum of two (2) hours of dissertation every semester, starting with the semester following Admission to Doctoral Candidacy, up to and in cluding the semester the dissertation is submitted to and approved by the Office of Graduate Studies . Dissertation hours may apply to the USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 46 http:/ /www.grad.usf.edu/ Continuous Enrollment Requirement. Colleges and major s may have additional requirements. Students who are dropped f rom degree -seeking status and formally readmitted to the major must enroll in a minimum of 5 dissertation hours in the semester that the readmission is effective. Refer to the Readmission Policy in the Graduate Admissions Section for more information. Note : students cannot be enrolled in thesis and dissertation at the same time. E nrollment during Semester of Thesis Submission Students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) thesis hours during the semester that the thesis is submitted and approved by the Office of Graduate Studies , usually the semester of graduation. Students not enrolled for the minimum requirement will not have the thesis/dissertation approved and therefore may not be certified for graduation. Note: students cannot be enrolled in thesis and dissertation at the same time. E nrollment during Semester of Graduation Students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) graduate hours during the semester of graduation. E nrollment for Graduate Teaching and Research Assistants Graduate Teaching and Research Assistants should be full -time students. Exceptions must be approved by the College Dean and the Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies . L eaves of Absence (LOA) Leaves of absence may be granted to students under exceptional and unavoidable circumstances. Students requesting a LOA must specify the reasons for the leave, as well as the duration. Requested LOA may be approved for up to two years. Students requiring less than three (3) consecutive terms of absence do not need an approved LOA if they meet the continuous enrollment requirement. S tudents with an approved LOA must be enrolled in the first semester after the leave expires. To request an LOA, the student must complete the form available from the Office of Graduate Studies website. The LOA must be approved by the Major Professor, the Major , the College, and the Office of Graduate Studies , and is noted in the student's record. If the LOA is granted, the time absent does not count against the student's time limit to obtain the degree. S tudents returning from an approved LOA must reactivate their status by contacting the Office of Graduate Studies for procedures. Doctoral candidates returning from a LOA must also have their candidacy status reactivated. USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 47 http:/ /www.grad.usf.edu/ Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) F or Academic Purposes S atisfactory Academic Progress for academic purposes is determined by the progress the student has made in the Major towards degree completion, taking into account the curriculum requirements, as well as the time to degree allocations. This is a separate assessment from the Satisfactory Academic Progress requirement for financial aid. F or Financial Aid Recipients R eference: http://www.usf.edu/financial -aid/sap /index.aspx , Reference: http://www.ifap.ed.gov/qahome/qaassessments/sap.html Fe deral regulations require all schools participating in Title IV federal financial aid programs to have a Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) policy that conforms to specific grade -based and time -based requirements. These requirements apply to all students as one determinant of eligibility for financial aid and include three components: G PA Pace Maximu m Time R efer to the Financial Aid websites for information and requirements. Academic Standards and Grades M inimum University Requirements I n Good Standing To be considered a \" student in good standing, \" graduate students must M aintain an overall minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 (on a 4.00 scale) in all courses taken as a graduate student, and M aintain an overall minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 (on a 4.00 scale) in all courses taken in each of the student's degree -seeking major s. On ly courses with grades of \"C\" (2.00) or better will be accepted toward a graduate degree; no grade of C- or below will be accepted. Students must meet the requirements to be in good standing to graduate. All \"I\" and \"M\" grades must be cleared for graduati on to be certified. Students who fail to maintain good standing may be placed on probation or academically dismissed. G rade Point Average (GPA) The GPA is computed by dividing the total number of quality points by the total number of graded ( A-F) hours completed. The total quality points are figured by multiplying the number of credits assigned to each course by the quality point value of the grade given. The GPA is truncated to two decimals (3.48) and is not rounded up. C redit hours for courses with grad es of I, IU, M, MU, N, S, U, W, Z and grades which are preceded by T (Transfer) are subtracted from the total hours attempted before the GPA is calculated. Graduate students are not eligible for grade forgiveness. All grades earned, regardless of course l evel, will be posted on the transcript. If a student retakes a course, both grades will be used in the determination of the GPA. Courses taken at USF as non- degree-USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 48 http:/ /www.grad.usf.edu/ seeking are not computed in the GPA unless the courses are transferred in and applied to t he degree requirements. The program and the college must approve such actions. G rades for transfer credits accepted toward the major will not be counted in the GPA unless the coursework in question was taken as a non -degree- seeking student at USF and me ets the requirements stated above (see Institution Based Credit/Transfer of Credit section). G raduate Grading System P lus/Minus Grading: Effective fall semester 2000, graduate and undergraduate grades will be assigned quality points in the Grade Point A verage (GPA) grading system. The +/ - designation must be included in the syllabus provided at the beginning of the course. The use of the +/ - grading system is at the discretion of the instructor.

See section on Academic Dishonesty and Graduate S tudies Policy on Academic Integrity for more information. USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 49 http:/ /www.grad.usf.edu/ Satisfactory (S)/ Unsatisfactory (U) Graduate students may not take courses in the major on an S/U (satisfactory / unsatisfactory) basis unless courses are specifically desi gnated S/U in the Catalog. Students may take courses outside of the major on an S/U basis with prior approval of the course professor, major professor or advisor, and the Dean of the College in which the student is seeking a degree. The student may apply a maximum of six (6) hours of such credit (excluding those courses for which S/U is designated in the Catalog) toward a master's degree. Directed Research, Thesis, and Dissertation courses are designated as variable credit and are graded on an S/U basis only. Before a student begins work under Directed Research, a written agreement must be completed between the student and the professor concerned, setting forth in detail the requirements of the course. I ncomplete (I) Definition: An Incomplete grade (\"I\") is exceptional and granted at the instructor's discretion only when students are unable to complete course requirements due to illness or other circumstances beyond their control. This applies to all gradable courses, including pass/fail (S/U). S tudents may only be eligible for an \"I\" when: t he majority of the student's work for a course has been completed before the end of the semester the work that has been completed must be qualitatively satisfactory t he student has requested consideration for an \"I\" gr ade as soon as possible but no later than the last day of finals week. T he student must request consideration for an Incomplete grade and obtain an \"I\" Grade Contract from the instructor of record. Even though the student may meet the eligibility requirem ents for this grade, the course instructor retains the right to make the final decision on granting a student's request for an Incomplete. The course instructor and student must complete and sign the \"I\" Grade Contract Form that describes the work to be co mpleted, the date it is due, and the grade the student would earn factoring in a zero for all incomplete assignments. The due date can be negotiated and extended by student/instructor as long as it does not exceed one semester from the original date grades were due for that course. The instructor must file a copy of the \"I\" Grade Contract in the department that offered the course and submitted through E -Grades by the date grades are due. The instructor must not require students to either re -register for the course or audit the course in order to complete the \"I\" grade. Students may register to audit the course, with the instructor's approval, but cannot re -take the course for credit until the \"I\" grade is cleared. The instructor will be required to complete the I -Grade Contract online when posting the semester grade at the end of the term, identifying the remaining coursework to be completed, the student's last day of attendance, and the percent of work accomplished to this point. This online contract will be automatically copied to the student's email and to the Registrar. A n \"I\" grade not cleared within the next academic semester (including summer semester) will revert to the grade noted on the contract. \"I\" grades are not computed in the GPA, but the grade noted on the contract will be computed in the GPA, retroactive to the semester the course was taken, if the contract is not fulfilled by the specified date. When the final grade is assigned, if applicable, the student will be placed on academic probation or academically dismissed (refer to Automated Academic Probation Procedures for information). Students cannot be admitted to doctoral candidacy or certified for graduation with an \"I\" grade. E xample: student has a \"B\" in the course, not including the grade for the missing assignment, therefore is eligible for an \"I\" student's grade, including a zero for the missed work, would be an \"D\" student and instructor complete the \"I\" Grade Contract, assigning an \"ID\" (Incomplete +D grade)USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 50 http:/ /www.grad.usf.edu/ Deadline Agreed Upon in Contract (e.g. two weeks):* If the student completes the work as agreed upon in the Contract by the noted deadline the instructor of record will submit a change of grade in egrades student earns final grade comprised of all completed course work I f the student does not complete the work as agreed upon in the Contract by the noted deadline \"I\" automatically drops off and the grade of \"D\" remains. GPA is recalculated for the current semester and retroactively recalculated for the semester in which the \"I\" was granted. * Although the instructor establishes the deadline for completion of the work, the deadline may only extend through the end of the subsequent semester. M issing (M) The University policy is to issue an M grade automatically when the instructor does not submit any grade for a graduate student. Until it is removed, the M is not computed in the GPA. To resolve the missing grade, students receiving an M grade must contact their instructor. If the instructor is not availa ble, the student must contact the instructor's department chair. Courses with an M grade may not be applied to the major requirements. Students with an M grade will not be admitted to doctoral candidacy until the M grade is resolved. C ontinuing Registration Grades (Z) The Z grade shall be used to indicate continuing registration in multi -semester internship or thesis/dissertation courses where the final grade to be assigned will indicate the complete sequence of courses or satisfactory completion of the thesis/dissertation. Upon satisfactory completion of a multi -semester internship or thesis/dissertation, the final grade assigned will be an S . The Office of Graduate Studies submits the change of grade for the last registration of thesis/dissertation cou rses once the thesis/dissertation has been accepted for publication. N ote: Graduation will not be certified until all courses have been satisfactorily completed. No grade changes will be processed after the student has graduated except in the case of university error. Procedures requiring petitions are processed through the Office of Graduate Studies . P robation Any student who is not in good standing at the end of a semester shall be considered on probation as of the following semester. The college or m ajor may also place students on probation for other reasons as designated by the college or major . Notification of probation shall be made to the student in writing by the department, with a copy to the College Dean. At the end of each probationary semeste r, the department shall recommend, in writing, to the College Dean one of the following: 1 .R emoval of probation 2.C ontinued probation; OR 3.Di smissal from the major . Students on probation may only enroll in graduate courses (5000 -7000 level) that are part of the approved degree major requirements as specified in the Graduate Catalog. Students with a GPA below 3.00 for two consecutive semesters will be prevented from registering for courses without the permission of the College Dean. The College Dean will notify the Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies in cases of academic dismissal. To be readmitted, the student will need to reapply for admission, meeting the admission criteria in place at the time.

Information on the different types of withdrawal (i.e., withdrawing from a single class - see the Drop section, an entire semester, or from the major itself) can be obtained from the Registrar's Office. Appropriate alternative calendar dat es may apply. Students who withdraw may not continue to attend classes. Tr ansfer of Credit (From Institutions External to USF Tampa) Students may transfer graduate -level structured coursework into their graduate major taken at regionally accredited instit utions, including USF System Institutions (USF St. Petersburg, USF Sarasota -Manatee), with the approval of the graduate major , college, and Office of Graduate Studies. May transfer only graduate -level (5000 -7999) structured coursework with a grade of B (3.00) or better. Courses with Pass/Fail grades are not eligible for transfer. Grades from courses taken at other Institutions arenot calculated in the USF GPA, although the courses are listed on the transcript. May transfer in up to 50% of a given gra duate major 's total minimum hours as reflected in the individual major listings in the USF Graduate Catalog in effect at the time of initial enrollment for that major . For doctoral major s, this percentage is based on the post -baccalaureate minimums. Note - the 50% maxi mum i ncludes the total of both external Transfer of Credit and Internal Application of credit. Individual Graduate Major s may have more restrictive requirements. Must not have been used for a completed degree. For students with coursework fr om a completed degree, the specific course requirements in common across both major s may be waived with the substitution of other approved coursework at the discretion of the major . Editorial Note: For students entering a doctorate after completion of a master's degree, departments may count the structured graduate credits from the master'stoward the post -baccalaureate requirements for the doctorate . The courses must be individually evaluate d a nd transferred in. Must not be older than ten years at the t ime of graduation or course currency is required. A pproval Process and D eadlines for Transfer of Credit : Acceptance of transfer of credit requires submission of the Transfer of Credit Form and approval of the : Graduate Director College Dean or designee Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies or designee The Graduate Major / Department will be responsible for evaluating, approving, and initiating the transfer using established criteria to ensure academic integrity of the coursework. This must be completed a nd submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies no later than the end of the first semester the student is enrolled in the graduate major . A pplication of USF Credit Up to 50% of graduate -level (5000- 7999) structured coursework with a grade of B (3.00) or better, taken as a non - degree seeking student at USF may be applied toward their graduate degree provided the courses are required for the major.

Change of Graduate Major S ee Change of Graduate Major in the Admissions Section. Accelerated Majors Accelerated Majors allow highly qualified undergraduate students to complete a Bachelor's degree and a master's degree or a Bachelor's degree and a professional doctorate in a select few majors on an accelerated timeline. Accelerated Majors commonly offer a shorter duration to completion of both degrees. Students complete a portion of the required graduate coursework while classified as an undergraduate student and have it count towards both degrees. As soon as the student completes the undergraduate degree requirements, the student is converted to graduate student status, where the remaining graduate requirements are fulfilled. Students interested in pursuing an Accelerated Major must complete an Accelerated Major Application. N ote: Although students may be in an Accelerated Major , pursuing a Bachelor's and Master's Degree at the same time, they cannot be in two levels at once. USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 53 http:/ /www.grad.usf.edu/ Accelerated Majors : Require that degrees are conferred sequentially Have an approved Program of Study, including a pl an for academic advising and notation for financial aid impact May share up to twelve (12) hours of structured graduate credit between the graduate and undergraduate degree or between the graduate degree and the Honors College Curriculum Requirements tied to the undergraduate major. Refer to the specific major for total hours approved to be shared. Require approval from the Undergraduate Council, Graduate Council, and if applicable, SACSCOC. It is preferred that the total combined credits be at least 150 credits (120 bachelor's and 30 master's)after the shared coursework is counted. Accelerated Majors with less than 150 total combinedcredits may be considered for approval but require submission to SACSCOC as a Substantive Change to the Major. Require a 3.33 GPA overall and a 3.50 GPA in the undergraduate Major Require that the admission requirements for the graduate major be noted in the Accelerated Major requirements. Require a minimum of 15 hours in the undergraduate major to be completed before a st udent may appl y fo r consideration for the Accelerated Major Require a \"B\" (3.00) in each graduate course taken as part of the shared credits applied to both undergraduate and graduate majors. Consequences for not obtaining a \"B\" will be noted in the speci fic Accelerated Major requirements A pplication and Progression Application - Students may be considered for an Accelerated Major following completion of a minimum of 15 hours in the undergraduate major and submission of an Accelerated Major Application. the student may be considered for acceptance into the Accelerated Major through faculty nomination or student self -nomination via submission of the Accelerated Major Application Form. Major s will review and approve the application. Progression - Major s will verify graduate admission eligibility and submit the required paperwork ( Accelerated Graduate Major Progression Form) to officially convert the student to graduate standing, no later than when the student has reached 90 hours or Bachelor's degree has been conferred. The application requires approval from the Graduate Major , College, and Office of Graduate Studies. Concurrent Degree Options S tudents interested in Concurrent Degrees: Must apply for admission to the first major and validate admission t hrough enrollment. In the semester following that enrollment, the student must apply for admission to the second major and concurrent degreeapproval. May share between 0% and 15% of the total combined minimum credit hours. Only structured graduate course work may be shared. Will meet all other separate degree requirements (e.g. two dissertations, one thesis/one dissertation, projects, exams, etc.), unless the Concurrent Degree was approved with a combined requirement by Graduate Council through the formal Concurrent Degree Curriculum Approval . M ust have a minimum of 60 total combined graduate hours after the shared hours are applied for concurrent master's majors, or a minimum of 102 total combined graduate hours for a concurrent master's/doctorate Degree s may be conferred sequentially or concurrently, as specified in the approved Major requirements Both Degrees must be conferred within the time -limit for the first degree to which the student is admitted. E xample: A student is enrolled in two master's maj ors, one requires 30 hours and the other requires 42 hours minimum. With approval, the student may share 9 hours (equal to or less than 15%) across the combined 72 total minimum credit hours required. The total minimum hours completed would then be 63. The student would also USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 54 http:/ /www.grad.usf.edu/ complete two separate theses. In concurrent degrees where the student is completing a thesis for one major and the other does not require a thesis, the thesis submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies reflects the Major for which it i s required. Concurrent Degree Curriculum Approval A Concurrent Degree may be developed in the following ways: a n established relationship between two majors formulated through the Department(s) and then formalized through the College(s), Office of Gradua te Studies, and Graduate Council. A current list of formalized programs with Concurrent Degree designation may be found in the Graduate Catalog. fo rmulated by an individual student who is interested in pursuing two majors that are not currently a formalized Concurrent Degree. Students must request approval from both majors of interest to pursue a Concurrent Degree with those majors . Any approved Concurrent Degrees must meet the minimum accreditation requirements (e.g. 60 hours combined after sharing hours). For procedures and the necessary forms, refer to the Office of Graduate Studies website. Note: when a Major has this occur more than three times, the Major should follow the process to formalize that Concurrent Degree. Interdisciplina ry Majors A student may pursue a single graduate degree that spans several academic areas. A n Interdisciplinary Major - Defined as a student pursuing a single stand- alone graduate degree, which is offered across two or more graduate majors . (Note: w here two separate degrees are preferred, refer to the Concurrent Degree information above). A pplication to an Interdisciplinary Major Students interested in applying for admission to an Interdisciplinary Major follow the established University, Colleg e, and Major admission requirements - refer to the Office of Graduate Studies website for specific information for that particular major . D evelopment of an Interdisciplinary Major Interdisciplinary Majors are formalized through the College, Office of Grad uate Studies, and Graduate Council and must follow the University requirements for development of a new degree program and/or major , including notation on the Workplan , if applicable . Procedures for developing an Interdisciplinary Major are available on t he Office of Graduate Studies website. For information contact the Office of Graduate Studies . Off-Campus Courses and Majors G raduate courses and major s are offered at locations other than the Tampa, Sarasota, St. Petersburg, and Lakeland campuses. Inf ormation on course enrollment procedures for off -campus courses and major s may be obtained from the College in which the courses or major s are offered. USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 55 Section 8 University Degree Requirements Degree Requirements T he following sections describe the Un iversity requirements established by the Office of Graduate Studies for the Master's, Education Specialist, and Doctoral degrees. However, individual major s and colleges may establish additional or more stringent requirements. Student Responsibilities The University of South Florida and all colleges, departments and major s therein establish certain academic requirements that must be met before a degree is granted. These requirements concern such things as curricula and courses, majors and minors, and academic residence. Faculty and graduate directors are available to help the student understand and arrange to meet these requirements, but the student is responsible for fulfilling them . At the end of a student's course of study, if all requirements for graduation have not been satisfied, the degree will not be granted. For this reason, it is important for students to acquaint themselves with all regulations and to remain currently informed throughout their college careers. Courses, major s, and requirements described in the catalog may be suspended, deleted, restricted, supplemented, or changed in any other manner at any time at the sole discretion of the University and the USF Board of Trustees. Graduate Faculty Definition T he University of South Florida recognizes Graduate Faculty and Affiliate Graduate Faculty. Only Graduate Faculty, and Affiliate Graduate Faculty approved for such purposes, may serve as the Instructor of Record for graduate level courses. G raduate Faculty is defined to consist of all t enure -track or tenured faculty appointed at the Assistant, Associate, or Professor rank, who holds a terminal degree or equivalent in their discipline. Graduate Faculty members are eligible to teach graduate courses and may direct and serve on masters, spe cialist, and doctoral level committees. To chair a doctoral level committee, a Graduate Faculty member must engage in current and sustained scholarly, creative, or research activities, such as publications, performances, exhibitions, patents, inventions and research grants. A ffiliate Graduate Faculty membership may be granted by the Office of Graduate Studies Dean to individuals whose skills or expertise meet criteria established by the College. Affiliate Graduate Faculty membership is in effect for a specified period of time and specific purposes. Affiliate members may be eligible to serve on masters, specialist, and doctoral level committees, to direct master's and specialist's level committees, and to co- direct doctoral level committees, at the discretio n of the College. Affiliate Graduate Faculty can only serve as the Instructor of Record when they have a terminal degree in the discipline and are approved to teach graduate courses in that field. Emeritus Professors and retired or recently resigned profe ssors may also be appointed as Affiliate Graduate Faculty with the approval of the College and Office of Graduate Studies Dean. G raduate Faculty Approval - Graduate faculty is defined as noted above; Colleges and Departments may have additional requireme nts. The Office of Graduate Studies will maintain a list of Graduate Faculty along with approval guidelines from the Colleges and Departments. Also reference USF Policy 10 -115 - Faculty Credentials for USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 56 Teaching Undergraduate and Graduate Courses - http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/policies -and- procedures/pdfs/policy -10-115.pdf . For a current list of Graduate Faculty and Affiliate Graduate Faculty in any major contact the graduate director or coordinator. M aster's Degree Requirements M inimum Hours A minimum of thirty (30) hours is required for a master's degree, at least sixteen (16) hours of which must be at the 6000 level or above; the remaining hours must be at the 5000 level or above. A t least twenty (20) hours must be in formal, regularly scheduled structured course work. Lower level undergraduate courses may not be used to satisfy master's course requirements but may be taken to meet specific prer equisites. All graduate and undergraduate courses taken as a graduate student count in the overall GPA, whether or not they count toward the minimum hours for the degree. Graduate students may not enroll for more than 18 hours in any semester without wri tten permission from the College Dean. The minimum number of credit hours required for each individual master's major is noted in the degree requirements section of the Graduate Catalog for that major listing. Major s with formally approved concentrations must have core major requirements that all students must successfully complete. Institutional Enrollment Requirement At least 50% of credits toward a graduate degree must be earned through instruction offered by the home institution (e.g., USF Tampa, USF St. Petersburg, USF Sarasota- Manatee) granting the degree. For information about the minimum number of credit hours required for the major refer to the curriculum requirements in the catalog listing for that m ajor. Students are responsible for consulting with their Graduate Director for information on courses that may be taken outside their graduate major, as well as the Transfer of Credit Policy for course transfer eligibility requiremen ts. Although equivalent courses may be offered at other institutions including within the USF System), they may not satisfy degree requirements. S tudents must matriculate for at least one semester following admission to the University before graduation may be approved. Students who want to change majors following admission into the University, must wait one semester before submitting the Change of Major request. S tudents who change to a lower degree level (e.g. change from doctorate to master's), in the same major, may graduate the same semester that the change is approved, provided that it is not the first semester following admission to the University. T ime Limitations Master's and Ed.S. degrees must be completed within five (5) years fro m the student's date of admission for graduate study. Courses taken prior to admission to the USF graduate major , for example as non -degree seeking or from other institutions, must be transferred in prior to graduation (preferably before the end of the student's second semester; see Course Currency Link). Master and Ed.S. degrees (including concurrent degrees) that require course work in excess of 50 credit hours may be granted a longer time limit by the University Graduate Council. T ime Limit Extensions In the event that a student nears the end of the time limitation as specified above, but the student needs more time to complete the degree, the student may submit a request for an extension using the Time Limit Extension Request Form, available on the Office of Graduate Studies website http://www.grad.usf.edu/student -f orms.php Requests must include: USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 57 the reasons for the delay in completion, the anticipated time needed for completion, endorsements fr om the graduate faculty advisor, graduate major , and College Dean or designee, a detailed plan of study denoting the pathway to completion and timeline for the remaining requirements for the degree N ote \u2014 for the time limit extension procedures, if the time limit extension will cause courses taken within the major to be older than 10 years, then a request for course concurrency may be required or the courses may be invalidated toward the degree requirements, per the time- limit policy. I f approved, the tim e-limit extension applies to courses applied toward the degree, with the exception of those transferred in or from completed major s. However, major s may require additional or repeat coursework as part of the condition of the time -limit extension. For requests exceeding a year of additional time, the Office of Graduate Studies will audit the student's progress each semester to ensure that the plan of study is adhered to and that progress towards degree completion is occurring. S tudents who exceed the time l imitations may have their registration placed on hold until a request for extension has been approved. Only one time -limit extension request is permitted. Students who are temporarily unable to continue the major should submit a Leave of Absence Request, which extends the time limit for the duration of the approved Leave for up to two years (see the section on Leave of Absence in the Enrollment Requirements section.) N ote - Time Limit Extensions are valid for a maximum period of two (2) years from the date of request. For more information and guidance, contact the Office of Graduate Studies. E nrollment Requirements Refer to the Academic Policies Section Ma jor Professor The Major Professor serves as the student's advisor and mentor. Students should confer with the Department (or equivalent) to confirm the internal process and timeline for the selection and appointment of the Major Professor. The student must identify a major professor from the student's academic area and receive that person's agreement to serve as major professor. The selection of the Major Professor must be approved and appointed by the Department as soon as possible, but no later than the time the student has completed 50% of the major . Students must have a major professor in order to mai ntain Satisfactory Academic Progress. If a major professor cannot be identified or in the event a major professor is unable or unwilling to continue serving on the student's committee, the student is responsible for finding another major professor from t he Department (or equivalent). Students who are unable to find a replacement major professor should confer with the Graduate Director for available options (including converting to a non -thesis option if available.) If no other options exist, the student may be requested to voluntarily withdraw from the major or may be honorably withdrawn in good academic standing. The student and major professor should plan a program of study which, when completed, will satisfy the degree requirements specified. A copy of this program of study, signed by the student and professor, must be maintained in the student's department file. Major Professors must meet the following requirements: Be from the student's academic area -- Be graduate faculty*, as defined by the Universi ty, from the student's academic area. Be engaged in current and sustained scholarly, creative, or research activities and have met departmental (or equivalent) requirements USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 58 Have been approved by the student's Department Chair (or equivalent) to serve as a Major Professor or Co - Major Professor * Affiliate Graduate Faculty may serve as a Co -Major Professor with a graduate faculty from the student's department. Co -Major Professors may be two graduate faculty or one graduate faculty and one approved Graduate Affiliate Faculty T he membership of graduate faculty will be based upon criteria developed within the appropriate major or department and approved at the college level. These criteria must be forwarded to the Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies. I n the event a Major Professor leaves the University (i.e., for an appointment at another university, due to retirement, etc.) and the Major Professor is willing and able to continue serving on the student's committee, the Major Professor then becomes a Co- Major Professor on the Committee and another graduate faculty from the student's Department is appointed as the other Co -Major Professor. In the event that the other Co -Major is Affiliate Graduate Faculty, the faculty leaving the University may remain as a memb er, with another graduate faculty from within the student's Department appointed as the other Co -Major Professor. To ensure that the student can make satisfactory progress, one of the Co- Major Professors must be accessible on the University campus for the student to make satisfactory progress on the thesis/dissertation. In the event a Major Professor is on temporary leave (e.g. sabbatical, research, etc.); the Major Professor shall coordinate with the Graduate Director to facilitate the needs of the student. In some instances, a student may choose to have two professors serve as Major Professor. In this situation the faculty are approved as \"Co- Major Professors\" and jointly serve in that role. Consequently, both faculty must sign approval on paperwork pertaining to the student's processing (i.e., committee form, change of committee form, etc.) (Co-) Major Professor(s) of the Graduate Student Supervisory Committee Responsibilities Available on the Office of Graduate Studies Website: http://www.grad.usf.edu/policies.php T hesis Committee Students working toward a thesis degree will have the benefit of a committee of members of the graduate faculty. The committee will approve the course of study for the student and plan for research, supervise the research and any comprehensive qualifying exams, and read and approve the thesis for content and format. C omposition The committee will consist of either: the major professor and at least two other members or two co-major professors and at least one other member C ommittee members should be from the general research area in which the degree is sought. (Colleges and Major s may require additional committee members and specify characteristics.) M ember Definition All graduate faculty, as defined by the University and the College/Department, and approved by their department and college, are assumed by the Office of Graduate Studies as qualified to be a member of and/or supervise a committee. Persons desiring to serve on a Graduate committee who are not defined as Graduate Faculty (i.e. visiting faculty, professionals, etc.) by the University and the College/Department must submit a curriculum vitae (CV) and be approved by the Department, College, and, as needed, the Office of Graduate Studies, for each committee. C ommittee members must meet the following requirements: Be graduate or affiliate graduate faculty, as defined by the University Have the background and expertise that contributes to the success of the student.USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 59 I n addition to the requirements specified in the Graduate Faculty definition, committee membership will be based upon criteria developed within the appropriate major or department and approved at the college level. These criteria must be forwarded to the Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies . A pproval Once a committee has been determined, a Supervisory Committee Form needs to be completed by the student and submitted to the Committee Members for original signatures. Check with the College for instructio ns and forms. The original appointment form and two (2) copies should be submitted to the College Associate Dean's office for approval. A copy of the approved form should be kept in the student's file. An approved and current Committee Form must be on file in the major /college before graduation may be certified. Committee forms need to be processed as early in the major as possible, but no later than the semester prior to graduation. (Colleges and departments may institute additional requirements for membership on Supervisory Committees.) C hanges to Committee Changes to a Supervisory Committee must be submitted on a Change of Committee Form. Check with the College for instructions and forms. Original signatures of faculty being added to the Committee, along with the approval signature of the (Co -) Major Professor(s), must be on the form. Faxed signatures are acceptable. Faculty who are removed from the Committee are not required to sign the form, provided that the (Co -) Major Professor(s) has signed.

Thesis Final Submission Guidelines Information on requirements for submission of the finished and approved manuscript copies is available online at the Thesis and Dissertation website http://www.grad.usf.edu/ETD -res-main.php . Students who fail to submit the final copy of a thesis by the posted submission deadline will be considered for graduation in the following semester and must therefo re apply for graduation by the posted deadline, enroll in a minimum of two (2) thesis hours for that subsequent semester, and meet the submission requirements as posted on the Thesis/Dissertation website. Only after the Office of Graduate Studies has approved the manuscript can the student be certified for the degree. M andatory Electronic Submission Students are required to submit the thesis in an electronic format (ETD). Requirements and procedures are available at the Office of Graduate Studies website http://www.grad.usf.edu/ETD -res-main.php Submission for Official Publication and Archiving All theses/dissertations will be submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies designated System for official publication and archiving . C hanges after Publication Once a thesis is approved and accepted by the Office of Graduate Studies for publication, it cannot be changed. Rel ease of Thesis Publications The University recognizes the benefits from collaboratio n with sponsors on research projects but also recognizes the possibility of conflicts of interest in the disclosure of the results of the collaborations. While the sponsor's economic interests in the restriction of disclosure should be considered, the University has a primary mission to extend knowledge and disseminate it to the public and the broader academic community. The University's \"Statement of Policy Regarding Inventions and Works\" acknowledges the possible need for delays in publication of sponsored research to protect the sponsor's interests, but it provides no definite guidelines for the restrictions of publication beyond the statement: \"Disclosure delays mutually acceptable to the USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 62 Inventor, the Vice President for Research, and the sponsor, if any, are authorized in order to allow patent applications to be filled prior to publication, thereby preserving patent rights...\"4 T o protect the University's primary goal from un -due compromise, the University has adopted the following guidelines: 1. T he reco mmendations of sponsors, regarding publication of research results should be considered advisory rather than mandatory. 2. I n support of academic discourse and the mission to promote and share academic works, Theses will be released for worldwide access once submitted to and approved by the USF Office of Graduate Studies. In the event that a patent or copyright application provides reason to delay therelease of the Thesis, a petition to request a one -year delay may be submitted to the Office o f G raduate Studies for consideration. Such requests must be received by the format check of th e t hesis. 3. S tudents should not be delayed in the final defense of their theses by agreements involving publication delays. D uty to Disclose New Inventions and Works USF information about the requirements of this policy contact the Division of Patents and Licensing at (813) 974- 0994. T hesis Change of Grade In the semester in which the final manuscript has been received, reviewed, and certified for permanent filing in the University Library, the Office of Graduate Studies submits the change of grade from \"Z\" to \"S\" for the last registration of thesis courses to the office of the registrar when all grades are due at the end of the semester. Education Specialist Degree (Ed.S.) Requirements E d.S. Thesis Students who are required to submit an Ed.S. Thesis must meet all of the requirements for the thesis, as speci fied in the Master's Degree section of this publication. For specific major information, refer to the College of Education. E d.S. Project Students who are required to submit an Ed.S. Non- Thesis project must meet all of the requirements as specified by the College of Education. A project does not need to meet the requirements of a thesis and is not submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies for approval and archiving. 4 April Burke, \"University Policies on Conflict of Interest and Delay of Publications,\" Report of the Clearinghouse on Universi ty- Industry Relations, Association of American Universities, February, 1985. USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 63 Doctoral Degree Requirements The doctoral degree is granted in recognition of high a ttainment in a specific field of knowledge. It is a research degree and is not conferred solely upon the earning of credit, the completion of courses, or the acquiring of a number of terms of residency, but also the successful completion of scholarly work. The length of residency and the requirements below are minimums; major s/colleges may elect to establish more rigorous requirements. The degree will be granted after the student has shown proficiency and distinctive achievement in a specified field, has demonstrated the ability to do original, independent investigation, and has presented these findings with a high degree of literary skill in a dissertation. A major professor will be appointed as soon as possible but no later than the time the student has co mpleted 50% of the major . The advisor will advise on any specific subject matter deficiencies and assist in the choice of a major professor and area of research. Res ponsible Conduct of Research Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) is a critical element in training for scholarship. USF has information about RCR available online at: www.grad.usf.edu/rcr.php Effective Spring 2013, Office of Graduate Studies requires all new doctoral students to have basic R CR training by completing the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) module most relevant to the student's program of study. The CITI modules have been designed to introduce researchers to various elements of research conduct ranging from r esearch misconduct to data management to mentoring. As this is a minimum requirement, specific doctoral major s may require training that goes beyond the basic components introduced in this module. Graduate Major s that have received Office of Graduate Stu dies approval for rigorous RCR training consistent with disciplinary standards and practices may exempt their students from the CITI requirement. Students must complete the module, or provide evidence of previous qualified RCR training to their Major Director and Office of Graduate Studies , in the first semester enrolled in a doctoral major . Previous RCR training should have been completed within the past year. Students will be unable to register for courses in a future semester until successful fulfillment of this RCR requirement. Once the training is completed, the Registration hold will be lifted. D octoral Minimum Hours The doctoral degree is earned on the basis of advancement to doctoral candidacy status and satisfactory completion of the dissertati on. Note - for professional doctorates (e.g. Au.D., DNP, DrPH, DPT, MD), a dissertation may not be required. Refer to the major listing for more information. The minimum number of credit hours to earn the doctorate is 72, post -bachelors, including dissertation (or project) . The minimum number of credit hours required for each individual doctorate major is noted in the degree requirements section of the Graduate Catalog for that major listing. Some graduate major s may require more than 72 hours. Major s with formally approved concentrations must have core major requirements that all students must successfully complete. S tudents must comply with general enrollment requirements and also institutional residency requirements. All doctoral students must ha ve at least one gradable (A -F) graduate course taken at USF to satisfy the GPA minimum requirements. No undergraduate course may be used to satisfy the gradable minimal course requirement for the doctoral degree. Lower level undergraduate courses may not be used to satisfy doctoral major requirements, but may be taken to meet specific prerequisites. All graduate and undergraduate courses taken as a graduate student count in the overall GPA, whether or not they count toward the minimum hours for the degree. USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 64 Time Limitations Doctoral degrees must be completed within seven (7) years from the student's original date of admission for doctoral study. . All courses applied to the doctoral degree must be completed within ten (10) years, including courses take n 1) p rior to admission to the USF doctoral major , 2) taken as non -degree seeking, or 3) transferred in from other institutions. T here is no time limitation for courses from a completed master's degree used toward a doctoral degree. For students who are readmi tted, see Readmission Policy. Typically, a student will reach candidacy within four years, but this may vary per discipline. T ime Limit Extensions In the event that a student nears the end of the time limitation as specified above, but the student ne eds more time to complete the degree, the student may submit a request for an extension using the Time Limit Extension Request Form, available on the Office of Graduate Studies website http://www.gra d.usf.edu/student -forms.php . R equests must include t he reasons for the delay in completion, the anticipated time needed for completion, and endorsements from the graduate faculty advisor, graduate major , and College Dean or designee, a detailed plan of study denoting the pathway to completion and timeline for the remaining requirements for the degree N ote \u2014 for the time limit extension procedures, if the time limit extension will cause courses taken within the major to be older than 10 years, then a request for course concurrency may be required or the courses may be invalidated toward the degree requirements, per the time- limit policy. I f approved, the time- limit extension applies to courses applied toward the degree, with the exception of those tran sferred in or from completed major s. However, major s may require additional or repeat coursework as part of the condition of the time -limit extension. For requests exceeding a year of additional time, the Office of Graduate Studies will audit the student's progress each semester to ensure that the plan of study is adhered to and that progress towards degree completion is occurring. S tudents who exceed the time limitations may have their registration placed on hold until a request for extension has been approved. Only one time -limit extension request is permitted. Students who are temporarily unable to continue the major should submit a Leave of Absence Request, which extends the time limit for the duration of the approved Leave for up to two years (see the section on Leave of Absence in the Enrollment Requirements section.) N ote - Time Limit Extensions are valid for a maximum period of two (2) years from the date of request. For more information and guidance, contact the Office of Graduate Studies. E nroll ment Requirements See Academic Policies Section I nstitutional Enrollment Requirement The majority of credits toward a graduate degree must be earned through instruction offered by the home institution (e.g., USF Tampa, USF St. Petersburg, USF Sarasota -Manatee) granting the degree. For information about the minimum number of credit hours required for the degree refer to the degree requirements in the major listing. Students are responsible for consulting with their graduate coordinator for information on courses that USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 65 may be taken outside their graduate major , as well as the Transfer of Credit Policy for course transfer eligibility requirements. Although equivalent courses may be offered at other institutions (including within the USF System), they may not satisfy degree requirements. Ma jor Professor The Major Professor serves as the student's advisor and mentor. Students should confer with the Department (equivalent) to confirm the internal process and timeline for the selection and appointment of the M ajor Professor. The student must identify a major professor and receive that person's agreement to serve as major professor. The selection of the Major Professor must be approved and appointed by the department as soon as possible, but no later than the ti me the student has completed 50% of the major . Students must have a major professor in order to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress. I f a Major Professor cannot be identified or in the event a Major Professor is unable or unwilling to continue serving on the student's committee, the student is responsible for finding another Major Professor. Students who are unable to find a replacement Major Professor should confer with the Graduate Director for available options. If no other options exist the student may be requested to voluntarily withdraw from the major or may be honorably withdrawn in good academic standing. The student and Major Professor should plan a program of study which, when completed, will satisfy the degree requirements specified. A copy o f this program of study, signed by the student and professor, should be maintained in the student's department file. M ajor Professors must meet the following requirements: Be from the student's academic area -- Be graduate faculty*, as defined by the Univ ersity, from the student's academic area Be engaged in current and sustained scholarly, creative, or research activities and have met departmental (orequivalent) requirements Be active in scholarly pursuits as evidenced by at least one refereed publication in the last three years. Have been approved by the student's Department Chair (or equivalent) to serve as a Major Professor or Co - Major Professor. *A ffiliate Graduate Faculty may serve as a Co -Major Professor with a graduate faculty from the student's department. Co -Major Professors may be two graduate faculty or one graduate faculty and one approved Graduate Affiliate Faculty T he membership of graduate faculty will be based upon criteria developed within the appropriate major or department and approve d at the college level. These criteria must be forwarded to the Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies. I n the event a Major Professor leaves the University (i.e., for an appointment at another university, due to retirement, etc.) and the Major Professor is willing and able to continue serving on the student's committee, the Major Professor then becomes a Co- Major Professor on the Committee and another graduate faculty from the student's Department is appointed as the other Co -Major Professor. In the event that the other Co -Major is Affiliate Graduate Faculty, the faculty leaving the University may remain as a member, with another graduate faculty from within the student's Department appointed as the other Co -Major Professor. It is important that one of the Co -Major Professors be accessible on the university campus for the student to make satisfactory progress on the thesis/dissertation. In the event a Major Professor is on temporary leave (e.g. sabbatical, research, etc.); the Major Professor shall coordin ate with the Graduate Director to facilitate the needs of the student. In some instances, a student may choose to have two professors serve as Major Professor. In this situation the faculty are approved as \"Co -Major Professors\" and jointly serve in that role. Consequently, both faculty must sign approval on paperwork pertaining to the student's processing (i.e. committee form, change of committee form, admission to candidacy, etc.) (Co-) Major Professor(s) of the Graduate Student Supervisory Committee Resp onsibilities Available on the Office of Graduate Studies Website: http://www.grad.usf.edu/policies.php USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 66 D octoral Committees Some Colleges have a Graduate Committee comprised of graduate faculty, who advise the student from admission up to doctoral candidacy, when the formal Doctoral Dissertation Committee is formed. As soon as an area of research is determined and a major professor is selected, a Doctoral Dissertation Committee will be appointed and approved for the student. The Department will request approval of the Doctoral Committee from the Dean of the College and, as needed, the Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies . Ro le of Doctoral Committees Depending on the College, either the Graduate Committee or the Doctoral Dissertation Committee is responsible for a pproving the student's course of st udy gr ading the written comprehensive qualifying examination D octoral Dissertation Committee Doctoral Dissertation Committees will, a pprove the plan for research supervise the research read and approve the dissertation, a nd c onduct the dissertation defense. M ember Definition All graduate faculty, as defined by the University and the College/Department, and approved by their department and college, are assumed by the Office of Graduate Studies as qualified to be a member of and/or supervise a doctoral committee. Persons desiring to serve on a committee who are not defined as Graduate Faculty (i.e. visiting faculty, professionals, etc.) by the University and the College/Department must submit a curriculum vitae and be approved by the Department, College, and Office of Graduate Studies , for each committee. C ommittee members must meet the following requirements: B e graduate or affiliate graduate facul ty, as defined by the University Have the background and expertise that contributes to the success of the student. I n addition to the requirements specified in the Graduate Faculty definition, committee membership will be based upon criteria developed within the appropriate major or department and approved at the college level. These criteria must be forwarded to the Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies . C omposition The Doctoral Dissertation Committee will consist of at least four members : th e Major Pr ofessor must be from the student's academic area -- two additional members must com e fr om the academic area (i.e. discipline) of the student at least one external member (from outside the Department, School, or equivalent, hosting th e d octoral major , but ma y be within the academic discipline) Faculty holding joint or adjunct appointments in the degree -granting academic unit (i.e. Department or equivalent) cannot be external members on a student's committee.USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 67 Approval Once a committee has been determined , a Doctoral Dissertation Committee Form needs to be completed by the student and submitted to the Committee Members for original signature. Check with the College for instructions and forms. To insure uniformity of excellence across the colleges, the (Co -)Major Professor(s) of Doctoral Dissertation Committees will need to submit a current curriculum vita (equivalent to an NIH Bio, approximately two pages long with the last three (3) years of scholarly activity included) with the committee appointment form to the College Dean or designee. This approval is in addition to the approval from their department chairperson. (Colleges and departments may institute additional requirements for membership on Doctoral Dissertation Committees.) Once approved, the origina l form and the approved Curriculum Vitae (CV) are placed in the student's file. An approved and current Form must be on file in the major /college before graduation may be certified. Doctoral Dissertation Committee Forms need to be processed as early in the major as possible, but no later than the semester prior to graduation. C hanges to Committee Changes to a Doctoral Dissertation Committee must be submitted on a Change of Committee Form. Check with the College for instructions and forms. Original signatur es of faculty being added to the Committee, along with the approval signature of the (Co -) Major Professor(s), must be on the form. Faxed signatures are acceptable. Faculty who are removed from the Committee are not required to sign the form, provided that the (Co -) Major Professor(s) has signed. In such instances the signature of the (Co -) Major Professor(s) indicate(s) approval of the change, as well as acknowledgement and approval of the change by the removed member. Any non -faculty being added to a comm ittee must submit a CV for approval. If a faculty member is being added as a Co -Major Professor, or if there is an appointment change to the Major Professor position, a CV must be included for the faculty member who is being added to that position. Change of Committee Forms should be submitted for approval as soon as the change takes place. Changes to a Committee are official only once approved and filed by the major and college. An approved and current Doctoral Dissertation Committee Form must be on file before graduation may be certified. D octoral Qualifying Examination As soon as the substantial majority of the course work is completed, the student must pass a written qualifying examination covering the subject matter in the major and related fields. Thi s examination may be supplemented by an oral examination. Students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit in their discipline at the time they take the qualifying examination. If the exam is taken between semesters, students mus t be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit in the semester before or following the exam. A dmission to Candidacy In order to be admitted to doctoral candidacy, students must meet the following requirements at USF: 1. admission to a doctor al major 2. appointment of a Doctoral Committee, 3. attainment of an overall and major Grade Point Average (GPA) of 3.00 at USF at the time of candidacy. All \"I\" and \"M\" grades, including \"IF\" and \"MF\", must be cleared before candidacy may be finalized. 4. successf ul completion of a qualifying examination 5. certification by the Doctoral Committee that the above qualifications have been successfully completed. T he Admission to Candidacy form should be submitted for approval during the semester that the qualifying exa ms were completed, but no later than the semester following the successful completion of the exam. The form will be approved by the Dean of the College and forwarded to the Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies for final approval. Doctoral Candidacy is e ffective as of the day that the Office of Graduate Studies approves of the request and changes the student's status to 6C. For procedures and processing deadlines refer to the Office of Graduate Studies website at www.grad.usf.edu . O nce candidacy status is approved, students with approved candidacy are eligible to enroll in dissertation hours (7980) in the semester that immediately follows the last business day of the approval window. For example, USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 68 students approved during the Fall approval window may enroll in the Spring. Students approved during the Spring approval window may enroll in the summer and students approved during the Summer approval window may enroll in the Fall. Students may NOT enroll in dissertation hours prior to being admitted to doctoral candidacy . Each major has a required number of dissertation hours for completion of the degree. Departments may, with College approval, apply Directed Research hours toward the total number of dissertation hours required. Directed Research hours shall not exceed 50% of the dissertation hour requirement. No directed research hours will be converted to dissertation hours (i.e. a directed research course dropped and a dissertation course added) prior to or during the approval window. For more information, refer to Enrollment Requirements in the Academic Policies section. Dissertation Dissertation requirements are for the academic degrees of Ph.D. and Ed.D. For the professional degrees of Au.D. and D.P.T., contact the professional school for doctoral project requirements. The Dissertation must conform to the guidelines of the University.

More information is available on the website at http://www.grad.usf.edu/ETD -res-main.php D octoral Dissertation Defense (Final Oral Examination) S cheduling and Announcement After the Doctoral Dissertation Committee has determined that the final draft of the dissertation is suitable for presentation , the Committee will request the scheduling and announcement of the Dissertation Defense (also called Final Oral Examination or Oral Defense.) A cop y of the announcement should be sent to the Office of Graduate Studies, preferably two weeks in advance of the defense date. The announcement must also be posted in a public forum for a minimum of twenty- four hours to comply with statute requirements for a public meeting. T he College and Department may specify additional procedures for this process. A ttendance It is desirable for a ll members of the final oral examination committee to be present physically during the entire examination. If this is impossi ble, video conferencing may be approved by the College Dean and the Office of Graduate Studies. If video conferencing is approved , the student , the Major Professor (or, if Co- Major Professors, at least one) , and the Outside Chair for the defense must be ph ysically present . Other faculty members and graduate students may physically or virtually attend the examination. 7 Include either References or a Bibli ography, as specified by your style guide. USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 70 Video Conferencing Graduate programs must adhere to the following if the final oral examination involves video conferencing. Departments can enforce stricter guidelines. Video conferencing may not be ideal in all circumstances. F acilities and Support Requirements The video conferencing room must allow the candidate and all members of the examination committee to see and hear one another during the entire examination. There must be appropriate software/hardware available f or the transmission of any text, graphics, photographs, or writing referred to or generated during the examination. Audi o-only communications are not permitted. Pr ior to the defense, the student must agree to the video conferencing set -up. The student and Major Professor must confirm in advance that the video conferencing setup is satisfactory. On the day of the defense, if the video conferencing capabilities differ signi ficantly from the initial agreement as noted on the Request for Defense Form, then t he student may cancel the examination without penalty. A ny technical support staff required to operate equipment must observe strict confidentiality. Th e video conferenc e must be scheduled for a three and a half hour time period to allow for any delays resulting from technical issues during the dissertation defense . S hould a technical failure arise , the Outside Chair in consultation with the Major Professor and other com mittee members will determine if the examination should continue. If the examination is cancelled, the examination will be rescheduled and there will be no penalty to the student. Al l committee members must record their vote on the Successful Defense form. Off-site committee members must sign a copy of the Successful Defense form (completed within the College) and send it back to the Major Professor as soon as possible, but no later than a week after the defense date. D octoral Dissertation Defense Chai r The Doctoral Dissertation Defense (Final Oral Examination) shall be presided by an external committee member from outside the Department, School, or equivalent, hosting the doctoral major , but may be within the academic discipline. OR, a non -committee member (a.k.a. Outside Chair), (Refer to the individual Program's Degre e R equirements in the Graduate Catalog for information). If the Chair is from another institution, this individual must be approved for Affiliate Graduate Faculty status. The Doctoral Dissertation Defense Chair's role includes overseeing the proceedings as well as serving as the student's advocate, by ensuring fairness of the process. Faculty holding joint, courtesy, or adjunct appointments in the degree -granting academic unit (i.e. Depa rtment or equivalent) cannot serve as the Defense Chair. USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 71 Procedures for Conducting the Doctoral Dissertation Defense (Final Oral Examination) 1. T he Doctoral Dissertation defense (final oral examination) should be conducted within a timeline to allow for the student to make any necessary corrections following the defense and still meet the final copy deadline for turning in the Dissertation to the Office of Graduate Studies . 2. T he presentation should be considered an important function in the Department and all graduate students and faculty be encouraged to attend. 3. T he presentation and defense are open to the public and as such, must meet the requirements of the Sunshine Laws for the State of Florida. The Doctoral Dissertation Committee deliberat ion is not public. 4. T he room selected for the examination should have adequate seating with an alternate room selected in case of problems. 5. I t is required that all members of the Doctoral Dissertation Committee be present for th e e xamination unless an absence is approved prior to the defense taking place by the Office of Graduate Studies Dean. In the event that a member cannot attend in person, participation ma y be p ermissible via video conference with approval from the Office of Graduate Studies . The student and Major Professor must be in attendance in person and may not participate via remote access. A minimum of three members, including the Major Professor is required to proceed with the defense. If a non- committee member (Outside Chair) chairs th e Defense, this individual does not count as one of the three required members in attendance. If an unforeseeable situationarises, that would prevent compliance with this requirement the Major Professor or Doctoral Dissertation Defense Chair should conta ct the Office of Graduate Studies for guidance and approval to proceed with the defense. 6. T he length of the examination period will generally not exceed three hours. Throughout this time the Doctoral Dissertation Defense Chair is to be in charge of all proceedings and, ideally, is expected to play a balancing role between advocacy and contention. 7. T he Doctoral Dissertation Defense Chair, at any time during the course of the examination, may request all visitors to leave. 8. P resentation T he Doctora l Dissertation Defense Chair should open the proceedings by introducing the candidate and the Doctoral Dissertation Committee. T he examination should begin with a presentation by the candidate designed to summarize the dissertation. 9. Q uestions F ollowing the presentation, the Defense may be moved to a different setting for the main examination. The College determines the order of the proceedings described below: The examination will consist of questions about the research by the Doctoral Dissertat ion Defense Chair and the Doctoral Dissertation Committee. All committee members ar e expected to participate fully in questioning during the course of the examination and in the discussion of and decision on the result.USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 72 I t is suggested that questioning should be limited to about 15 minutes for each Doctoral Dissertation Committee member with subsequent rounds of questioning as necessary. Q uestions from the faculty -at-large and/or the public may be allowed following the presentation. It is suggested that questioning from the general audience be limited up to 5 minutes per person. 10.

M andatory Electronic Submission Students are required to submit the dissertation in an electronic format (ETD). Requirements and procedures are available at the Office of Graduate Studies website at http://www.grad.u sf.edu/ETD -res- main.phpUSF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 73 Submission for Official Publication and Archiving All theses/dissertations will be submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies designated System for official publication and archiving . C hanges after Publication Once a disserta tion is approved and accepted by the Office of Graduate Studies for publication, it cannot be changed. Rel ease of Dissertation Publications The University recognizes the benefits from collaboration with sponsors on research projects but also recognizes the possibility of conflicts of interest in the disclosure of the results of the collaborations. While the sponsor's economic interests in the restriction of disclosure should be considered, the University has a primary mission to extend knowledge and disseminate it to the public and the broader academic community. The University's \"Statement of Policy Regarding Inventions and Works\" acknowledges the possible need for delays in publication of sponsored research to protect the sponsor's interests, but it provides no definite guidelines for the restrictions of publication beyond the statement: \"Disclosure delays mutually acceptable to the Inventor, the Vice President for Research, and the sponsor, if any, are authorized in order to allow patent applications to b e filled prior to publication, thereby preserving patent rights...\" 8 T o protect the University's primary goal from un- due compromise, the University has adopted the following guidelines: 1. The recommendations of sponsors, regarding publication of research results should be considered advisory rather than mandatory. 2. I n support of academic discourse and the mission to promote and share academic works, Dissertations will be released for worldwide access once submitted to and approved by theUSF Office of Grad uate Studies. In the event that a patent or copyright application provides reason to delay the release of the Dissertation, a petition to request a one year delay may be submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies for consideration. Such requests must be received by the format check of the dissertation. 3. S tudents should not be delayed in the final defense of their dissertations by agreements involving publication delays. D uty to Disclose New Inventions and Works USF For information about the requirements of this policy contact the Division of Patents and Licensing at (813) 974- 0994. D issertation Change of Grade In the semester in which the final manuscript has been received, reviewed, and certified for permanent filing in the University Library, the Office of Graduate Studies submits the change of grade from \"Z\" to \"S\" for the last registration of dissertation courses to the office of the re gistrar when all grades are due at the end of the semester. 8 April Burke, \"University Policies on Conflict of Interest and Delay of Publications,\" Report of the Clearinghouse on Universi ty- Industry Relations, Association of American Universities, February, 1985 .

List accurate as of 8/ 17/18 USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 10 Degrees, Majors, and Concentrations 94 http://www.grad.usf.edu/ Accelerated Majors A ccelerated Majors allow academically qualified students to complete an undergraduate Bachelor's degree and a graduate degree (typically master's degree) on an accelerated timeline, graduating sooner than in traditional majors . Typically, students will complete a portion of the required graduate coursework while classified as an undergraduate student and have it count towards both degrees. As soon as the student completes the undergraduate degree requirements, the student is converted to graduate status, where the remaining graduate requirements are fulfilled. S tudents must submit an Accelerated Major Application for acceptance into an Accelerated Major track. Once a student is ready to move into graduate student status, the Progression Form must be completed and submitted. More information and the Application and Progression Forms are available online at: http://www.grad.usf.edu/accelerated.php Fo r specific curriculum requir ements and to see how many hours are shared, refer to the corresponding major section of the Graduate Catalog . Note: Accelerated Majors must have a combined total minimum of 150 hours after counting the shared coursework or have SACSCOC approval for the total combined hours if less.

USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 11 Graduate Certificate Policies 96 http://www.grad.usf.edu/ Section 11 Graduate Certificate P olicie s Office of Graduate Certificates U niversity of Sout h Florida 4202 E. Fowler Ave. The areas of study for the G raduate Certificates are created within the mission of graduate education. Students will be awarded certificates upon completion of specific course work, which has b een approved by the Graduate Council. The G raduate Certificate is not defined as a degree by the Office of Graduate Studies ; rather, it is a focused collection of courses that, when completed, affords the student some record of distinct academic accomplish ment in a given discipline or set of related disciplines. Moreover, the G raduate Certificate is not viewed as a guaranteed means of entry into a graduate major . While the courses comprising a graduate certificate may be used as evidence in support of a student's application for admission to a graduate major , the certificate itself is not considered to be a prerequisite. Process of Approval for New Graduate Certificates P rior to submission of a new Graduate Certificate Proposal, a Concept Proposal form mus t be submitted through the College Dean to the Academic Program Advisory Council (APAC) for a 14- day posting. Once cleared through APAC the faculty sponsor may proceed with submission of the proposal through normal curriculum processing procedures. Propo sals for new areas of study for graduate certificates are created and submitted by the academic unit that wishes to offer such a certificate. Proposals must be accompanied by endorsement from the department heads and deans of the colleges/schools in which the contributing course work is offered as well as from the academic unit or units whose students or majors could be impacted by the creation of the graduate certificate. The Graduate Council will consider all the proposals for new graduate certificates t o assure proposal guidelines have been followed and that repetition and redundancy across areas of study for certificates are not evident. Those meeting the criteria set forth by the Graduate Council will then be recommended for approval. USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 11 Graduate Certificate Policies 97 http://www.grad.usf.edu/ Criteria for Ap proval T he general principles applied to the assessment of the academic quality of proposals for new graduate areas of study for certificates include: 1. T he sequence of course work must offer a clear and appropriate educational objective at the post - baccalaureate level. 2. T he curriculum will consist of at least two structured core graduate courses taken at USF, specific to the area of study. Substitutions to the core courses are not permitted. A minimum of nine unique credit hours is required for the certi ficate curriculum. 3. T he curriculum will achieve its educational objective in an efficient and well -defined manner. 4. A perceived need for such a certificate should exist. This provision might be defined in terms of either external markets (i.e., external demand for the skills associated with such a certificate) or internal academic means (i.e., the need for a critical mass of students in a given discipline). 5. A n appropriate number of credit hours must comprise the area of study for the certificate , with th e t ypical range being 12- 15 hours. The number of graduate credits cannot be less than nine (9) or more than one -half of the credits necessary for a related master's degree offered at USF . 6. I f the area of study for a certificate requires new courses, those co urses must be approved by the appropriate College bodies or offices and the Graduate Council. Student Eligibility and Admission Criteria S tudent s must apply and be accepted into the Graduate Certificate to be eligible to receive a certificate. The prere quisites and general criteria of eligibility for admission to any graduate certificate area of study include: 1. An earned baccalaureate degree or its equivalent from a regionally accredited college or university or enrollment in a USF Accelerated Major is required. Students in Accelerated Majors may be admitted upo n c ompletion of 120 semester hours. 2. E ach Graduate Certificate specifies the requirements for admission, including minimum grade point average, standardized test scores, and other similar criteria as part of the application. However , p rospective non -d egree seeking graduate certificate students must meet University G raduate Admission s g rade point average requirements. 3. G raduate Certificate students will be held to the academic standards for all graduate students as specified in the Graduate Catalog, except for any additional requirements as noted in the section in the Graduate Catalog regarding Graduate Certificates. S tudents who wish to pursue a Graduate Certificate must apply to the Graduate Certif icate Offic e (ht tp://www.usf.edu/innovative -education/programs/graduate -certificates/ ) and be admitted to the Graduate Certificate. Students are encouraged to contact t he coordinator prior to applying.USF Graduate Catalog 2018-2019 Section 11 Graduate Certificate Policies 98 http://www.grad.usf.edu/ Non -D egree Seeking Students All non -degree seeking students who wish to pursue approved graduate certificates should apply for admission to the Graduate Certificate program through the Graduate Certificate Office as so on as possible for maximum benefit, but must apply to the Certificate and complete required coursework within five years of taking the first course applicable to the certificate. S tudents must submit a Completion Form to the department for approval and submission to the Office of Graduate Certificates for the Graduate Certificate to be awarded. Certificate- seeking - students will be classified as \"Graduate Certificate Students.\" As such, they are not eligible for financial aid and will receive a later regi stration date than degree -seeking students. D egree Seeking Students o Admission - All degree seeking students who wish to pursue approved graduate certificates must apply for admission to the Graduate Certificate program through the Graduate Certificate O ffice. Students must apply for admission to the certificate prior to the deadline to apply for graduationby the fourth week of the semester in which the student plans to graduate. C ompletion F or Graduate Certificates within the Major, students must submit the Completion form by the fourth week of the semester in which the student plans to graduate. For Graduate Certificates in a discipline outside the Major, students must submit the Completion form no later than ten years after starting the first co urse applied to the Certificate. 1. S tudents pursuing a graduate certificate are required to meet the same academic requirements as those defined for degree -seeking students to remain in \"good standing\". 2. A ll graduate certificate students may apply one graduate course to a maximum of two graduat e ce rtificates. 3. Al l graduate certificate students must meet all prerequisites for courses in which they wish to enroll. 4. S hould a graduate certificate student subsequently apply and be accepted to a graduate major, the U niversity's Application of Internal Credit Policy applies.

Fowler Ave BEH107 Tampa, FL 33620 Dean: Robert Potter , Ph.D. Associate Dean: Allison Cleveland Roberts College Structure: The College of Arts and Sciences is USF's largest college . The C ollege is comprised of three schools including the School of Social Sciences, the School of Natural Sciences & Mathematics, and the School of Humanities, all with strong interdisciplinary connections among them and throughout the U niversity. Mission Statement : The College of Arts and Sciences is a community of scholars dedicated to the idea that educated people are the basis of a just and free society. The essences of education are a capacity for the appreciation of social change within a context of prior human achievement. The faculty of the Arts and Sciences strive to instill in their students a history of human ideas, a love of learning, and an understanding of t he means that scholars have used in their search for beauty and order in the natural world. The education provided by the disciplines of the Arts and Sciences is the foundation upon which the lives and professions of our students are built, and the basis from which personal growth occurs. The College of Arts and Sciences takes as its goal a melding of the natural, humanistic and social philosophies into a comprehensive whole that encourages the development of new ideas and new approaches to the understandi ng of our universe. It is the responsibility of scholars to share their discoveries for the betterment of society. Thus, the Arts and Sciences embrace the disciplines that strive to make immediate use of knowledge in the service of social goals as well as the disciplines whose discoveries contribute to the fund of basic information that is the stepping stone of applied knowledge.

More than 240 graduates have received an education in anthropology and its practical uses, leading to employment in government and private sector agencies and organizations. For many, the MA is a terminal degree that qualifies them for professional careers in administration, program evaluation, planning, research, and cultural resource management. Others have gone on to earn doctoral degrees and have gained employment in academic or higher level nonacademic positions. Students entering the Applied Anthropology major at USF choose from one of four tracks : Archaeology, Biological Anthropology , Cultural A nthropology, or Medical Anthropology . Although these four tracks share some common requirements, and are bound by general rules of the USF Office of Graduate Studies, they have different curricula and employment trajectories. Archaeology Track graduates typically enter careers in contra ct archaeology, or public and private agencies and museums responsible for managing archaeological resources. The C ultural Anthropology Track is designed to lead to employment in diverse areas that include education, urban planning, human services, private sector consulting and research, and non- governmental community organizations. Museum and heritage programming represent an area of overlap between the two emphases. Students who wish to pursue these kinds of specialties will develop curricula that draw from both applied and public archaeology requirements in consultation with their advisors. Biological Anthropology students are trained to work in law enforcement, private sector consulting and research, and non- governmental organizations. The Medical Anthro pology t rack prepar es students to conduct research, evaluation, and consulting in a variety of settings, including community -based organizations, county and state health departments, and non- governmental organizations. In addition to following the curricul um of a track, M.A. students can select elective courses to fulfill one of four concentration s in Archaeological and Forensic Sciences, Bio cultural Medical Anthropology, Cultural Resource Management, or Heritage Studies.

Each Department has its own Chair and Graduate Director and offers students a Master of Science in Biology with a specific concentration asso ciated with either CMMB or IB. There is no general Biology MS major . The CMMB and IB Departments are located in modern, well -equipped buildings. Research in the CMMB Department is done by faculty housed in Interdisciplinary Science Building and the Bio -Science Faculty building (BSF), and most of the research within the IB Department is conducted by faculty housed in the Science Center building (SCA). Because of the interdisciplinary aspect of most research projects, faculty and graduate students often work together on broad training research projects that bring together many of the traditionally separate areas of biology. Many of the faculty withi n CMMB and IB are involved in cooperative research with their colleagues in Chemistry, Public Health, Nursing, Me dicine, Geology, Psychology, Geography, Marine Science, and Environmental Science. Often CMMB and IB graduate students have faculty members from these other areas of USF as members of their graduate committees. Because of the many undergraduate courses th at require hands -on experimental laboratories, both CMMB and IB support many graduate students as Teaching Assistants. CMMB and IB values high quality teaching at all levels of instruction. Research Assistant positions also are available to support researc h with specific faculty members depending on an individual faculty members funding. Numerous scholarship opportunities are also offered on a competitive basis through the USF Office of Graduate Studies. Application to the Biology Major is through one of t he two departments, with students selecting a formal Concentration. Refer to the Concentration listing in the Catalog for specific information and requirements.

Prospective students must apply to the Biology M .S. major with a specific concentration via the online application process through the USF Office of Graduate Admissions . GR E: Preferred scores of 500V, 600Q, 4.5AW prior to August percentile) , 4.5AW for GRE revised general test taken after August 1, 2011 F or acceptance into the IB Department, acceptance by a faculty member in IB is MAND ATORY. IB encourages applicants to contact faculty via email to indicate an interest in the research being conducted in their laboratory. IB will make every effort to pair potential graduate students with appropriate faculty; however, it is recommended tha t applicants make direct contact with individual faculty. I t is expected that candidates for the M.S. degrees will have completed courses equivalent to those required for the B.S. in Biology at U.S.F. A pplying to the Department of Cell Biology, Microbiology and Molecular Biology Students interested in attending graduate studies within the CMMB Department should visit the CMMB website that can be accessed from the main USF site and review the current CMMB faculty. It is recommended that potential students consider at least 2 -3 CMMB faculty that they would be interested in working with and communicate this information in their letter of application. It is also recommended that potential students contact the CMMB Graduate Director as well as the individual faculty members they are interested in working with via email.

Students doing rotations will need to enr oll in the laboratory rotation course. If a student has not chosen a major professor after two semesters, they may enroll in an additional summer rotation. Rotations have several purposes. The foremost is to help the students choose a compatible major prof essor and an exciting research project. A second purpose is for students to develop necessary technical skills. Students will be evaluated by the host professor and the Graduate Advisor will assign a grade to each student at the end of the semester.

Electives - 6 credits Students taking ENC 6745 Teaching Practicum must use this as an elective if they count it toward the 33 credits in the degree. No CRW courses will be allowe d in the literature track. Only one practicum will be allowed to satisfy degree requirements (including ENC 6745). One Directed Study may be used to substitute for degree requirement with the approval of the Graduate Director. Portfolio and Defense - 3 credits Three directed study hours to prepare portfolio. In their fourth and final semester (excluding summer terms), MA students will submit a portfolio for review to a two -member faculty committee six weeks prior to the Office of Graduate Studies deadline for thesis/dissertation submission. Upon submission, the student and chair of the committee will establish a defense date with the Graduate Program Specialist. The portfolio will contain the following: An introductory first- person essay in which the st udent offers a self -evaluation of the contents of the portfolio and how it reflects his or her own process of revision, intellectual growth, plans for publication/dissemination, and professional development (minimum five pages, not to exceed fifteen). Two revised seminar papers 5000 -6000 words in length, including appropriate MLA or Chicago Style documentation. o Papers should be developed under the direction of t wo different faculty members from the English Department, who then will form the committee for th e defense. One member of the committee will serve as the chair, who will coordinate the circulation of the portfolio, the scheduling of the defense, and the submission of evaluation forms to the graduate director within specified deadlines. The portfolio will be reviewed and evaluated by this t wo-member faculty committee using the published assessment rubric. Members of the portfolio committee will be asked to work with the student to revise the papers she/he wrote for class. The goal is to get the pape rs into a form that might reasonably be published. Because this option is not a thesis, it does not have to be submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies , and so it does not need to adhere to the Office of Graduate Studies deadlines. Defenses should be c oncluded two weeks before the end of classes. The whole portfolio, along with the revised papers and the introductory essay, should be circulated two weeks prior to the defense, to give committee members an opportunity to read it through. Oral Defense The committee chair convenes a meeting with the committee and student for 30 minutes; this oral examination provides the opportunity for faculty to question the student on various aspects of the portfolio, and it gives the student the opportunity to expand upon and refine ideas represented in writing. The defense also provides an opportunity for further suggestions on publication and revision. After 30 minutes, the committee will convene without the student to discuss a final assessment for the portfolio usi ng the published rubric.

Geography is the study of the human -environment r elationship either in a global or more regional context. Human Geography studies the construction of space, place, and power. It encompasses the study of economic geographies (e.g. globalization and development), political geographies (e.g. geopolitical struggles and new social movements), and social and cultural geographies (e.g. identities and exclusions). Human geography is key to providing insights into contemporary spatial arrangements, including the role of cities within the global economy, locati ng urban- rural intersections in t he production of uneven development, and how class, gender , and race shape struggles for so cial justice. Environmental G eography links the study of nature and society and considers the ways in which conventional division s between human and non- human (natural) worlds are bridged through the production of socio -natures. This understanding is crucial to explaining and ameliorating contemporary environmental problems, including the privatization of natural resources, inequal ities in access to food and water, injustices associated with environmental hazards and undesirable land uses, and the role of human activities in spurring large- scale environmental change GI Science and Spatial Analysis concentrates on the use of advanced geospatial technologies, and the development and use of spatial analysis methodologies, to applied research problems in human and environmental geography. A thorough understanding of such geospatial technologies as Remote Sensing, GIS, and GPS, as we ll as modern methods of spatial statistical analysis and emerging spatial analytical techniques such as agent -based modeling, is a critical aspect of developing appropriate approaches to the analysis of geographic data.

Most research in the CMMB Department is done by faculty housed in the Bio -Science Facility building (BSF). Due to the interdisciplinary aspect of most R esearch projects, faculty and graduate students often work together on broad ranging research projects that bring together many o f the traditionally separate areas of biology. Many of the faculty within CMMB are involved in cooperative research with their colleagues in Chemistry, Integrative Biology, Public Health, Nursing, Medicine, Geology, Psychology, Geography, Marine Science, a nd Environmental Science. Often CMMB graduate students have faculty members from these other areas of USF as members of their graduate committees. Because of the many undergraduate courses that require hands -on experimental laboratories, CMMB support many graduate students as Teaching Assistants. CMMB value s high quality teaching at all levels of support . Research Assistant positions may also be available to support research with specific faculty members depending on an individual faculty members funding. Numerous scholarship opportunities are also offered on a competitive basis through the USF Office of Graduate Studies . Applying to the Department of Cell Biology, Microbiology and Molecular Biology Students int erested in attending graduate studies within the CMMB Department should visit the CMMB website that can be accessed from the main USF site and review the current CMMB faculty. It is recommended that potential students consider at least 2 -3 CMMB faculty that they would be interested in working with a nd communicate this information in their letter of application. It is also recommended that potential students contact the CMMB Graduate Director as well as the individual faculty members they are interested in working with via email. Such communication wi ll facilitate the assignment of the laboratory rotations that CMMB students will participate in during their first semester of residency and also allow the applicant to determine whether the desired faculty member has positions available in the laboratory. All students admitted to the Masters in Microbiology must establish a supervisory committee. The supervisory committee shall constitute the major professor and at least two additional credentialed faculty. At least one of the committee members must be a faculty member at USF. Supervisory committee must be formed within two semesters after matriculation. The CMMB Graduate Director and CMMB Chair must approve the Supervisory Committee. Once a major professor has been assigned and/or a student occupies or u tilizes significant space or facilities for research or analogous scholarly activity directly pertinent to the generation of a thesis, the student shall enroll for a minimum of two (2) hours of research credit each semester (other than summer semester), un til eligible to enroll in thesis credits.

Passing one Qualifying Exam on Statistical Methods or Math Statistics at master's level. Thesis Option - 6 hours minimum MAT 6971 Thesis 6 hours Students may opt to complete a thesis in lieu of 6 hours of electives. A mast er's thesis is a scholarly composition that demonstrates the ability of the author to do independent and creative work. It explores in some depth a problem or issue related to the major field of study. Although considerable variations in format and style are acceptable, precise expression, logical construction, and meticulous attention to detail are essential. A thesis in statistics should deal with some aspect of statistical methodology or theory, or the development of statistical models for a class of pro blems related to a scientific question. While most theses will include a case study or example that involves scientific data, the analysis of a particular data set does not, alone, constitute the level of scholarly accomplishment required for a thesis. Student's Graduate Committee Students working toward a thesis will have the benefit of a committee of members of the graduate faculty, appointed by the graduate director/departmental chairperson and approved by the Dean of the College . The Committee will approve the course of study for the student and plan for research, supervise the research and any comprehensive qualifying exams, and read and approve the thesis for content and format.

We prepare leaders in the field of urban and regional planning to meet community, national and global needs. The major recognizes the need for effective planners to possess diverse skills in the planning and management o f human settlements. Accordingly, the MURP core coursework includes thematically -related courses in land use planning, research methods, quantitative analysis, planning theory and history, planning policy and politics , community and economic development, and geographic information systems (GIS). Students have the option of enrolling in electives that focus on housing & community develo pment, land use planni ng, local economic developm ent, GIS, coastal zone management, housing & community development, environmental and natural resources planning, natural hazards and resilience planning, and transportation planning. These areas of specialization build on the strengths of existing faculty in our sister - major in Public Administration, as well as with colleagues a nd facilities across the university. The major is thus distinct in its flexibility. Graduates of the major will be able to: 1. Engage in policy -related research relevant to urban and regional issues . 2. Assume positions of leadership in public, private and nonp rofit organizations engaged in planning, land use, and public policy . 3. Further public discourse on the problems confronting cities and regions . 4. Utilize communications and technical skills to become successful at all levels of the planning profession.

ABA provides an approach for developing, implementing, and evaluating practical strategies to produce changes in socially significan t behaviors of individuals in the context of community settings. Three important features characterize the scientific basis upon which ABA is built: a) it focuses upon objectively measurable behavior of individuals; b) it studies environmental influences u pon the targeted behaviors; and c) it places a premium upon single -subject research designs to analyze the effects of different environmental variables. The 41-credit -hour master's degree in ABA is in the department of Child and Family Studies in the Col lege of Behavioral and Community Sciences is fully online . Students demonstrate knowledge of behavioral principles and procedures in courses that constitute a core curriculum, demonstrate applied behavior analysis skills through supervised practicum experi ences, and complete a data based case -study . The major is designed to prepare students to meet the standards to be Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBA s). It will prepare them for employment in a variety of fields where there are growing demands for com petent professionals with expertise in applied behavior analysis. Philosophy The systematic analysis and application of behavioral principles is an extensive repertoire of professional behaviors. In the USF ABA major , these skills are acquired as students move through the sequenced curriculum of coursewo rk and practicum experiences. The curriculum requires application of behavior analytic principles, with direct supervision by faculty and BCBA supervisors. Students participate in practicum training in com munity agencies un der the supervision of BCBAs. In addition to the 10 -25 hours of behavior analysis practice they complete in their practicum sites each week, students also participate in practicum seminars each semester. In these seminars, the instructo r discusses important practice issues and facilitates student dis cussion of their applied work. The supervision of the students' case study research rests in the hands of the on- site supervisor and designated core faculty member . On-site supervisors and AB A faculty serve as mentors for the students by closely supervising their case study research and their progress through the major . Therefore, as students are mentored by their on -site supervisor and USF professors during the major , a meaningful supervisor -student relationship is essential.

The profession of App lied Behavior Analysis requires that the practitioner possess personal characteristics as well as academic and technical competencies, and the admissions process attempts to evaluate both these areas. Admission to the major is based on past academic work ; coursework in ABA, a CV outlining relevant work, volunteer, and extracurricular experience in applied behavior analysis; letters of recommendation; and a statement of ABA interests, and professional goals. Students may apply, after conferral or ant icipated conferral of their Bachelor's degree. Applications should be submitted by the posted deadline to be considered for application in the following fall term. Late applications will be considered if space in the major is available.

Code: DEA Major/College Codes : BUD BA Effective date Summer 2014 CONTACT INFORMATION College: Muma College of Business Contact Information: www.grad .usf.edu The DBA degree program offered by the Muma College of Business provides its graduates with the skills needed to conduct rigorous research with the objective of applying the findings to real -world decision -making in industry and government. The Program provides for intellectual growth as students work closely with faculty in seminars, research projects, and other assignments that develop their research skills and ability to communicate their findings to a broad audience of both practitioners and researchers. It also offers students the opportunity to develop a portfolio of skills that, when combined with the extensive experience that they bring into the program, uniquely qualifies them to serve in clinical faculty position s. The curriculum is des igned to build upon the breadth of business understanding that they have previously achieved as successful executives. This is achieved by offering substantive coverage of a broad variety of qualitative and quantitative research techniques and by allowing students the flexibility to focus more deeply on their personal areas of interest during the dissertation phases of the program. The degree conferred is a Doctor of Business Administration (DBA), a terminal degree so -named to differentiate it from the Ph.D . degree that specifically focuses on preparing students for an academic research career within a specific discipline. Students will complete the 3 -year program in a cohort with other executives. Classes are scheduled all day for two consecutive days appro ximately one weekend a month for six 5 -month semesters. Each semester is divided into 2 quarters, with a one -month break between semesters. Face -to-face classes are heavily supplemented by online activities between face- to-face classes. The weekend format allows participants to continue carrying their careers while they master a range of applied research skills.

They fall into three categories. The first are designed to develop the student's quantitative and qualitative research skills, and to provide opportunities to practice these skills in real world contexts. These required courses consist of: GEB 7557 Research and Writing Skills for Doctoral Students 3 credits QMB 6375 Applied Linear Statistical Models 3 credits QMB 7565 Introduction to Research Methods 3 credits QMB 7566 Applied Multivariate Statistical Methods 3 credits GEB 7911 Qualitative Research Methods in Business 3 credits Other Required Courses - 18 hours The second category is intended to provide students with exposure to research in the multi -disciplinary topics that represent the current areas of focus of the Muma Colleg e of Business.

Four of the following courses would be offered so as to provide exposure to a variety of research -related topics and activities. ACG 7936 Seminar on Special Topics in Accounting 3 credits FIN 7930 Selected Topics in Finance 3 credits GEB 6457 Ethics, Law and Sustainable Business Practices 3 credits ISM 7386 Informing Science 3 credits ISM 7930 Selected Topics in MIS 3 credits MAN 6930 Selected Topics 3 credits MAR 7931 Seminar on Selected Marketing Topics 3 credits Publication Courses 9 Credits These courses are offered during the first three semesters of the major and have a substantial distance learning and collaboration component between class meetings, with members of the cohort being required to peer review each other's work and make revisions. They represent an extension of previous courses, and require the students to create publishable documents, such as journal, conference and book chapter submissions. Depending upon the particular publicat ion project, each course will have one of the following designations: ACG 6915 Directed Research 3 credits GEB 6930 Selected Topics 3 credits FIN 7915 Directed Research 3 credits ISM 7931 Directed Research 3 credits MAN 6911 Direc ted Research 3 credits MAR 6916 Directed Research 3 credits USF Graduate Catalog 2018- 2019 Business Administration ( D.B.A.) 343 http://www.coba.usf.edu Issues Courses 10 Credits These courses are offered starting in the fourth semester of the major , and are intended to run in parallel with proposal and dissertation activities . Although meeting according to the same schedule as regular courses, issues courses offer fewer credits than regular or publication courses, and therefore have commensurately reduced outside workloads to avoid interfering with the dissertation process. Me mbers of the cohort select the topics from a list of proposals made by faculty members and other members of the cohort. Students may also elect to facilitate issues courses under the direction of a faculty supervisor, who acts as the instructor of record. Depending on the topic being taught, these courses may be any of the following: ACG 7939 Executive Issues in Accounting 2 credits FIN 7939 Executive Issues in Finance 2 credits GEB 7939 Executive Issues in Business 2 credits ISM 7939 Exec utive Issues in MIS 2 credits MAN 7939 Executive Issues in Management 2 credits MAR 7939 Executive Issues in Marketing 2 credits QMB 7939 Executive Issues in Operations Research and Operations Management 2 credits With the approval of the D BA Major Committee, students may be permitted to substitute up to four (4) credits of independent study/directed research (e.g., ACG 7905, MAR 7910) for selected issues courses during their final year of the major . Dissertation Proposal Course 4 Credits The proposal course is offered during the student's fourth semester. It requires the student be matched to a four (4) person Dissertation Committee and submit a dissertation proposal for approval by the Committee . For the purpose of the DBA degree program , the course requirements for both dissertation and doctoral project proposals are the same. Prior to the proposal course, students will take the university -mandated qualifying exam, whose results will be assessed by the DBA Committee. Proposal courses are graded Pass/Fail, and must be passed. GEB 7981 Dissertation Preparation 4 credits Qualifying Exam and Doctoral Candidacy Per University Policy, students must be enrolled in a minimum of 2 graduate credit hours in the semester of the exam. For DBA students, this requirement will be met as part of the normal course load. Before a student enrolled in the DBA degree program can be admitted to doctoral candidacy, the following University requirements must be m et: appointment of a Dissertation Committee, attainment of an overall and degree program Grade Point Average (GPA) of 3.00 at USF at the time of candidacy. (All \"I\" and \"M\" grades, including \"IF\" and \"MF\", must be cleared before candidacy may be finalized.) successful completion of a qualifying examination certification by the Dissertation Committee that the above qualifications have been successfully completed. Dissertation/Doctoral Project 16 Credits Students are required to complete a dissertati on or doctoral project, as approved by his or her committee. Dissertation Dissertation courses are offered every quarter throughout the student's last year, upon satisfactory completion of at least 44 course credits, four (4) proposal credits, and Admissi on to Doctoral Candidacy. These courses require the student to work towards the completion of the Dissertation approved by his or her committee. Because the DBA degree is designed to be responsive to the needs of the Candidate, there is some flexibility in the form that the Dissertation can take \u2014subject to approval by the Committee. University policy allows for two variations in the format: 1. A traditional research dissertation 2. Collection of articles/papers USF Graduate Catalog 2018- 2019 Business Administration ( D.B.A.) 344 http://www.coba.usf.edu The Candidate will meet with members of t he Committee during each residency of the final year of the major , and will present his or her dissertation to the Committee in the final semester of the major . Upon successful completion of the dissertation defense presentation, the Dissertation Committee will then approve the awarding of the Degree, subject to all remaining curriculum program requirements being met, including submission of the Dissertation to the Office of Graduate Studies. Dissertation courses are graded Pass/Fail, and must be passed. The sixteen (16) dissertation credits can be earned by taking one or more of the following courses: ACG 7980 Dissertation in Accounting FIN 7980 Dissertation GEB Dissertation ISM 7980 Dissertation MAN 7980 Dissertation MAR 7980 Dissertation Doctoral Project Or, a student may opt to complete a doctoral project in lieu of the Dissertation. Examples that could be approved might include: 1. a practice -focused book submitted for publication, 2. a write -up of a substantial work -related project in whi ch the principles of evidence- based research were applied 3. a portfolio of related research products/activities that demonstrate knowledge creation or innovative application in a given area. Such a portfolio might include journal, book, magazine article s, conference papers and presentations. Students completing the Doctoral Project earn their required 16 credit hours by taking courses specifically designated as doctoral project courses by the program. In the event such courses are not available in the catalog, special topics courses designated \"Selected Topics: Doctoral Project\" may be substituted. These courses are graded Pass/Fail, and must be passed. Confirmation of successful completion of the Doctoral Project must be submitted to the Office of Gr aduate Studies. External Activity Requirements In addition to the major's course requirements, each student is required to participate in three external activities that involve meeting with academics and/or doctoral students from other institutions. Examp les of such activities could include academic conferences, workshops, colloquiums, doctoral symposiums or academic association annual or regional meetings. At least one of these should include a substantial proportion of international attendees. Grading Requirements Proposal, Dissertation, and Directed Research courses are graded Pass/Fail, and must be passed. Students must complete all remaining courses with a grade of \"B\" or better. This is in addition to the University requirement for a 3.00 GPA overall and in the major . Should a student fail to pass or complete a course with the required grade, the DBA Degree Program Committee may offer an alternative activity as a substitute. Other Requirements As a result of the program's cohort structure, normally all doctoral coursework must be completed at the University of South Florida within the DBA degree program. Students seeking to transfer from other majors should contact the DBA Academic Graduate Director prior to applying. All program requirements will n ormally be completed in three (3) years, as part of a cohort. In the event of unavoidable interruptions to a student's progress, the student may petition the DBA Graduate Committee for an extension up to a maximum of five (5) years from the student's origi nal starting date. Any student not completing all program requirements within the five (5) year time period will be dropped from the program and the student would need to re- apply for admission to the major in the event he or she wishes to continue.

CONCENTRATION - (Minimum 15 hours) Students select from the following concentrations: Accounting, Finance, Information Systems, or Marketing All students w ill take at least five (5) courses at the 6000 or 7000 graduate level in an area designated as the student's Concentration. Students are encouraged to identify courses in the concentration field that will provide experience in applying current research tec hniques to problems in that field. To accomplish this, the student may propose a combination of formal classroom courses and independent directed -research courses. This combination may include a year -long research seminar in which the groundwork is laid fo r the student's dissertation. The specific agenda of courses will be determined by the student's program committee. The following fields are offered: Accounting, Finance, Information Systems, Management (inactive) and Marketing. Courses taken as part of the Foundation or Core sections may not be counted as part of the hours required for a concentration field.

SUPPORT FIE LD (9 hours) The support area will consist of a minimum of three graduate level courses (9 hours) from one or more of the fields listed under the concentration field, or elsewhere in the university. The support field and the concentration field cannot be taken in the same department. Courses within the support field can be selected to complement the concentration field and in special cases may include courses outside the Muma College of Business. The nature and number of the support area courses will be determined by the Student's Program Committee in consultation with the Ph.D. coordinator of the support field department. Courses taken as part of the Foundation or Core courses may not be counted as part of the 9 hours required for support fields. Com prehensive Qualifying Examinations: Upon completion of all coursework, students must pass the equivalent of a comprehensive examination in the concentration area. The student's performance on these \"exams\" should reflect familiarity with the literature, as well as with current issues and problems related to these fields. A student who fails either of the examss may retake it within one year. A second failure disqualifies the student from continuing the Ph.D. degree program . If the degree is not conferred within 5 calendar years of the comprehensive qualifying examination, a second and different examination must be taken. Students passing the qualifying examination are eligible for admission to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree program. The decision to administ er a separate comprehensive exam for a support area will be made by the department in which the support area is taken. In the event that an interdisciplinary support area is selected, any department represented by six (6) or more semester hours may require a qualifying examination. In the event that no single department represents six semester hours or more, the student's graduate committee will solicit input from the faculty teaching the courses in the support area. If a majority of those polled take the p osition that a separate comprehensive examination in the support area USF Gradu ate Catalog 2018- 2019 Business Administration ( Ph.D. ) 349 http://www.coba.usf.edu is not appropriate, the exam will not be administered. If a separate comprehensive examination is not administered in a support area, material from the support area will be integrated in to the comprehensive exam in the concentration area.

Contact the department for information. The goal of the USF Muma College of Business integrated undergraduate -graduate program i n BAIS is to provide outstanding undergraduate students an option to complete the B.S. undergraduate degree in BAIS and the M.S. graduate degree in BAIS in five years (141 total hours). The integrated B.S./M.S. program is a 141 -hour undergraduate -graduate option that allows eligible students to work towards the M.S. in BAIS degree requirements while completing their undergraduate B.S. degree. Students interested in this option will work closely with an advisor and a faculty member to develop an integrated plan of study. General Guidelines Time of admission to the accelerated program: Students will be eligible for admission to the accelerated major at the beginning of their Senior year in BAIS. Students must apply for admission consideration during their J unior year. Students will start taking courses in the graduate program in their Senior year. Joint admission: Students must apply to and meet admission requirements of the M.S. in BAIS graduate major . Plan of study: In consultation with an advisor and a faculty member, students will be required to prepare a Graduate Degree Action Plan . The plan will cover the entire time period of the major and it will be periodically reviewed with an advisor. Advising: Students will present their portfolio (see below fo r details and a plan of study in person to the integrated program committee prior to being admitted to the major . Tuition charges: Students will be required to pay graduate tuition rates when taking graduate courses. Admission Requirements 1.

Graduate Certificates Offered: See Graduate Certificates COLLEGE REQUIREMENTS General Major Requirements The requirements for graduate degrees from the College of Engineering consist of University requirements, College requirements, and Major requirements. For University requirements refer to the Office of Graduate Studies Policies and Procedures. College requirements are listed below. Refer to the degree sections for other requirements. Master's Degree Programs The Master's degree is awarded for advanced study beyond the baccalaureate degree within an area of specialty. The College of Engineering offers several majors leading to degrees at the master's level. Master of Science in Designated Engineering Field - This degree is normally awarded to a Master's graduate who holds a Bachelor's degree in the designated field. Some majors offer this degree in two options: (1) thesis option (30 credits), and (2) non -thesis option (30 credits). Master of Designated Discipline - This degree is normally awarded to a Master's graduate who has an undergraduate degree in the discipline and who follows an all coursework major or a project major . College of Engineering Requirements for Mas ter's Degree 1. A thesis major must contain a minimum of 24 credit hours of coursework and a minimum of 6 credit hours of thesis. (If a student transfers from a thesis major to an all coursework major , no thesis hours may be transferred, converted or counted toward the degree.) 2. Non -thesis major requirements vary according to department but must contain a minimum of 30 credits of approved coursework. 3. Students must maintain an overall grade point average of 3.00. No grade below \"C\" will be accepted in a graduate major . If a student's average falls below 3.00, the student will be placed on probation. 4. Most major s require students to pass a final oral or written comprehensive examination prior to receiving the degree. These examinations are arranged and administered by the student's department. Accelerated Majors Leading to Accelerated Bachelor 's and Master's Degrees Students who are clearly interested in graduate study are invited to pursue an accelerated major leading to a Bachelor's Degree and Master's degree in the College of Engineering. Students in the Accelerated Major may apply up to 12 credit hours of graduate level coursework, which must be approved by the Graduate Coordinator, to count towards both degrees. Students apply for admission to this major throu gh their advisors, who should be consulted regarding additional requirements. Several factors, which vary by academic department, are considered for admission. However, all applicants must have a minimum GPA of at least 3.00. USF Graduate Catalog 2018- 2019 527 http://www.eng.usf.edu/ Doctoral Degree Major s The Doctor of Philosophy degree is awarded in recognition of demonstrated scholarly competence and ability to conduct and report original and significant research. Unlike the baccalaureate and Master's degrees, the Ph.D. degree cannot be earned by an accumul ation of course credits over a period of residence alone. After adequate fundamental preparation to gain competence, the student must demonstrate research capability through completion of an authoritative investigation in the chosen engineering field, culm inating in a written dissertation. The dissertation must demonstrate that the student possesses the ability to reason logically, the talent for engaging in significant and original research, and the ability to organize and present conclusions in a professi onal manner. Doctor of Philosophy in Designated Engineering Field - This degree is awarded to students pursuing a major in one of the following Engineering disciplines: Biomedical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Industrial Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. Students receiving this degree must demonstrate a thorough foundation in the designated discipline. College of Engineering Requirements fo r Doctoral Degrees 1. Supervisory Committee . An advisor will be appointed by the chair of the appropriate department or major for each student during the first semester of registration at the University of South Florida. The advisor will help determine the s tudent's area of research interest and will delineate preliminary course assignments. At the earliest possible date, a major professor will be appointed and a supervisory committee formed. This committee will monitor the student's program of studies and ha s full responsibility for conducting the student's qualifying examination. The Supervisory Committee consists of a minimum of five members. One member of the committee must be outside the College of Engineering. (The requirement may be waived if special reasons exist and prior approval is obtained from the Engineering Associate Dean for Academic Affairs.) A majority of the committee will be from the College of Engineering, with at least two departments of the College represented. 2. Credit Hours . A minimum of 72 hours beyond the baccalaureate degree, including a minimum of 20 hours of dissertation, and a minimum of 30 hours o f coursework (excluding independent study and directed research) is required by the College . Further requirements may be imposed by the candidate's doctoral major and supervisory committee. See individual major s for specific requirements. 3. Learning Focus. Throughout the student's program of study, independent learning will be emphasized. For the first time in the participant's career, in mo st cases, the student will be responsible for mastering a new domain of knowledge without the aid of organized lectures and textbooks. The principal information source will be current literature. Such experience is a necessary preparation for a meaningful career in engineering and other fields where the professional must keep pace with a large, ever -changing body of knowledge. 4. Qualifying Examination . A written and oral qualifying examination, conducted by the supervisory committee, will be taken by each Ph .D. student as soon as a substantial majority of coursework is completed. USF Graduate Catalog 2018- 2019 528 http://www.eng.usf.edu/ 5. Admission to Candidacy. Students must be admitted to candidacy before they register for dissertation. Before admission to candidacy, students must have officially formed a Ph.D. Supervisory Committee and passed the qualifying examination of paragraph 4. Once admitted to candidacy students must enroll for a minimum of 2 credit hours each semester of the academic year until completion of major . 6. Dissertation Research . The student mus t carry out an investigation resulting in an original and significant contribution to the knowledge in the field of research. The requirement of uniqueness means that the dissertation research will provide an important creative experience for the student. As the final stage of the student's major , the candidate must prepare a written dissertation covering the research. Students in the Ph.D. major must take an appropriate number of doctoral dissertation credits, but not less than 20 hours; the exact number i s determined by department and/or individual requirements. The defense of the dissertation will conform to Office of Graduate Studies general rules. 7. Residency . Minimum residency requirements may be satisfied by completing the University's minimal requirement at the University of South Florida. Any graduate work counted toward the fulfillment of the requirement for the Ph.D. degree after admission to candidacy must be accomplished within 5 calendar years. Collaboration with Other Colleges and Departments Advanced study and research challenges exist at the interfaces between engineering and other academic disciplines. Examples include surface physics and chemistry applied to semiconductor processing technology; semiconductor physics applied to VLSI and analo g integrated circuit design, manufacture and quality control; chemical processing and its relation to chemical principles; environmental engineering and chemical identification of minute impurities; environmental and transportation engineering and its rela tion to public health and public administration; water resources engineering and geo -hydrology; and biomedical engineering, to name only a few. The College collaborates with other academic units of the University in research activities and selectively educates students to become proficient in such interdisciplinary fields.

Concurrent M.S.B.E./M.D. MS.B.E. in Biomedical Engineering - 30 hours M.D. in Medicine The Objectives of the M.D./Ph.D. Concurrent Degree are: 1) Produce Highly Trained Professionals who can work effective in the area of Biomedical Translational Research, more specifi cally Engineer -Physicians who can conduct research in a Biomedical Engineering Area that addresses a significant clinical problem, and bring that research through to Clinical application; and 2) provide an integrated educational experience leading to both the M.D. degree and the Ph.D.(BME) Degree. In order to accomplish the first objective, advances in health care increasingly involves the application of emergin g science and technology (I.E., Engineering) to clinical problems, including problems in diagnos tics treatment and the health care system itself. Unlike more basic research that often aims to increase science and technology knowledge in itself, translational research seeks to specifically address the science and technology needed to solve problems w ith the end product an actual application or product (of course, adding new significant knowledge in the process). In order to conduct effective biomedical translational research, the investigator must be trained in both clinical science (i .e. the MD De gree) and Engineering (Specifically Biomedical Engineering). This need has been delineated by both academics and industry and is validated by the growing number of MD/PH.D. (BME) majors nationally. USF has the necessary educational components and research infrastructure for this endeavor; both degrees are currently available. The proposed major seeks to provide an integrated experience where the student really feels a part of both the medical/clinical and engineering worlds simultaneously, hence the need for an integrated concurrent degree. Admissions Refer to the individual major listings for the specific requirements for each degree. Students apply for the BME degree through the Office of Graduate Studies; Students apply separately for the M.D. Degree through the College of Medicine. Admissions are on the same time schedule as that for general M.D. students. Applicants should contact a major advisor prior to application . Curriculum For specific degree requirements, refer to the Ph.D. in Biomedical E ngineeering major page in the Graduate Catalog and to the curriculum requirements for the M.D. as posted by the College of Medicine. USF Graduate Catalog 2018- 2019 Biomedical Engineering (M.S.B.E.) 534 http://www.eng.usf.edu/ This is a seven (7) year major. Students initially complete a non -thesis M.S. in Biomedical Engineering. Then proceed t o complete the first three (3) years of the Medical School Curriculum.

Director of Academic Affairs : David F. Naar, Ph.D. College Structure and Location: The College of Marine Science (CMS) was formed during 2000 from the previous Department of Marine Science, initiated in 1967 with three founding faculty members. The Florida Board of Regents declared it a University Center of Excellence in 1978 and approved the Marine Science Ph.D. degree program in 1982. The CMS at the University of South Florida is constituted as a graduate -level resea rch major that forms the basis for educational opportunities at the Ph.D. and M.S. degree levels and for public service to the State of Florida. Located on the beautiful waterfront of Tampa Bay adjacent to the USF St. Petersburg campus, CMS is administrat ively part of the USF Tampa campus and reports to the Provost of USF. The College is focused on interdisciplinary research in marine science. Our ranked faculty, support personnel, and graduate students work together toward a vision of understanding the unified global ocean system. The College seeks to build new interdisciplinary research teams in collaboration with our local marine science research partners, includ ing the Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute, the U.S. Geological Survery, NOAA, SRI St. Petersburg, and Mote Marine Lab. Mission Statement: The primary mission of the College is to conduct basic and applied research in ocean science. Here, ocean science is defined by application of the traditional fields of science to the biology, chemi stry, geology, and physics of the marine environment and the interactions between the marine environment and the adjoining atmosphere and land systems - presently and throughout earth's history. Included in the primary ocean science mission is the develop ment of new technologies and tools for exploring the coupled ocean - atmosphere- land systems. The College expects it s faculty to develop research majors of outstanding caliber and to fully engage the national and international scientific communities, throug h the reporting of research results in the most respected oral and written venues, and by professional service. Integral to the ocean science research mission is the education of graduate students. The College recruits, trains, and graduates productive, creative scientists at the Ph.D. and M.S. levels that are prepared to make independent contributions to ocean science. The faculty are expected to develop outstanding graduate education programs that will afford students the opportunity to participate in all aspects of research. The College recognizes that graduate education requires strong mentoring along with traditional USF Graduate Catalog 2011- 2012 About the Catalog 618 http://www.marine.usf.edu/ classroom instruction. An ancillary but important mission of the College is education outreach for students at all levels and for th e public at large. Our outreach programs have significantly expanded our educational responsibilities, and they are intended to motivate all generations to become scientifically literate citizens and to understand the environment in which they live. The College pursues innovative avenues for educational outreach. Efforts are made to attract more junior and senior level undergraduates into both the ocean science core courses and into advanced courses for which they have pre -requisites. Historically, this is a way in which students have made career decisions to engage in ocean science. In this manner the College maintains close ties with the student body in other University of South Florida c olleges and campuses. Research Facilities: The College faciliti es include specilaized laboratories equipped for studies in: Scanning and transmission electron microscopy; Trace metal analysis; Water quality; Organic and isotope geochemistry, Physical chemistry, Ichthyology. Additionally, the complex includes the Center for Ocean Technology, which provides instrumental manufacturing and prototyping suppo rt to the faculty and students . The College's students and faculty have conducted research in the Antarctic, Arctic, Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, as well as the Bering, Mediterranean , and Caribbean Seas.

Our group also works closely with scientists from the US Geological Survey's Center for Coastal and Marine Science Center, a major federal laboratory located n earby. Physical Oceanography Physical oceanography involves the study of water movement in the ocean. Energy is introduced to the ocean through wind and solar heating, and these combine with the rotation of the Earth and gravitational effects to drive ocean circulation, tides, and waves. Our physical oceanographers also investigate how the Earth's oceans are directly coupled with the atmosphere, from local weather patterns to the global climate system. Physical oceanographers in the CMS carry out research on a variety of topics using the latest technology. Computer models, real time data, satellite remote sensing, and in situ data from moored arrays, coastal tide gauges, and research cruises are used to study a wide range of research problems. Topics include tide and current prediction in Tampa Bay, circulation on the West Florida Shelf and in the Gulf of Mexico, El Ni\u00f1o phenomena , and the potential for global climate change. Marine Resource Assessment The College of Marine Science offers an interdisciplina ry concentration in Marine Resource Assessment (MRA) as part of its M.S. and Ph.D. majors . This concentration provides training in the emerging field of ecosystem -based management. Its mission is to train a new generation of scientists that can effectively address issues concerning the sustainability of the world's living natural resources. The MRA concentration addresses the national shortage of graduates possessing the skills required for managing living marine resources by teaching a quantitative approac h to ecosystem analysis and living resource assessment. The MRA concentration is designed to produce resource assessment scientists who can introduce relevant ecosystem -level variables into the traditional, single -species assessment process, complementing and enhancing the development of the science- based management policies that protect living marine resources.

The exam aims to judge a student's ability, upon successful completion of the four core classes (B - or better), to integrate the concepts covered in these classes. All students will take the same exam, at the same time, and questions will be determined by a committee to be appointed by the Dean. All Ph.D. students are expected to take this exam no later than the beginning of their t hird year (to allow for students who take 2 years to finish the core classes because of other course requirements or if they do not start in the fall term). M.S. students who anticipate continuing in the major to obtain their Ph.D . are encouraged to take t his exam, which will fulfill this requirement as long as they enter the Ph .D. major within 7 years of successfully completing the exam. The IMSE is a written exam, followed by optional oral exam if the student does not perform sat isfactorily on the written exam. If the student fails the exam, he/she has a second chance to pass the exam in the following year. If a student fails the exam twice, he/she may not proceed in the Ph.D. major . After passing the IMSE , students are expected to form their dissertatio n committee, have their research proposal approved by the committee, and to take and pass a Ph.D. Candidacy Exam (PCE) administered by the dissertation committee. The qualifying exam is meant to test the students' in- depth knowledge in their area of concentration and/or dissertation research. The PCE must consist of a 2 -4 hour oral exam, with an optional written exam (which could be prior to or after the oral exam) at the discretion of the student's major advisor. The student is expected to take and pass th e PCE no later than the start of their fourth year. A student has two chances to pass the PCE in order to become a Ph.D. candidate and must do so prior to beginning their fifth year. Students failing the first time must take the exam again within one year of the first try. If a student fails the exam twice, he/she may not proceed in the Ph.D. major . Dissertation Requirements (16 hours) A minimum of 16 credits of OCE 7980 (Dissertation credit hours). Following admission to candidacy, the student must enro ll in OCE 7980 when engaged in research, data collection, or writing activities relevant to the dissertation.

USF Graduate Catalog 2018- 2019 Medicine (M .D.) 665 http://health.usf.edu/medicine/ SELECT Program Overview Building Leadership Co mpetencies and Emotional Intelligence The USF Health Morsani College of Medicine SELECT program (Scholarly Excellence. Leadership Experiences. Collaborative Training.) prepares students to be physician leaders who can accelerate change in health care. The program recruits and develops students with the intellectual perspective, empathy, creativity and passion to change patient care, the health of communities and the medical profession. The founding principle of SELECT is the concept that students with high emotional intelligence are more likely to develop the skills needed to transform health care and improve the health of communities. In essence: students with a strong foundation in emotional intelligence will become more engaged, compassionate physicians who will connect deeply with their patients and their patients' families; feel more comfortable with and be more effective as team leaders and team members; and have the relationship building skills and systems perspectives to more effectively lead change i n health care organizations. One of the most distinctive features of SELECT is the opportunity for medical students to shape their educational experiences at both a highly progressive, student -centered medical school, the USF Morsani College of Medicine i n Tampa, FL, AND at one of the country's top health networks known for its quality, safety, and lean approach to driving efficiency in healthcare, the Lehigh Valley Health Network in Allentown, PA. The first class was admitted in 2011, and 56 students are now admitted annually. Students admitted to SELECT spend their first two years taking classes at the USF Morsani College of Medicine in Tampa, and then go to Lehigh Valley Campus for two years of clinical education. Students admitted to SELECT develop lead ership skills that will arm them with the knowledge, resources, and network to change the healthcare landscape for the better. These include: Making a difference in the lives of patients, peers, community, and hospitals. Applying continuous improvement approaches to optimize healthcare quality, patient safety, and efficient use of resources. Building resilience to operate efficiently in complex health systems. Acquiring tools to become a change catalyst. Becoming a driving force for the evolution of health care quality.

Code: Major/College Codes : EBI EN CONTACT INFORMATION College s: Engineering /Medicine Departments : Chemical & Biomedical Engineering ; Medicine Contact Information: www.grad.usf.edu The Objectives of the M.D./Ph.D. Concurrent Degree are: 1) Produce Highly Trained Professionals who can work effective in the area of Biomedical Translational Research, more specifically Engineer -Physicians who can conduct research in a Biomedical Engineering Area that addresses a significant clinical problem, and bring that research through to Clinical application; and 2) provide an integrated educational experience leading to both the M.D. degree and the Ph.D.(BME) Degree. In order to accomplish the first objective, a dvances in health care increasingly involves the application of emerging science and technology (I.E., Engineering) to clinical problems, including problems in diagnostics treatment and the health care system itself. Unlike more basic research that often aims to increase science and technology knowledge in itself, translational research seeks to specifically address the science and technology needed to solve problems with the end product an actual application or product (of course, adding new significant k nowledge in the process). In order to conduct effective biomedical translational research, the investigator must be trained in both clinical science (i .e. the MD Degree) and Engineering (Specifically Biomedical Engineering). This need has been delineat ed by both academics and industry and is validated by the growing number of MD/PH.D. (BME) majors nationally. USF has the necessary educational components and research infrastructure for this endeavor; both degrees are currently available. The proposed major seeks to provide an integrated experience where the student really feels a part of both the medical/clinical and engineering worlds simultaneously, hence the need for an integrated concurrent degree.

The Dr.P.H. prepares individuals for leadership roles in practice -based settings such as health departments, non- profit organizations, health services, international agencies, and community -based organizations. Accordingly, the emphasis of the Dr .P.H. is placed on fostering advanced expertise in developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence - based public health practice. The Dr.P.H. degree offers two concentration s: Advanced Practice Leadership in Public Health (APLPH), and Public Health and C linical Laboratory Science and Practice (PHLSP). Each of these has a doctoral core and concentration curriculum that develops the student's c ommunity engagement, leadership and m anagement, communication and education, and evidence- based public health. Dr.P .H. student s are expected to collaborate with senior public health practitioners as mentors through applied practice experiences, and are required to complete a field -based doctoral project that influences public health programs, policies, or systems. The Dr.P.H. requires a minimum of 43 semester hours beyond the Masters degree, with at least 13 credits at the 7000 level. This major requires students to be on campus for part of their experience. Mission The mission of the Dr.P.H. degree is to prepare pract itioners for leadership and advocacy in public health practice through an evidence- based, interdisciplinary approach to understanding and solving public health problems in public and private sectors in the U.S. and worldw ide. Mode of Delivery The USF Col lege of Public Health Dr.P.H. degree is completed through a combination of distance- learning and blended courses that include on- campus learning via three one- week Dr.P.H. Institutes. Students are expected to attend an Institute in the first semester of th eir admission, and then in the subsequent two summer semesters. This combination of delivery formats allows working professionals to broaden their grasp of public health leadership, practice, and research without interrupting their careers.

USF Graduate Catalog 2018- 2019 Architecture (M.Arc h.) 760 http://www.arts.usf.edu/ OTHER REQUIREMENTS Computers The School of Architecture and Community Design requires each student enrolled in the Advanced Design Studios level, or hig her, to possess (through purchase or lease) a NOTEBOOK COMPUTER system. The notebook computer requirement allows students to conduct the majority of digital work, which is an integral aspect of advanced architectural design education and professional pra ctice, in the design studio. The studio is the primary place for the exchange of design ideas, critique, and synthesis, and the Architecture faculty believes that the student's regular presence in the studio is critical for maximizing her or his architectural design learning. The notebook system is required in lieu of a desktop in order to address the limited design studio space available to each student. The mobility of the notebook allows the student to easily and quickly transform a relatively small desk space into a variety of configurations suitable for physical model -making, hand -drawing, hand- drafting, design research, and design writing as well as digital drawing, modeling, and graphic design. The battery -powered notebook allows for maximum compute r use within environments with limited electrical power outlets. The School will continue to maintain high- powered computer systems in the laboratory for intensive computing required for manipulating large digital models, renderings, etc. Students may begin their digital work on their laptops and, if needed, use removable storage and network connections to transfer files to the lab systems for final development. The School provides black and white printers, color and black and white plotters, and scanners in the computer laboratory. Because the notebook computer system is an educational requirement of the School, the cost of a new computer purchase can be factored in determining a student's financial need. The student must contact the USF Office of Financial Aid (813 -974- 4700) to request additional information and a \"Budget Adjustment for Computer Purchase\" form prior to ordering a computer. The decision regarding a student's budget adjustment may take 6 -8 weeks, so students are strongly encouraged to plan ahead. Only one financial aid budget adjustment up to $2,500 for a new computer can be issued during a three year period. Portfolios The faculty requires the submission of portfolios of academic work by each student at two formal portfolio reviews. Students must pass these portfolio reviews in order to advance in the major . The portfolio policy can be found on the School's website. Students are advised to prepare their design work for inclusion in their portfolios at the end of each design semester, instead of waiting until just before the portfolio due dates.

A student should, if possible, have at least one graduate class in these three areas: 1) Ancient/Medieval 2) Early Modern (15th-18th centuries) 3) Modern (19 -21st centuries). Museum experience is encouraged for all students, but course credit for museum internships is limited to those seeking a Certificate in Museum Studies. Thesis and Qualifying paper options Students either write a qualifying paper or thes is to complete the requirements of the major . Students should consult with the Graduate Coordinator and the faculty to determine which option is the best for them; the final decision rests with the faculty. For either option, a B+ average or above is req uired in courses taken to fulfill Major graduate credits, for students to move on to this final phase of their graduate studies. The M.A. in Art History is a two -year major for students who attend full time, but the thesis option often takes longer to complete. Qualifying paper option Requires 8 seminars in art history (32 hours), with 8 additional hours of electives, plus 2 hours for preparing the qualifyin g paper (in the fourth and final semester). The qualifying paper should demonstrate the student' s ability to do significant art -historical research, to persuade by effective use of evidence and argument, and to write fluently and clearly. The qualifying paper will usually be a substantial ly revised seminar paper and should be about 15 -20 typed pages in length, excluding endnotes, bibliography, illustrations or other materials. Students choosing this option should form a qualifying paper committee by the end of the second semester of their first year. The Committee is composed of a major professor and a second faculty member . Members of the Committee are faculty in the School of Art and Art History, of which one must be tenured or tenure- earning. The M ajor Professor will usually be the professor who oversaw the writing of the original seminar paper. St udents pursuing this option download the relevant form at http://www.arts.usf.edu/absolutenm/articlefiles/20 -GradComApptFrm.pdf . Students are responsible for collecting committee members' signatures. The M.A. Graduate Coordinator must authorize all committee assignments with his/ her signature When submitting drafts of the qualifying paper to committee members, students must allow faculty members two weeks to read any gi ven version. Remember that first drafts usually have to be extensively revised, often several times, before the qualifying paper is accepted. Faculty are not normally available during the summer to read qualifying paper drafts. The qualifying paper commi ttee must approve the qualifying paper before the student can graduate. Qualifying papers must be submitted two weeks before the last day of classes of the semester in which the student wishes to graduate. The major professor, in consultation with the oth er faculty member , notifies the Academic Advisor of the School of Art and Art USF Graduate Catalog 2018- 2019 Art Histo ry (M.A.) 767 http://www.arts.usf.edu/ History of approval of the paper before the end of the semester. If a paper is not approved, the student may revise and resubmit it a second time. It is the student's responsibi lity to stay abreast of Office of Graduate Studies deadlines and registration requirements in the final semester, which are available online at http://www.grad.usf.edu . Thesis option Requires six seminars in art history (24 hours), with 8 additional hours of electives, plus 6 hours of thesis writing (4 hours in the third semester and 2 hours in the fourth and final semester). Students writing the thesis should work with faculty during the second semester to begin de veloping potential topics. By the end of the first year, students who wish to write the thesis should decide on a thesis topic with a major professor from the art history faculty. The topic is usually related to research done in a seminar. During the foll owing summer students prepare the thesis proposal. The proposal should define a significant research problem and explain how the topic has the potential to contribute to scholarship in the field; it must include a research plan and a critical review of th e scholarly literature on the subject area. Thesis proposals will be presented to faculty and fellow graduate students in a public forum at the beginning of the third semester. Each presentation is followed by discussion, which provides an opportunity fo r students to receive suggestions and recommendations from faculty and peers. If the proposal is declined, the student will be eligible to pursue a Qualifying Paper. If the art history faculty approves the thesis topic , the student should form a thesis co mmittee by the end of the semester in which they have successfully proposed a thesis topic, and have thereby achieved thesis candidacy. The Committee is composed of at least two members and the Major Professor . The Major Professor and at least one other committee member must be chosen from tenured or tenure -earning art history faculty, or otherwise as approved by the Graduate Coordinator of the Art History Major. Students forming the thesis committee download the relevant form at http://www.arts.usf.edu/absolutenm/articlefiles/20 -GradComApptFrm.pdf . Students are responsible for collecting committee members' signatures. The M.A. Graduate Coordinator must authorize all committee assignments with his/her signature. While moderate in length and considerably more limited in scope than a doctoral dissertation, the M.A. thesis must demonstrate the student's ability to do original, independent research of publishable quality. The thesis should be approximately 35 -40 typed pages of text - the usual length of a journal article -- excluding notes, bibliography, illustrations or other materials. When submitting drafts of the thesis to committee members, students must allow facul ty members two weeks to read any given version. Remember that first drafts will have to be extensively revised several times before the thesis is accepted. Faculty are not normally available during the summer to read thesis drafts. The thesis committee m ust approve the final thesis before the student may schedule a date for the M.A. thesis defense. The examining committee will consist of the thesis committee and at least two additional questioners who are chosen by the student in consultation with the th esis committee. Students should keep in mind that the questioners must also be allowed two weeks to read the draft of the thesis after it is accepted for the defense by the thesis committee. The oral defense is open to the public. No defenses are schedule d during the summer. Immediately after the orals, the examining committee meets to determine whether the student has passed the oral examination and whether the thesis is acceptable in its current form. NOTE: It is usually necessary to make some changes in the thesis after the oral de fense. Allow at least one week between the oral exam and the Office of Graduate Studies deadline so that you will be able to make the changes. Ideally, the student will complete the thesis and submit it in the fourth semest er. It is the student's responsibility to stay abreast of Office of Graduate Studies deadlines and registration requirements in the final semester. Check with the USF Office of Graduate Studies for specific deadlines and requirements for the M.A. thesis and graduation. These are available online at http://www.grad.usf.edu/ETD -res-main.php. All theses must be submitted electronically. Transfer of Credit There is no automatic transfer of non- degree seeking student credit or graduate credit earned at ot her institutions or from other graduate majors in the University towards M.A. degree requirements. The School of Art and Art History has designated a six hour limit on all credit taken as non- degree seeking student status. Any transfer of credit or non- degree seeking student hours to be used toward M.A. degree requirements are only granted after a faculty review at the time the student has been accepted into the M.A. major .

They are listed with the Program or College that offers them. Courses are numbered based on content, rather than by department or program. This means that a single program may have courses in several different disciplines and may consist of courses having several different prefixes. The University reserves the right to substitute, n ot offer, and add courses and programs that are listed in this catalog. Course Levels - 0 PSAV, college prep, vocational prep 1-2 Lower -level -level 5-9 Graduate and Professional USF Graduate Course Level Variance Definitions It is expected that the 5000- 6000- 7000 courses will have distinct syllabi demonstrating different depth and breadth of the subject matter as reflected in the course requirements. The courses presuppose different audiences, and the intention is to offer them at distinct levels. 5000- 5999 Typically Introductory Graduate Level Courses 6000- 6999 Typically Master's level Courses 7000- 7999 Typically Doctoral level Courses Abbreviations used in course descriptions: G Graduate PR Prerequisite CI With the consent of the instructor CC With the consent of the chairperson of the department or program CR Co-requisite DPR Departmental Permit Required Lec Lecture Lab Laboratory Dem Demonstration Pro Problem Dis Discussion ML Master's Level GS Graduate Standing Rpt May be repeated UL Upper level S/U No grade, Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Only USF Graduate Catalog 2018- 2019 Section 2 7 - Course Information and Course Descriptions 787 http://www. grad .usf.edu/ 787 Florida's Statewide Course Numbering System Courses in this catalog are identified by prefixes and numbers that were assigned by Florida's Statewide Course Numbering System (SCNS). This numbering system is used by all public postsecondary institutions in Florida and by participating nonpublic institutions. The major purpose of this system is to facilitate the transfer of courses between participatin g institutions. Students and administrators can use the online SCNS to obtain course descriptions and specific information about course transfer between participating Florida institutions. This informat ion is at the SCNS website at http://scns.fldoe.org . Each participating institution controls the title, credit, and content of its own courses and recommends the first digit of t he course number to indicate the level at which students normally take the course. Course prefixes and the last three digits of the course numbers are assigned by members of faculty discipline committees appointed for that purpose by the Florida Department of Education in Tallahassee. I ndividuals nominated to serve on these committees are sele cted to maintain a representative balance as to type of institution and discipline field or specialization. The course prefix and each digit in the course number have a meaning in the SCNS. The listing of prefixes and associated courses is referred to as the \"SCNS taxonomy.\" Descriptions of the content of courses are referred to as \"statewide course profiles.\" Example of Course Identifier Prefix Level Code Century Digit Decade Digit Unit Digit Lab Code (first digit) (second digit) (third digit) (fourt h digit) ENC 1 1 0 1 English Lower (Freshman) Freshman Freshman Freshman No laboratory Composition Level at this Composition Composition Composition component in institution Skills Skills I this course General Rule for Course Equivalencies Equivalent courses at different institutions are identified by the same prefixes and same last three digits of the course numb er and are guaranteed to be transferable between participating institutions that offer the course, with a few exceptions, as listed below in Exceptions to the General Rule for Equivalency. For example, a freshman composition skills course is offered by 84 different public and nonpublic postsecondary institutions. Each institution uses \"ENC_101\" to identify its freshman composition s kills course. The level code is the first digit and represents the year in which students normally take the course at a specific institution. In the SCNS taxonomy, \"ENC\" means \"English Composition,\" the century digit \"1\" \"Freshman Composition, \" the decade digit \"0\" represents \"Freshman Composition Skills,\" and the unit digit \"1\" represents \"Freshman Composition Skil ls I.\" In the sciences and certain other areas, a \"C\" or \"L\" after the course number is known as a lab indicator. The \"C\" represe nts a combined lecture and laboratory course that meets in the same place at the same time. The \"L\" represents a laboratory course or the laborator y part of a course that has the same prefix and course number but meets at a different time or place. Tran sfer of any successfully completed course from one participating institution to another is guaranteed in cases where the cour se to be transferred is equivalent to one offered by the receiving institution. Equivalencies are established by the same prefix a nd last three digits and comparable faculty credentials at both institutions. For example, ENC 1101 is offered at a community college. The same cou rse is offered at a state university as ENC 2101. A student who has successfully completed ENC 1101 at a Florida College System institution is guaranteed to receive transfer credit for ENC 2101 at the state university if the student transfers. The student cannot be required to take ENC 21 01 again since ENC 1101 is equivalent to ENC 2101. Transfer credit mus t be awarded for successfully completed equivalent courses and used by the receiving institution to determine satisfaction of requirements by transfer students on the same basis as credit awarded to the native students. It i s the prerogative of the receiv ing institution, however, to offer transfer credit for courses successfully completed that have not been designated as equiva lent. NOTE : Credit generated at institutions on the quarter- term system may not transfer the equivalent number of credits to insti tutions on the semester -term system. For example, 4.0 quarter hours often transfers as 2.67 semester hours. USF Graduate Catalog 2018- 2019 Section 2 7 - Course Information and Course Descriptions 788 http://www. grad .usf.edu/ 788 The Course Prefix The course prefix is a three -letter designator for a major division of an academic discipline, subject matter area, or subcatego ry of knowledge. The prefix is not intended to identify the department in which a course is offered. Rather, the content of a course determines t he assigned prefix to identify the course.

Credit shall be awarded if the courses are judged by the appropriate statewide course numbering syst em faculty committees representing school districts, public postsecondary educational institutions, and participating nonpublic postsecondary educational institutions to be academically equivalent to courses offered at the receiving institution, including equivalency of faculty credentials, regardless of the public or nonpublic control of the previous institution. The Department of Education shall ensure that credits to be accepted by a receiving institution are generated in courses for which the faculty po ssess credentials that are comparable to those required by the accrediting association of the receiving institution. The award of credit may be limited to courses that are entered in the statewide course numbering system. Credits awarded pursuant to this s ubsection shall satisfy institutional requirements on the same basis as credits awarded to native students. Exceptions to the General Rule for Equivalency Since the initial implementation of the SCNS, specific disciplines or types of courses have been excepted from the guarantee of transfer for equivalent courses. These include courses that must be evaluated individually or courses in which the student must be evalua ted for mastery of skill and technique. The following courses are exceptions to the gen eral rule for course equivalencies and may not transfer. Transferability is at the discretion of the receiving institution. A. Courses not offered by the receiving institution. B. For courses at non -regionally accredited institutions, courses offered prior to the established transfer date of the course in question. C.
