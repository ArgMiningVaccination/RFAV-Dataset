Acupuncturists have used this herb for generations as an anti-toxin herb and now modern research confirms its clinical efficacy. An aqueous extract of the herb Ban Zhi Lian (Scutellaria barbata) was found to have \"anti-proliferative gene expression responses in human breast and prostate cancer cells\" by researchers at the University of California at Berkeley, Department of Molecular and Cell Biology.1 Researchers at the Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Department of Oncology concluded that Ban Zhi Lian \"has antitumor activity and seems to be safe and effective for the use of anti-tumor therapy.\"2 Other research finds that Ban Zhi Lian \"exhibited potential anticancer activity... through induction of apoptosis.\"3 This is a small sampling of the research into the anti-cancer properties of this herb. Clinically, Ban Zhi Lian is often combined with another herb, Bai Hua She She Cao, in the treatment of lung and gastrointestinal cancers. Often, acupuncturists administer the herbs as a supplement to conventional chemotherapy. Although the term acupuncturist is used in the USA, practitioners are often trained in both Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture as part of the acupuncture education program of training. In many states such as California and Massachusetts, herbal training towards a minimum of a master's degree in Chinese medicine and continuing education CEUs are required to obtain and maintain an acupuncture license. Acupuncturists are best known for treating the side effects of cancer such as pain or the side effects of chemotherapy such as hair loss, nausea, stress, exhaustion and insomnia. In states such as California, it is forbidden for acupuncturists to mention any Chinese medicine 'cure' for cancer. Ban Zhi Lian has never been purported to be a cure but it is a helpful tool in the fight against cancer. Its antineoplastic (anti-cancer cell) properties help fight tumor growth.
