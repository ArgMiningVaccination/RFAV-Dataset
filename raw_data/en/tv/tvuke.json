Researchers analyzed data from 9000 children from the Child Complementary and Alternative Medicine File of the 2012 National Health Interview Survey. In particular they looked at several major areas of CAM: - Alternative medical systems, which includes acupuncture - Biologically-based therapies such as herbal supplements - Multivitamins and multiminerals - Manipulative and body-based therapies, such as those conducted by a chiropractor - Mind-body therapies, which includes yoga They found that children who had ever used an alternative medical system had a 33% rate of influenza vaccination, compared with a 43% rate among those who had never used such a form of CAM. The most common types of alternative medical systems were homeopathy, which was used by 3.2% of participants, and naturopathy, used by 0.70% of participants. Of the manipulative and body-based therapies examined by the researchers, chiropractic manipulation had a prevalence of 5.49%, making it the most often used form of those therapies. The investigators suggest that the connection between lower influenza vaccination rates and use of certain forms of CAM may be due to these types of CAM being more likely to involve practitioners who oppose vaccination or support alternative schedules. However, most patients do not disclose CAM use to their physicians. \"There is opportunity for US public health, policy, and conventional medical professionals and educators to improve vaccine uptake and child health by better engaging both CAM and conventional medicine practitioners-in-training, parents of children using particular domains of CAM, and the CAM practitioners advising them,\" the study's authors concluded.
