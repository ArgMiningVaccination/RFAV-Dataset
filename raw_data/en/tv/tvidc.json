My current research projects include a number of studies evaluating magnet ingestions in children, as well as devices for use in minor procedures, such as lumbar puncture and ear foreign body removal. I recently completed a role as the site principal investigator on three industry-sponsored multi-center studies: a randomized clinical trial evaluating a new therapy for pediatric asthma; validation of a clinical score for asthma; and a study of the epidemiology of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), an important cause of wheezing illness in infants. I have authored two chapters on the management of croup, and numerous peer-reviewed publications involving the care of the febrile infant, electronic decision support, and the management of foreign bodies. - Research Focus Area - Chronic Conditions / Special Health Care Needs, Translational research, observational studies, investigator-initiated interventional studies, Quality Improvement, Therapeutic Trials "}
