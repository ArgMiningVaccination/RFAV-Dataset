You can still ask your GP for this vaccine until your 25th birthday. - 2 doses of the [MMR vaccine](/conditions/vaccinations/mmr-vaccine/)- as there are outbreaks of mumps and measles at universities. If you have not previously had 2 doses of MMR, you can still ask your GP for the vaccine. - the [HPV vaccine](/conditions/vaccinations/hpv-human-papillomavirus-vaccine/)- which helps protect against genital warts and cancers caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV), such as cervical cancer. Non-urgent advice: Speak to your GP surgery if: - you think you or your child have missed any vaccinations - you or your child have a vaccination appointment - but you've missed it or cannot attend Your GP surgery can book or rearrange an appointment. It's best to have vaccines on time, but you can still catch up on most vaccines if you miss them. Page last reviewed: 9 August 2023 Next review "}
