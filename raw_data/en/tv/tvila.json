Each presenter will bring a case for the interdisciplinary case groups for open discussion and sharing of insights. The case discussions will be followed by mid-day talks to develop practical therapeutic imaginations. We will illuminate these topics through singing, therapeutic artistic activities, and an interactive workshop titled \"AnthropoSophia: Connecting Social and Individual Health\", led by Raphael Knauf MD and Jan Goeschel, PhD. The goal of this workshop is to strengthen our ideal intentions of working with solidarity, freedom and equality in medicine and therapies. The conference is open for members of the AHA, as well as non-members who are familiar with anthroposophy.
