But that does not stop people from using them. Before you consider drinking Yogi Detox Tea, you should understand that herbal does not mean safe especially if it is used in high dosages. You may feel side effects just as you would with drugs or medications. Function Detox teas like Yogi Tea claim that they are an internal body cleansing agent to improve kidney and liver function by enhancing the body's ability to eliminate impurities and harmful toxins by using certain herbs. There is no scientific evidence to support these claims and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not regulate herbal supplements. Ingredients According to the manufacturers of Yogi Tea the active ingredients in their detox tea are burdock, organic dandelion, juniper berry, ginger, skullcap leaf, cardamom seed, Japanese honeysuckle flower and a variety of other herbs. The manufacturer does not list the amounts of the varying herbs; therefore it is unknown what quantities of any particular herb may be in the detox tea. Herbal Effects Most of the herbs used in the detox are considered safe in small amounts. Dandelion for instance, according to the National Center for Complimentary and Alternative Medicine, has been historically used as a liver and kidney tonic with only rare side effects such as an upset stomach. If you have a gallbladder disease or blocked bile ducts, then you should not use dandelion. Burdock, another herb that is used has been associated with increasing or decreasing blood sugar levels and decreased heart rate in some instances. Precautions Many people make the mistake in thinking that just because something is natural or herbal than it must be safer than standard drugs that are prescribed by your doctor with all the side effects and recalls that are constantly in the news. Herbal supplements also have precautions, especially if you are taking any type of medication. Herbs can react adversely with certain medications and even some dietary supplements you may be taking. You should consult with a medical professionals before using herbal remedies like Yogi Detox Tea. Researching what goes into your body even if it is \"natural\" should be something you do for your own protection and knowledge. The National Center for Complimentary and Alternative Medicine provides a good start for understanding the use of herbs and herbal supplements. Warnings It is possible to have an allergic reaction with any herb. If you experience stomach cramping, diarrhea or any other adverse reactions stop drinking the Yogi Detox Tea. Some of the herbs used in this detox tea are used as diuretics which allows water to move quickly and easily through the body but that does not mean that they are removing any toxins or poisons, they are just increasing the output of water. Make sure you are drinking plenty of water to avoid dehydration. Drink the detox tea in moderation and do not go beyond the recommended dosage. Also eat a healthy diet while using the tea.
