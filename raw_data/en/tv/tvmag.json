Common triggers for seasonal allergies include pollen, mold, dust and plants. And with those annoying air particles comes the even worse symptoms. Allergies can cause disruptive symptoms such as a sore throat, inflamed sinuses and sneezing, which can ruin a vacation. The stress of having seasonal allergies can rise when you're traveling and unsure how they will affect your trip. If you struggle with pollen or other natural allergies that are more prevalent during certain seasons, here are some steps you can take to assure your vacation won't be overshadowed by them: Prepare Before you go on your trip, take a look at the current [pollen forecast](https://weather.com/health/allergy) to appropriately plan. Also check to see what time of year the pollen count is at its lowest. If you're able to schedule a trip during that window, it will reduce your symptoms while visiting. But, if you're unable to change the schedule, keep an eye on the forecast and plan your medications appropriately. If you have severe seasonal allergies that you think will greatly affect the trip or vacation experience, try to go to a location that will better work with your allergies. Go skiing in spring, go out to sea, or go to the beach. All these are some safer options. Medication If traveling abroad, you might not have access to pharmacy or doctor. This means you'll have to stock up and bring a big enough supply of your allergy medicine for the duration of your stay. Depending on the country you're traveling to, these drugs may not be available to you. Pack medicine such as antihistamines and inhalers into your carry on bag to ensure that they do not get lost in your luggage. If you're worried about these items being confiscated, have your doctor write a note beforehand to get these items through security. During the Transportation Stuck in an enclosed space with dozens of stranger, the air supply isn't going to be great on an airplane. Be conscious of this challenge and plan for the increased allergy issues that come with [cabin pressure](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=60597). The air on planes is incredibly dry, so try to bring nasal mist to help keep nasal passages moist. You might also take pain relief for your sinuses as the air pressure can cause pain. A natural antihistamine like lavender essential oil could also help open up the sinuses. While on a plane, you should also make sure to constantly ingest liquids; hot drinks will help even more, especially if you have a sore throat. There may be less air pressure in a car, but road trips can also create allergy issues. For a road trip, try turning the air on for ten minutes before entering your car. This will help clean out dust and mold from the air vents. While There Upon finally reaching the destination, there are still a few more steps to battle seasonal allergies. If you are doing outdoor activities, try to avoid them during peak pollen count times (usually between 5-10 a.m.). Dry, windy days can also negatively affect allergies. Also, while at your destination, try to shower at least once a day to get rid of any pollen that may have gotten into your hair. If you sleep before washing out the pollen, those particles can stick to the pillow. You'll breathe in the pollen all night, likely making those symptoms even worse. Also, if it's available, turn on air conditioning in your hotel or room. This will greatly reduce pollen counts and outside triggers.
