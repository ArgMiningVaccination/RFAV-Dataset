According to Industry data, Cleansing Cocktails make up a $5 billion business, expected to grow by 8 % this year. Much more than any Cleansing tonic, or cleansing supplements, I recommend to clean up your diet! The Dirty Dozen The Environmental Working Group (an organization of scientists, researchers, and policymakers) puts together two lists \"The Dirty Dozen\" and \"The Clean 15\" to help consumers know when they should buy organic and when it is unnecessary. These lists were compiled by the USDA on the amount of pesticide residue found in non-organic fruits and vegetables after they had been washed. What Should We Eat? At SIMPLIFY, we understand that \"eating\" is a very personal matter. We all remember the foods that we grew up with, that give us comfort; we enjoy traditional foods with many memories of family gatherings. Eating is personal! Some of us assimilate raw foods better, some feel more energized from cooked foods. Some like a larger amount of complex carbohydrates (unrefined carbohydrates), some of us feel better with less. There is no one-size-fits-all solution! Eating, digesting and assimilating the nutrients we need, is Bio-Individual! Eat More Fruits and Vegetables! Small steps can go a long way when trying to implement healthy changes to your lifestyle. Start introducing more produce to your diet, and you will soon feel the difference in your energy levels! Dieting versus Eating Healthy Dieting versus eating natural, nutrient dense foods: Most weight loss plans require you to follow some type of diet that include a special twist in the hope to find it new and interesting to make you willing to follow the regimen for some initial period of weight loss. The Health Benefits of Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice Many of my clients start their day with a glass of orange juice from a container. Please take some time to let me convince you about the health benefits of adding a daily routine to your health, and start squeezing your own juice fresh. Fresh oranges are the most convenient form of fruit drinks available today. Slice an orange in half, and you have an instant nature drink! The benefits of freshly squeezed orange juice are far above the commercially prepared substitutes. The Magic Mineral Broth At a conference, I had the pleasure of meeting Rebecca Katz, nutrition pioneer, and author of several cookbooks. \"Nutritional Healing\" is a fascinating topic. My primary interest is for my clients to receive the nutrients they need, through the most natural, healthiest food choices! Integrative Healthcare - Take Charge of Your Own Health! We, at Simplify, do feel part of a movement, where we, as individuals, have to take charge of our own health and well-being. This movement is called Integrative Healthcare, where all healthcare providers will come together as a team to complement each other for the well-being of their clients/patients. Integrative Medicine, according to Dr. Andrew Weil, Director of the Integrative Medicine program at the University of Arizona, is \"...based on a physician/patient partnership within which conventional and alternative modalities are used to stimulate the body's natural healing potential. It neither rejects conventional medicine nor uncritically accepts alternative practices.\" Complimentary treatments that have a positive impact on healing and recovery or simply help clients/patients to relax and feel more balanced, are becoming more acknowledged as our responsibility to stay healthy. Is Oatmeal Gluten-Free? According to the University of Chicago Celiac Disease Center, yes - oats are technically gluten-free since they aren't a type of wheat, barley, or rye grain, the three groups of whole grains that naturally contain the protein gluten. Instead of containing gluten, oats have a protein called avenins. Oats are considered safe for all people with a gluten allergy, and seem to be easier for most people to digest. Reports show that \"perhaps less than 1 percent of Celiac clients show a reaction to a large amount of oats in their diets,\" as long as that person is careful about how the oats were manufactured and processed. Can Sweet Potatoes Fight Against Diabetes? What's New and Beneficial About Sweet Potatoes? - Orange-fleshed sweet potatoes may be one of nature's unsurpassed sources of beta-carotene. Several recent studies have shown the superior ability of sweet potatoes to raise our blood levels of vitamin A. This benefit may be particularly true for children. In several studies from Africa, sweet potatoes were found to contain between 100-1,600 micrograms (RAE) of vitamin A in every 3.5 ounces; enough, on average, to meet 35% of all vitamin A needs, and in many cases enough to meet over 90% of vitamin A needs (from this single food alone).
