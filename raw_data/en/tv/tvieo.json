The Vedas include almost every aspect of life i.e. health, astrology, army, poetry and spiritual living and behavior. We find the roots of modern medicine in the Vedas. The gveda, a compilation of verse on the nature of existence, is the oldest compilation of any knowledge system. The gveda refers to the cosmology known as Skhya which lies at the base of both yurveda and Yoga, contains verses on the nature of health and disease, pathogenesis and principles of treatment. 5 : : : According to the yurveda, the body is comprised of three primary forces, termed Doa i.e. (i) Vyuh (ii) Pitta, and (iii) Kapha. The state of equilibrium between the doa is perceived as a state of health; the state of imbalance is disease. Each Doa represents characteristics derived from the five elements of space, air, fire, water, and earth. Herbs are used to heal the diseases of the mind and body and to foster longevity. Angahdayam lists eight branches of the yurveda. They are- - Kya Cikits (Internal Medicine), - Bla Cikits (Treatment of Children / Pediatrics), - Graha Cikits (Demonology / Psychology), - Urdhvnga Cikits (Treatment of the clavicle), - alya (Surgery), - Damtra Cikits (Toxicology), - Jar Cikits (Geriatrics, Rejuvenation), and - Va Cikits (Aphrodisiac therapy). The Vedic priests were not only performing religious rites and ceremonies, they were also Vaidyas (physicians of yurveda). The sage-physician-surgeons were realized health as an integral part of spiritual life. It is said that they received the knowledge of healing, prevention, longevity and surgery through divine revelation. These revelations were transcribed from the oral tradition into book form at a much later date. What is fascinating is yurveda's use of herbs, foods, aromas, gems, colors, yoga, mantras, lifestyle and surgery. There were two main schools of yurveda; treya- the school of physicians, and Dhanvantari- the school of surgeons. These two schools made yurveda a more scientifically verifiable and classifiable medical system. In Indian tradition, Brahm is known as the creator of the world. Many diseases also emerged with the advent of life on the earth. To protect / cure from such diseases Brahm passed the knowledge of yurveda to Prajpati. Later knowledge passed on to to and Krapi. contributed for the development of yurveda. Agnivea was the most intelligent and his compilation is known as \"Agnivea Sahit\" or \"Agnivea Tantra\". crya Caraka edited this text and added some commentary, which was later known as \"Caraka Sahit\". Suruta, a student of Dhanvantari has contributed greatly in the area of surgery (alya Cikits) through his text known as Suruta Sahit. However, there were many parallel streams of knowledge (medical) practiced at that time, are evident through the texts like Kyapa Sahit (by Kayapa), lkya Tantra (by Nimi There are two main re-organizers of yurveda whose works are available today - Caraka and Suruta. Caraka Sahit is mainly a medical text while Suruta Sahit concentrates on surgery. The third major treatise is called the Angahdayam by Vgbhaa, which is a concise version of the works of Caraka and Suruta. Ancient Indian healing system used mix of religious practices with secular medicine. They used incantations in combination with administering drugs and performing operations. It involved observing the patient as well as observing their natural environment. They also used an extensive range of medicine; Caraka Sahit listed 500 medicines while Suruta Sahit mentioned over 700 vegetable-based medicines. Indian medicine relied on the concept of marmas, which identified a series of points where an injury or damage could be fatal. Surgery was widely used and surgeons performed the most elaborate operations. Over 121 different steel instruments were used to sew up wounds, drain fluid, remove kidney stones and to perform plastic surgery. yurveda is practiced in different parts of India since Vedic times. Over 70 percent of Indian population is dependent on this ancient knowledge of healing. The fundamental principles of yurveda are at the heart of many \"alternative\" therapies used in the West, today. Through this portal, an attempt has been made to establish the relevance of this ancient system of medicine in today's world, by publishing the available texts and researches (analysis of the knowledge using modern scientific methods and standards practiced worldwide), in public domain.
