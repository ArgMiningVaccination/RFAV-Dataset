It's a question that sprung up again with the d eath last month of Steve Jobs, Apple's iconic founder and innovator-in-c hief. What was it about Jobs and the company he founded that nurtured so m uch innovation and creativity, and can it really be brought into pharma-c eutical innovation?J obs outlined his personal trajectory in a tale of passion and loss in his 2 005 commencement address at Stanford University. His path to Apple s tarted when he dropped out of Reed College in order to be free to take any c ourse that interested him rather than follow a prescribed curriculum lead-i ng to a specific major. This in turn led him to a calligraphy course that, h e says, informed his ethic of blending aesthetics and technology to create A pple products. But as with many great relationships, what started out with s o much generative promise ended in heartbreak\u2014Jobs's specifically, when a t the age of 30 he was asked to leave the company he'd founded. \" I'd been rejected,\" he said, \"but I was still in love.\" That first loss, pain-f ul as it may have been also relieved Jobs of the \"heaviness of being suc-c essful,\" and replaced it \"with the lightness of being a beginner again.\" Jobs t he beginner embarked on yet another creative period that resulted in the f ormation of Next and Pixar, which ironically, brought him back to Apple a nd it to him for yet another creative period that yielded iPods, iPhones, a nd iPads and revolutionized both the computer and the communication i ndustries. T he other great focusing event in Jobs's life, as we all now know, was t he imminence of his death from pancreatic cancer. In the face of death s aid Jobs, \"we are already naked,\" and because of which, he admonished S tanford's class of 2005 not to be \"trapped by dogma, which is living with t he results of other people's thinking.\" Rather, Jobs urged the graduates to f ollow their individual passions.J obs died the same week the winners of the 2011 Nobel Prizes were a nnounced, and among those winners was Ralph Steinman, a Rockefeller U niversity professor, who elucidated the biology of dendritic cells. S teinman died the same week as Jobs, just days before the Nobel announce-m ent was made. But in an interview on National Public Radio on Oct. 3, 2 011, Adam Steinman, the Nobelist's son talked about his father's passion f or his work, and his desire to \"instill a sense of excitement and discovery i n the next generation.\" R eading these stories, one might suggest, as Jobs did in his Stanford a ddress, that it's the threat of loss that should make one insist on follow-i ng their passions to discovery. But I keep thinking of one my professor's o bservation that children are the true scholars, because they want to learn e verything and are unfettered by dogma. Jobs and Steinman and other great i nnovators are the ones that, in spite of prevailing dogma, never lose their c hildlike passion for learning and exploring. So the pharmaceutical industry m ay be misguided in looking for ways to inspire innovative thinking in its s cientists. The real secret might be in not wringing it out of them.

Discovery PipelineM icrobubbles Deliver A cross the Blood-Brain BarrierU ltrasound-activated microbubbles can be u sed to transport large molecules across the b lood-brain-barrier (BBB) in mice without d amage to neural tissue or microvasculature, a s presented in the Oct. 4, 201 1 issue of t he Proceedings of the National Academy of S ciences. The tightly regulated BBB presents a c hallenge for delivery of both small-m olecule and large-molecule therapeutics t o the central nervous system. The Columbia Un iversity authors demonstrated how the b arrier could be breached noninvasively us ing microbubble carriers. Microbubbles a re stable bubbles with diameters of l ess than 10 uM composed of a lipid or p olymer shell that incorporates a therapeutic, a nd a gas core. The microbubbles are d elivered systemically, then activated by l ocally-applied ultrasound pulses that cause r elease of the therapeutic only at the site of a ctivation. It is thought that the ultrasound c auses the bubbles to expand and contract, a nd thereby forces them through the capillary w alls. Calibrating the ultrasound pulses to m aximize delivery while minimizing damage t o the microvasculature and surrounding n eural tissue was the challenge addressed i n the study. Four different ultrasound pulse p arameters were varied systematically: peak-r arefactional pressure, frequency (within the p ulse), pulse length, and pulse repetition f requency. The authors identified a minimum p eak-rarefactional pressure required for BBB d isruption, and found short pulses delivered i n bursts were most effective at depositing f luorescently-tagged molecules in the brain wi thout cellular disruption. Fluorescently-t agged dextran molecules as large as 7 0 kDa were delivered to the hippocampus i n mice using this method. Moreover, the d extran was homogeneously distributed at t he activation site, and occasionally uptake i nto neurons could be visualized. This m ethod offers the potential to deliver large-m olecule therapeutics noninvasively to one of t he ource: J.J. Choi et al., Proc. 08 (40) 16539--6544 Report f rom RussiaF oreign bio/pharmaceutical c ompanies, including many o f the leading global players i n patented and generic d rugs, are starting to invest h eavily in Russia under th e expectation that the c ountry will remain one of th e world's fastest growing dr ug-manufacturing m arkets. Bio/pharmaceutical sales are increasing at around three times f aster than the country's GDP. By 2016, total revenue in the Russian bio/p harmaceutical market is forecast by market researchers Frost & Sullivan to r each more than $37 billion\u2014that's 2.4 times higher than 2009 levels and e quivalent to an annual growth rate of 13.5%. T he Russian government is hoping that investments by multinational d rug companies will help modernize drug production in the country. The g overnment wants the Russian bio/pharmaceutical sector to reach Western s tandards of drug manufacture and innovation, which the industry has a l ong way to go to achieve. T he latest government initiative has been the launch of a state fund th at will invest jointly with foreign sovereign wealth and private equity f unds as much as $50 billion in priority areas such as bio/pharmaceuticals a nd healthcare. This money will supplement 120 billion RUB ($3.7 billion) o f state money announced late last year under the country's Pharma 2020 p rogram. Those funds will be allocated to upgrading bio/pharmaceutical m anufacturing, including the introduction of new production technologies i n more than 160 facilities.T he initial aim behind the Pharma 2020 strategy is to raise the share o f domestic production in Russia from a meager 20% of total drug sales t o 50%. A separate goal aims to increase domestic production of vital m edicines to 90% by the end of the decade.P rime Minister Vladimir Putin has warned that restrictions will be i mposed on multinational manufacturing firms, now comprising most of the t op 10 drug suppliers in the country, if they do not set up local production f acilities and transfer their technologies into Russia.\" The Pharma 2020 goals can be achieved only if the domestic bio/p harmaceutical industry becomes innovative through partnerships with i nternational bio/pharmaceutical companies and Russian academia,\" says O leg Korzinov, director of the Center for Development at the Moscow-based P harmaceutical Cluster Northern, the country's first innovative pharma clu ster. T he drugs of international bio/pharmaceutical companies with a local m anufacturing presence are likely to be favored by an expanded state-r eimbursement scheme covering high-cost therapies. \"A local plant will b e the entry ticket into the Russian market and an improved healthcare s ystem,\" explains Martin Schlow, a Russian pharmaceuticals specialist at the m anagement-consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).A s a result, there have been a series of recent announcements by top g lobal players, including Novartis, AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, and P fizer, about investing in manufacturing and R&D projects in the country. Discovery Pipeline W in Initiative /Getty Images 10 BioPharm International www.biopharminternational.com November 2011Global News FDA Outlines Strategy to S pur Biomedical InnovationI n response to concerns about the sustainability of US drug-d evelopment efforts, FDA has released a report, titled Driving B iomedical Innovation: Initiatives to Improve Products for Patients. T he report outlines several steps that FDA will take to spur biomedical i nnovation and ensure that such innovation can be quickly translated i nto safe and effective therapies. Input used to compile the report was o btained from a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including members o f large pharmaceutical companies, small biotech companies, academic r esearchers, and patient advocacy groups.T he report outlines major areas in which FDA will be launching i nitiatives to address feedback obtained from stakeholders. They include: Rebuilding FDA's small business outreach services: FDA will establish a F DA Small Business Liaison program and a Young Entrepreneurs p rogram, as well as establish a new partnership with the US Small B usiness Administration. Building infrastructure to drive and support personalized medicine: F DA will invest in regulatory science and clarify agency policies to s upport the emerging field of personalized medicine. Creating a rapid drug-development pathway for important t argeted therapies: To clarify the pathway for rapid development o f promising therapies, FDA will host a series of scientific m eetings intended to achieve a common understanding of steps n eeded when an investigational drug being studied for a serious d isease shows exceptional promise during the early stages of de velopment. Harnessing the potential of data mining and information-sharing w hile protecting patient privacy: FDA is rebuilding its IT and data a nalytic capabilities and establishing science enclaves that will a llow for the analysis of large, complex datasets while preserving p atient privacy. Training the next generation of innovators: FDA is designing a new F uture Innovators Program under which promising candidates w ill be brought into the agency for training and experience. T his program will provide FDA with important outside expertise a nd perspective while equipping these innovators with highly m arketable skills and experience. Streamlining and reforming FDA regulations: The agency is r eviewing its current regulations to identify burdensome, unclear, o bsolete, ineffective, or inefficient regulations.T he report comes at a time when new drug applications have f allen to record lows, despite continuous increases in research and d evelopment budgets. FDA hopes that the initiatives outlined in thi s report will promote innovation, help developers overcome ch allenges in product development, and speed the delivery of s afe and effective treatments to patients. In her introduction to th e report, FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg says, \"It is i mportant to note that while these are important first steps to a ddress the immediate concerns before us, this is an ongoing i nitiative at the agency and will be expanded beyond the reforms o utlined in this document.\" \u2014 Amy RitterIn addition, leading generic-drug producers s uch as Dr. Reddy's Laboratories and Teva P harmaceuticals are strengthening their R ussian manufacturing capabilities.T he Russian government initially e xpects foreign companies to help bolster i nnovation in drugs but ultimately wants th ose companies to assist in giving the c ountry a platform for becoming a major p roducer of APIs. E stablishing such a position will be a big t ask because currently only 15% of APIs in m edicines on the Russian market are made i n the country. More important, only 10% of th e country's 400 bio/pharmaceutical plants c omply with GMP standards. M any of the multinational companies s etting up plants in Russia are using c entralized API production. \"Due to reasons o f economies of scale, all active bio/p harmaceutical ingredients will continue t o be manufactured at our large active i ngredient plants in Denmark,\" explains M ike Rulis, head of communications at Novo N ordisk, the Danish insulin maker, which is b uilding an insulin plant in Russia's Kaluga re gion.T he largest barriers to API production i n Russia include a \"lack of a long tradition o f API exports, absence of binding rules p ertaining to approval of the production a nd the quality control of drugs [and] a l ow level of training of specialists in in ternational requirements like GMP ,\" says M onika Stefanczyk, head bio/pharmaceutical m arket analyst at PMR, a market researcher i n Kracow, Poland. N onetheless, PMR believes that with the a id of the Pharma 2020 program and a new l aw-making GMP certification that becomes o bligatory by 2014, Russia has the potential t o become an alternative center to India and C hina for API production.P rogress will depend on how long R ussia takes to establish a thriving bio/p harmaceutical manufacturing market, w hich currently is relatively small in per c apita terms. \"The limited affluence of R ussian society restricts drug consumption a nd this is not expected to change in the n ear future,\" says Dominika Grzywinska, a F rost & Sullivan research analyst. \u2014 Sean Milmo is a freelance writer b ased in Essex, UK. N ovember 2011 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm International 11Global News Beat D igital Vision/Getty ImagesThe outcry from physicians, pharmacists, a nd patients over disruptions in the sup-p ly of vital medicines to treat cancer, pain, a nd other serious conditions is drawing attention o n Capitol Hill and throughout the healthcare s ystem. Oncologists cannot obtain widely-used c hemotherapies to treat seriously ill patients. S urgeons are postponing operations because th ey lack key anesthetics and pain medications. D octors are struggling to obtain vital parenterals f or premature babies and for patients requiring i nfusion. And dozens of clinical trials have been h alted because investigators don't have adequate s upplies of cancer drugs used as components of t reatment arms or as controls. W hile there always have been periodic drug s hortages, the problem has become much more a cute in the past two years. The main culprit a ppears to be drug-manufacturing and supply-c hain failings, particularly related to the produc-t ion of generic sterile injectables. Decisions by f irms to exit certain low-profit markets often l eave only one or two producers for a widely-used p arenteral or other product. Some manufactur-e rs have had to halt production due to problems m eeting GMPs. Such developments raise charges t hat too-strict FDA oversight aggravates the prob-l em\u2014or that industry negligence and b usiness practices put the public health a t risk. Another possibility is that poli-c ies and practices that drive down r eimbursement for old-line generics d iscourages industry investment in cer-t ain therapeutic categories. T hese issues made headlines in S eptember as Congressional commit-t ees held hearings on the drug short-a ge crisis and broader pharmaceutical s upply-chain problems. An FDA public w orkshop on Sept. 26, 2011, provided a f orum for health professionals, patient advocates, drug distributors and manufacturers t o air concerns and propose remedies for short d rug supplies. The resulting publicity has boosted C ongressional interest in legislation to address p harmaceutical supply-chain issues in general, a nd the drug shortage situation in particular. FDA h as prepared a report analyzing steps it can take t o tackle shortages with its current limited author-i ty, and the Government Accountability Office ( GAO) is examining the causes and responses to t he drug-shortage crisis. G ettinG worseP olicymakers may take action because, despite e xtensive FDA efforts, \"drug shortages are get-t ing worse,\" said Douglas Throckmorton, deputy d irector of FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and R esearch (CDER), at the FDA workshop. The agency r ecorded 178 drug shortages in the US in 2010, u p from 157 in 2009\u2014and much more than the 50 -60 per-year range of previous years, reported E dward Cox, coordinator of CDER's drug-shortage p rogram. The problem is even more serious when l ooking at all drugs and biologics: the University o f Utah Drug Information Service recorded 210 s hortages this year as of mid-September, slated to s urpass last year's total 211 short-supply problems. A nd because supply problems often last more than a y ear, some 260 active shortages are in the Utah t racking system. M oreover, 74% of the shortages reported to FDA l ast year involved sterile injectables\u2014and almost a ll of them for \"medically necessary\" drugs, noted H oward Koh, assistant secretary for health in the U S Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS), at a September hearing before the House E nergy and Commerce Health subcommittee. S hortages in parenterals have taken a toll on h ospitals and clinics: a survey by the American H ospital Association in June 2011, found that vir-t ually all hospitals have experienced at least one Drug Shortages Create Crisis fo r Manufacturers, RegulatorsC lamor mounts over compromised care an d rising costs due to lack of crucial therapies.

F DA also has approved tempo-r ary importation of unapproved s ources to fill supply gaps, a strat-e gy that helped alleviate shortages t his year in several cancer drugs. APP P harmaceuticals worked with FDA to reduce a shortage of the widely used an esthetic propofol by importing the p roduct from Germany.U nfortunately, FDA often lacks i nformation on looming shortages b ecause, under current law, only sole-s ource manufacturers of critical med-i cines have to notify FDA of plans t o discontinue production. Some c ompanies voluntarily inform FDA o f problems likely to lead to short s upplies, but most do not, and often t he information comes in too late for ti mely resolution.T o remedy this limitation, C ongress is looking to enact legisla-t ion that would require six-months a dvance notification of production c hanges for a broad range of pre-s cription drugs. Rep. Diana DeGette ( D-CO) has bipartisan support for l egislation in the House, and Sens. A my Klobuchar (D-MN), and Robert C asey (D-PA) lead the early-notifica-t ion campaign in the Senate. They p ropose leeway for manufacturers w ho show that a manufacturing p roblem could not be anticipated, as w ell as penalties for failure to comply. A r elated proposal requires manu-f acturers to inform FDA of situations t hat make a product vulnerable to s hortages, such as a single API source, t o highlight the need for back-up em ergency sources. A lthough advance notifica-t ion may help FDA head off some s hortages, the danger is that wider r elease of such information could l ead to hoarding and price goug-i ng. Gray-market profiteers are i nundating health professionals w ith faxes and phone calls offer-i ng scarce drugs at huge markups. R ep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, t op Democrat on the House O versight and Government Reform C ommittee, launched an investiga-t ion of secondary distributors last m onth, seeking information on s ources and profits for certain drugs. H is targets include high-priced offers o f leukemia treatment cytarabine b y Allied Medical Supply (Florida); Superior Medical Supply (Colorado) o ffers for paclitaxel; Premium Health S ervices (Maryland) sales of leucov-o rin; fluorouracil offers from PRN harmaceuticals eliance Wholesale (Florida) market-i ng of magnesium sulfate. T o avoid profiteering, FDA wants t o be informed by manufacturers of possible shortage situations, but d oesn't necessarily want to make t hat information public right away, n oted Sandra Kweder, deputy direc-t or of CDER's Office of New Drugs at t he House hearing. The agency first w ants to assess if the problem is real, i ts likely impact, and what actions c an be taken to mitigate difficulties. \" Early notification to FDA is a very u seful tool,\" said Kweder, \"but it's d ifferent from early publication.\"A dvance notification is not al ways possible. FDA officials con-c ede that many manufacturing p roblems cannot be anticipated ( e.g., equipment breakdowns and p lant fires, and earthquakes, volca-n oes, and other natural disasters)c an suddenly disrupt supplies and m aterial transport. a DDressinG p roDuCtion proBleMsM anufacturers now support s tronger early notification re quirements, largely to reduce c omplaints about industry respon-s ibility for most shortages. FDA r eports that most supply problems a rise from GMP and product qual-i ty failings, along with difficul-t ies obtaining active ingredients o r problems at a manufacturing s ite. Industry consolidation has r educed the number of generic-d rug firms making sterile inject-ab les, Cox observed at the FDA w orkshop, and it takes time for a nother manufacture to establish a f acility to produce these more c omplex and costly medicines. R eliance on contract manufactur-e rs also has led to shortages for both b rand and generic drugs. Johnson N ovember 2011 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm International 15regulatory Beat& J ohnson faces serious supply for cancer and AIDS treat-m ent Doxil (liposomal doxorubi-c in) because its contract producer, B oehringer Ingelheim's Ben Venue L aboratories, decided to exit the CM O business. T he strong link between manu-f acturing issues and shortages raises q uestions about pharma's commit-m ent to quality production. FDA w ants manufacturers to prevent s hortages by developing continuity o f supply plans, with backup suppli-e rs and alternative production strate-g ies for critical products. Industry has a r esponsibility, FDA officials assert, t o proactively identify and promptly r esolve manufacturing problems and t o implement quality-by-design strat-e gies to prevent failures.A n alternative view is that FDA c reates shortages through overly ag gressive enforcement of manu-f acturing rules. Agency officials m aintain that they don't halt pro-du ction for minor violations, but o nly for significant problems with dr ug sterility and contamination. B efore requesting a drug recall or s eizure, they check to make sure s uch action won't precipitate a s hortage. But strong action is n eeded when inspectors find glass an d metal particles in vials and n ew impurities and degradants. In s ome cases, companies have been c ited multiple times for violations a nd still fail to correct manufactur-i ng deficiencies until threatened w ith total shutdown. F DA officials also emphasize t hat they can act fast to help bring o nline a new producer or new s upplier when needed. \"We can t urn things around in a matter o f weeks,\" Kweder insisted at the H ouse hearing, in response to man-u facturer claims that FDA requires t wo-to-three years to approve a new m anufacturing site. \"This is not b usiness as usual,\" she stated. B ut stakeholders feel there is more t hat FDA and other government agencies can do to prevent critical s hortages. FDA should revise how it c alculates risks and benefits from reg-u latory action to give greater weight t o patient safety issues that arise w ith shortages. The federal govern-m ent should establish stockpiles for m edically necessary drugs, as done f or treatments against bioterrorist a ttacks and pandemics. And antitrust o fficials should scrutinize proposed p harma company mergers to assess h ow the combination would affect lim ited drug supplies. A t the same time, there's inter-e st in providing more incentives for m anufacturers to enter depleted mar-k ets. Tax credits or rebates could spur m anufacturers to update facilities o r launch production of low-profit d rugs. Some kind of exclusivity c ould be offered for new production o f a drug in short supply. Or, generic-d rug makers might be eligible for r educed user fees on applications to p roduce hard-to-obtain medicines. S hortages in controlled sub-s tances, such as long-acting pain-k illers and drugs to treat children w ith attention deficit hyperactiv-i ty disorder, are generating calls f or the Drug Enforcement Agency ( DEA) to work more closely w ith FDA and industry to mod-i fy limits on active ingredients. M anufacturers receive DEA annual q uotas on controlled drug sub-s tances, but would like a way to t ransfer allotments when one com-p any ceases production.T here's also support for more r esources for FDA to deal effec-t ively with shortages. FDA formed t he drug-shortage program in 1999 t o manage anticipated supply dis-r uptions from the Y2K shift to the n ew millennium. But with only five s taffers and limited legal authority, F DA is hamstrung in preventing s upply disruptions. B alanCe neeDeDP arallel to the shortage crisis, FDA h as been campaigning for more authority to control counterfeiters a nd manage an increasingly global p harma supply chain. A number o f bills before Congress would e mpower FDA to deal more force-f ully with illegal imports and to a ddress drug manufacturing prob-l ems. The challenge is to ensure t hat efforts to strengthen FDA clout d oes not aggravate drug shortages. A t a hearing Sept. 14, before the S enate Health, Education, Labor, a nd Pensions (HELP) Committee, D eborah Autor, recently named F DA deputy commissioner for g lobal regulatory operations and p olicy, presented a long list of de sired policy changes to pro-m ote drug safety and level the p laying field between domestic a nd foreign manufacturers. Autor w ants mandatory recall author-i ty for drugs, power to detain and de stroy violative imports at the b order, and much stiffer penalties f or noncompliance. Drug manu-f acturers and importers would h ave to register and list manufac-t uring facilities using identifier n umbers, and importers would h ave to demonstrate that they m eet quality standards, instead o f FDA proving that they do not. A utor also seeks more authority to e nforce track-and-trace standards, w hich would help hospitals and p hysicians know whether drugs f rom unknown or unusual sources ar e legitimate. I ndustry supports many of t hese changes, but is wary that c ontinued shortages will spur c alls for even greater government i ntervention in the market. The d anger is that added rules could m ake low-profit drug markets l ess attractive to manufacturers.

Some improvements for biosimilar manu -facturers will include: improved expression systems, higher titers to reduce capacity requirements, and better assay methods to permit process monitoring, and product characterization (1). Technol ogy needsI mproved expression systems Biosimilars manufacturers will need to increase expression-system yields to enable use of smaller bioreactors and lower cost facilities. N ew expression-system technologies, along with l arge single-use bioreactors for late-stage and commer cial manufacturing, may begin to displace stainless steel for commer cial manufacture. This shift is particularly true for recombinant mono -clonal antibodies (mAbs), where a large number of b iosimilar products are in development. mAbs have high repeated dosing requirements, and large amounts of protein in the magnitude of hundreds of kilograms per year often are needed. New platforms (i.e., new host cells/organ-isms) and genetic-engineering advances applied to traditional platforms also can offer advan -tages in product yield, product quality, lower operating, purification, and infrastructure costs (2). Some newer technologies offer shorter times required to go from gene to transformed host cell line/organism to commer cial-scale manufacture. Currently , there are just a few major players promoting new expression-system technolo-gies, but there are many advances ready for adoption, adaptation, and further development. H igher titers to r educe capacity requirementsThe trend in increasing protein expression yields has had broad ramifications for biosimilars. From lowering construction re quirements to increasing bottlenecks at the do wnstream end of production, the effects of upstream advances and the availability of more varied expression systems have created options and problems not previously seen. According to a recent BioPlan Associates analysis, the overall average yield reported for commer cial mAb manufacture in 2011 is 2.18 g/L, up from 1.94 g/L in 2009 (see Figure 1) (1). It was not that long ago that mammalian-cell culture commer cial production yields were lucky to achieve 1 g/L or greater (1). The next generation of commer cial products will have an even greater average yield. For late-stage clinical manufacture, the overall average in 2011 is 2.68 g/L, up from 1.96 g/L in 2008. Although pro -tein yields over 30 g/L are being reported by expres -sion s ystem developers and early adopters, these yields are the exception, and yields for commer cial manufacture in the 5-10 g/L range are more likely in coming years (1). A nalytical technologyB etter assay methods to permit process moni-t oring and product characterization will e nable more biosimilar approvals. FDA and o ther regulatory agencies will largely rely on a nalytical data to support conclusions that b iosimilar candidates are sufficiently similar t o their marketed reference products to allow g eneric-like approvals. As such, regulators are l ikely to look for better analytic characteriza-t ion through more combinations of attributes a t greater sensitivities with multiple comple-m entary methods. For drug developers, ana-l ytical method development and testing will b e less expensive and quicker compared to reli-a nce on clinical trials to support approvals.P rogress in the development of bioprocessing-r elated assays and analytical equipment, how-e ver, has not kept up with industry demands.

Now .20 BioPharm International www.biopharminternational.com November 2011 Compliance NotesP hotodisc/Getty Images FDA regulatory oversight and enforcement h ave never been more intense or poten-t ially more costly. According to the busi-n ess intelligence firm FDAzilla, the agency is on p ace in 2011 to break its record for 483s for the t hird year in a row, issuing well over 10,000 cita-t ions a year\u2014that's one every 52 minutes. For b iopharmaceutical companies, with their highly c omplex and expensive operations, the total cost o f cGMP compliance continues to constitute a s ignificant percentage of the cost of goods sold. M eanwhile, a variety of factors have made c ompliance and quality more challenging. C omplex global supply chains increase the l ikelihood of lapses. Economic pressures to c ut costs can result in compromised pro-c esses and increased operational as well as q uality risk. Conversely, anxiety about regu-l atory action and inadequate understanding o f risk can lead to expensive gold-plating a nd redundancy in quality and compliance a ctivities. Company growth, the introduc-t ion of new products, and entry into new g lobal markets can also attract an increase in r egulatory scrutiny. In mergers and acquisi-t ions, achieving consistency in quality and c ompliance can be especially daunting, par-ti cularly when a traditional small-molecule m anufacturer acquires a biologics manufac-t urer or licenses a biologic product, thereby r equiring interaction and compliance with a t otally different branch of FDA with which it h as little or no prior experience. I n the face of these pressures, the business case f or optimal quality and compliance is compel-l ing: improved operating performance, greater p roductivity, less compliance risk, l ess rework, and fewer interruptions o f supply to the market resulting in l ost revenue. Yet, in many companies, c ompliance problems persist, often because the company culture consists more of f ighting fires than of thinking right-first-time a nd maintaining a reliable state of quality and c ompliance throughout the company. For an o rganization to do this successfully\u2014and sus-t ainably\u2014this mindset and behavior focused on q uality compliance must start at the top and be e mulated by individuals at all levels and in all f unctions within the company. Moreover, in a c ulture of quality, it is important that employees a dopt this mindset, not because they have to, b ut because they understand the importance a nd benefits of this thinking and behavior and a ppreciate the risks of not adopting it. C onsider the wildly divergent views of quality t hat were uncovered when a major biopharma-c euticals manufacturer undertook a comprehen-s ive assessment of quality across a number of its g lobal operations. The company's manufactur-i ng sites, as well as corporate headquarters, were p olled on such questions as how well leadership de fined and communicated their vision of the de sired quality culture, whether management h ad identified what was required to create and s ustain a quality culture, whether the individual h ad the tools and resources to get his or her job d one correctly, and much more. When asked w hether the right behaviors were encouraged In a culture of quality, i t is important that employees a dopt this mindset, not because t hey have to, but because they u nderstand the importance.

No t every dimension that was a ssessed turned up such diver-g ence. For example, nearly everyone a greed that they were held account-ab le for the quality of their work; a nd by overwhelming majorities t hroughout the company, respon-de nts agreed that if they observed no ncompliant activities they felt c omfortable calling it to someone's a ttention. But in many areas there w ere wide divergences and in oth-e rs\u2014like whether the company's p eople had the skills to do a high q uality job\u2014there was low favor-a bility almost across the board. It a lso emerged that the company was p erceived by employees as focusing o n short-term fixes in quality issues, a nd that personal development, t eamwork, rewards, and recognition w ere inadequate for promoting a q uality culture. Instead of a single, u nified environment, the company h ad many disparate cultures.

O n the basis of this assessment, it i s then possible to characterize the o rganization's quality culture, or m ore likely, cultures, as the basis for u ndertaking transformation.K ey elemeNTs of a su CCessful TraNsformaTIoN F rom the assessment there should e merge clear recommenda-t ions for improvement, includ-i ng quick wins, and goals for the s hort-, medium-, and long-terms. B ecause organizations differ, the p articulars of these recommenda-ti ons for transforming any given culture will vary. But there are s ome constants in the execu-t ion of such recommendations. A c entralized project management f ramework should be put in place t o help guide the planning and s uccessful implementation of the r ecommendations.T o help drive and sustain c hanges, a compelling qual-i ty culture message must be de veloped\u2014in effect, internally b randing the effort. The message m ust be clear, relevant, under-s tood by all, and designed to p rovide a point around which e very employee can rally, moti-v ating them to contribute to the e ffort. Best practices in human r esources, organizational develop-m ent, and leadership should be f ollowed in order to maximize em ployee engagement, assure e ffective rewards and recognition, p rovide timely communication o f progress, and institutionalize a ccomplishments. Finally, appro-p riate operational-excellence t ools should be used to further h elp assure successful implemen-t ation and sustainability of these e fforts\u2014as well as to provide the m etrics needed to monitor and r eport progress along the way.W hat should the resulting high p erforming, sustainable quality c ulture look like? Again, the par-t iculars may vary from company t o company, but such cultures s hould share the following charac-t eristics (see Figure 1): Employees at all levels under -s tand the organization's quality o bjectives, policies, and proce-d ures and their individual roles i n helping to achieve them. Leadership at all levels is vis -i bly engaged in supporting the de velopment of a quality cul-t ure and effectively engages a nd motivates others to do the s ame\u2014leading to self-moti-v ated accountability and sus-t ainability. Effective communication, e nterprise-wide sharing of best p ractices, engagement of all e mployees, and rewards and rec-o gnition for both teams and indi-v iduals maintain the momentum a nd enthusiasm required for sus-t ainability. T h e o r g a n i z a t i o n h i r e s p e o p l e w ho possess the quality values, n orms and work practices the c ompany desires. Staged on-boarding and technical an d quality training are deployed a t the company, business unit, f unctional area, and individual le vels. Consistent and sustainable stan -d ards of quality are defined c learly and deployed across the or ganization in conjunction with q uality and compliance systems t hat enable the organization to a chieve those standards. The organization distinguishes b etween people and processes as t he root cause of mistakes, and i nstead of blaming people looks to c orrect processes. Leaders and managers at all levels e stablish an environment of trust a nd collaboration in which chal-l enging issues can be raised with-o ut fear of reprisal. The organization institution -a lizes a process for capturing, an alyzing, and incorporating l essons learned from past suc-ce sses and failures. As the organization grows and c hanges, the quality culture is c ontinually monitored and fine-t uned to ensure that it remains e ffective and sustainable.T he journey from quality cul-t ure assessment to transforma-t ion to sustainability need not t ake long or consume massive r esources. But it does require the r ecognition that achieving qual-i ty and compliance is not a mat-t er of a discrete, isolated process b ut of the larger environment in w hich it takes place. N ovember 2011 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm International 23The Disposables Advisor A lthea TechnologiesFocus on Standardization, Q uality by Design, and Regulatory GMPH ighlights from the IBC Single-use Applications meeting, the PDA Single-use W orkshop, and the Bio-Process Systems Alliance International Summit p rovide insight into current single-use practice.I BC: foCus on standardIzatIonA t the IBC Single-Use Applications meeting, held i n Boston on Jun. 6-9, 2011, I gave a talk enti-t led \"Standardization of Single-Use...Pros, Cons a nd Possibilities.\" The topic of standardization h as appeared in many surveys as one of the top 1 0 needs for expanding single-use implementa-t ion. However, there is little definition of what i s meant by \"standardization,\" which could be a pplied to many areas.O ne particular area of discussion is the inter-c hangeability of sterile connectors to enable sin-g le-use unit systems with sterile connectors from d ifferent suppliers to be linked. In preparing my t alk, I also discovered that there is already an i nterchangeable \"standard sterile connector\" rec-o gnized by industry. If you search for this phrase i n Google Images, you'll find a photo of a tradi-ti onal two-way hosebarb fitting.I n my talk, I discussed how standardization of a dvanced sterile connectors must begin with the en d-user's company. Different systems' a ssemblers and integrators can gener-a lly source whatever advanced sterile c onnector is specified, so the first effort m ust be for the end-user's company to d ecide what its preferred sterile con-n ector will be. Since the introduction o f the first advanced sterile connector ( Pall's Kleenpak), there are now five a dditional designs on the market from o ther suppliers, but there is still no i ndustry consensus on which design m ight become the \"standard\" of the f uture. Unlike the easily copied tri-c lamp style hygienic flange connector, w hich is commonly used in stainless-s teel and some single-use systems, or th e aforementioned hosebarb fitting, m any advanced single-use sterile con-nectors incorporate patented technology and de signs. Users calling for the standardization o f sterile connectors have yet to address which de sign should dominate or why the patent-h older should license their design to competi-t ive suppliers. Once bioprocessers agree on a p referred design within their own facilities o r companies, once there is consensus on an i ndustry-preferred design (such as happened w ith tri-clamp style connectors), and once pat-e nts expire, options will appear to either \"stan-d ardize\" one of the original sterile connector de signs. The alternative is that users will prefer a n innovative proprietary design that is supe-r ior to current designs, but has yet to be seen. U ntil then, care has to be taken to avoid inhib-i ting innovation and it may not be realistic to e xpect meaningful voluntary standardization f rom the bioprocessing supply industry.O ne area where there is an industry initia-t ive underway to standardize connectors, how-e ver, is for polymeric tri-clamp style hygienic f lange seal connectors. In response to stimu-l us letter from the Bio-Process Systems Alliance ( BPSA), the American Society of Mechanical E ngineers bioprocessing equipment standards g roup (ASME-BPE) has formed a task force to r eview the requirements for single-use polymeric t ri-clamp style connectors and how the ASME-B PE Standard for stainless steel hygienic flange s eal connectors can be modified in response t o accomodate their use. Unlike their stainless s teel counterparts, single-use polymeric tri-clamp c onnectors do not require cleanable finishes, c revice-free cleanable seals, or thermal resistance a nd mechanical strength suitable for steaming i n place. They also do not require tolerances t hat are readily achieved with stainless steel on a l athe, but are difficult to achieve with plastic m olding, thus incurring unnecessary mold costs. Jerold Martin is senior vice-p resident of global scientific a ffairs at Pall Life sciences, Port W ashington, nY, and chairman o f the board and technology c ommittee at Bio-Process systems and relaxation of the A SME-BPE standard to cover the s pecific requirements for single-use p olymeric tri-clamp style connec-t ors will be a benefit to both suppli-e rs and users.P da: foCus on QBdT he PDA held its first Single-Use W orkshop in Bethesda on June 2 2-23, 2011. The main focus w as to preview the draft PDA T echnical Report on Single-use M anufacturing, which is currently i n development, and to solicit a ttendee feedback. As a member o f the PDA Single-use Task Force, I s erved on the planning committee a nd as a moderator and presenter o n the report for this workshop. T he purpose of the new report i s to provide the reader with criti-c al concepts and topics to consider w hen implementing a single-use m anufacturing strategy for drug o r vaccine production. The draft r eport discusses single-use systems t hat may be in direct or indirect c ontact with raw materials, interme-d iates, intermediate products, phar-m aceutical drug substances or the d rug product. The primary goals for de veloping a single-use manufactur-i ng strategy are customer-based and f ocus on patient safety and product a vailability, as well as product and p rocess understanding and control. T he workshop program focused o n QbD principles and other h igh-level topics to guide users o n their initial decision, selec-t ion, validation, and implemen-t ation of single-use processes. T he workshop included several o pportunities for Q&A and open d iscussion, which gave the task f orce valuable feedback from a ttendees on the draft report. Key t ake away points included: Th e r e po rt s h o ul d aim t o h el p e nd-users move away from 'gut-f eeling' to fact-based decisions. C o n t r o l o f s u p p l i e r s w i l l a l s o c ome under more scrutiny and supplier audits can be expected to i ncrease. M o r e d e t a i l o n m a t e r i a l s a n d m anufacturing methods (e.g., f ilms) may be required. Partnership between the supplier a nd end user was stressed; those c ompanies that truly embrace p artnership will be the ones most l ikely to achieve success. The industry will expect suppli -e rs to have pharmaceutical stan-d ard quality systems in place, p articularly with regard to hav-i ng an appropriate materials c hange control and change noti-f ication program. Training in single-use will also b e a key requirement/capability f rom suppliers. Clear communication strategies e ncompassing quality, trust, track r ecord, openness, and security w ill be in focus.T he target date for the report's p ublication is by the end of this c alendar year. Current activities e ntail completion of the manu-s cript incorporating the feedback f rom the June workshop and final t echnical review of completed sec-t ions. Follow-on workshops are p lanned for Uppsala, Sweden, on No v. 28, 2011 and Phoenix, AZ, on A pr. 18-19 2012 (see www.pda.org f or details).r eguLatorY gMP foCus e xPLaIned at BPsa ConferenCe T he third important single-use con-f erence of the summer was the BPSA I nternational Single-use Summit, w hich was held in Washington, D C, on Jul. 27-29 2011. This inau-g ural conference for BPSA served a s a forum for suppliers and users t o highlight the business model f or single-use. In addition to busi-n ess leader speakers, the summit f eatured J. David Doleski, the con-s umer safety officer at FDA's Center f or Drug Evaluation and Research. D oleski opened with a review of rel-e vant FDA regulations that impact single-use manufacturing, includ-i ng 21 CFR 211.65 on Equipment, 2 11.94 on Drug Containers, 6 00.3 on Biological Purity and 6 00.11 on Biological Control. E ach of these has similar state-m ents about assuring that process e quipment and containers do not a dversely affect the drug or bio-l ogical product. Additional com-p endial standards noted were USP Chapters <87> <88> o n <661> on P lastics, and <381> on Elastomers, a s well as relevant FDA guid-a nces, including cGMP for Phase I I nvestigational Drugs (July 2008) a nd Container Closure Systems f or Packaging Human Drugs and B iologics (May 1999).A dvantages of single-use manu-f acturing were recognized as: Reduced for cleaning and s terilization systems and vali-d ation Reduced risk of cross-contami -n ation Improved containment Potentially greater control over a septic operations (as facilitated w ith sterile connectors/discon-n ectors and tube welders/sealers). D oleski's talk continued with an e xcellent overview of topics that s hould be incorporated in process d ocumentation and FDA filings. I nitially highlighted were consider-a tions for vendor partnerships and m aterials control, included estab-l ishment of manufacturing (qual-i ty) agreements, vendor audits, n otifications of changes in product ( materials or design), certificates of a nalyses, and flow path testing for e ndotoxin, particulates and biobur-de n (where necessary). With regard t o sanitization (e.g., irradiation for m icrobial control) or sterilization, b ioprocessers should note where s terilization is performed (i.e., con-t ract irradiator) and provide doc-u mentation on the sterilization v alidation method, sterilization r ecords, impact on materials (sup-EMD Millipore and the M logo are trademarks of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. \u00a9 2011 Millipore Corporation.

P rocess-validation considerations s hould take into account the full r ange of the manufacturing pro-c ess, and incorporate multiple unit operations and actual manufac-t uring parameters, such as mixing s peed and duration of perfusion c ulture. Sterile-media simulations s hould be conducted for filling of s terile product (i.e., bulk or unit d osage). Where fluids are stored in single-use containers, valida-t ion should include the length of ti me and temperature range, with a ssessments of the impact of fluid o n materials, and the impact of m aterials on product, buffers or m edia, and container integrity (i.e., l eakage) after storage. Where bulk f luids are shipped, considerations s hould include the effect of pressure c hanges, such as altitude, effect of m otion (i.e., acceleration or vibra-t ion) and the protection offered by e xternal containers. Other envi-ro nmental considerations can i nclude light, chemicals, and other m echanical forces that may affect th e contained fluid.Despite commonly cited con-c erns, leak integrity issues with t oday's improved biocontainer de signs are rare. However, pos-s ible issues should be qualified a nd noted, such as movement or s hipping of storage containers, o perator error (handling training), i mproper operation parameters ( i.e., tube welding), and exposure t o extreme temperature. D oleski summarized his talk by s aying that FDA recognizes the i mportance of the user's relation-s hip with their single-use equip-m ent suppliers and expects users t o work with suppliers to develop k nowledge of their single use e quipment, understand their p roduct and processes, consider p otential issues, conduct a cor-r esponding risk assessment, per-f orm appropriate validation, and e stablish proper quality systems to m aintain a state of control. /uni25C6 DNA De tection from the Experts in Host Cell Protein Detection Rec over sub-picogram/mL levels of DNA in our kits for: Residual CHO Host Cell DNA Residual E.coli Host Cell DNA Residual NS/0 Host Cell DNA qPCR and Dye Binding formats availableCY GNUS USA HEADQUARTERS:4701 Southpor t Supply NC 28461Phone: 910-454-9442 Fax: 910-454-9443Email: info@cygnustechnologies.comOr if you seeking custom vices we offer:C ustom Antibody Developmen t Antibody Puri/f_ication and C onjugation C ustom Assay Development Cygnus also offers a broad menu of well-validated, robust gener ic kits and immunoassay reagents.

This growth is partly d riven by their highly com-p etitive business model that requires t hat they continually drive for effi-c iency and productivity. As an exam-p le, today more than 86% of CMOs are u sing disposables/single-use devices t o create improvements in bioprocess-i ng performance, according BioPlan A ssociates' 20th annual report (1). T he survey asked 352 global bioman-u facturers and CMOs which aspects o f manufacturing technology have i mproved performance at biologics f acilities over the last year. Among the 1 5 areas identified, some significant d ifferences were seen between CMOs a nd biologics developers. T his year, the vast majority of C MOs, 86.2%, pointed to finding \"sig-n ificant\" or \"some\" improvements as a r esult of single-use devices adop-t ion, far outstripping their next most p opular factor, \"improved upstream p roduction operations,\" from single-use devices u sage\u2014a healthy percentage, but lag-g ing behind factors such as \"over-a ll better control of process\" (73.5% The d ata, released in BioPlan Associates' 8 th Annual Report and Survey of B iopharmaceutical Manufacturing C apacity and Production, shows that i mplementation of single-use devices w as one of the few areas where CMOs reported implementing more perfor-m ance improvements than product m anufacturers.UnIT ed STaTeS verSUS eUropeI n comparing responses from manu-f acturers in the US, Western Europe, a nd the rest of the world (ROW), s ingle-use device adoption was one o f the major areas with divergent r esponses, with more in Europe than t he US and ROW reporting improve-m ents from this area. Specifically, 7 9.2% of Western European respon-de nts signaled improvements derived f rom single-use devices, second only t o \"overall better control of process,\" a t 82.8% of European biomanufactur-e rs. By contrast, 62.3% of US respon-de nts and 55.2% of ROW respondents r eported improvements from single-u se technologies, behind other factors s uch as improved production opera-ti ons (upstream and downstream), and p rocess control enhancements. The E uropeans' preference for single-use t echnologies may reflect their cus-t omer purchases and/or vendor mar-k eting catching up with those in the U S, while much of the ROW still may n ot be heavily implementing single-u se systems, or vendors are simply not y et marketing heavily in these regions.T aken together, 65.5% of bioman-u facturing and CMO respondents p ointed to benefits from usage of s ingle-use devices this year, a slight d ecrease from the 67.2% in 2010 (2). I ndeed, this year, reported improve-m ents from single-use devices d ropped to fourth on our list of fac-t ors, from second last year.

The use of more d isposables and single-use devices i n manufacturing took the top s lot, with 40.8% of respondents. F ollowing disposables was the use of more \"platform'\" downstream p rocesses, at 37.7%. Analysis of th ose activities showed that there w as a cluster of mid-level activi-t ies that sped drug-delivery times. T hese included activities such a s using \"platform\" cell lines, i mproved in-process monitoring, u se of \"design of experiment\" m ethods, and use of better chro-m atography resins. At the bottom o f the attributes was \"use of differ-en t expression systems.\" However, b ecause expression systems are t ypically a one time decision, this i s not unexpected.C omparing biomanufacturers t o CMOs, BioPlan found that for C MOs the number one activity i mplemented to speed drug devel-opment timelines was the use of m ore disposables and single-use d evices in manufacturing (72% v s. 42% for biomanufacturers).T rends in the time required f or product development and a pproval are closely related to p roductivity and cost concerns. T his year, the survey showed that a cceptance of single-use devices is a lso being used as a cost-cutting a ction. Of 212 respondents to this q uestion, 35.4% accepted single-u se (disposable) systems into clin-i cal manufacturing operations to c ut costs, while 19.3% accepted s ingle-use systems into commer-c ial manufacturing operations for t he same reason.p rIMary reaSonS for I nCreaSIng USe of dISpoSaBleSB ioPlan identified reasons for the i ncreasing trend towards use of d isposable and single-use system co mponents. Single use dispos-ab le systems can provide cost s avings, and sometimes these sav-i ngs can be substantial compared w ith fixed stainless steel systems, p articularly with regard to larger s ystems. Indeed, as shown above, b iomanufacturers are accepting s ingle-use systems as a cost-cut-ti ng mechanism, and according t o BioPlan's data, almost 58% of r espondents indicate that using disposables to lower annual costs is a \" very important\" attribute.H owever, as in previous years, d irect cost reductions do not a ppear to be among the most w idespread (\"important\" or \"very i mportant\") factors to these deci-s ion-makers. As in earlier years, t he data indicate that disposable s ystems users are more concerned ab out factors that will save time, r educe risks, and accelerate cam-p aign turnaround. Increasingly, t hey are also interested in reducing ca pital equipment.T he primary reasons biophar-m aceutical developers and CMOs u se these products are to: Eliminate cleaning requirements ( 90.2% indicating \"important\" o r \"very important\") R e d u c e c a p i tal in v e s tm e n t in f acility and equipment (85%) R e d u c e tim e t o g e t f a cili ty u p a nd running (85%) Decrease campaign turnaround t ime (81.7%).A s ignificant shift is the focus o n reducing capital investment in f a cili ty an d e q ui p m e n t .

For example, a f ew years ago, \"eliminating c leaning requirements\" took t he top position over \"decreas-i ng risk of cross-contamination,\" a s the dominant reason for i ncreased usage.

This r eduction may reflect a matu-r ation of this segment. As the i ndustry becomes more aware o f the attributes and benefits o f disposable usage, and as the u se of disposables increases, d ecision-makers' needs and spe-c ific reasons for increasing usage c ontinue to level out. For exam-p le, when considering all users, \" Decreasing risk of cross-con -t amination\" as a \"very impor-t ant\" reason saw a decrease this y ear to 42.4% (down from 50% l ast year) of users. Much of this s tabilization may be the result of g reater experience and awareness o f these devices.W here developerS a nd CMoS dIfferB bio-t herapeutic developers when m easuring their top reasons for i ncreased use of disposables. A ccording to Dr. Abdul Wajid, s enior director of process sciences a t XOMA (US) LLC, \"Significant di fferences with biotherapeutic de velopers reflects CMO business m odel which has multiple proj-e cts pipeline, generic quality doc-u mentations enabling them to a chieve faster turn around result-i ng in higher productivity and b etter use of plant time to main-t ain business edge,\" (1).C MOs in particular can save on f acility or campaign costs, which can also reduce operating costs a nd capital investments. The flex-i bility and quick turn-around t imes between process runs can a lso improve efficiency, which can r educe costs. These savings can be p assed on to the client. This is the r esult of the CMO being able to p erform different processes within t he same facility. CMOs often use d isposables to reduce risks of cross-c ontamination between campaigns, a nd are motivated by the need to g et a facility or project up and run-n ing quickly. By contrast, biother-a peutic manufacturers tend to be m ore motivated by the need to keep m aintenance costs low. If suppli-e rs or associated standard-setting b odies are able develop methods f or standardizing disposables, it w ould enable the use of secondary v endors, which is an increasingly i mportant factor today.\" Very important\" reasons for i ncreased use of disposables that a re much more applicable for b iotherapeutic developers: Reduce time to get a facility up a nd running (44.6% of devel-o pers vs. 34.6% of water requirements ( 25% of developers vs. 8% of C MOs) Lower annual maintenance ( 22.2% of developers vs. 12% of C MOs).\" Very important\" reasons that a re more applicable for CMOs: Decrease risk of product cross-c ontamination (56.0% of C MOs, 39.4% of developers) ( 36% of CMOs, 19.7% of devel-o pers) of C MOs, 33.1% of developers).T hese crucial reasons are r eflected by the recent expansion o f the CMC Biologics facility in C openhagen to include a 2000 L s ingle-use bioreactor. According t o Gustavo Mahler, chief oper-a tions officer at CMC, the a dvantages are clear: \"Reduced p roject times, reduced risk of c ross-contamination resulting in increased process reliability, a nd reduced batch manufactur- Biomanufacturers Only CMOs Only Used more disposables and single-usedevices in manufacturing Used more 'platform' downstream processes Improved in-process monitoring methods 41.7%72.0% 40.6% 52.0% 37.7% 24.0% Figure 2: Select activities implemented to speed drug development timelines i denti/f_ied by biomanufacturers versus CMOs.S urvey methodologyT he Annual Report and S urvey of Biopharmaceutical Ma nufacturing Capacity and P roduction in the series of annual e valuations by BioPlan Associates y ields a composite view and trend a nalysis from 352 individuals at b iopharmaceutical manufacturers a nd contract manufacturing o rganizations (CMOs) in 31 c ountries.

CMOs can be t he first to reap these advan-t ages, but all biomanufacturers h ave seen benefits. The top five r easons most commonly cited by a ll respondents as \"most critical\" i nclude:1 . Reduce capital investment in f acility and equipment (21% for 2 011, up from 14.4% in 2009) 2 . Eliminate cleaning require-m ents (12.6%) . Faster campaign ( 11.2%, up from 6.9% in 2009) 4 . Decrease risk of product cross-c ontamination (8.4%)5. Reduce time to get facility up a nd running (6.3%).I t is clear that single-use d evices continue to gain accep-t ance in the industry, and that t heir benefits are being increas-i ngly noticed. Over time, we e xpect biomanufacturers and C MOs to integrate disposables i nto most processes, especially a s downstream single-use solu-t ions and specific devices such a s probes and sensors continue t o evolve. In addition, as new r egions such as China and India g ain prominence and begin to p roduce biologics and bioge-ne rics, the need for consistent q uality will likely dictate the g reater use of disposables, b ecause they can often be imple-m ented more efficiently and with f ewer risks of quality problems ( 4). As new biomanufacturers e nter the industry and new prod-ucts enter the pipeline, the dis-p osables option will become part o f the decision process from the ve ry start.re ferenCeS 1.

This next generation fits l oosely into the category of follow-on b iologics, a title that covers various p roducts that are copies, near-copies, o r improvements of original biologic p roducts (see Figure 1). Within this g roup there appear to be both easy w ins and challenging approaches that w ill require great effort to bring a prod-u ct to market. However, a detailed a nalysis of the costs and benefits of fol-lo w-on biologics shows how increased i nvestment in development can offer a b etter marketing opportunity.B iosimilarsO n Mar. 23, 2010, the Biologics Price C ompetition and Innovation Act ( BPCA) became law in the US, the w orld's single largest pharmaceu-t ical market. As a result of this act, F DA is developing mechanisms for t he approval of products known as b iosimilars that may be considered \" highly similar\" to and \"interchange-ab le\" with authorized biologics that h ave lost market protection (see side-b ar \"Product Protection\"). There i s a vital distinction between these c lasses; not all highly similar prod-u cts will be \"interchangeable,\" but a ll \"interchangeable\" products are \" highly similar\" to the product cited i n their application. An interchange-ab le follow-on biologic can be sub-s tituted for the original product by a p harmacist, thus increasing poten-t ial market usage. A product that is similar is deemed to have the same c linical effect but must be prescribed i n its own right. This distinction is n ecessary because of the complexity of b iological products, the potential for d ifferent immune responses, and other s ide effects which are extremely dif-f icult to characterize through analyti-c al methods or in vivo testing. In other s trongly regulated markets such as E urope, Australia, Canada, and Japan, t he same principles have been enacted f or some time (1-4). The European m arket, in particular, has extensive e xperience with the two-tier approach t o similarity.i mitatorsW hile markets with strong regulatory o versight have been struggling with t he definitions and approval routes f or biosimilars, markets that are not as w ell-regulated have seen the introduc-t ion of imitator products. These prod-u cts are intended to mimic originator p roducts, but because of differences in q uality and composition, they cannot, i n general, be considered similar to t he originator (5). Any claim of high s imilarity by many of these products is l ikely to be disputed by the more regu-l ated markets (6).B ioBettersT he final class of follow-on biologics i s not intended to be similar to the o riginal products; it is are intended t o be better. Biobetters, also known a s biosuperiors, are improvements on o riginal biological products that pro-v ide enhanced safety, efficacy, or dos-i ng regime.

T o license a biobetter, existing r egulatory pathways for a new p roduct must be followed. That i s, a unique portfolio of quality, s afety, and clinical efficacy data m ust be generated.C an Biosimilars G enerate ProFits?T he development costs of a b iosimilar product that meets the r equirements of a strongly regu-l ated market have been estimated b y those developing such prod-u cts to be $75-250 million and b y the Federal Trade Commission t o be $100-200 million (7,8). W hen considering the global r egistration of a biosimilar, one v ariable still to be assessed in t hese estimates is whether clini-c al trials will be required in e ach regulatory market. At pres-ent, the EMA has requested test-i ng against a locally approved, E uropean-labeled reference p roduct and there are signs that F DA will require testing against a U S-approved and labeled ref-e rence product. Duplication of t he pivotal clinical trials is thus a p ossibility. In the US, the extent o f data required to prove that a p roduct is \"interchangeable\" is u ndefined, but it can be expected t o be significantly greater than t he requirements for a claim of \" highly similar\" to the reference p roduct. With this high entry c ost, a biosimilar will only be a v iable prospect when the poten-t ial sales of that product exceed $ 250 million per year (9).D ata from European expe-r ience with biosimilars can be e xamined to investigate the p robable returns on the level of i nvestment needed to bring a b iosimilar to market. In Europe, a b iosimilar is approved through t he central process common to a ll member states, then each c ountry decides whether the p roduct may be substituted for the reference product and at w hat level that substitution may o ccur. Table II provides data for b iosimilar market penetration in E urope, by country, in the sec-o nd quarter of 2009. At this time, b iosimilar human growth hor-m ones (HGH) had been approved f or three years, biosimilar epo-e tins (EPO) for two years, and b iosimilar filgrastims (G-CSF) for l ess than nine months.T he relatively high penetration o f G-CSF in a short period of time s uggests that increased familiarity w ith biosimilars in the European m arket is improving uptake, but it c ould also reflect differing substi-t ution concerns. What is notice-a ble is that the originator product m aintains a significant mar-k et share in the face of biosimilar c ompetition. There is no evidence o f the dramatic erosion of sales s een in the patent cliffs of small-m olecule originators.T he second part of the picture f or biosimilar sales is the number o f entrants to the market and the p eriod over which they launch p roducts. With no equivalent o f the Waxman-Hatch 180-day e xclusivity period for the first g eneric competitor, the European e xperience has been that several b iosimilar products enter the m arket at the same time. While t his has in part been influenced b y the timing of the development o f the European biosimilar guide-l ines, the situation is likely to b e mimicked in the US as guide-l ines are issued or market exclu-s ivity or patent periods expire. F igure 2 shows the situation in G ermany following the approval o f the EPO biosimilars Binocrit a nd Mircera on Sept. 28, 2007, a nd Silapo and Retacrit on Dec. 1 8, 2007. Although overall sales v alue for biosimilar EPO prod-u cts has increased since 2008, the s plit between the manufacturers h as been maintained. BiobettersBiosimilarsSubstitutes Imitators Follow-on BiologicsFigure 1: Follow-on biologics similar), imitator, or b iobetter classes. Within biosimilars, there is a subset of products that can be s ubstituted for the originator product (i.e., they are interchangeable). N ovember 2011 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm International 33Follow-on BiologicsB ased on a European market of a pproximately $600 million for E PO, extrapolation of these fig-u res would likely give a biosimi-l ar uptake of $185 million, with t he single biggest seller obtain-i ng European sales of $100 mil-l ion. These figures are theoretical; f or an example of real sales fig-u res, Sandoz, which has been t he leader in the biosimlar busi-n ess since launching Omnitrope ( HGH) in Europe in 2006 and in t he US in 2007, achieved com-b ined global sales of the biosimi-l nd Zarzio (G-CSF) of $185 mil-l ion in 2010 (12). T he key factor in these calcu-l ations is the uptake per coun-t ry, which is governed by the s ubstitution policy. Including t he potential US market, which i s approximately 1.5 times that o f Europe, achieving a sales tar-g et of $250 million per year for a b iosimilar will only be possible if a p roduct is granted interchange-ab le status with the originator i n the US market. The require-m ents for interchangeable status h ave yet to be set but they can be e xpected to be very challenging.a BioBetter aPProaChI n contrast to the regulations for b iosimilars, the route to approval f or a biobetter is clear. A full bio-lo gical licence application (BLA) w ill be required in the US, and t he equivalent procedure will be r equired in other markets. The c ost of bringing a new product t hrough the BLA process has been e stimated at $1.24 billion (13). T his figure, however, incorpo-r ates a 30% success rate for mol-e cules entering the process. With b iobetters, it is arguable that the s uccess rate will be significantly h igher because the target and e fficacy of the originator product a re known. Thus, failures during t he development period will be due to unwanted side effects, as o pposed to lack of efficacy. The a verage development costs for a b iobetter will therefore be closer t o the estimated direct costs for a s ingle product of $375 million.A s each modified molecule pro-g resses through the development p rocess, more is learned about th e effect of the modifications, a nd this knowledge can then be a pplied to the design of studies t o test subsequent molecules. As a r esult, companies can further i mprove success rates by devel-o ping platform technologies. U sing consistent platforms also r educes manufacturing design c osts and can simplify the ana-l ytical characterization program. A t ypical example of the platform a pproach is the carboxy terminal p eptide attachment developed b y Washington University in S t Louis, MO. Merck brought a follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH) modified in this way to t he European market as Elonva. P rolor Biotech is using the tech-n ology as well, to develop modi-f ied HGH (Phase I completed), I nterferon (preclinical), Factors V II and IX (preclinical), EPO ( preclinical) and other thera-p eutic peptides. The platform a pproach is also readily applica-b le to antibodies. MedImmune an d Xencor are among those m odifying amino acid sequences i n the Fc domain to develop bio-b etter versions of existing mono-c lonal treatments. P latform approaches also allow s maller companies to enter the m arket. By developing and pro-t ecting the technology of the m odification, such companies c an enter partnerships with larger o rganizations that have the nec-e ssary production, distribution, Improvement H ow achievedExample of companies s upporting the approachH umanizationUse human cell lines to e with polyethelene g protein to ex tend serum half-lifeAmgen's Neulasta is a p egylated form of their own N eupogenF usion proteinsAddition of albumin or other p rotein moieties to extend s erum half-lifeCoGenensys purchased by T eva in 2008A ltered amino acid sequenceEngineering antibody Fc d omains for ffector for biosimilars in Europe (10). HGF is human growth h ormone, EPO is epoetin, and G-CSF is Biologicsa nd sales capability, than f unding the full development p ackage themselves.I f the costs of bringing a biobet-t er to market are two- to fourfold h igher than those of a biosimilar, w hat are the advantages? The most ob vious is that the product will be n ew, and therefore subject to 12 y ears of market exclusivity in the U S. In Europe and other markets, e xclusivity is more closely aligned w ith patent protection. The data f rom the European experience of b iosimilar competition presented a bove suggest that biosimilar com-p etition will be weak, and thus a l ong period of exclusivity may n ot be as necessary for profit gen-e ration as would be expected. T he benefits to the license holder w ill be earned by the nature of t he product; its improved char-a cteristics must be used to attract p atients and increase sales. While t he biosimilar aims to take mar-k et share by being slightly cheaper t han the originator, the biobetter has to gain market share on merit a lone. Sales presentation of a newly a pproved biobetter will thus extol t he benefits of the product rather t han relying on price alone to d rive business.h ealthCare CostsW hat are the potential benefits t o patients? The main intention o f the BPCIA was to drive down c osts of biologics to the health-c are system, recognizing that b iologics will form an increasing c omponent of the drug expen-d itures and have high relative t reatment costs compared with tr aditional small molecules. The F ederal Trade Commission report e stimated that the introduc-t ion of biosimilars represented a potential savings of 10%-30% ( 8). Given the European experi-e nce of biosimilar uptake and the e ffect of biosimilar introduction o n originator price, the overall i mpact on the drugs bill for a par-t icular indication where biosimi-lar treatment becomes available is l ikely to be a 10-20% reduction (8). A b iobetter will command a p remium price for its improved c haracteristics, but the improved d osing regimes common to such p roducts can result in significant c ost savings for the treatment of a particular indication. For exam-p le, based on the treatment used i n a pivotal trial for Neulasta\u2014a n Amgen biobetter version of t heir own Neupogen\u2014a single t reatment cycle costs $3400 f or Neulasta and $6000 for N eupogen, despite the unit prices b eing $3400 and approximately $ 300 (body weight dependent), r espectively (14). The biobetter i n this case represents a 40% r eduction in overall costs for the h ealthcare provider.th e FUtUre BioloGiCs marKetT he global biologic market will g row\u2014of that we can be cer-t ain\u2014but what form m 10 5 0 Figure 2: Epoetin (EPO) sales in Germany following approval of the rst biosimilars (data, ref. 11). N ovember 2011 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm International 35Follow-on Biologicsp roducts will continue to gen-e rate significant sales volume, if n ot value, in the less regulated ma rkets. Some manufacturers o f these products may be able t o develop sufficiently detailed q uality, safety, and efficacy data p ackages to convert the imitator t o biosimilar status in the regu-l ated markets. With established p roduction facilities and sales g enerated from the imitator prod-u ct, the additional investment to b ring the product up to biosimi-l ar status may be justified by the r eturns from biosimilar sales. D irect entry to the regulated mar-k ets as a biosimilar is less likely to b e economically viable.B iobetters offer the opportu-n ity to establish brand-to-brand c ompetition within treatment i ndications. Where in the past t he identification of a mode of a ction has prompted the gen-e ration of multiple analogues, o r \"me-too\" products, such a s Lipitor, Crestor, Zocor, and L ipostat in the statin market, the i dentification of a target recep-t or by the originator product will s pur the creation of biobetters. W ith many possible routes of m odification, several companies w ill be able to target the same i ndication with novel products a nd thus create competition w ithin the market.N ew targets will continue to be i dentified, and the first product to b e marketed for an indication may b e more sophisticated than a sim-p le copy of the natural human pro-t ein. As platform technologies are e stablished, partnerships between i nnovators and the owners of the p latforms will grow.sU mmaryT he follow-on biologics area a ppears crowded with prod-u ct divisions dependent on what s eem to be slightly different reg-u latory definitions. Much atten-t ion has gone to biosimilars as the class with the potential to reduce h ealthcare costs through increased c ompetition. With the experience g ained from the introduction of t hese products in Europe and the c onservative approach to regula-t ion in the US, it is unlikely that b iosimilars will meet this hope. H owever, biobetters represent an o pportunity to be innovative with r educed risk and increased sales for t he manufacturer while improv-i ng the treatment of patients and r educing healthcare costs.

Typically, patents last 20 years a nd can cover the structure of a molecule, the design of a process u sed to produce that molecule, or a device for delivering the dose to t he patient. I t is possible to challenge a patent in terms of obviousness (i.e. no l eap of logic was required to arrive at the patented item), or because e arlier patents that cover the same idea already exist. Therefore, a p atent is not an absolute guarantee that the product or process cannot b e copied, even within the nominal lifetime of that patent.A lso available to the originator of a pharmaceutical product is e xclusivity\u2014the interval between the approval to market the product a nd the time at which a competitor product may be approved by the s ame authority (i.e., branded exclusivity) or at which a competitor p roduct may be submitted on the basis of safety data for the original p roduct (i.e., data exclusivity). A product may have exclusivity without h aving a patent. For instance, additional periods of exclusivity are a vailable to drug producers who conduct trials in children to ensure c orrect dosing (pediatric exclusivity) or who develop drugs to treat o rphan diseases where the drug will not have high sales volumes.36 BioPharm International www.biopharminternational.com November 2011 p hoto CREDIt: MARtIN ChILD, GEtty IMAGEsBiosimilars B iosimilars can be defined as b iotech drugs that have been s hown to have comparable q uality, safety, and efficacy t o the original product. Scientific and r egulatory issues around approval o f biosimilars have been a topic of g reat interest and debate lately in E urope and in the United States. A k ey concren is industry's limited u nderstanding of how the different q uality attributes (QA) of a biotech p roduct affect its safety and efficacy.

Sales o f biosimilars will be primar-i ly driven by sales in the devel-o ped countries (i.e., US and E urope) with the US constituting a pproximately 90% of the global ma rket. A regulatory pathway for a pproving bisimilars is already i n place in Europe\u201414 such p roducts have been approved to d ate (1). The pathway in the US, a lthough approved under the B iologics Price Competition and I nnovation Act of 2009, is still b eing implemented. In Japan, al though a regulatory guidance f or biosimilar approval was issued i n 2009, the slow adoption of s mall-molecule generic drugs sug-g ests that the approval of biosimi-l ars is likely to begin later than in t he US. t he economicS o f BioSimilarSA lthough the financial driv-e rs for growth of biosimi-l ars are widely recognized to b e significant, there are some k ey aspects that distinguish b iosimilars from the small- m olecule generic drug market. P erformance of biosimilars in G ermany, the largest biosimilar m arket at present, shows that t he substitution rate for biosimi-l ar epoteins is about 35% of the t otal sales of epoetin. This per-c entage is quite different from t he >90% rates that are com-m only achieved for small- m olecule generics (2). This dif-f erence is partly due to the ob servation that patients tak-i ng biotech therapeutics s how an aversion towards switch-i ng to the corresponding biosimi-l ars (3). Development and commercial-i zation of a biosimilar requires a nywhere from $10-40 million c ompared with the $1-2 million t ypicaly required for a conven-t ional small-molecule generic d rug. Furthermore, biosimilars a re expected to be priced at only a 2 0-25% discount in compari-s on with their original products, a s ignificantly smaller discount t han what is common with small-m olecule generic drugs. O verall, the effect on overall d rug pricing will be much more lim ited with biosimilars than w ith small-molecule generics. P atient behavior is also likely to r esult in slower adoption. m anufacturerS anD clinical r eSearch orGanizationS M ore than 30 biopharmaceutical c ompanies and clinical research o rganizations are based in India ( see sidebars on companies and c ontract organizations) (4, 5). T he biopharmaceutial sector's e stimated value was $1.9 billion i n 2009-2010, and accounted f or three-fifths of the approxi-m ately $3-billion in revenues of t he biotech industry in India as a w hole. More optimistic pro-j ections for sales revenues of biosimilars entering the US and E urope have been estimated as h igh as $21 billion for the next s ix to seven years. India is also e merging as a hub for conduct-i ng global clinical trials with i ts share going from 2% at pres-e nt to 5% by 2012, based on low c ost, large and diversified patient p ools, easy recruitment, strong g overnment support, availability o f specialized doctors and trained i nvestigators, and a gradual s trengthening of the IP environ-m ent (5, 6). T he clinical research organiza-t ion market has increased from $ 5 million in 2005 to $71 mil-l ion in 2006, and reached $1 bil-l ion in 2010 with 50,000 clinical r esearch professionals and 400 c linical trials involving 100,000 p atients at 300 sites (7).I ndian companies have grad-u ally advanced from making s impler biotech products, such a s the granulocyte colony stimu-l ating factor to manufacturing m ore complex biotech products, s uch as monoclonal antibodies ( see Table I) (8).

R esults showed that Singapore, I reland and India are the top c hoices, followed closely by C hina and Germany. The com-p etition for leadership in devel-o pment and commercialization w ill be intense among the more e stablished players (i.e., Germany, S ingapore, and Ireland) as well as t he emerging ones (i.e., India and C hina).T he developed countries (i.e., U S, Europe, Japan) have a long h istory of manufacturing biotech p roducts for regulated markets, b ut the developing countries have t he key advantage of an availa-b ile, qualified ,and relatively l ow-priced workforce. However, m ore is needed for the latter g roup to completely embrace the p rinciples and expectations with r espect to product quality and G MP compliance, and this will b e a large obstacle on the path to these manufacturers emerging as m ajor global players. T he complexity of the biosimi-l ars market is further amplified b y industry's inability to com-p letely characterize biotech p roducts through analytical m eans. As a result, there is lim-i ted understanding of how the b iotech process affects the qual-i ty of the final product and how q uality attributes affect clinical s afety and efficacy of the prod-u ct (10, 11). I n the current environment, a ny missteps by an Indian m anufacturer may to result in a p erception that the biosimi-l ars manufactured in India (or a ny other developing country) a re not of adequate quality. For e xample, the Swiss generic-drug m aker, Acino, announced that i t incurred a loss after European U nion authorities required a r ecall of batches of its drug C lopidogrel, which had been f ormulated using an active i ngredient from an Indian sup-p lier (12). The European regula-t ors ordered the recall after an i nspection of the Indian firm led t o the finding that it had com-p romised production records for C lopidogrel.movinG forwarDM uch needs to be done for I ndian manufacturers to gradu-a te from being considered \"man-u facturers for the developing w orld\" to the \"manufacturers for t he developed and the develop-i ng world.\" S ignificant improvements h ave been made the coun-t ry's regulatory system. A sys-t ematic, science- and risk-based a pproach for review of regulatory f ilings and inspections has been p ut in place. However, there is a n eed to ensure greater trans-p arency in the decision-making p rocess so that the outcomes can b e more consistent. The current s ystem involves multiple orga-n izations (e.g., the Department o f Biotechnology, Central Drugs S tandard Control Organization) a nd ministries of the govern-m ent. A single point of decision-m aking and accountability will m ake the system more efficient, c redible, and better coordinated, a nd will reduce confusion and de lays that are otherwise suffered a t times by the industry. In addi-t ion, basic training in areas such a s GMP, documentation practices, s cale up, technology transfer, and v alidation is needed by the indus-t ry and regulators. C reation of modern technol-o gy platforms that can support t he regulatory authorities in m aking appropriate decisions d uring the review and inspection p rocess is needed. For example, a pproaches such as rapid analysis o f a drug lot, fingerprinting, and u se of chemometrics to quickly f acilitate decision-making on p roduct quality are already in p ractice by some of the major g lobal regulatory agencies, and I ndia could benefit from these t echnologies. T he Indian Pharmacopoeia C ommission (IPC) is in the pro-c ess of overhauling its mono-g raphs for biotech products.

P rofessional organizations s uch as the Parenteral Drug A ssociation (PDA) have been e ffective in the US in bring-i ng the industry and regula-t ors together in the form of v arious task forces to create b est practices for industry and r egulators. International trade o rganizations, such as the A merican Chemical Society ( ACS) and International Society f or Pharmaceutical Engineering ( ISPE), also have been effective i n the US by encouraging dia-l ogue between academia and i ndustry through conferences a nd other events. I ndia could benefit from s imilar academic-industry col-l aborations. The Small Business I nnovation Research ( SBIRI) from the Department of B iotechnology (DBT) is one step i n this direction. Q uality by design (QbD) has g ained significant momentum l ately in the biotech industry w ith both regulators and the industry investing financial a nd staffing resources to imple-m ent the approach (13, 14). A Q bD approach is likely to be e xpected of Indian manufactur-e rs when they apply for FDA or E MA approval of biosimilars.

In such applications, the b ag is hermetically sealed and steril-i zed. Sterility of the bag must be main-t ained to avoid contamination of the p roduct. Any breach of the sterile con-d ition is considered a serious risk and o ften results in disposal of valuable p roduct, sometimes after significant c ost and effort has been expended in t he course of making it.A t the moment, disparities exist b etween defect sizes that are readily detectable using current on-line tech-n ology, and the speculated value for t he critical defect size (e.g., the defect s ize at which sterility of a package is l ost). Lampi established, and Chen an d Keller independantly substanti-a ted, that the critical defect dimen-s ion for bacterial penetration for f lexible bags is 11 \u00b5m or less, while G ilchrist determined that the dimen-s ion was nearly twice that: 22 \u00b5m ( 1-4). Blakistone later established t hat critical defect size was 7 \u00b5m (5). D iscrepancies in the critical defect s ize could be attributed to differ-e nces in the bio-test methodology, c oncentrations of test microbes, test t imes, or positive/negative pressure Integrity Testing of Flexible C ontainersV ishwas Pethe, M ike Dove, and A lex TerentievD efects as s mall as 1 0 m can b e detected w ithout c ompromising p roduct ntegrity testing.V ishwas Pethe* is a research engineer, M ike Dove is a manufacturing engineer, a nd Alex Terentiev is US R&D director, all a t ATMI Life Sciences, vpethe@atmi.com P hoto courtesy 2011 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm International 43Integrity Testingi n the test bag. Therefore, one o f the objectives of this paper is t o determine the critical defect d imension at which sterility b reach occurs in biopharmaceuti-c al containers. Such information w ould provide a foundationfor a voiding inherently problematic c onditions, as well as for empir-i cally evaluating and tailoring l eak detection equipment for t heir specific needs.T he package's integrity con-t rols microbial ingress into the p ackage and thereby preserves p roduct sterility. The current t echnologies employed in the b iopharmaceutical packaging i ndustry (e.g., vacuum bubble t est, dye-penetration test, pres-s ure-decay test, constrained-p late pressure-decay test) are o nly capable of reliably detecting l eak rates in the range of 10-2 or 10 -4 cc/s, which is equivalent to detecting defect sizes in the scale o f 90-500 \u00b5m. Thus, industry n eeds a method of testing the i ntegrity of a flexible container t hat detects defects correspond-i ng to the minimum size needed t o block water-borne microbes. T his article describes a new test methodology, called helium i ntegrity testing (HIT), that can de tect such defects.M eThoDS AnD MATeRIALST he HIT apparatus includes the f ollowing main components (see F igure 1): S hort Courses: 4-5 C onference: February 6-8 E xhibition: February 6-7SLAS2012: Collaborate | Innovate | Dominate Collaborat e with 5,000+ innovative scientists, engineers, researchers and technologists from academic, g overnment and commercial laboratories around the globe to inaugurate the First Annual SLAS Conference a nd Exhibition in San Diego, CA, February 4-8, 2012.

The test unit i s a flexible two-dimensional b ag with connecting ports that e nable fluid communication w ith the helium source and vac-u um pump. The test chamber is l arge enough to house the unit t o be tested. The test chamber is c onnected to a vacuum pumping g roup equipped with the tracer-g as detector for chamber evacua-t ion and gas detection. A second v acuum group is used to evac-u ate the unit under test before f illing it with gas. A tracer-gas filling device (i.e., helium sup-p ly) completes the testing appa-r atus. The unit to be tested is p ut into the vacuum chamber a nd connected to service hoses, t hen the vacuum chamber and t he unit are evacuated. During c hamber evacuation, the test u nit is pressurized with the t racer gas. After a stabilization t ime, the detector is linked to t he vacuum line to detect the t racer gas flow through a leak a nd drawn in by the pumping g roup. This method can be made f ully automatic, so it depends lit-t le on an operator. Its sensitivity c an reach < 10-10 cc/s flow rates. T o prevent long down times, the H IT system employs an in-line p ressure-sensing test method as a p reliminary leak test that detects g ross leaks before the final a utomatic leak-test operation u sing a tracer gas is begun. This a pproach prevents large quanti-t ies of tracer gas from leaking i nto the atmosphere. A special-i zed pumping technique reduces t he stress on the test unit by r educing the internal pressure of the test part along with the e xternal (i.e., chamber) pressure.T o improve test time per test u nit, the test chamber was modi-f ied to include spacers that allow t he simultaneous testing of f our units. The spacers are held u pright by connecting rods, and e ach spacer has enough cavi-t ies in it such that when a test b ag inflates against it, it does n ot block the path of helium m olecules flowing through the de fect. The spacers constrain t he test bag in the test chamber, f urther increasing the helium p ressure in the bag and result-i ng in increased sensitivity of l eak detection. The spacers also e nsure that test bags experience m inimal stress during cham-b er evacuation by limiting bag e xpansion.T est bagsT he test bags were prepared by w elding two sheets made from A TMI's proprietary TK8 film. T o create defective bags, one of t he two sheets was modified to i ncorporate a defective patch. A de fective patch is a piece of TK8 f ilm (4 in. x 4 in.), with a 10 \u00b5m \u00b1 1 \u00b5 m hole drilled by a laser. T he laser-drilled holes were vali-d ated for defect size by measur-i ng flow rate through the defect a rea. Hereafter, \"defective bags\" i mplies a test bag with a 10 \u00b5m de fect, and \"good bags\" implies b ags with no defect.T he size of the test bag d epends on the size of the two s heets used in making one. The n ominal volumes of test bags i n this study were 1, 5, 10, 20, a nd 50 L. The helium leak rates t hrough defective bags and good b ags measured using HIT tech-n ology are discussed below.

The test b ags were aseptically filled with 50 m L microbial growth medium ( trypticase soy broth). The outside o f the test bag was sprayed with a 0 .9% saline solution contain-i ng approximately 106 CFU/mL of Escherichia Staphylococcus a ureus and Bacillus spizizenii and a pproximately 105 CFU/mL of Ca ndida albicans and Aspergillus b rasiliensis. The test bags were t hen transferred to an incuba-t or maintained at 30-35 \u00b0C and m onitored for 15 d. The growth m edium inside the test bag was p eriodically checked for microbial g rowth, which indicates microbial i ngress.L iquid particle count (LPC) test A t est bag was filled with ultra-p ure water (deionized water fil-t ered using a 0.05 m filter) and gently shaken to ensure that all t he bag surfaces came into con-t act with the solution. A sample o f the solution from the test bag w as then passed through particle m easuring equipment (PMS). The i nstrument reports the number o f particles per mL of solution w ith particle sizes greater than 2 5 and 10 m.R eSULTS AnD DISCUSSIonM icrobiological challenge testW hile l ong been used to challenge pack-a ges, particularly cans, for pin-hol es and channel leaks, they ar e not the real conditions that a package generally encounters d uring its use. Hence, pack-a ge integrity-evaluation meth-o ds that employ bioaerosols that s imulate the conditions that the p ackage will be expected to toler-a te during storage and distribu-ti on are more relevant and are g aining prominence. Test bags w ith defects between 2 and 50 \u00b5 m were exposed to a microbial e nvironment and served as test s ample. The test bags not exposed t o bacteria served as negative con-t rol for the aseptic filling. For e ach organism, a bag contain-i ng no defect was injected with 0 .1 mL of a 103 CFU/mL solution o f the organism to serve as posi-t ive control. The positive controls e xhibited growth after 1 d, thus v alidating the test conditions for de tecting microbial ingress.A s expected, under the con-d itions of the test, microbial i ngress into a package took lon-g er as the defect size got smaller. T est bags with defect sizes of 50 a nd 20 \u00b5m took the same time ( i.e., 5 d) to allow microbial g rowth, meaning that a clear c hannel for microbial ingress w as already established at 20 \u00b5 m. However, when the defect s ize was 15 \u00b5m, it took 14 d to s how any microbial growth (see Table I). A significant slowdown i n the microbial ingress at 15 \u00b5 m and complete cessation of m icrobial ingress at 10 \u00b5m or s maller defect sizes are interest-i ng, considering that microbial o rganisms are much smaller t han 10 \u00b5m and should infil-t rate through 10 \u00b5m defects just a s easily as they did through 20 \u00b5 m defects. The logical explana-t ion for this observation lies in t he threshold pressure inside the t est bag (1). To initiate micro-b ial ingress through a defect, t he pressure inside the test bag ( i.e., threshold pressure) must o vercome the force of the liq-u id surface tension and initiate l iquid flow through the defect, t hus providing a channel for m icrobes to travel into the bag. T he magnitude of threshold pres-s ure required to initiate liquid f low depends on the location o f the defect due to differences i n the static head pressures. As de fect size decreases, the thresh-o ld pressure for a given liquid i ncreases. Thus, in test bags with 1 0 \u00b5m defects, the threshold p ressure is lower than the force o f the liquid surface tension, pre-v enting the formation of a chan-n el through which microbes can t ravel. One other reason offered i n the literature for this behavior i s the formation of a biofilm on t he film surface, which prevents m icrobial ingress.A lthough additional studies m ay be required to confirm the ro ot cause for the lack of pen-e tration of microbes through a 1 0 \u00b5m defect, these results are i n agreement with researchers i n the food packaging industry s uch as Lampi and Chen, who h ave shown the critical dimen-s ion for microbial ingress to be a bout 10 \u00b5m (2, 3). The differ-e nces in the critical defect size f or microbial ingress between d ifferent studies could be due to Figure 3: test chamber with spacer, i llustrating test bag positioning. N ovember 2011 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm International 47Integrity Testingdi fferences in methods e mployed and the contact mate-r ials that affect the surface ten-s ion of the liquid. Based on these r esults, it is clear that defects l arger than 10 m cause steril-i ty breach. Therefore, integrity t esting for on-line package test-i ng must detect 10 \u00b5m defects to e nsure product sterility.L eak detection dataI n an ideal world, the helium i n the test background would b e nonexistent, and a good bag w ould not leak helium at all. On t he other hand, a defective bag w ould leak a definite amount h elium, that would be detected, th us resulting in distinct sepa-r ation of helium leak rates for de fective bags versus those for g ood bags. This f ideal behav-i or would result in a high degree o f resolution, allowing existing l eak-detection methods to be u sed to detect bag defects.H owever, the walls of flexible b ags are often made of polymeric m aterials, which are intrinsically p ermeable to gases. Helium gas h as a smaller molecular size and p ermeates faster through poly-m eric materials than air or nitro-g en. Thus, even a good test bag c an leak a significant amount of h elium by diffusion through the b ag walls. This diffused helium c reates high helium background l evels in the test chamber, thus m aking it difficult to quantify a ctual helium leaks through t he defects in the test bag. The h igh helium background essen-t ially masks the helium leaking f rom defects, limiting the low-e st leak rate that can be reliably m easured. HIT testing ensures t hat helium flowing through t he defects is maximized, while t he background helium concen-t ration is minimized. The test t ime was kept as short as pos-s ible to prevent elevation in the helium background as the test pr ogressed.Da ta reproducibilityO ften, even when a constant a mount of helium flows through a de fect, the ability of the pump-i ng system to carry helium mole-c ules to the detector can vary. In addition, the helium background v aries as the equipment oper-a tes over a period of 8 h, which m ay result in variation of the m easured leak rate for the same de fect size. To minimize this v ariation, the volume of the test c hamber external to the test bag w as minimized and the pump- 10-310 -410 -5Effect of bag positioning in test chamberon leak rate through a defective Position 4 Helium leak rate(cc/sec) 10 -310 -410 -5Helium leak rates of fully assembled nished good bagsv/s fully assembled bags with 10 micron defects \"Defective\" bags \"Good\" bags Box: 25%-75% Data Whiskers: Min, Max L - bag with 10 micron defect NL - bag with no defect (good bag) 1,5,10,20 and 50 - volume of bag n>16 each of 4: effect of test bag position in the test chamber on the helium leak rate.F igure 5: Box plot of helium leak rates (cc/sec) of good bags and defective bags.48 BioPharm International www.biopharminternational.com November 2011Integrity Testingi ng efficiency of the vacuum p umps was optimized. A single de fective bag from each of the b ag sizes (i.e., 1-50 L), was tested f ive times to verify the reproduc-i bility of the leak rate through a de fect (see Figure 2). The data s how a standard deviation of less t han 4% for leak rate in all bag s izes tested, except for 1-L bags, w hich had slightly greater varia-t ion at 10%. The higher varia-t ion in 1-L bags was due to the r elatively high ratio of detector g as to test bag volume, result-i ng in higher sensitivity input parameters such as tracer gas fill v olume and helium background. T he box plot of the measured l eak rates also indicates that the a verage leak rate for all defective b ags, irrespective of the bag size i s above a certain leak rate.Ef fect of test bag position T he test chamber includes a s pacer, which splits the test c hamber space into four com-p artments that can each accom-m odate one test bag. Of the four c ompartments, the two compart-m ents closer to the test-chamber wall are designated as positions 1 a nd 4, and the remaining two a re designated as position 2 and 3 ( see Figure 3).D uring the leak-testing pro-c ess, as the bag walls push a gainst the container wall, some d efects may be blocked by the c ontainer wall, thus reducing o r eliminating helium flowing t hrough the defects and, in turn, p reventing its detection. To mini-m ize this risk, spacer bars were p laced between the walls of the t est bag and container wall to p rovide a path for the tracer gas t o escape. Experimental studies w ere performed to ensure that t here was minimal variability in t he amount of helium flowing t hrough the defects due to the p osition of the bag in the cham-b er. Experiments were conducted w ith test bags placed in locations 1 t hrough 4. For each location, f ive distinct sets of defective t est bags per bag size were tested f or helium leaks. The box plots s howing the leak rates from bags a t different positions indicates th at there was minimal variation a nd that the measured leak rates w ere above a certain leak rate (see F igure 4). A t-test comparing the m eans of leak rates confirmed w ith greater than 86% confi-de nce that no significant differ-e nce would be observed in the m ean of the helium leak rates. T hus, irrespective of the bag posi-t ion in the test chamber, helium l eaks through a defective test bag r each the detector without appre-c iable loss in the process.V alidation of HIT technology f or 10 \u00b5m defect detectionA s eries of experiments was per-f ormed to validate that the HIT t echnology could detect 10 \u00b5m de fects.

The de fective test bags were then t ested, and the leak rate through t he defective bags was compared w ith the baseline leak rate. The s equence of testing defective b ags versus good bags, smallest b ag versus large bag was random-i zed to avoid trending issues. T he helium leak rate through de fective bags must be substan-t ially higher than the maximum h elium leak rate through good b ags to detect 10 \u00b5m defects.T he good test bags averaged a h elium leak rate of 1.17 x 10-5 cc/s, w hile the defective bags averaged 8 .94 x 10-5 cc/s. The variation in t he leak rates through good bags w as largely due to variation in the h elium background, while the vari-a tion in defective bag leak rates was l argely due to variation in the laser-d rilled defect hole sizes. The maxi-m um leak rate, also referred to as b aseline leak rate, is the sum of the a verage leak rate of good bags and f our times the associated standard de viation. The baseline leak rate v aried with bag size but for further e valuation, the baseline leak rate i s the maximum leak rate possible f or good test bags irrespective of b ag size, 3.4 x 10-5 cc/s (see Figure 6 ). This meant that if the helium l eak rate was higher than the base-l ine leak rate, there was a defect in t he test bag, and the bag would be r ejected. The helium leak rate value f or all the defective bags tested was h igher than the baseline leak rate v alue, allowing easy distinction b etween the good and the defective b ags (see Figure 5).A statistical analysis ( t-test for m eans) of leak-rate distributions o f defective bags versus good b ags indicated clear separation ( p < 0 .1) of leak rates. L iquid particle countW hile methods using tracer gas h ave come close to detecting 10 \u00b5 m defects, they have failed to m aintain cleanliness of the test u nit. Often such techniques i nvolved connecting the test unit t o the tracer-gas supply, evacu-a tion pumps, which can be a s ource of particle generation. I n addition, when the test bags a re filled with tracer gas, they a re pressurized to a great extent, r esulting in film stretching and c ausing particle shedding. It was t he intent of this test to show that n o significant increase in the liq-u id particulate level occurred due t o the use of this technology. The r atio of liquid particles generated t o the nominal bag volume was h ighest for 1-L bag because of its h igher surface-area-to-volume r atio, making 1-L bags more sensi-t ive to a change in particle con-c entration as a result of the leak t esting process. Therefore, only 1 -L bags were tested for verify-i ng particulate generation. It is e xpected that if 1-L bags do not s how a significant rise in the par-t icle count, large bags will not s how a significant rise either. A s ample of solution from each of t he 1-L test bags was run through p article measuring systems equip-m ent, and the data is reported in T able II. The data did not show s ignificant increase in the liquid particle count level indicating that H IT technology does not cause p articulate generation and is safe f or-point-of-use applications.C onCLUSIonSE xisting integrity-test meth-o ds for flexible containers can de tect defects in the range of 50 0-90 \u00b5m, but are inadequate f or ensuring product sterility. A m icrobial ingress study con-d ucted on flexible sterile con-t ainers revealed that defects as s mall as 15 \u00b5m can compromise s terility, while defects equal to o r smaller than 10 \u00b5m did not. A n ovel helium integrity test m ethod developed by ATMI is c apable of detecting 10 \u00b5m de fects during in-line package t esting without compromising t he cleanliness of the product. T he test bags with 10 m defects h ad helium leak rate value h igher than baseline leak rate v alue allowing clear distinction b etween good bags and defec-t ive bags.

Facing a need to f ind novel and diverse small-molecule l eads, attention in the 1980s centered o n high-throughput screening (HTS) te chnologies and compound librar-i es. Those libraries, albeit large, were h ardly diverse, with most therapeutic a gents coming from a few target protein c lasses. Complementation of libraries w ith natural products, the development o f combinatorial chemistry, and appli-c ation of focused-library sets followed. T his evolution, together with automated m ethods for content-rich assay systems a nd fast make-test cycles, enhanced dis-c overy of novel, potent, and diverse lead s eries. C ontrast this with the present ana-l agous processes for protein therapeu-t ics: the discovery and development of n ovel biologics is hardly diverse, effi-c ient or rapid. State-of-the art protein d iscovery and development use mul-t iple expression hosts (e.g., mouse, C (CHO), and NS0) a nd several reformatting steps between h osts are often necessary during testing, s cale-up, and production. The process of de veloping cell-based protein expression sy stems that are efficient, consistent, a nd scalable often is difficult and some-t imes impossible using currently avail-a ble technology. T o date, more than 150 protein d rugs have been approved for clinical u se, nearly all of which are produced i n cell-based expression systems, such a s E. coli, CHO cells, and Saccharomyces c erevisiae (S. cerevisea). These cell-based s ystems have several limitations, and many biologics can't be developed in t hese systems. For example, these sys-t ems only allow the overexpression of p roteins that don't affect the physiology o f the host cells. For many expression s ystems, identifying cell lines that sta-b ly synthesize high protein titers of the de sired product is a time-consuming a nd labor-intensive process. Ideally, the s ame production host for rapid variant d iscovery, production for animal test-i ng, and manufacturing of a clinical ca ndidate would be used.I deally, one would want to emulate t he huge leap made in iterative drug de sign seen in small-molecule discovery, n amely, rapid make-test cycles and gen-e ration of multiple parallel libraries of dr ug candidates with diverse structural e lements to optimize activity while m aintaining feasibility for manufacture. A n ideal system would do the following: Make fast make-test cycles a prereq-u isite for re-iterative design on the o rder of three to five days, similar t o those for focused small-molecule l ibraries Create efficient and rapid expres-s ion and purification that allows for l ibraries of hundreds to thousands o f protein-sequence variants to be s imultaneously tested per make-test c ycle using standard off-the-shelf rob otics equipment Incorporate preferred sequences de fined from selection technologies, s uch as ribosome or phage display, i nto whole protein therapeutics for te sting Enhance the diversity of chemical s tructures by expanding the library o f available amino acids at specifi-c ally targeted points in the protein s equence from 20 natural to many h undreds of non-natural amino-a cids Optimize several esign, de velopment, an anufacturing o f therapeutic p roteins.T revor Hallam* is chief scientific officer a nd Christopher Murray is v ice-president of research, both at S utro Biopharma, 310 Utah Ave, S uite 150, South San Francisco, CA 94080, t hallam@sutrobio.com.* To whom all correspondence s hould be addressed N ovember 2011 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm International 51Protein through r apid high-throughput make-t est cycles Create processes that are not o nly rapid but amenable to r apid scale-up and cGMP man-u facturing once the desired th erapeutic construct has been i dentified.A s ambitious as such a system w ould seem, several exciting tech-n ologies are emerging that improve e xpression systems and enhance d iversity to enable modification o f intrinsic properties of proteins, s uch as enzyme catalytic efficiency o r binding.

Beyond these e arly approaches, considerable e ffort to produce ever-more elegant c onstructs that combine two sepa-r ate functions have been made. One p romising approach, antibody drug c onjugates (ADCs), involves using a t argeting antibody to known tis-s ue selective cell-surface antigens o r receptors to target conjugated t oxins or cytotoxic drugs and s o enhance selectivity over normal t issue. Su ccessful design of effective A DCS is complex and requires l inking cytotoxic drug payloads to tumor-targeting antibody con-s tructs. The selection of an ideal a ntigen target for optimal internal-i zation and specificity for tumor t issues is critical. The design of l inkers that are stable in circula-t ion, but cleave when internal-i zed in tumor cells to release the c ytotoxic drug, adds to the com-p lexity, but the other major tech-n ical hurdle has been to define h ow the cytotoxic payload with l inker are conjugated to the target-i ng antibody. The biopharmaceu-t ical companies Seattle Genetics a nd Immunogen have developed rob ust platforms that depend on c onjugation of linkers and cyto-t oxic warheads to available cyste-i ne or lysine residues, respectively, i n the tumor targeting antibody s equence. D espite successes with ADCs, t here are many examples where s eemingly optimized functional c omponents (i.e., antigen-binding m otif, linker, and drug-conjugate) d o not translate into a develop-a ble therapeutic candidate. ADCs p roduced to inevitably lead to the pro-d uction of multiple species of the A DC with the drug conjugated in v arying payloads of between one a nd nine molecules per immuno-g lobulin G (IgG). Furthermore, all s ites of conjugation are not equal. S ome conjugations interfere with a ntigen-binding epitopes, thereby r educing binding affinity and/o r drug half-life (1).

These sorts of approaches ar e attractive in that posttransla-t ional chemical coupling to a com-m on IgG construct with resulting e xtended half-life represents a plat-f orm amenable to many different s mall-molecule or peptide agonists.n on-nATUrAl Amino ACidST he introduction a mino acids (nnAAs), or those a mino acids not part of the 20 n aturally incorporated ones into p roteins, plays an important ro le in basic peptide and protein r esearch. They are increasingly u sed to develop biologics with e nhanced pharmacological prop-e rties beyond providing sites for d rug NnAAs can be i ntroduced through chemical syn-t hesis in peptides or biosyntheti-c ally in proteins. Currently, only p eptides and very small protein d rugs with nnAAs are on the mar-k et because they can be made syn-th etically and avoid the limitations o f cell-based expression systems. A p rominent example is ydroxyphenylglycine have been i ncorporated (3).T he opportunities to broaden p rotein diversity and properties w ith nnAAs are enormous, as is t he ability to incorporate chemical m odifications in proteins that can e ndow current biopharmaceuticals w ith improved or new properties. T hese chemical modifications can c hange the characteristics of pro-t eins, including ligand-binding spectroscopic cata-l ytic efficiency, and substrate speci-f icity. These modifications provide p ossibilities to develop biobetters a nd biosuperiors that have supe-r ior pharmacological properties, i ncluding improved safety profiles, l onger half-life, and enhanced a ctivity (4).M uch effort has been put into d eveloping technologies that e nsure a site-specific incorporation o f the nnAAs with a high rate of y ield. Various methods for site-spe-c ific introduction have been estab-l ished, both semisynthetic and re combinant methods. Few meth-o ds, however, have made it from t he bench at small-scale protein p roduction to commercial scale. A r ecently formed biotechnology c ompany, Redwood Biosciences, is u sing an approach based on the w ork of Carolyn Bertozzi's labora-t ory at the University of California, B erkeley. Her work focuses on g enetically encoded aldehyde t ags and aims to exploit a specific s equence (originally found within t he sequence of sulphatases) that i s posttranslationally recognized a nd modified by a formyl glycine-g to produce a s o-called aldehyde chemical han-d le (5). The incorporation of the C xPxR sequence at specific posi-t ions in candidate protein thera-p eutics provides a means p roduce a site-specific nnAA with a reactive aldehyde amenable to d rug conjugation.O ne of the oldest methods for n nAA incorporation into proteins u ses auxotrophic strains from E. col i that cannot synthesize a spe-c ific natural amino acid and thus h ave to uptake it from the growth m edium. A structurally similar n nAA can be supplied within the g rowth medium in place of the n atural amino acid and will be a lternatively incorporated into the p rotein. A major downside is that t he specific nnAA will be incor-p orated at every site coding for t he natural amino acid and can l ead to misfolding and impaired f unction of the target protein, o r the nnAA can be incorpo-r ated in the host-cell's proteins, w hich can have toxic effects (6). A llozyne has pioneered this type o f cell-based expression system t hat incorporates nnAAs into pro-t ein sequences, but this approach r equires extensive re-engineering o f the target protein sequence u sed, due to the region-specific n ature of the nnAA incorporation us ing this method.A mbrx has developed cell-based n nAA incorporation systems where E . coli or CHO cells are engineered w ith orthogonal pairs of transfer ( tRNA) and tRNA synthetases to c harge and incorporate nnAAs at s elected codons at specific points i n the coding sequence of the e xpressed protein. This approach i s a significant advance and pro-v ides answers to at least some of t he questions raised about nonspe-c ific sites of conjugations in ADCs. F or truly expanding the number a nd variety of nnAA that can be i ncorporated to determine the e ffect on function, even at a single a mino-acid position, the approach de mands significant investment to e ngineer further orthogonal pairs o f tRNA synthetases and tRNAs t hat can recognize a library of n nAAs. A further complication is that these pairs should be exqui-s itely selective over natural amino a cids to avoid their incorporation o ver the desired nnAA, which can b e challenging in a drug-manu-f acturing context with strict reg-u latory requirements. When this c hallenge is taken into account, a long with the variability in effi-c iency with which nnAAs are ab sorbed into the cell, these sys-t ems will not likely be amenable t o fast reiterative make-test cycles w ith libraries of nnAAs at multiple s ites of incorporation. A ll of these considerations sug-g est a clear need to move away f rom the conventional cell-based p rotein expression systems to a ddress the critical requirement f or a rapid make-test system that i s amenable to many parallel re-i terations of site-specific incor-p orations sequences or multi-p le nnAAs at multiple sites.

A n ideal cell-free protein produc-t ion platform would produce fully s oluble and correctly folded pro-t eins at high volumetric produc-t ivities at any scale. The platform w ould be rapidly and predictably o ptimized by systems-level pro-c ess design and control without t he demanding requirements f or maintaining cell viability a nd be readily adapted to high-t hroughput methods, including i n vitro evolution of proteins to a llow incorporation of nnAA into p olypeptides. The platform would b e based on simple batch systems u sing standard bioreactors that are k nown to scale to thousands of l iters for both cell fermentation a nd subsequent cell-free protein p roduction (10, 11).E arly efforts at developing s uch a system focused on pro-j ected costs that were much too h igh, as well as on proteins with d isulfide bonds that could not b e folded effectively. By focusing o n basic biochemical reactions a nd controlling cell-free metab-o lism, these limitations have been methodically addressed ( 12). Amino-acid supply has b een stabilized, and metabolism a ctivated to dramatically reduce s ubstrate costs by requiring only t he addition of nucleotide mono-p hosphates to drive energy pro-du ction. Commercially available in v itro transcription translation k its based on E. coli, wheat germ, r abbit reticulocytes, and insect-c ell extracts do not offer this a dvantage and are suitable only f or research exploration at small s cale. Control of the sulfhydryl r edox potential has been gained a nd a disulfide isomerase a dded to facilitate oxidative pro-t ein-folding (13). These advances n ot only suggest production fea-s ibility for pharmaceutical pro-t eins containing the 20 natural a mino acids, but they also pro-v ide enabling technology for i ncorporation of ercial s ystem (OCFS) developed by S wartz and collaborators can be o ptimized for high-level pro-d uction of proteins to allow for s cale-up to commercial levels o nce the target protein is identi-f ied (14). The authors expressed a m ultidisulfide-bonded protein, b iologically active granulocyte-m acrophage colony-stimulating f actor (rhGM-CSF), at titers of 7 00 mg/L in 10 h. Importantly, t hey could show that the product w as linearly scalable from start-i ng materials in 96-well plates up t o 100-L culture volume (14). The o pen nature of the system allows m ass spectrometry-based profil-i ng of the cell-free metabolome a nd proteome. Rapid testing of t he effects of addition and sub-t raction of various components f or system optimization can be m odeled without the require-m ents for tuning more complex c ellular networks required for maintaining cell viability com-m only encountered in mamma-l ian cell-line development.di FFiCUlT-To-ExPrESS ProTEinST he lack of a membrane-barrier i n the OCFS provides the oppor-t unity to express and study pro-t eins that are difficult to express i n cell-based systems.

Cell-free expression s ystems can provide a useful tool f or rapid screening and analysis of p rotein function, which is impor-t ant for protein-drug discovery a nd development. DNA molecules c an be amplified, transcribed, a nd translated in microplate wells a nd the expressed protein can be a ssayed immediately (15). Recently, H TS in a cell-free wheat germ s ystem led to the discovery of a n ovel malaria vaccine candidate ( 16). Finally, the linear scalability a llows proteins identified in dis-p lay-based selections and HTS to b e immediately scaled for produc-ti on of multiple gram quantities, t hus avoiding the delays and chal-l enges of conventional mammalian c ell line development.C urrently, cell-based expres-s ion technologies exhibit several l imitations with respect to pro-t ein production at all phases of t he drug discovery and develop-m ent pipeline. Rapid production o f proteins with novel chemical m odifications, such as ADCs, are p articularly challenging.

The aim i s to design a robust, economi-c al, and reproducible system that e nhances the overall performance o f the specific cell line. Typically, ce ll culture performance is assessed u sing a number of parameters, i ncluding cell density and viability. H owever, the defining parameter of a ny successful production system is i ncreased protein expression. T raditionally, optimal mamma-l ian cell growth was achieved by a dding animal sera, such as fetal b ovine serum (FBS) at a concen-t ration of 5-20% to basal m edia. Although sera may provide i mportant growth and regulatory f actors, their composition is com-p lex and undefined, which can l ead to batch-to-batch variability an d downstream processing chal-l enges. Furthermore, the potential f or contamination by adventitious a gents, such as viruses, prions, a nd bacteria, poses serious bio-s afety risks. This has led regula-t ory authorities such as the US F ood and Drug Administration a nd European Medicines Agency ( EMEA) to issue guidelines that u rge biomanufacturers to avoid in gredients of animal origin. R egulatory pressures related to s afety concerns are therefore driv-i ng the biopharmaceutical industry a way from the dominance of serum a s a media supplement, and toward t he use of serum-free, animal-com-p onent free, or even chemically d efined media (CDM) for both new a nd older manufacturing processes. S erum-Free MediaP lant-derived hydrolysates have b een routinely used to reduce or e liminate serum from traditional basal media formulations, often i n combination with a variety of a dditional supplements. These h ydrolysates are composed of a m ixture of peptides, amino acids, c arbohydrates, and lipids, and as a m ultitude of unidentified compo-n ents with indeterminate biologi-c al activity. They are produced by th e enzymatic or acidic digestion o f a given raw material from var-i ous plant sources including, but n ot limited to soy, wheat, and cot-t on. Some process scientists have b een reluctant to use plant-derived p rotein hydrolysates as medium s upplements because of their lack o f definition, which impairs their a bility to assess the root causes o f variability in their production pr ocesses. Recent improvements, i ncluding novel enzyme digestion t echniques, refined processing tech-n iques, automation, and formal c leaning validations have resulted i n more consistent hydrolysates sold under the trade name of HyPep and U ltraPep.1 These improved plant protein hydrolysates are widely a ccepted as performance-enhanc-i ng substitutes for animal-derived m edia components for a variety of c ell lines (e.g., hybridoma, BHK, CHO, Vero, MDCK).2- 4 Several biopharmaceuticals produced using p lant-derived protein hydrolysates h ave reached the market and many m ore are in various stages of devel-o pment.A s an alternative solution to tr been eveloped for biopharmaceuti-c al production s ubstrates. mix-t ures of biochemical constitu-e nts in CDM have been carefully d esigned to stimulate cell growth, m aintain good cell viability, and p romote high protein yields.

Partial Replacement of Chemically Dened Media with Plant-Derived Protein HydrolysatesP lant-derived hydrolysates can be used as valuable and p ractical tools to improve cell culture performance.J AMES BABCOCK, CHRISTOPHER WILCOX, HANS HUTTINGAA BSTRACT P rotein hydrolysates are routinely used as cell culture sup-p lements to enhance the overall performance of many b iopharmaceutical production systems. This enhance-m ent is subject to the additive effect of the native hydro-ly sate components and the supplemented growth or p roduction medium. Therefore, it is necessary to experi-m entally determine the proper hydrolysate dosage for a g iven hydrolysate medium combination that provides the d esired optimization effect such as better growth pro-m otion, enhanced cell viability, increased target protein pr oduction, or a combination of all three. In mammalian s ystems, hydrolysates have been used in combination w ith a variety of other supplements to help reduce or eliminate serum requirements in systems using traditional b asal media. Today, many high-performing, richly formu-l ated chemically defined media have become available as s tand-alone substrates for biopharmaceutical production. T his article shows that these chemically defined media c an benefit from the addition of hydrolysates and other s upplements. It also demonstrates that in other cases, plant-d erived hydrolysates can partially replace a significant por-t ion of the active ingredients in these rich media.

N ovember 2011 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm International 57Final WordE CONOMIC ChallENgEs T he diagnostics industry is provid-i ng new tools that could improve p roduct offerings to physicians and p atients and create value for share-h olders. Unfortunately, many diag-n ostics industry players believe the e conomics of innovation are under-m ined by low pricing and reimburse-m ent of tests, and the diagnostics p artner's low share of prescription-di agnostic (Rx-Dx) partnership val-u es. In this context, it is important t hat the government and its agencies s upport required changes. According t o research by PwC, diagnostics com-p anies are seeking action in three m ain areas, as outlined below.P ricingP ricing should reflect the value of t he test rather than its cost. The price s hould reflect a reasonable propor-t ion of the test benefits or the cost s avings. In the US, the concept of v alue-based pricing is making grad-u al progress. Europe, however, has y et to see value-based pricing applied t o a personalized medicine test. The di agnostics industry fears, according t o PwC research, that unless pricing i s adapted to value creation, it will f ail to achieve sufficient economic r eturn to stimulate continued invest-m ent and innovation. R eimbursementT he process to gain reimbursement f or diagnostics should be accelerated a nd harmonized across countries. In many countries, reimbursement f or a new test can take four to seven y ears following marketing clear-an ce. Industry participants believe t hat health technology assessment ( HTA) models need to be adapted t o allow for faster reimbursement de cisions. One practical solution to a ddress reimbursement delays has b een companion test subsidies from th e bio/pharmaceutical partner. T his is not ideal; but in cases where t he test determines drug eligibility; t he alternative would be that severe l imitations would be placed on drug a vailability. This arrangement may n ot be acceptable to industry.D iversity of health technol-o gy assessment procedures across c ountries is another issue in multi-c ountry product launches. This p roblem has been recognized by the E uropean Commission, which has s ponsored the European network f or Health Technology Assessment t o work on greater cooperation. The U S is also represented in this initia-t ive through the Center for Medical T echnology Policy. Va lueT he share of value going to the diag-n ostic in Rx-Dx partnerships should b e revisited. Diagnostics companies a re concerned about not getting a f air share of the overall value of Rx-D x combinations when negotiating d eal terms with bio/pharmaceutical p artners, and that they suffer from h istorically low recognition of the value of diagnostics. Traditionally, d iagnostics represent less than 2% of h ealthcare spend despite influencing m ore than 60% of crucial healthcare de cisions. Diagnostics partners are f ocused on trying to rebalance their s hare of the financial value in Rx-Dx c ombinations. O ne avenue that diagnostics com-p anies are pursuing is to obtain a ro yalty on sales of the companion p roduct. Companies have resisted s uch a move because they believe the D x partner has not shared the risk o r investment associated with drug d evelopment. Diagnostics players i nsist that this move should happen, a rguing that where Rx-Dx combina-t ions are relevant, the companion d rug would not be able to make it t hrough clinical trials or be reim-b ursed and commercialized without th e companion diagnostic. Thus, the v alue of the drug is critically depen-de nt on the contribution of the com-p anion diagnostic. I n the near-term, these chal-l enges are not expected to under-m ine the pace of Rx-Dx deal a ctivity. However, they may affect lo ng-term diagnostics innovation if t hey are not addressed. At best, not a ddressing these economic issues c ould result in an undervaluing of d iagnostic innovation by pharma. A t worst, these issues could eventu-a lly discourage continued invest-m ent into diagnostics ventures and de lay patient access to important ne w health technology.

Analysts are projecting billion-d ollar revenues for some new drugs linked to c ompanion diagnostics. A s the pharmaceutical industry develops more t argeted therapeutics, and their interdependence w ith companion diagnostics grows, companies are c onsidering ways to access diagnostics technology t o complement their evolving product portfolios. T he main strategy has been to seek companion di agnostic solutions by forming partnerships with di agnostic companies. Yet, the allocation of the o verall financial value of the drug-diagnostic com-b ination a challenge.s ompanion diagnostics partnerships in the indus-t ry more than tripled in 2010 compared with 2 008, and the pace of deal activity has continued d uring the first half of 2011. The rising number o f partnerships reflects the increasing seriousness w ith which bio/pharmaceutical companies view b iomarker and diagnostic programs designed to a ccompany their drug-development efforts. They a re making more systematic use of companion d iagnostic programs to increase drug response r ates and reduce side effects. Diagnostic companies, p articularly those with strong molecular and tissue d iagnostic capabilities, have been active in devel-o ping tools to respond to industry's specific needs. D riving the momentum in companion diag-n ostics partnership activity is the increasing ro le of diagnostics in the regulatory approval, r eimbursement, and performance optimization o f new drugs. Increasingly, regulatory agencies i nsist on validated diagnostics prior to consider-i ng marketing clearance. In addition, the grow-i ng use of tests that identify patients who would n ot benefit from certain therapies has raised the bar for obtaining reimbursement for new drugs. I ncreasingly, payers see companion diagnostics a s useful tools to allocate healthcare funds more e ffectively and to control costs. Many health-c are professionals insist on specialist testing b efore prescribing and reimbursing treatment r egimens that are expensive and not efficacious i n certain patient subpopulations.I n the US, some pharmacy benefit managers a re adapting their business models by forming p artnerships with, or acquiring, specialist clini-c al laboratories. Payers' preference for drugs that c ome with a companion test, particularly when t hese drugs are expensive and may lead to severe s ide effects, will likely increase over time with the r ising pressure on healthcare budgets and greater a vailability of appropriate diagnostic tools.t hE PartNErs: thE rx/hyphen.capDx COMbINatION B io/pharmaceutical companies have achieved s ome success in seeking improvements in drug-r esponse profiles through better patient target-i ng. For example, drug-response rates of up to 8 0% have been reported for targeted subpopu-l ations for cancers that generally have a 20% r esponse rate.T he prospect of repeating such technological w ins is encouraging industry to accept changes t hat appear increasingly inevitable, including t he decline of the mass-market blockbuster drug m odel, the emergence of smaller targeted mar-k ets, and the need for high-performance diag-n ostic tools to dominate well-defined smaller ma rket segments.O n the supply side, the technological fea-s ibility of companion diagnostic programs is i ncreasing. Companies continue to develop r elevant expertise in molecular and tissue diag-n ostics, which will enable the development of b etter tools to guide treatment decisions. by gerry McDougall, a principal at P ricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC), and lo\u00efc K ubitza, a director in PwC's Pharmaceutical & life sciences advisory services group, g erald.j.mcdougall@us.pwc.com.lo ic.x.kubitza@iu.pwc.com.M.
