She had difficulty participating on sports, had anxiety at school and sleepless nights. She had been prescribed steroid inhalers for her breathing problems by her pediatrician.

Her job performance became poor and she was feeling depressed because she couldn't accomplish much work for the day, she was not able to cook for her family in times when she was feeling weak and tired. We did some laboratory tests based on her symptoms and health condition, we then gave her a treatment plan that consisted of diet changes, vitamins and supplements and a detox plan. Part of the treatment plan also consisted of first accurately diagnosing her food sensitivities and avoiding them. She was also given vitamins and supplements to improve her condition. Making her understand and knowing the reasons as to why she had these symptoms is what differentiated this clinic from others that gave her prescriptions without fully understanding her situation.

It was horrible because she didn't always feel that she could be at the best of her performance, felt older than she was.

After being on a holiday and having her stomach continually acting up, she decided she did not want to live with it anymore and decided to look for an alternative treatment. Lucky for her, she came across our website and decided that she would give it a try.

[*](testimonials.html#Disclaimer) A client was suffering from an ulcerative colitis flare up due to an overly stressed body. She had been suffering from infrequent bouts of colitis for over 13 years ago, and the colitis had been worsening through the years. Symptoms included an inflamed gastrointestinal tract and bowel. These symptoms had become very worrisome because 8 months prior, she had suffered from a stroke, which was brought on from complications from a severe colitis flare up. At this point conventional medicine wasn't working as planned. Our approach was to first find out if her body wasn't tolerating certain foods, and to eliminate them from her diet in order to start the healing process. We tested her blood, stool and saliva test and she then received a comprehensive outline of foods that she needed to eliminate and reduce from her diet. This shed some light on things that were going on inside her body. With conventional medicine, she had never advised that her diet and stress could be the cause of colitis or what steps she should take to reduce or eliminate flare ups. Her treatment plan consisted of taking medical food to calm the inflammation, supplements and vitamins to boost her immune system, and acupuncture to relieve stress and bring balance back to her body. She noticed IMPROVEMENTS IN HER HEALTH WITHIN 4 WEEKS OF STARTING THE ELIMINATION DIET AND THE TREATMENT PLAN. This was fast because in the past, her colitis symptoms persisted for up to 3 months each time she had a flare up and her episodes had become more frequent and severe throughout the years where it was beginning to do real damage to her body. [*](testimonials.html#Disclaimer) Her health has benefited from naturopathic / natural medicine tremendously. She is now more aware than ever before that everything she puts inside her body is very important to her health and well being. She feels revitalized and hopeful that her colitis may be a thing of the past, now that she is knowledgeable of what she must do to remain healthy. Naturopathic medicine has made a big difference in her life and health as she now has the tools required in order to live a healthier and happier life. A client in his early 30's was been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. His symptoms included fatigue, lower back pain, blurry vision, headaches, weakness, lack of energy and painful legs. The severity of the symptoms prevented him from working, and he had to go on long-term benefits. He needed to recover to go back to work. Being on all sorts of Western Medications, he felt more sickness and very depressed! We SYSTEMICALLY FOUND THE ROOT CAUSE OF HIS PROBLEMS, instead of covering up the symptoms, which his neurologist had done happily. We understood that most of his problems were imbalances in his energy, diet and emotions, and Western medicine didn't acknowledge these simple factors. We created a suitable, systemic natural treatment plan for his body's specific needs. It started with first, a proper diagnosis of the energetic and nutritional state of his body. Then, we started weeding out food allergens with proper blood food intolerance tests. We then started a diet plan, acupuncture and nutritional supplementation, and he HAS NEVER FELT BETTER! WITHIN 2 MONTHS, he was definitely feeling better and able to return to work. He has been doing really well without the use of any prescription medication, which were expensive and ineffective and had many unsafe side effects. He now feels like a new person, the way he did before MS [*](testimonials.html#Disclaimer) came along. He has the energy to carry out daily activities and enjoy his life again. He never thought it possible after suffering for more than a year. His back and legs are NO LONGER PAINFUL. His transient headaches are gone. Most of all, he no longer feels the overwhelming fatigue! His health has improved drastically, not only with respect to multiple sclerosis, but all aspects of his health (digestion and proper elimination of toxins in the body).

Her chronic sleep disturbance improved by 70% and continued to improve. Menopausal symptoms have virtually disappeared, there was a general sense of energy and well being. The patient was quite satisfied with our thorough and knowledgeable application of Naturopathic Medicine.

Overall her health has improved tremendously and she felt emotionally and physically energized, positive and motivated. [*](testimonials.html#Disclaimer) A woman in her 40's had been smoking for a better part of her life. Being a smoker made her lungs sore, made her feel guilty and her partner didn't like it either. It lowered her self- esteem as a person. She had tried to quit unsuccessfully a few times before she came to the Nature's Intentions Naturopathic Clinic. She found our approach to healing quite very different - We combined acupuncture and hypnosis and natural supplements which helped her quit smoking WITHIN 2 WEEKS of starting the program.

These symptoms were taking over her life and others because she was constantly talking about them. She decided to seek alternative help after having tried all sorts of antibiotics and various medications - most of which did nothing! We conducted series of laboratory / medical tests to determine what is wrong with her body before starting her on any natural supplements. Her course of natural treatment plan consisted of first scientific tests, supplements and diet. Within 2 months, she felt much better.
