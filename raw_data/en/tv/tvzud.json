Guidelines are now published for more than 60 tumor types, subtypes, and topics. During the NCCN's 28th Annual Conference, updates to the NCCN Guidelines were presented for several tumor types. We briefly describe here the latest key recommendations. Colon Cancer \"We tried to more clearly differentiate the algorithms for mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR/MSI-H) and mismatch repair-proficient tumors.\" \u2014Aparna R. Parikh, MD For the treatment of colon cancer, Breakthrough Therapy designations and approvals have recently been granted for KRAS G12C inhibitors, BRAF V600E inhibitors, and the tucatinib and trastuzumab combination for HER2-amplified metastatic disease. These developments indicate a promising future for an expanded arsenal of treatment options in colon cancer, according to the panelists who discussed this malignancy at the conference: Aparna R. Parikh, MD Midhun Malla, MD, MS Katrina S. Pedersen, MD, MS Aparna R. Parikh, MD, Assistant Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, and Director, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center's Global Cancer Care Program; Midhun Malla, MD, MS, Assistant Professor of Medicine, West Virginia University Cancer Institute; and Katrina S. Pedersen, MD, MS, Associate Professor of Medicine, Siteman Cancer Center, Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine. The NCCN Guidelines have largely been restructured to reflect the different approaches for patients whose tumors are mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR or microsatellite unstable [MSI-H]) vs those with microsatellite-stable (MSS) tumors. This applies not only to the metastatic disease setting but now to the neoadjuvant setting as well. In the treatment of the primary tumor, patients with dMMR/MSI-H clinical T4b tumors can be considered for neoadjuvant therapy with a checkpoint inhibitor (preferred); this list now includes single-agent dostarlimab-gxly in addition to single-agent pembrolizumab and oxaliplatin) and CAPEOX (capecitabine/oxaliplatin) remaining the alternative options. Neoadjuvant therapy for patients with MMR-proficient/MSS tumors is with FOLFOX or CAPEOX. This same neoadjuvant approach can also be taken for resectable oligometastatic disease. Dostarlimab was added as a category 2A recommendation for the neoadjuvant treatment of dMMR/MSI-H resectable synchronous liver-alone and/or resectable dostarlimab, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab with or without ipilimumab were added as category 2A options. Other updates include the following additions: Bladder Cancer \"We are getting closer to [optimizing a] targeted, personalized therapy for our patients with bladder cancer.\" \u2014Arlene O. Siefker-Radtke, MD Targeted agents have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic urothelial cancer. The NCCN Guidelines still recommend platinum-based chemotherapy as the front-line standard, but these older regimens may potentially be replaced by targeted immunotherapeutic agents, according to Arlene O. Siefker-Radtke, MD, Professor of Genitourinary Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Arlene O. Siefker-Radtke, MD The NCCN Guidelines state that single-agent pembrolizumab is an option for patients who cannot tolerate platinum-based front-line therapy. The NCCN Guidelines have been updated to include atezolizumab as another alternative. Moreover, for patients achieving a response or stable disease after front-line platinum-based chemotherapy, maintenance treatment with avelumab can now be considered. This recent category 1 recommendation provides clinicians with more options to improve long-term outcomes in the setting of metastatic urothelial cancer, Dr. Siefker-Radtke said. Newer targeted options entered the NCCN Guidelines for metastatic urothelial cancer more than 1 year ago, \"but they may still be new in the minds of many,\" she said. They include the following agents: The NCCN Guidelines should soon reflect the approval of enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab, a combination with the potential to change the front-line standard for cisplatin-ineligible patients with bladder cancer. \"Maybe we now have a strategy that can beat platinum in general and result in less toxic therapy for our patients,\" she said. Kidney Cancer \"At this point in time, we have no studies with a background of individuals who have experienced disease progression on a contemporary doublet.... We want that to change.\" \u2014Eric Jonasch, MD The key updates to the NCCN Guidelines in kidney cancer were centered on subsequent therapies, according to Eric Jonasch, MD, Professor, Department of Genitourinary Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. \"We now have treatments separated out for individuals who received prior immunotherapy and for those who are immunotherapy-naive,\" he said. Eric Jonasch, MD For patients with advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma who experience disease progression on front-line agents, the NCCN Guidelines do not offer a list of \"preferred\" regimens. For immunotherapy-naive patients, inhibitor is reasonable, based on anecdotal evidence and smaller studies, he said. For patients who have received prior immunotherapy, the treatment choice becomes more challenging, and includes both single agents and doublets. \"It's still evolving, but I think the main point is to look at the comorbidities of patients and their previous treatments and choose a regimen based on those factors,\" he said. \"Most of the time, you are going to see some kind of benefit from one of these regimens in the subsequent-line setting.\" Additions to the NCCN Guidelines in advanced kidney cancer follow: Malignant Glioma \"Using the [re]classification of gliomas by the World Health Organization criteria, we can resolve a lot of cases that otherwise were a bit of a coin toss.\" \u2014Craig M. Horbinski, MD, PhD An update in the treatment of malignant glioma were presented by L. Burt Nabors, MD, Vice-Chair for Research of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Professor and Director of Neuro-Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham O'Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center, and Craig M. Horbinski, MD, PhD, Professor of Pathology and Neurological Surgery and Director of Neuropathology, Northwestern University and Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Chicago. L. Burt Nabors, MD Craig M. Horbinski, MD, PhD The fifth edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of central nervous system tumors, which was published in 2021, regrouped diffuse gliomas into two primary categories: adult-type and pediatric-type. The former, which was the focus of the presentation at the NCCN Annual Conference, comprises and IDH-wild-type new classifications have been incorporated into the NCCN Guidelines, Dr. Horbinski said. Dr. Nabors described additional updates related to the NCCN recommendation for the separate treatment of grade 2 and 3 astrocytomas, which he noted are based on the results of two phase III trials that demonstrated survival benefits: RTOG 9802 and CATNON. Based on these findings, the NCCN Guidelines for IDH-mutated astrocytoma and Karnofsky Performance Status 60 now recommend the following: Esophageal or Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer \"Until immunotherapy came along, we had been stuck for a while with cytotoxic chemotherapy. But now, we have immune checkpoint inhibitors, which when added to cytotoxic drugs will increase the survival of patients with recurrent metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.\" \u2014Michael K. Gibson, MD, PhD The key update to the NCCN Guidelines for treating esophageal cancer is the addition of immunotherapy to chemotherapy in the first-line setting for recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, according to Michael K. Gibson, MD, PhD, Director of Translational Research for Esophago-Gastric Cancer and Associate Professor of Medicine, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville. Michael K. Gibson, MD, PhD Three large randomized clinical trials\u2014KEYNOTE-590 for pembrolizumab, CheckMate 648 for nivolumab, and ESCORT-1st for camrelizumab\u2014have shown that a survival benefit can be achieved by adding immunotherapy to a chemotherapy backbone. This has led to the NCCN panel's consensus on the efficacy of these regimens and the recommendation of pembrolizumab and nivolumab in the NCCN Guidelines for advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, Dr. Gibson said. Also of note, the section on next-generation sequencing has been updated to better guide the selection of targeted agents. At present, these agents include trastuzumab, selpercatinib, pembrolizumab/nivolumab, entrectinib/larotrectinib, and dabrafenib/trametinib. The panel also revisited the NCCN Guidelines for surveillance after successful local therapy for esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancers. The optimal surveillance strategy for these patients has remained controversial, with no high-level evidence to guide the development of algorithms that balance benefits and risks (including cost) within this cohort, Dr. Gibson said. The NCCN has now provided guidance for individualized stage-specific surveillance, with recommendations that vary according to the depth of tumor invasion and treatment modality. For patients with stage II or III tumors, those treated with bimodality therapy (ie, definitive chemoradiation) should undergo surveillance with esophagoduodenoscopy for at least 24 months, whereas those receiving trimodality therapy may forgo esophagoduodenoscopy but should be monitored for at least 36 months, the panel recommended. Listed here are other updates for esophageal cancer: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer \"The guidelines now recommend the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in addition to the use of induction or adjuvantchemotherapy for some patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer.\" \u2014Gregory J. Riely, MD, PhD In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), tumor histology and the status of PD-L1 drive treatment selection. The NCCN Guidelines now include, for patients with stage II or III disease, the option of adjuvant pembrolizumab or atezolizumab to follow chemotherapy, said Gregory J. Riely, MD, PhD, Attending Physician and Vice-Chair of Clinical Research, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York. Gregory J. Riely, MD, PhD New to the NCCN Guidelines as well is the addition of neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus immunotherapy as a recommended treatment approach in a subset of patients. The NCCN Guidelines state: \"All patients should be evaluated for preoperative therapy, with strong consideration for nivolumab plus chemotherapy in those patients with tumors 4 cm or node-positive and no contraindications to immune checkpoint inhibitors.\" Multiple molecular targets have been identified in NSCLC, with agents now approved in the first-line setting for patients with alterations in EGFR, ALK, ROS1, RET,MET exon 14, and BRAF. \"In addition, new therapies are addressing targets we've not been able to target before, and we now have data for them in the second-line setting,\" Dr. Riely said. These new agents and their corresponding targets include fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki for HER2-mutant tumors, amivantamab and adagrasib for KRAS G12C-mutant tumors. The NCCN Guidelines now recommend these agents as second-line options in the appropriate patients. Multiple Myeloma \"Immunotherapy is where myeloma is going in the next few years, in a big way.\" \u2014Natalie S. Callander, MD In multiple myeloma, rapid changes in the treatment landscape have resulted in the \"downgrading\" of alkylators, anthracyclines, and thalidomide, given that multiple alternatives are much more effective, said Natalie S. Callander, MD, Professor of Medicine, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, and Director, Myeloma Clinical Program, Carbone Cancer Center. Although quadruplet induction regimens in newly diagnosed patients became part of the NCCN's recommendations more than a year ago, \"there is now increased enthusiasm\" about this approach, Dr. Callander said. These regimens, which typically include daratumumab, are backed by a strong body of phase II data, early phase III data, \"and the expectation that we will have a large phase III trial sustaining the use of quadruplet therapy,\" she said. Natalie S. Callander, MD \"However, immunotherapy is where myeloma is going in the next few years, in a big way,\" she added. This includes chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, a growing number of antibody-drug conjugates and bispecific T-cell engagers, and naked antibodies, many which target the myeloma-specific B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA). \"Therapeutics with new targets are also in development.\" To this end, the NCCN Guidelines have been updated to recommend the BCMA-targeting bispecific antibody teclistimab, which has proved effective in patients who are refractory to three or more classes of drugs. The NCCN Guidelines also recognize that BCMA-targeted, CAR T-cell products have a useful role in patients who can afford a 4- to 6-week delay during their manufacturing. Two commercially available CAR T-cell products\u2014idecabtagene vicleucel and ciltacabtagene autoleucel\u2014have been added to the treatment options. Newer CAR T-cell products with shorter manufacturing times are in development. \"We just don't know the optimal sequence of these treatments yet. At our center, we tend to move first to the bispecific T-cell engagers because they are more available. For fitter patients, we can start discussing and planning for CAR-T,\" Dr. Callandar said. The NCCN panel recently agreed to endorse the Second Revised International Stage System for multiple myeloma, meaning this should soon appear in the NCCN Guidelines. This more nuanced staging system evaluates cytogenetic risk in greater detail, resulting in three levels of risk rather than two. Metastatic Breast Cancer \"The introduction of newer therapies and combination treatments has allowed for a more nuanced approach to treating breast cancer, leading to improved patient outcomes.\" \u2014William J. Gradishar, MD In metastatic breast cancer, the latest update to the NCCN Guidelines reflects the growing importance of combination therapies and personalized medicine in managing estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-positive, and triple-negative subtypes of breast cancer, according to William J. Gradishar, MD, the Betsy Branson Professor of Breast Oncology, Professor of Medicine, and Chief, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago. William J. Gradishar, MD \"Although the traditional endocrine therapies, such as aromatase inhibitors, tamoxifen, and fulvestrant, have shown benefits in treating estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, they also present limitations, including the development of ESR1 [resistance] mutations and various toxicity issues,\" said Dr. Gradishar. Thus, options for treatment after disease progression in recurrent or metastatic disease have expanded to include the selective estrogen degrader elacestrant, PI3K inhibitors, and other targeted agents, which are reflected by the following additions to the NCCN Guidelines in patients with corresponding biomarkers: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma \"There has been a shift toward using second-generation BTK inhibitors because of their comparable efficacy and reduced toxicity.\" \u2014Deborah M. Stephens, DO The NCCN Guidelines underscore the need for an individualized approach to treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). For front-line a patient's IGHV status, del (17p)/TP53 mutation status, age, and comorbidities. In choosing subsequent therapy, factors to consider include prior therapy, comorbidities, and resistance mutations, said Deborah M. Stephens, DO, Director of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Lymphoma Program, Associate Professor of Hematology and Hematology Malignancies, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah. Deborah M. Stephens, DO Updated recommendations for treatment have separated patients according to the presence or absence of del(17p)/TP53 mutations. Key updates based on this stratification include the following: Recurrent or Metastatic Cervical Cancer \"KEYNOTE-826 moved the combination of pembrolizumab, platinum, and paclitaxel, plus or minus bevacizumab, into the first-line choice for patients with recurrent/advanced disease\u2014in sites where the regimen is available.\" \u2014Nadeem R. Abu-Rustum, MD With immune checkpoint inhibitors having proved beneficial in cervical cancer, the NCCN Guidelines recommend that all patients with recurrent or progressive cervical cancer be tested for PD-L1 expression. In addition, Nadeem R. Abu-Rustum, MD where possible, testing for DNA mismatch repair status (deficient vs proficient) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) is also recommended. Although they are rare, NTRK gene fusions are seen in patients with cervical sarcoma, as are RET fusions in patients with advanced disease; with targeted agents available for these tumors, testing for these alterations can be beneficial, said Nadeem R. Abu-Rustum, MD, Chief, Gynecology Service, and the Avon Chair in Gynecologic Oncology Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York. The key update to the NCCN Guidelines for cervical cancer is the incorporation of pembrolizumab. Here is how the NCCN Guidelines have incorporated this checkpoint inhibitor: As Dr. Abu-Rustum pointed out, although pembrolizumab-based regimens are effective, their use requires specific pathologic testing, and the drugs are expensive; thus, this NCCN-recommended approach may not be feasible in countries with limited resources, where most cervical cancer occurs. Second-line options may include cisplatin/paclitaxel with bevacizumab or carboplatin/paclitaxel and bevacizumab. In rare cases of tumors with PD-L1 positivity, RET gene fusions, and NTRK gene fusions, such as nivolumab, selpercatinib, and larotrectinib or entrectinib, respectively, are listed in the NCCN Guidelines as \"useful in certain circumstances.\" For small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix, the following drugs were added as \"other\" recommended regimens in the or carboplatin plus paclitaxel. Several single agents were added for treating this tumor in the second or subsequent line. Hepatobiliary Cancer \"Biliary tract cancer is the most targetable and actionable gastrointestinal tract cancer....Genomic profiling is the standard of care in the management of these cancers.\" \u2014Mitesh J. Borad, MD Updates in hepatobiliary cancers were presented at the conference by Mitesh J. Borad, MD, Director of the Cancer Cell, Gene, and Virus Therapy Lab, Director of the Liver and Biliary Cancer Research Program, and Director of Precision Cancer Therapeutics, Center for Individualized Medicine, Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center, Scottsdale, Arizona. Mitesh J. Borad, MD Of most importance, the NCCN Guidelines for hepatobiliary cancers have been reorganized into separate Guidelines for hepatocellular carcinoma and biliary tract cancers. The text was also revised to have more \"patient-centered\" language. Most of the changes in hepatobiliary cancer, as with other malignancies, pertained to the incorporation of checkpoint inhibitors, mainly durvalumab. The TOPAZ-1 trial evaluated the addition of durvalumab to gemcitabine/cisplatin; it found improvements in overall survival, progression-free survival, and response, without a meaningful increase in toxicity over chemotherapy alone. \"The combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin plus durvalumab represents a new standard of care,\" Dr. Borad said. Highlights of the updated NCCN Guidelines for liver cancer follow: Metastatic Prostate Cancer \"Although androgen-deprivation therapy is still the backbone of therapy for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, the treatment landscape has progressed to doublet and triplet therapies.\" \u2014Archana Ajmera, MSN, ANP-BC, AOCNP Treatment decisions for metastatic prostate cancer are often dictated by tumor location, biology, and health status of the patient, despite androgen-deprivation therapy being a well-established standard of care in this disease setting. At the conference, the nuances of and updates to the treatment of this malignancy were discussed by Rana R. McKay, MD, Associate Professor of Medicine and Urology; nurse practitioner Archana Ajmera, MSN, ANP-BC, AOCNP, both of the University of San Diego Moores Cancer Center; and Kelly L. Stratton, MD, Associate Professor of Urologic Oncology, University of Oklahoma Health Stephenson Cancer Center. Rana R. McKay, MD Archana Ajmera, MSN, ANP-BC, AOCNP Kelly L. Stratton, MD The NCCN Guidelines offer category 1 evidence from phase III studies to support the efficacy of doublet therapy upon a backbone of androgen-deprivation therapy plus abiraterone, apalutamide, or enzalutamide. Category 1 evidence also supports triplet therapy with androgen-deprivation therapy plus docetaxel and either abiraterone or darolutamide. This evidence is reflected in the updated NCCN Guidelines for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer: Ovarian Cancer \"The results of the studies are impressive. They suggest we may be changing the natural history of ovarian cancer by giving PARP inhibitors to women with BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer.\" \u2014Joyce F. Liu, MD, MPH Joyce F. Liu, MD, MPH Although established as effective targeted agents for ovarian cancer, PARP inhibitors have recently been associated with some mixed results in some settings in the treatment of ovarian cancer. \"The PARP inhibitor space has gotten to be more complex,\" according to Joyce F. Liu, MD, MPH, Associate Chief and Director of Clinical Research, Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The NCCN Guidelines have addressed these recent developments in the following updates: In another important update, the NCCN panel added the antibody-drug conjugate mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx, which targets folate receptor alfa (FR), as a \"preferred\" treatment for recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer in patients with high FR expression. Clinicians should be aware of the black box warning for ocular toxicities and should carefully follow instructions for monitoring and supportive care, she emphasized.
