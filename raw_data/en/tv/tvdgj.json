There are two main things they can do. 1. Invest in the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator [The ACT-Accelerator](https://www.who.int/initiatives/act-accelerator) is a global collaboration of health organisations, scientists, businesses, civil society, governments and philanthropies, including Wellcome, working together to get lifesaving tests, treatments and vaccines from the laboratory to the front line. However, its progress is at grave risk due to significant underfunding. A [$16.8 billion funding gap for the ACT-Accelerator](https://www.who.int/initiatives/act-accelerator/funding-tracker) is hindering the rollout of Covid-19 tools in many low- and middle-income countries, putting millions of lives at risk. We're calling for leaders to look outwards and contribute their fair share to making tests, treatments and vaccines available to all, by investing in the ACT-Accelerator. 2. Donate excess vaccine doses through COVAX Covid-19 vaccination rates are accelerating across the world. But the majority of vaccinations so far have been in wealthy countries, leaving large parts of the global population unprotected. Science has given us the exit route from this pandemic, but it will only work if its benefits can reach the maximum number of people around the world. We're calling for rich countries that have secured lots of excess vaccine doses to [donate these through COVAX](https://www.gavi.org/covax-facility), who will ensure that vaccines go where they are needed most.
