Some five thousand years ago, herbs were considered to be lifesavers. The oldest surviving text of Chinese herbal pharmacology, extensively detailed a life-saving prescription of mixing camphor and cannabis. Then Sumerians (considered to be the creators of human civilization as know it) also wrote about life saving prescriptions of thyme. But then with the advancement of science and technology, herbs lost their appeal. Since herbs have always taken time to deliver desired results, we didn't have the patience to see how magical herbs are. However, [herbs have made a supreme comeback](https://www.indiatimes.com/lifestyle/why-having-a-work-best-friend-might-be-the-best-thing-for-your-career-376407.html) and are now regaining their luster for their curing, ailing and beautifying properties. A private herb garden has now become a status symbol. Chefs and doctors can't stop raving about the magic of herbs.

And then many conversations after drowning my sorrows someone recommended to buy spearmint and as they say rest is history. I got a job which got me wealth and luck was in abundance too! Sometimes we need to keep our logic on the side and just keep an open heart and see the magic of other living things. 5. Dandelion Pexels Best known for: adaptability and strength.

Patchouli Unsplash Best known for: luck, luck and more luck. I have always been an ardent believer in how you need a little bit of luck on your side to fulfill or successfully complete anything. For those who believe their luck to be down, fill your garden or balcony with patchouli and see how luck favors you. 9. Lemongrass Unsplash Best known for: bringing prosperity and removing pain.
