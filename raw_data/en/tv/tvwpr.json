Are you dealing with a pain condition and searching for relief? [Contact MegaMotion Physical Therapy](https://mechanotherapy.physio/contact/) to learn more information on how acupuncture could benefit you. What is acupuncture treatment? Based on the scientific study of musculoskeletal and neuromuscular systems, acupuncture therapy is a method of treatment used to relieve pain, especially in the back and neck, as well as cases of osteoarthritis. This method has been around for ages! In fact, [Practical Pain Management](https://www.practicalpainmanagement.com/patient/treatments/alternative/role-acupuncture-treating-chronic-pain) explains the origins of acupuncture, stating: \"Acupuncture (a branch of traditional Chinese medicine, or TCM) is a practice 3,500 years older than traditional Western medicine. It works by applying needles, heat, and pressure to specific points on the body. The theory is that invigorating these points releases or redirects the body's natural energy known as chi or qi because illness and pain come from blockages or imbalances of this vital life force.\" Modern methods of acupuncture are strictly based on Western medicine principles and research. It provides an environment that enhances the body's ability to heal, ultimately reducing pain in the process. When performing acupuncture, an acupuncturist will insert a sterile acupuncture needle through the skin, into the underlying tendons, ligaments, or muscles that have been affected, in order to relieve pain, decrease muscle tension, and improve mobility. Your acupuncturist will likely choose to insert needles into acupoints at the site of your pain, but may also choose \"distal\" acupoints. Distal points are believed to open up specific pathways that work in conjunction with the pathways opened at the local acupoints. Will acupuncture hurt? Many people assume that because needles are involved, acupuncture treatment is excruciatingly painful. This isn't true! In fact, most of the patients we see report feeling little to no discomfort when undergoing acupuncture treatments. Our highly-trained acupuncturist knows how to make the process as easy and painless as possible; however, some patients may still experience a \"twitch response\" when the needle is inserted. Patients compare this twitch to a quick muscle cramp. There may be some residual soreness in the 24-48 hours following treatment, however, this is nothing to be concerned of and will typically dissipate on its own. Acupuncture sessions often take less than 30 minutes. The number of recommended visits varies depending on the complexity of the problem, but some people report significant relief after a single session! Benefits of acupuncture treatment There are several benefits of acupuncture treatments, perhaps the largest one being that it is a safe, holistic, and effective form of treatment. In fact, many cases where opioids are prescribed could be avoided by simply participating in acupuncture treatments! Acupuncture has been used to treat several diverse conditions, from chronic pain sufferers to athletes experiencing delayed onset muscle soreness. It can speed up recovery time and allow you to return to doing the things you love as fast as possible, all without the use of expensive surgeries or addictive medications. Acupuncture needles help to release the body's natural painkillers which short-circuit the loop of pain and stiffness, in addition to halting the body's anticipation of pain. Two of the main outcomes of acupuncture are neurohormone production and endorphin release. - Neurohormone production. Substances like dopamine are released by your body's glandular system through strategic placement of acupuncture needles. The needles stimulate the glands so that their secretion is regulated in a more pain-suppressing manner. Dopamine also plays a role in relieving muscular and emotional tension, further enhancing the effects of the acupuncture treatment. - Endorphin release. These mood-boosting and pain-suppressing opioid neuropeptides are released by your nervous system by stimulation, such as exercise and acupuncture therapy. You will experience pain relief and easing of muscle tension in the area most directly related to your pain.
