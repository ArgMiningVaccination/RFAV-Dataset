Sawah, who earned her Master of Science in pharmaceutical sciences in 1994 and her PharmD in 1999 from UKCOP , is a board-certified pharmacotherapy specialist who has spent most of her career serving others and saving lives. Since 2011, Sawah has dedicated her pharmacy career and personal life towards aiding those affected by the Syrian war and the resulting humanitarian crisis in Syria and Turkey. She is also the co-founder of the non-profit Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations-USA (UOSSM USA) and currently serves as president of the organization in the U.S. In March of 2011, Syrian citizens participated in a series of peaceful demonstrations against their dictatorship in hopes of pushing the country toward democracy. However, the Syrian government did not take these actions lightly, and Syrians received brutal and violent responses, particularly through the detainment and torture of eleven schoolchildren from southern Syria, even discarding one child's remains on his parents' doorstep. After witnessing these horrific events, Sawah felt a calling to leave her home in Ohio to go and use her pharmacy and healthcare expertise in humanitarian efforts.As the crisis continued, millions of people pleaded for humanitarian action and medical assistance in Syria, where roughly 80% of the population was without access to safe water, food or shelter. Being a pharmacist, Sawah recognized the immediate outcomes of Syrian living conditions; infectious disease outbreaks and communicable diseases were rampant through the region. At the same time, Sawah also understood the risks of being a healthcare professional aiding those who were going against the Syrian government. Many doctors and healthcare professionals who tried to provide medical support were either targeted, injured or killed by the government. However, Sawah refused to allow fear of government retaliation to prevent her from helping others, and she put her patient care expertise to work for the innocent Syrian civilians. Sawah's personal experience and her own principles have guided her throughout her career and given her the motivation to truly make an impact on the lives of others. Her passion for helping others and taking care of patients naturally led her to a career in pharmacy. However, she was willing to sacrifice her professional career and role as HOW A UK ALUMNA IS HELPING THE HUMANITARIAN RELIEF OPERATION IN SYRIA Khaula Sawah (MS '94, PharmD '99) with her husband Ashraf Traboulsi (MS '95, PhD '97) ALUMNI TRAINING LEADERS by Caitlyn Romanski a clinical pharmacist for something bigger - to mobilize efforts and help humanitarian relief operations. After pivoting from a successful pharmacy career to leading humanitarian efforts, Sawah often found herself in stressful and vulnerable situations. Her expertise was constantly questioned as she navigated a largely male-centric leadership environment in both Syria and Turkey. Despite the patriarchal hurdles, Sawah let her work speak for her, serving as the first Executive Director of UOSSM in Turkey. During her time at UOSSM, Sawah built the entire structure of the organization and managed its staff. She also developed strong strategic relationships with partners and donors. UOSSM became one of the major humanitarian organizations present during the Syrian crisis, providing medical relief, primary and advanced health care, nutrition, specialized mental health and psychosocial support and protection services, and special needs rehabilitation to millions of people there. As an alumna of the University of Kentucky, Sawah has dedicated herself to supporting vulnerable populations with lifesaving, innovative and quality healthcare services and truly embodies the sentiment of a dedicated pharmacist. When reflecting on her overall career, Sawah stated that seeing how her work affects others pushes her to keep going. \"I saw the impact of my work on the people I served in Syria at the time. But later, I saw that the impact of my work was bigger than anything I could dream of - my family, my children, my friends, my boss at work, young men and women were all looking up to me and being inspired by what I was doing. I didn't know that I was a source of inspiration and motivation,\" said Sawah. \"Although I'm no longer doing the groundwork in Syria, my time back in the United States has reminded me that I am not alone in this work, and that every one of us can make a difference.\" Sawah's humanitarian efforts are an excellent example of how the simplest of pharmacy passions can make the utmost difference in the lives of others. Her story of hope and resiliency, which she continues to share at UKCOP will inspire many students, faculty and staff members and countless other pharmacy and healthcare professionals to continue making achievements in both pharmacy and humanitarian efforts around the world.

UK COLLEGE OF PHARMACY | 9ADVAN CING THERA PIESOUR RESEARCH ADVANCING THERAPIES Alex Flannery worked as a clinician in the intensive care unit for six years. During his tenure in critical care, the University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy assistant professor and 2011 graduate, saw many cases of sepsis and acute kidney injury, which have no cure. Flannery's background in pharmacology sparked an interest in learning more about how to treat these diseases. \"I want to better understand the physiological processes of sepsis and acute kidney injury,\" Flannery said. \"What happens to the body? What treatments can we use? Are there any current medications that we can repurpose to treat these conditions?\" Flannery then made the transition to becoming a clinical researcher. He credits the multidisciplinary nature of care at the hospital for his success in a smooth transition from clinician to researcher. \"As a pharmacist, I worked with physicians, nurses and lots of other health care professionals to optimize patient care,\" he said. \"The focus on improving outcomes is very apparent in the research setting as well, which has benefited me in my transition.\" Flannery currently works with patients who have sepsis and are experiencing acute kidney injury. \"Sepsis is when you get an infection, and your body's immune system reacts very poorly to it. It is, by definition, a life- threatening event,\" he said. \"We want to study what happens when you have kidney injury on top of that.\"Working with actual patients allows Flannery to experience an up-close look at how sepsis can take a toll on the body. \"Sometimes, research involves looking at what happens to these patients and the risk factors they may have,\" he said. \"Other times, it involves getting biospecimens from them and looking at different things to see if we can understand mechanisms better. And sometimes, it involves giving those patients medicine \u2014 either within the context of a clinical trial or otherwise \u2014 and seeing how certain changes happen.\" Flannery is researching the role of a complex hormonal system called the renin-angiotensin system in sepsis- associated acute kidney injury. The renin-angiotensin system, or RAS for short, is a target of certain drugs used for blood pressure control. \"We collect specimens from patients that have sepsis and kidney injury and look at this complex profile of the system,\" he said. \"It's like a Rubik's Cube. You have it perfectly set up, and this disease comes along and twists it all out of order. We are looking to see exactly what those alterations are in that complex profile.\" Flannery credits much of his success to his education. He completed his pre-pharmacy studies from UK before furthering his education at the UK College of Pharmacy, where he also completed clinical training in critical care at UK HealthCare. He recently completed his doctorate in clinical and translational science from the UK Center for Clinical and Translational Science program in May of 2021.\"I feel very supported here. There is a lot of synergy between UK HealthCare and the university. Health care can learn from research just as much as research can learn from health care,\" Flannery said. \"Being able to see patients and study patients in a way that is 5-10 minutes away from research space really facilitates the type of infrastructure that you need, in addition to the collaboration.\" When asked what advice he would give to current students, Flannery says the greatest part of the effort comes with preparation. \"Every study can make a contribution to society, whether it's positive or neutral necessarily,\" he said. \"Focus on your methods, sell your methods, and let that really be the energy which drives your research project.\"PHARMACY PROFESSOR IN SEARCH OF TREATMENTS FOR ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY by Haley Williamson Alex Flannery (right), UK College of Pharmacy assistant professor, is in search of treatments for acute kidney injury. Our frontline researchers are committed to solving health care problems in Kentucky and across the globe.10 | 2021 ANNUAL REVIEWPUBLICATIONS PRODUCED BY UKCOP FACULTY IN 2021249IN COLLABORATIVE FUNDING $82.3 M FISCAL YEAR PRIMARY RESEARCH 2018 $21.9 2019 $21.2 2020 $28.7 2021 RESEARCH ADVANCING THERAPIES IN COLLEGE-SPECIFIC COLLABORATIVE FUNDING $6.3M RESEARCH FUNDING A group of University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy (UKCOP) researchers received $3 million in National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding to develop new treatments to combat Ewing sarcoma, a rare type of cancer. Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive form of cancer that is diagnosed mostly in children and young adults. Currently there are no effective treatments. The principal investigators in the project, Drs. Leggas, Rohr, and Tsodikov, are developing a novel Ewing sarcoma treatment derived from the bacterial natural product drug mithramycin. This program was enabled by a team science approach that includes collaborators from the Markey Cancer Center (MCC). The synergistic expertise of the principal investigators, Drs. Leggas, Rohr and Tsodikov - in pharmacology, natural product chemistry and structural biology - is complemented by Dr. Heidi Weiss, and Dr. Chi Wang - biostatistics and bioinformatic experts - as well as the clinical expertise of Dr. Tom Badgett who treats children with Ewing sarcoma. The project stems from Dr. Rohr's longstanding research program in understanding mithramycin biosynthesis and engineering bacteria to produce unnatural mithramycin analogues, which are molecules that are initially produced by bacteria, but then chemically modified in a test tube. One of these engineered analogues serves as a convenient starting point for medicinal chemists. \"A primary emphasis of my research program is to understand how microbes make complex natural products,\" Rohr said. \"The expertise and infrastructure in the UKCOP have been critical to moving this basic science to a project with real potential for translation to the clinic.\" The Tsodikov team is working on mechanistic understanding of how these molecules interact with their molecular targets using fundamental biochemical and structural studies. In parallel, the Leggas team is the driver on translational preclinical aspects of the project, where they are specifically focused on understanding how the modifications of the novel analogues influence the balance between toxicity and anti-cancer efficacy in cellular and in vivo pharmacology studies. \"Our strengths complement one another perfectly and we're able to take on this complex question of understanding and treating a devastating disease in a completely different way than we would as individuals,\" Tsodikov said. \"It's also what makes a team science approach so efficient. We've taken something that would have been incredibly difficult for any of us to accomplish alone and turned it into something entirely feasible. That's the beauty of team science.\" The team coalesced in 2013 and has included former UK clinicians - Drs. Jeffrey Moscow and Lars Wagner. Initial work was supported by MCC pilot funding and since then, the investigators leveraged support from MCC research cores and from clinical collaborators in pediatric oncology. Their alliance flourished and additional funding was awarded from the DanceBlue Foundation, and extramurally from the Department of Defense and the Kentucky Pediatric Research Trust Fund. The team's momentum was also bolstered by the Center for Pharmaceutical Research and Innovation (CPRI) at the College, which has supported scale-up fermentation and process chemistry to enable the team's in vivo studies. Tom Prisinzano, CPRI director, views this as an exciting advance in cancer drug development. \"This is an exceptional example of a multi-disciplinary team working together to transition innovative preclinical science to UKCOP RESEARCHERS RECEIVE $3M IN FUNDING TO COMBAT EWING SARCOMA by Jacob Lewis promising early-stage drug candidates,\" Prisinzano said. \"CPRI is very excited to assist these talented investigators develop this project.\" The new grant will support key studies to further understand the mechanism of action of the novel mithramycin analogues and the team expects to help them select the best molecule for clinical testing in Ewing sarcoma. But the investigators believe there is more to this story. \"Our research is poised to generate a general approach for developing pharmacological inhibitors that target oncogenic transcription factors,\" Leggas said. \"This could be important for the treatment of several cancers including prostate cancer, leukemias and lymphomas, among others, so stay tuned.\" Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number R01CA243529.

ELE VATING CAREELEVATING CARE The University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy (UKCOP) has created a scholarship in an effort to address inequity within the pharmacy profession. The scholarship, put in place at the request of UKCOP's students, was created after students helped identify the need for more substantial scholarship support to enable attendance of a more diverse student body. The scholarship - open to any student who wishes to apply - is in honor of the first African American woman pharmacist in Kentucky, Harriet Beecher Stowe Marble. Marble practiced pharmacy throughout the United States and was a pillar of the Lexington community where she owned a drugstore. The scholarship is meant to assist students in their pursuit of a pharmacy degree. Marble's pharmacy career first began when she received her B.S. in pharmacy in 1906 from Meharry Medical College, the nation's oldest historically Black health sciences center. She was an excellent student and went on to outscore 77 others before the Mississippi State Board of Examiners in 1908. Marble went on to get her pharmacy license in several states, practicing pharmacy throughout the country. Her career took her down several different paths\u2014she worked at drug stores in Oklahoma and Mississippi and then within the health-system at the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial College in Alabama. Later, Marble was able to open a drug store in her hometown of Yazoo City, Mississippi, before deciding to move to Lexington with her family in 1921. Marble's time in Lexington was the peak of her career. During this time, she became one of the most successful businesswomen in Kentucky. Her property at 118 North Broadway functioned as a physician's office, pharmacy, and home. Marble's hard work did not go unnoticed; she had relationships with other successful black women like Madam C.J. Walker, the first Black woman to become a millionaire in the United States. Marble was also involved in national pharmacy organizations. She was elected office-bearer of the National Medical Association (NMA) pharmaceutical section in 1913 and became vice president in 1919.Marble's historic and groundbreaking career allowed her to provide meaningful care to patients across the country. Through this scholarship, UKCOP will help her legacy live through the next generation of pharmacists.

UK COLLEGE OF PHARMACY | 15 14 | 2021 ANNUAL REVIEWELEVATING CARE On March 18, 2021, Kentucky House Bill 48: An Act relating to reimbursement of pharmacist services sponsored by pharmacist and Representative Danny Bentley, was signed by Governor Beshear. The passage of this bill followed three years of legislative advocacy by the Kentucky Pharmacists Association and the Advancing Pharmacy Practice in Kentucky Coalition (APPKC), an advocacy group of pharmacy stakeholder organizations in Kentucky, including the Kentucky Pharmacists Association, the Kentucky Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the Kentucky Board of Pharmacy, the American Pharmacy Services Corporation, the Sullivan University College of Pharmacy, and the University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy's Center for the Advancement of Pharmacy Practice. WHAT WILL THE BILL DO? The bill amended KRS Chapter 304 to establish when an insurer or third-party administrator for an insurer will provide reimbursement to a pharmacist for a service or procedure they provided. For this statute, an insurer is defined as \"any insurer, self-insurer, self-insured plan, or self-insured group and shall include any health maintenance organization, provider-sponsored integrated health delivery network, or nonprofit hospital, medical-surgical, dental, and health service corporation.\" An insurer shall provide reimbursement if the service or procedure \"is within the scope of practice of pharmacy; would otherwise be covered under the policy, plan, or contract if the service or procedure were provided by a physician, APRN, or PA; and is performed by the pharmacist in strict compliance with laws and administrative regulations related to the pharmacist's license.\" In addition, the reimbursement will be at a rate not less than that provided to other nonphysician practitioners. WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT? In 2017, regulation 201 KAR 2:380 established procedures by which pharmacists, acting in collaboration with a prescriber, can provide mutually agreed-upon services as outlined in a specific care protocol. At the time, the hope was that this new regulation would help address limited access to care across Kentucky. It was estimated that Kentucky would experience close to a 30% shortfall in primary care provider adequacy by 2025. In addition, evidence has shown that pharmacists providing protocol-driven direct patient care can improve both patient and public health. As of July 1, 2021, sixteen protocols have been approved by the Kentucky Board of Pharmacy; however, many pharmacies still have not implemented these protocols in their practices. HOW DOES THIS BILL HELP? A major barrier to widespread implementation of protocol-driven care has been a lack of reimbursement. HB 48 addresses this issue by requiring commercial insurances to reimburse pharmacists for the services they provide. With this statute in place, pharmacies have one less barrier to offering protocol-driven patient care. More pharmacists offering protocol-driven care will help further address limited access to care and improve both patient and public health throughout Kentucky. This is a positive first step towards getting pharmacists reimbursement for their services. However, additional work is needed to ensure full access for all patients, as HB 48 applies only to commercial insurances and does not apply to Medicare and Medicaid.COMMERCIAL INSURANCE TO REIMBURSE FOR PHARMACIST- PROVIDED SERVICES IN KY by Sara Hart and Kyle BryanWHAT ARE THE FIRST STEPS IN IMPLEMENTATION? To prepare for reimbursement for pharmacy services, there are important steps that your pharmacy must complete: Examine the current services provided by your pharmacy and identify those that are eligible for billing. Each pharmacist should obtain a National Provider Identifier (NPI) number. Pharmacists must become credentialed and contracted with health payers. It is important to specify that you are enrolling as a pharmacist for the purpose of providing care. Keep in mind that to date, few states have required insurers to credential and contract with pharmacists; therefore, persistence is key. Many health plans utilize the Council for Affordable Quality Healthcare (CAQH) ProView service for their credentialing process. More information on credentialing and contracting will be forthcoming from the APPKC and its stakeholder organizations. It is paramount that we work together to support profession-wide implementation of this important legislation across all practice settings. On behalf of its stakeholder organizations, the APPKC is establishing a workgroup focused on implementation and the University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy has hired a practice implementation pharmacist to lead implementation efforts. While this progress is game- changing for Kentucky pharmacists, it is new legislation with little precedent and will require much time and effort to completely and successfully implement. If you are interested in assisting APPKC with HB 48 implementation efforts, please contact Kyle Bryan at kyle.bryan@uky.edu.OUR IMPACT UK COLLEGE OF PHARMACY | 17Val Adams Funding from Bristol Myers Squibb Company Abby Bailey Chair, American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP) Emergency Medicine Practice Research Network (PRN) Bjoern Bauer Extramural funding from NIH (2), funding from Pharma Foundation Brittany Bissell Chair, American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP) Pulmonary Practice Research Network (PRN) Jeffrey Cain 2021 University of Kentucky Outstanding Teaching Award Joseph Chappell Extramural Funding from Enepret Aaron Cook Presidential Citation from the Neurocritical Care Society, ASHP Foundation Award Chris Delcher University of Florida Department of Epidemiology Outstanding Young Alumnus, funding from Ferris State University, funding from Department of Justice (2) Holly Divine AACP Academic Leadership Fellow Linda Dwoskin Extramural Funding from NIH (4) Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services (KYNETIC) Alex Flannery Chair, Critical Care American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP) Practice Research Network (PRN), KSHP Pharmacy Mentor of the Year Award, American Society of Nephrology 2020 Pre-Doctoral Fellowship Award, Resident Award (Resident Katie Landmesser, Mentor Alex Flannery) ACCP Futures Grants Awardees, fellowship from American Society of Nephrology, funding from La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company, funding from American College of Clinical Pharmacy Trish Freeman Induction into UKCOP Hall of Distinguished Alumni, funding from KY Cabinet for Health and Family Services Sylvie Garneau-Tsodikova Extramural Funding from NIH (2) Greg Graf Extramural Funding from NIH (2) Kip Guy Extramural funding from NIH (2), funding from GHIT (2), funding from University of Cambridge, funding from Mathile Family Foundation, funding from MMV Jimmi Hatton Kolpek President, American College of Clinical Pharmacy Kyung-Bo Kim Funding from Arisu Therapeutics Inc Jill Kolesar Funding from KY Lung Cancer Research Fund, funding from KY Cabinet for Health and Family Services (2), funding from M2Gen Corporation, funding from ArtemiLife Inc., funding from CRDF Global Robert Kuhn Funding from Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.
