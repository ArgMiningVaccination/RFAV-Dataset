Lin * The problem of toxic ignorance plagues modern society. On a daily basis, each of us is exposed to hundreds of chemicals, the vast majority of which havebeen subject to little or no testing to determine whether they are toxic to humansor the environment. Many of these chemicals may turn out to be harmless.Some, however, may cause cancer, reproductive defects, and other harms. Intoto, chemicals are believed to be responsible for tens of thousands of deaths peryear. The systematic failure of manufacturers and distributors to test chemicalsubstances is a rational response to marketplace incentives, tort liability rules,and existing chemical regulations. To address the problem of toxic ignorance,this Article proposes the recognition of a new type of public nuisance to compelchemical testing. In contrast to conventional toxic tort litigation, whichrequires a showing of physical injury, the failure to test itself would constitute apublic nuisance. Inadequate testing puts the public health at risk, and theresultant lack of information undermines the ability of governments and indi-viduals to protect public health. In addition to explaining the basis for apply-ing public nuisance doctrine to the failure to test, the Article also examinespractical considerations relating to how courts would enforce the duty to con-duct testing.

The problem of toxic ignorance is widely recognized, yet legislatures,regulatory agencies, courts, and the chemical industry have done rela-tively little to address the problem. Without analyzing the risks posedby chemicals before they become widely distributed, it is difficult todetermine the precautions that should be taken or the scope of anyhealth and environmental problems that may result. Experiences inwhich we have discovered the hazards of chemical substances belat-edly\u2014ranging from asbestos to benzene to polychlorinated biphenyls(PCBs)\u2014illustrate the potentially broad and serious consequences of toxic ignorance. 2 Uncertainty is a constant companion in scientists' efforts to understand the phenomena occurring around us, and the field of tox-icology is no exception to that principle. 3 Rarely do we know as much as we would like to know about cause-and-effect relationships. Yet thelevel of toxic ignorance that surrounds us is not the inevitable resultof the limits of scientific inquiry. Rather, it is the consequence ofdeliberate decisions by the chemical industry and by those who incor-porate chemicals into their manufacturing processes to avoid testingthat would identify at least some of the likely harms.

It might also require significantresources and drive useful chemicals from the market. In the absenceof such a mandate, this Article proposes the use of public nuisancelitigation for attacking the toxic ignorance problem. Part I of the Arti-cle explains the problem of toxic ignorance and identifies various eco-nomic and legal disincentives for chemical manufacturers to conducttoxicity testing. In response to this problem, Part II proposes the rec-ognition and use of a public nuisance action against chemical manu-facturers, processors, and importers for the failure to test chemicalsubstances. Finally, Part III examines the important practical questionof how courts might enforce the duty to test against chemical compa-nies; this section describes various methods of toxicity testing and sug-gests guidelines for courts to consider. I. T HE PROBLEM OF TOXIC IGNORANCE A. Background According to some estimates, chemical exposure is responsible for tens of thousands of deaths per year in the United States.4 None- theless, we have surprisingly little information about the health andenvironmental effects of the thousands of chemicals that we use on adaily basis. 5 A 1998 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) study of toxicity data on high production volume (HPV) chemicals\u2014those 4See Christine H.

The absence oftoxicity data hampers these agencies' ability to carry out basic regula-tory tasks such as conducting risk assessments, developing safetyguidelines, setting regulatory standards, defending regulations fromlegal challenges, and warning the public about potential hazards. 14 Ultimately, the information gap leaves the government unable to pro-tect the public and the public unable to protect itself. Lack of toxicity information undermines the tort system as well. Ideally, toxic tort claims further social goals of compensation, deter-rence, and corrective justice. 15 Injured plaintiffs receive compensa- tion for their harms, potential defendants are deterred by the threatof liability, and those entities responsible for plaintiffs' harms arerequired to restore plaintiffs to their original position. 16 In reality, however, environmental toxic tort plaintiffs are frustrated by gaps inknowledge regarding causation, risk, and harm. 17 Often the most sig- nificant of these obstacles is causation.18 Toxicity testing has the in Our Blood , HARPER 'S MAG., Oct. 2007, at 78, 80-81 (reporting chemical industry representative's praise of ineffective toxic regulatory statute). 12 See U.S. GOV'T ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE , supra note 9, at 1-2 (noting over seven R hundred new chemicals are introduced into commerce each year). 13 See Jeffrey Rudd, Regulating the Impacts of Engineered Nanoparticles Under TSCA: Shifting Authority from Industry to Government , 33 COLUM .

Even when the available data is sufficient tosupport a regulatory response, it is usually insufficient to support afinding of causation in an individual tort case. 19 In these cases, courts often require proof that exposure to a chemical doubled the plain-tiff's risk of harm, or they may demand particularistic proof of a causalconnection. 20 Magnifying the difficulty of the task faced by toxic tort plaintiffs, the Supreme Court's decision in Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.21 established a rigorous standard for admitting scientific expert testimony. Daubert made clear that federal trial judges must serve as gatekeepers for scientific testimony by examiningfor themselves the reliability of the methods underlying expert testi-mony. 22 The application of Daubert in toxic tort cases has led many courts to reject proposed expert testimony, particularly that profferedby plaintiffs, as too unreliable in light of scientific uncertainty andincomplete scientific knowledge. 23 B. Incentives Not to Test The toxic ignorance problem is the unsurprising result of rational decisions by chemical manufacturers not to conduct extensivetesting. 24 Our legal system generally assumes that chemicals are \"innocent until proven guilty\"; we restrict chemical manufacture and 19 See Richard J. Pierce, Jr., Causation in Government Regulation and Toxic Torts , 76 WASH. U. L.Q. 1307, 1307 (1998) (explaining that in \"deciding whether to impose a regulatory restriction, the agency asks whether there is sufficient evidence of a gen-eral causal relationship between substance A and injury X to justify imposition of a regulatory restriction,\" whereas in a tort case, a court must decide the distinct ques-tion of \"whether a particular manufacturer of substance A is legally and financially responsible for a particular injury to a particular individual\"). In the narrower con-text of product liability actions involving exposure to potentially toxic substances, cau-sation poses a less imposing barrier. In such actions, plaintiffs may be able toestablish liability based on a failure to warn that a product might be harmful, without having to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the product is harm- ful.

In theory, governmentagencies, consumer organizations, and others can step in and performtoxicological research on their own. These actors, however, rarelyhave the resources to do so. 26 In addition, they may not be able to access the information needed to conduct safety testing because oftrade secret claims by manufacturers. 27 Consequently, society relies heavily on chemical manufacturers to do the testing themselves.28 Manufacturers have the greatest familiarity with their products and the most opportunities to learn about them, can channel theresults of safety testing back into product design to avoid injuries, andcan spread the costs of testing among customers. 29 Various factors discourage manufacturers from generating toxicity information, how-ever. First, thorough toxicity testing can be expensive, and manufac-turers cannot easily profit from investments in producing toxicitydata. 30 In ordinary product development research, companies trans- form knowledge from that research into private gain through the 25 See Carl F.

Tort Law Exacerbates the Ignorance Problem 1. The Duty to Test In theory, liability rules promote toxicity research by giving man- ufacturers an incentive to ensure that their products are reasonablysafe. Indeed, tort law imposes on manufacturers an unequivocal dutyto test their products for dangers associated with their use. 39 This risk\u2014if indeed it is\u2014if consumers do not expect the product to be risky in the first place.\"). 31 See Wagner, supra note 5, at 1631.

Difficulties in Enforcing the Duty to Test The duty to test for toxic hazards, however, is enforceable only if a plaintiff is injured and brings a cause of action against the manufac-turer in strict liability, negligence, negligent failure to warn, or thelike. 46 Under existing law, the failure to test for toxic hazards cannot, by itself, serve as the basis for an independent cause of action.47 For many product liability cases, this is not a significant problem: plaintiffsinjured by a defective tool or appliance typically will have little diffi-culty in identifying their injury and the manufacturer responsible forthat injury. Plaintiffs in toxic tort cases, however, face numerousobstacles to bringing successful claims, particularly as to issues ofcausation. Specifically, toxic tort plaintiffs must prove both general causa- tion\u2014that a substance is capable of causing the injury at issue\u2014andspecific causation\u2014that exposure to the substance in fact caused theplaintiffs' injuries. 48 Because of the extensive research required, the 44 See Kociemba , 707 F. Supp. at 1528 (holding that continuing duty to test exists where manufacturer has knowledge of problem with product, product is subject tocontinued sale or advertising, and where there was preexisting duty to warn of dan-gers associated with product). 45 See Wagner, supra note 26, at 794-95 (noting that \"[s]tate-of-the-art testing R generally consists of 'all of the available knowledge of a subject at a given time,'\" including scientific, medical, engineering, and any other knowledge (quotingLohrmann v.

TSCA Makes Matters Worse Toxicity testing could be mandated by statute or as part of a regu- latory regime. For most substances, however, existing regulatorymechanisms require no testing at all. Rather, as explained below, thecurrent statutory scheme actually creates further disincentives formanufacturers to test. The general authority to regulate chemical substances in the United States is found in the Toxic Substances Control Act 53 (TSCA), which gives EPA broad authority to regulate the entire life cycle of achemical substance\u2014including the authority to order manufacturersto do the testing that would address the knowledge gap. 54 TSCA applies to all chemicals other than those specifically exemptedbecause of their coverage under other federal statutes. 55 The statute provides EPA with regulatory authority in three key areas: regulating 53 Pub. L. No. 94-469, 90 Stat. 2003 (1976) (codified as amended at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2601-2692 (2006)). 54 SeeROBERT V. P ERCIVAL ET AL ., E NVIRONMENTAL REGULATION 95 (5th ed. 2006) (\"In theory, [TSCA] is the broadest source of EPA's regulatory authority . . . \u00a7 2602(2) (defining \"chemical substance\" to exclude pesticides, tobacco, nuclear material, food, food additives, drugs, cosmetics, and medicaldevices). Most of these exempted chemicals\u2014pesticides and pharmaceuticals in par-ticular\u2014are subject to mandatory toxicity testing before they enter the stream of com-merce.

Registration requires that an appli-cant demonstrate, through specified toxicological tests, that the product will notcause unreasonable harm and that it will perform its intended function withoutunreasonable harm. Id. \u00a7 136a(c)(5); see 40 C.F.R. pt. 158 (2009). Pharmaceuticals are subject to an extensive premarket approval process administered by the Food andDrug Administration (FDA). 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355 (2006). That process includes submis-sion of an Investigational New Drug Application containing the results of pharmaco-logical and toxicological studies and three phases of human clinical trials todetermine effectiveness and toxicity. See 21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 312.20, 312.23 (2009) (clinical trials); id. \u00a7\u00a7 314.1-314.650 (regulations governing approval of new drugs). Although the FDA also has authority to regulate cosmetics, it has interpreted thatauthority narrowly, placing the responsibility on cosmetic manufacturers to deter-mine the safety of their own products before marketing. See Lin, supra note 13, at R 373. The regulatory regimes for pesticides and pharmaceuticals do ensure that at least some toxicity testing occurs. But as litigation against the manufacturers of Vioxx andProzac illustrates, even these requirements hardly guarantee discovery of all serioushealth risks. See Berger & Twerski, supra note 23, at 261 (commenting that safety R studies done to obtain FDA approval often are inadequate to identify all toxic effects because of various factors, including their relatively short timeframe and small size);Wendy Wagner, When All Else Fails: Regulating Risky Products Through Tort Litigation , 95 GEO.

Acloser examination of the provisions of TSCA and EPA practice underthose provisions explains why. 1. TSCA Does Not Require Toxicity Testing For chemicals already in commerce, section 4 of TSCA authorizes EPA to review potential health risks and to require manufacturers toconduct toxicity testing. TSCA, however, does not mandate that EPA undertake chemical risk reviews. Nor does TSCA impose on manufac-turers a self-executing duty to conduct toxicity tests. Rather, EPAmust first promulgate a rule before a manufacturer has the obligationto test a chemical. 59 In the rule, EPA must establish that the chemical \"may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environ-ment,\" 60 or that it \"will be produced in substantial quantities\" and result in \"substantial human exposure\" or entry of \"substantial quanti-ties\" into the environment. 61 Issuing test rules under section 4 has proven to be cumbersome: the process of finalizing such a rule maytake two to ten years and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. 62 Since 1979, EPA has reviewed the safety of only two percent of the ing hidden company documents and in raising public consciousness about misdeeds of drug companies). 56 Section 6 of TSCA authorizes EPA to regulate any chemical substance if it finds that there is a \"reasonable basis to conclude\" that such an activity \"presents or willpresent an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.\" 15 U.S.C.\u00a7 2605(a) (2006). This standard has proven difficult for EPA to meet. See Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA, 947 F.2d 1201, 1215-17, 1220, 1222 (5th Cir. 1991) (requiringEPA to balance cost of regulations against their benefits, to evaluate availability ofsubstitutes for chemical in question, and to apply least burdensome regulatory mea-sure that provides adequate protection). 57 See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2603 (2006). 58 See id. \u00a7 2604 (2006).

Section 5 of TSCA requires manu-facturers to provide a premanufacture notice (PMN) before begin-ning to manufacture a new chemical. 64 Although EPA may take action to control unreasonable risks it identifies, manufacture of thechemical can proceed unless EPA acts on the PMN within ninetydays. 65 In filing a PMN, manufacturers must submit to EPA any test data in their possession or control related to health or environmentaleffects, as well as a description of any other toxicity data of which theyare aware. 66 TSCA, however, does not require that manufacturers generate such data in the first instance.67 Not surprisingly, most chemical companies do not perform toxicity testing voluntarily: onlyfifteen percent of PMNs contain health and safety test data. 68 In the absence of such data, EPA relies heavily on analysis of structure activ-ity relationships (SARs) to screen for and assess potential risks. Thismethodology involves the use of models to predict likely biologicalactivity by comparing the molecular structure of new chemicals withthe structure of chemicals with existing toxicity data. 69 While EPA believes that these models are effective as screening tools to identifychemicals meriting closer review, the agency admits that the overallaccuracy of these models has not been validated. 70 63 See GAO, CHEMICAL REGULATION , supra note 9, at 18.

TSCA Creates Disincentives to Test Not only does TSCA fail to require toxicity testing for either new or existing chemicals, but various provisions of the statute discouragemanufacturers from conducting tests voluntarily. First, section 6 ofTSCA imposes on EPA the burden of proving \"an unreasonable risk ofinjury to health or the environment\" as a prerequisite for regulation. 71 This burden gives manufacturers a disincentive to produce risk infor-mation and an incentive to demand that EPA support any findings ofrisk with cost-benefit analysis and quantitative data. 72 Voluntary test- ing is further discouraged by TSCA's requirement that manufacturersnotify EPA of any information that \"reasonably supports the conclu-sion that [the chemical] presents a substantial risk of injury to healthor the environment . . . .\" 73 Thus, a manufacturer who conducts extensive safety testing runs the risk of generating data to support reg-ulation and of attracting scrutiny from plaintiffs' attorneys and regula-tors, with little potential marketing benefit. 74 3. The HPV Challenge Program Has Done Little to Bridge the Data Gap In an effort to shrink the toxics data gap, at least as to chemicals produced in large volumes, EPA and the chemical industry enteredinto a voluntary initiative, the High Production Volume ChallengeProgram. 75 Under the program, chemical companies made commit- ments to \"sponsor\" HPV chemicals by making screening-level toxicityinformation available to the public. 76 Sponsors pledged to propose and undertake test plans to develop data where screening information Validation and Barriers to the Validation of Alternative Tests , in ALTERNATIVES TO ANIMAL TESTING 28, 28-29 (R.E.

A RTICULATING AN ENFORCEABLE DUTY TO TEST IN PUBLIC NUISANCE DOCTRINE As explained above, manufacturers of chemical substances have a duty under tort law to test those substances before introducing theminto commerce or otherwise exposing the public to them. 85 Anecdo- tal evidence suggests that the American public generally assumes thatmanufacturers carry out this duty and that chemicals in commercehave been tested for health, safety, and environmental effects. 86 In fact, however, current testing efforts are grossly inadequate. For thevarious reasons just identified, the duty to test is rarely enforced, andthe existing legal structure actually discourages manufacturers fromperforming the necessary tests. 87 To address this failing, I propose the recognition of a new type of public nuisance for the failure to test chemical substances. This causeof action would be enforceable against manufacturers, processors, orimporters of such substances. In contrast to conventional toxic tortlitigation, however, no showing of physical injury would be required.Rather, the failure to test itself constitutes a public nuisance becausethat failure puts the public health at risk and because the resultantlack of information undermines the ability of governments and indi-viduals to protect public health. This Part explains the legal founda-tion for this cause of action. A.

Confusion has sometimes surrounded the definition of publicnuisance, and the contours of the doctrine vary by state. 95 The term \"public nuisance\" sometimes refers to conduct that creates an unrea-sonable interference with a public right, and at other times refers tothe resulting harm or damages suffered by the public at large. 96 Not- withstanding such discrepancies, the basic elements of a public nui-sance claim can be distilled into the following elements: (1) anunreasonable and substantial interference (2) with a public right (3)where the defendant has control of the instrumentality causing thenuisance. 97 Courts and commentators are divided over the role of fault, with some requiring that the defendant's conduct be inten-tional, unreasonable, violative of a statute, or otherwise tortious; andothers holding that liability for public nuisance is strict. 98 94 See, e.g. , Gifford, supra note 88, at 834 (contending that public nuisance should R not be a means of recovering damages from product manufacturers). 95 See Robert Abrams & Val Washington, The Misunderstood Law of Public Nuisance: A Comparison with Private Nuisance Twenty Years After Boomer, 54 ALB.

The Second Restatement of Torts describes a public right as \"one common to all members of the general public\" and \"collectivein nature.\" 104 Such a right can be distinguished from the \"individual right that everyone has not to be assaulted or defamed or defraudedor negligently injured.\" 105 In other words, for a public right to be violated, there must be more than an aggregation of private rightsviolations. 106 A public nuisance involves an act \"that could hurt any member of the public, not just a plaintiff situated in circumstancesunique to an individual or subsection of the general public.\" 107 Pub- lic rights thus include common law rights in health, safety, and com-fort\u2014such as the right to unobstructed highways and waterways andthe right to unpolluted air and water\u2014as well as rights identified by statute. 108 Attempting to distill the various situations in which public nuisance doctrine has been applied, the Wisconsin Supreme Courthas suggested that public nuisance involves interference \"with the use 103 See Antolini & Rechtschaffen, supra note 92, at 10,120 (\"The interference need R not be related to land, but can be much broader, affecting virtually any public resource or place.\").

Contrasting\"public right\" with the broader concept of \"public interest,\" DonaldGifford contends that \"while it is in the public interest to promote thehealth and well-being of citizens generally, there is no common lawpublic right to a certain standard of medical care or housing.\" 110 These concerns, Gifford suggests, do not involve interference with useof a public place or with activities of an entire community. 111 The interference with public rights must be substantial (i.e., sig- nificant) and unreasonable in order to be a public nuisance.112 Sig- nificance requires that the harm complained of be more than trivial,although the mere threat of substantial harm will suffice. 113 The requirements of significance and unreasonableness essentially over-lap, as section 821B of the Second Restatement of Torts suggests. Section 821B lists various circumstances that may sustain a finding that inter-ference with a public right is unreasonable: (a) Whether the conduct involves a significant interference with the public health, the public safety, the public peace, the public com-fort or the public convenience, or (b) whether the conduct is proscribed by a statute, ordinance or administrative regulation, or (c) whether the conduct is of a continuing nature or has produced a permanent or long-lasting effect, and, as the actor knows or hasreason to know, has a significant effect upon the public right. 114 Reasonability turns on the significance of the interference, as in the first and third Restatement examples, or on a prior legislative or admin- istrative judgment of unreasonability akin to per se negligence, as in 109 Gifford, supra note 88, at 815 (quoting Physicians Plus Ins.

Consistent with this view, Donald Gifford has suggested thatcourts should consider the following factors in determining whetherinterference is unreasonable: \"(i) the number of people susceptible,(ii) the degree of risk of harm occurring, (iii) the duration of the riskof harm occurring, and (iv) the severity of the harm that mayoccur.\" 116 In contrast to private nuisance, where the reasonableness inquiry calls for a weighing of the gravity of the harm to the plaintiffagainst the utility of the defendant's conduct, 117 public nuisance involves no such balancing of the utilities.118 Many courts also require as an element of public nuisance that the defendant have control of the instrumentality causing the nui-sance. 119 This element is rooted in the historical use of public nui- sance by the state to enjoin conduct injuring the public health, safety,or welfare. 120 A defendant who no longer exercises possession or con- trol, the reasoning goes, is not in position to abate a nuisance.121 The requirement of control has proven fatal to most attempts to applypublic nuisance doctrine against product manufacturers, includingmakers of handguns and lead paint. 122 In the handgun cases, states alleged that handgun manufacturers created a public nuisance bymaking handguns readily available and sought compensation forexpenses incurred in responding to handgun violence. 123 In the lead 115 See RESTATEMENT (SECOND ) OF TORTS \u00a7 821B cmt. e. 116 Gifford, supra note 88, at 816.

Applying Public Nuisance Doctrine to the Failure to Test Do the \"rights common to the general public\" and subject to pro- tection against interference through a public nuisance action extendto a right not to be exposed to untested or inadequately tested chemi-cal substances? In other words, can public nuisance doctrine encom-pass a company's failure to test the chemicals it manufactures beforereleasing them into the stream of commerce? Even though applica-tion of public nuisance in such situations would represent an exten-sion beyond common law precedents, consideration of the scope,purpose, and origins of the public nuisance doctrine suggests anaffirmative answer. As discussed above, public nuisance essentially involves interfer- ence with public rights. The public rights that a state may protect viapublic nuisance include the collective interests of its citizens in thequality of the state's environment, a point illustrated by Georgia v. Ten- nessee Copper Co ., 132one of the Supreme Court's leading decisions on public nuisance. In that case, Georgia sought to enjoin out-of-statecopper companies from discharging pollutants that were allegedlydamaging forests and crops within the state of Georgia. 133 Noting that the case involved \"a suit by a State for an injury to it in its capacity of quasi -sovereign,\" the Court observed that \"[i]n that capacity the State has an interest independent of and behind the titles of its citizens, inall the earth and air within its domain. It has the last word as towhether its mountains shall be stripped of their forests and its inhabi-tants shall breathe pure air.\" 134Tennessee Copper is instructive on at least two important points. First, the decision underscores that thestate's police power is the basis for public nuisance actions brought by 130 See, e.g. , Commonwealth v. Barnes & Tucker Co ., 319 A.2d 871, 883, 885 (Pa. 1974) (finding that acid mine drainage discharging from mine constituted public nui-sance and explaining that \"[t]he absence of facts supporting concepts of negligence,foreseeability or unlawful conduct is not in the least fatal to a finding of the existenceof a common law public nuisance\"). 131 Abrams & Washington, supra note 95, at 370.

Public nuisance thus is quite distinct from private nui- sance in its origins as well as in the scope of interests it seeks to pro-tect. 135 Acting as parens patriae , the state may bring public nuisance actions to protect the health and welfare of its citizens.136 Second, Tennessee Copper affirms the breadth of the power that the state can effectuate through public nuisance actions. Rejecting the defendants'argument that the harm to the state had to be balanced against theeconomic benefit of the copper smelting operations, the Court char-acterized the state's quasi-sovereign authority in these matters as virtu-ally absolute: Whether Georgia by insisting upon this claim is doing more harm than good to her own citizens is for her to determine. The possibledisaster to those outside the State must be accepted as a conse-quence of her standing upon her extreme rights. 137 Admittedly, the failure to undertake testing to determine health and safety risks differs from the palpable harm of Tennessee Copper and familiar examples of interferences with public health or comfort\u2014 smoke, noise, and the like\u2014that constituted public nuisances under the common law. The modern understanding of \"interference withpublic rights,\" however, is broader than the limited conception of nui-sance as a tangible harm or annoyance. 138 First, public nuisance has 135 Cf. People ex rel. Gallo v. Acuna, 929 P.2d 596, 603 (Cal. 1997) (\"Unlike the private nuisance\u2014tied to and designed to vindicate individual ownership interests in land\u2014the 'common' or public nuisance emerged from distinctly different historical origins. The public nuisance doctrine is aimed at the protection and redress of com- munity interests and, at least in theory, embodies a kind of collective ideal of civil life which the courts have vindicated by equitable remedies since the beginning of the16th century.\"). 136 See Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. P.R. ex rel .

Although the Supreme Court has declined to set out an exhaustive definition ofquasi-sovereign interests, it has made clear that \"a State has a quasi-sovereign interestin the health and well-being\u2014both physical and economic\u2014of its residents in gen-eral.\" Snapp & Son, Inc. , 458 U.S. at 607. 138 See Prosser, supra note 91, at 997 (noting that \"[ n]uisance is a French word R which means nothing more than harm\").\\\\server05\\productn\\N\\NDL\\85-3\\NDL303.txt unknown Seq: 28 25-MAR-10 7:53 982 notre dame law review [ v ol. 85:3 not been confined to situations where plaintiffs have suffered tangible injury. Interference with the public peace, as by loud noises, andinterference with public morals, as in cases of prostitution, were rec-ognized as public nuisances by the common law. 139 Indeed, the Sec- ond Restatement of Torts identifies five broad categories of public rights subject to protection through a public nuisance action: \"the publichealth, the public safety, the public peace, the public comfort [and]the public convenience.\" 140 Not surprisingly, the mere risk of harm has long been sufficient to establish a public nuisance,141 as demon- strated by common law cases involving the keeping of diseased ani-mals, the maintenance of a pond breeding malarial mosquitoes, andthe storage of explosives in the midst of a city. 142 A state's quasi-sover- eign interests \"in the well-being of its populace\"143 readily extend beyond these situations and include protection against potentialinjury from exposure to untested chemicals. 144 Untested chemicals do present a somewhat more complicated sit- uation than the above-noted examples of public nuisance in that therisk of injury is not established for individual substances. More specifi-cally, while we have a sound basis for believing that untested sub-stances collectively pose a significant threat to public health, there isalmost no way of knowing which individual chemicals do so withouttesting\u2014testing that the manufacturer is in the best position to per-form.

In order to constitute a public nuisance, an interference with public rights generally must be substantial and unreasonable.156 At first glance, the requirement of substantiality may appear to be a seri-ous obstacle to asserting a public nuisance claim for the failure to testchemical substances. By virtue of the very failure to test, substantialphysical harm usually cannot be shown. 157 However, a showing of sub- stantial harm is not strictly required where the state seeks only injunc-tive relief, as opposed to damages. 158 In order to obtain an injunction against a public nuisance, harm need only be threatened and neednot actually have been sustained at all. 159 Moreover, the responsibility of chemical manufacturers in perpetuating the condition of toxicignorance argues in favor of a shift in the burden of proving substanti-ality (or the lack thereof) to chemical manufacturers. 160 The third element of a public nuisance action, the requirement that the defendant have control of the instrumentality causing thenuisance, is easily satisfied where the nuisance involves a failure totest. After all, the manufacturer is responsible for introducing thechemical into the stream of commerce and has complete control overwhether testing is done. This situation is thus distinguishable fromthe efforts to apply public nuisance doctrine in handgun and leadpaint litigation, where the instrumentalities causing the nuisance longago left the manufacturers' control and arguably became subject to the good by such insensible degrees that the two are not capable of being readily distinguished and separated in terms of legislation. Id. at 388-89 (citations omitted). By analogy, the police power extends not only to demonstrably harmful chemicals, but also to chemicals whose effects are currentlyunknown and that ultimately may pose no health or environmental risks. 156 See supra Part II.A. 157 Three of the four factors suggested by Donald Gifford as relevant to determin- ing the significance of interference with a public right, see supra text accompanying note 116\u2014the degree of harm, its duration, and its severity\u2014will be difficult to R demonstrate because of the lack of safety testing. 158 See RESTATEMENT (SECOND ) OF TORTS \u00a7 821B cmt. i (1979) (\"[F]or damages to be awarded significant harm must have been actually incurred, while for an injunc-tion harm need only be threatened and need not actually have been sustained atall.\"); cf.

Moreover, although a few courts suggest that publicnuisance \"has historically been tied to conduct on one's own land orproperty as it affects the rights of the general public,\" 162 such a view takes an overly narrow approach to public nuisance doctrine evenunder common law precedents. 163 Obstructions of public roads and waterways could readily occur without any land ownership by thedefendant; indeed, the \"catch-all criminal offense\" of public nuisancecame to encompass such diverse circumstances as diversion of waterfrom a mill, unlicensed stage-plays, and indecent exposure. 164 The common element in these situations was not the presence of a realproperty interest; rather control of the obstruction or source of the nuisance sufficed. Such control is readily present when a chemicalmanufacturer has failed to test the safety of its products. 161 See, e.g. , In re Lead Paint Litig., 924 A.2d 484, 501 (N.J. 2007); State v. Lead Indus. Ass'n, 951 A.2d 428, 455 (R.I. 2008). In some of these cases, courts haverejected public nuisance claims out of a concern that such suits could be used tocircumvent products liability law pertaining to defective products. See e.g. , In re Lead Paint , at 456. With respect to untested chemicals, however, the allegation is not so much that the chemicals are defective, asthat manufacturers have failed to test for defects in the first instance. 162 See, e.g. , In re Lead Paint , 924 A.2d A.2d at 452 (\"[T]o date, the actions for [public] nuisance in this jurisdiction have beenrelated to land.\"); Gifford, supra note 88, at 832 (contending that \"a finding of public R nuisance historically involved the use of land\"). Gifford suggests that confining pub- lic nuisance claims to cases involving land makes sense in light of the availability ofclaims of negligence, strict liability for abnormally dangerous activities, and strictproducts liability for personal injuries resulting from conduct not involving the use ofland. See id. at 833. Public nuisance law, however, incorporates an element of fault and thus cannot be strictly separated from the law of negligence or strict liability. See supra note 98 and accompanying text. In addition, the availability of one cause of R action in specific factual circumstances does not necessarily preclude the availability of another. Public nuisance's requirement of interference with a public right reduces any concern that the tort might swallow up other torts and apply to \"any unreasonableharm that might result from human interaction.\" Gifford, supra note 88, at 833. 163 See 58 AM.

First, some jurisdictions requireintent, negligence, or a violation of law as an element of public nui-sance. 165 Such a requirement would be readily met in failure to test cases. By definition, a failure to test involves negligent conduct by achemical manufacturer: the failure to conduct reasonable health andsafety testing. 166 Second, public nuisance claims would be asserted under state common law, raising the possibility of federal preemptionunder TSCA. That statute, however, expressly preserves \"the authorityof any State . . . to establish or continue in effect regulation of anychemical substance, mixture, or article containing a chemical sub-stance or mixture.\" 167 C. An Alternative Public Nuisance Theory Centered on the Right to Information Public nuisance theory also can be applied to the problem of unt- ested chemicals under an understanding of \"public right\" that focuseson harms to personal autonomy. Under this approach, the publicright that is interfered with is a procedural right, the right to informa-tion, rather than the substantive right against exposure to untestedsubstances. This sort of interference represents a significant depar-ture from the common law examples of public nuisance, but it stillfalls within public nuisance's broad definition. While the public rightto information regarding environmental hazards is a fairly modernconcept, it is one that has received growing recognition in recentyears. 168 The adoption of various statutes promoting the dissemination of information about chemical hazards to the public reflects the develop-ment of this right. At the federal level, the Emergency Planning andCommunity Right-to-Know Act 169 (EPCRA) requires facilities to report annually their releases of chemicals that have been listed as toxic by 165 See supra note 98. R 166 The specific measures necessary to satisfy the duty to conduct reasonable test- ing are considered in Part III of this Article. 167 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2617(a)(1) (2006). The exceptions to this statutory section pro- vide for preemption where EPA issues a rule mandating testing or otherwise regulat-ing a specific chemical substance. See id. \u00a7 2617(a)(2). In such circumstances, a state would have no need to bring a public nuisance action for failure to test. 168 Cf. Gary E.R. Hook & George W. Lucier, The Right to Know is for Everyone , 108 ENVTL .

Principle 10 of the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environmentand Development discusses this point: Environmental issues are best handled with the participation of all concerned citizens, at the relevant level. At the national level, eachindividual shall have appropriate access to information concerningthe environment that is held by public authorities, including informa- tion on hazardous materials and activities in their communities , and the opportunity to participate in decision-making processes. States shallfacilitate and encourage public awareness and participation by mak-ing information widely available. 180 Although Principle 10 hardly establishes an enforceable right to such information, it does reflect a recognition of the importance of \"infor-mation on hazardous materials\" to human wellbeing and the role ofgovernments in developing and disseminating that information. The \"right-to-know\" laws discussed above, as well as Principle 10, share a common rationale of promoting individual autonomy by facili-tating the ability of individuals to make choices about the risks towhich they are exposed. 181 The right to know and the right not to be ronmental risk information that an individual would consider in deciding whether to engage in an activity may be sufficient to establish Article III standing in at least somecircumstances.

Moreo-ver, access to accurate information, like access to unobstructed high-ways, is essential to healthy open markets. D. Litigating Public Nuisance for Failure to Test A public nuisance cause of action to enforce chemical manufac- turers' and importers' duty to test is attractive for a number of rea-sons. First, it would make the duty to test a meaningful obligation. Acause of action as delineated in this Article would be available uponthe introduction of an untested substance into the stream of com- 182 See Echeverria & Kaplan, supra note 177, at 590; Timothy William Lambert et R al., Ethical Perspectives for Public and Environmental Health: Fostering Autonomy and the Right to Know , 111 ENVTL .

Wagner, supra note 26, at 808-09 (\"The legislative history undergirding at R least some of the right-to-know laws also supports an inference that the public expects manufacturers to bear responsibility for generating and providing basic informationon potentially toxic products and by-products.\"). The right of citizens to know of thehazards posed by chemicals in the environment around them is analogous to the rightof a patient to informed consent under medical malpractice law. See Berger & Twer- ski, supra note 23, at 270-73 (discussing informed consent paradigm). In the latter R context, Professors Berger and Twerski have argued that an injured patient who is deprived of information about the risks associated with the use of a drug should havea cause of action even if she is unable to prove that the drug caused her injury. See id. at 259 (describing proposal, which would apply to drugs that are not medically neces-sary). Causation not only is impossible for many such plaintiffs to prove, but also islargely beside the point: the patient's right of informed consent was violated at thetime of nondisclosure.

We would not have to wait for physical injury before trying to enforce the duty, and causation\u2014a formidable barrier to the filing oftoxic tort claims, let alone their successful prosecution\u2014would not beat issue. Second, such a cause of action would enable a measuredpublic response to a public problem. 185 Because individual members of the public would suffer from virtually the same injury, potentialprivate plaintiffs would not be able to assert the special injury neces-sary to sue. Rather, only public entities would be able to bring failure-to-test claims under a public nuisance theory. 186 This limitation on the pool of potential plaintiffs would ameliorate concerns that manu-facturers would be inundated by lawsuits. And because of limitedpublic resources, state attorneys general would need to be selective indeciding what cases to pursue and which companies to name asdefendants. 187 Third, the relief granted would directly redress the problem. Although damages are sometimes recoverable in public nui-sance actions, the most common remedy is injunctive relief. 188 This general rule would hold true for failure-to-test claims as well. Injunc-tive relief would be preferable to damages because of the difficulty ofdetermining the economic value of the information not developed.In addition, to the extent that damages might in theory compensatefor tangible injuries, it is improbable that plaintiffs would be able todemonstrate injuries caused by exposure to as-yet untested substances.Ultimately, injunctions ordering companies to perform testing inorder to manufacture or distribute a chemical within a state would bea particularly appropriate remedy, and courts could tailor compliancedeadlines to account for individual circumstances, such as the contin- 185 See Antolini & Rechtschaffen, supra note 92, at nui- sance \"offers a community-oriented remedy\"). 186 Cf.

In order to bring public nuisance claims for failure to test, a state would first have to ascertain whether any testing has been done on aparticular chemical. Although TSCA has been of limited value in gen-erating toxicity data, 189 it can play an important role in revealing what, if any, testing has been conducted. First, the requirement of TSCAsection 5 that companies provide EPA with notice of new chemicalsand significant new uses of existing chemicals provides a useful start-ing point. 190 In these notices, companies must submit health data in their control and a description of other toxicity data of which they areaware. 191 Second, section 8 of TSCA imposes additional disclosure requirements. Section 8(d) requires manufacturers, importers, andprocessors of chemicals to submit unpublished health and safety stud-ies in their possession, as well as lists of other studies known to thembut not in their possession. 192 Moreover, if manufacturers, proces- sors, or distributors of a substance obtain information that reasonablysupports the conclusion that the substance presents a substantial riskof injury to health or the environment, section 8(e) requires thatinformation to be provided to EPA. 193 The section 8(d) obligation applies only to chemicals that have been specifically listed by EPA,194 whereas section 8(e) is a self-implementing requirement that applieson a continuing basis to all chemicals. 195 189 See supra Part I.D. 190 15 U.S.C. ., supra note 64, at 65-67.

E. Other Proposals Several commentators have proposed other means of addressing chemical manufacturers' failure to test their products. In this section,I briefly compare the leading proposals with the public nuisanceapproach advocated here. This comparison suggests several advan-tages to a public nuisance approach, including its simplicity and rela-tively flexible application. 1. Liability Without Causation One way to address the failure to test would be to impose toxic tort liability without proof of causation. Under one such proposal byMargaret Berger, an injured plaintiff who demonstrates that a chemi-cal manufacturer failed to develop or disseminate information neededto assess latent risks would be entitled to recovery, unless the manufac-turer can demonstrate that its product did not cause the plaintiff'sinjury. 203 The proposal, in other words, creates a presumption of cau- sation and shifts the burden of disproving causation to thedefendant. 204 202 also 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.306(a)(3) (2009) (defining health and safety data); Conrad, supra note 192, at 146 (contending that \"TSCA does not R provide business confidentiality protection to health and safety studies\"). To the extent that such data constitute CBI, states have sometimes been able to access TSCACBI data through agreements with EPA and industry. See Yang, supra note 201, at R 232. 203 Berger, supra note 18, at 2143-44. Under a negligence regime, defendants R who meet the requisite standard of care for toxicity testing would not be liable for injuries caused by their products. Id. at 2143. 204 Id. at 2144-45 (allowing manufacturers to raise defenses \"that certain adverse health reactions could not plausibly arise from exposure to defendant's product\" or\"that a particular plaintiff's injury is . to another cause\"). In a similarproposal by Wendy Wagner, plaintiffs would be required to prove the following ele-ments to establish a prima facie case: inadequate testing; foreseeable exposure; and\"serious harm that might be causally linked to exposure to the product.\" Wagner, supra note 26, at 834-35; see also Heidi Li Feldman, Science and Uncertainty in Mass R Exposure Litigation , 74 TEX. L. R EV. 1, 45 (1995) (suggesting burden of proof be shifted whenever plaintiff can establish uncertainty such that it is not possible to concludewhether substance is safe or harmful to humans).\\\\server05\\productn\\N\\NDL\\85-3\\NDL303.txt unknown Seq: 41 25-MAR-10 7:53 2010] deciphering the chemical soup 995 Berger contends that eliminating causation and focusing instead on the failure to develop information creates better incentives forinvestigating risk. 205 The proposal, like the approach set out in this Article, comprehends toxic ignorance as the root of the problem.Given the lack of toxicity information, eliminating causation improvesthe prospect of holding defendants liable for morally irresponsiblechoices. 206 Berger also suggests that causation does little to further the corrective justice goals of tort law in toxic tort cases and thereforethat little is lost by eliminating it as a requirement for recovery. 207 Unlike run-of-the-mill tort cases, where causation serves to \"'singl[e]out this plaintiff from the class of persons whom the defendant hasendangered,'\" 208 the heavy reliance on epidemiological data and sta- tistical probabilities to infer causation209 in toxic tort cases under- mines the notion that causation has singled out the correct plaintiffand the correct defendant. 210 Imposing liability without causation would put some pressure on manufacturers to carry out testing and would enable more toxic tortvictims to bring successful claims. But the latent harm that frequentlycharacterizes toxic exposure would still create insurmountable diffi-culties in many cases. Although they would be relieved of the formalburden of proving specific causation, plaintiffs, in order to determinewhom they should file a complaint against, would still have to linktheir injury to a particular defendant or group of defendants; thisshowing would essentially involve a watered-down version of generalcausation. 211 On the one hand, such a showing could be quite prob- lematic given our daily exposure to hundreds of chemicals and thelack of testing for many of those chemicals. On the other hand, ifcourts interpret this requirement leniently, such that any plausiblelink between exposure and injury might do, the pool of potentialplaintiffs\u2014and number of potential trials\u2014could become unmanage- 205 Berger, supra note 18, at 2134.

However, the proposal's requirement that plaintiffs demonstrate exposure and ill health subsequent to such exposure indicates that plaintiffs wouldstill have to draw a link between the two. See id. at 2144; cf. Wagner, supra note 26, at R 835 (requiring that plaintiffs show \"serious harm that might be causally linked to exposure to the product\").\\\\server05\\productn\\N\\NDL\\85-3\\NDL303.txt unknown Seq: 42 25-MAR-10 7:53 996 notre dame law review [ v ol. 85:3 able.212 Overwhelming liability could be the result, as companies una- ble to satisfy their duties are compelled to pay potentially speculativedamage amounts. 213 The proposal set forth in this Article avoids many of the difficul- ties of Berger's proposal by taking an ex ante approach. Rather thanconcerning itself with the recovery of damages, the proposal aims toavoid damages in the first instance by mandating reasonable testing ofchemicals before and after they enter the stream of commerce. 214 This focus on the breach of the duty to test sidesteps the difficultiesinvolved in demonstrating causation (albeit in a watered-down ver-sion). Unlike Berger's scheme, the instant proposal does not requirea plaintiff to identify plausible defendants, nor does it risk casting toowide a net that could impose formidable burdens of liability on anentire industry. Indeed, the proposal guards against potential abuseby offering only injunctive relief and by limiting drastically the pool ofpossible plaintiffs. The instant proposal thus provides a measured buteffective response to the toxic ignorance problem. 2. Statutory Reform Other proposals, rather than relying on the tort system, involve statutory reform. As various commentators have contended, statutoryenactments generally possess greater democratic legitimacy than regu-latory obligations imposed through parens patriae suits. 215 Statutory reform allows a directly accountable political body to consider com-plex problems, weigh competing interests, and set priorities through arelatively public process. 216 Public nuisance litigation brought by state attorneys general, in contrast, can effectively supplant legislative deci-sions with detailed decrees proposed by executive branch officials andimposed by an unelected judiciary. 217 The possibility of such litiga- 212 See Pierce, supra note 19, at 1313-18, 1325.

Significant government resources would berequired, however, to develop such a scheme and to process the infor-mation submitted. 234 In addition, a REACH-like regime would face formidable political barriers to enactment.235 The inability of Con- gress to make meaningful changes to TSCA, despite widespread recog-nition of its shortcomings, suggests the unlikelihood of statutoryreform in this area in the near future. 236 Recent episodes of contami- nated consumer products and growing concerns about endocrine dis-ruptors may generate legislation responding to specific concerns, 237 but the broader problem of untested chemicals presents a moreabstract issue that is less likely to generate public support or legislativeattention. 238 Unless or until a comprehensive scheme akin to REACH is put in place, public nuisance actions can offer states the opportu-nity to target chemicals that may warrant testing because of their wide-spread use, persistent nature, observed effects, or other reasons forconcern. Indeed, REACH itself may facilitate such actions, as well asother tort and regulatory efforts in the United States, by generatingtoxicity data that might suggest the need for further investigation. 239 Public nuisance actions not only can target individual chemicals fortesting, but their case-specific approach also allows testing require-ments to be tailored to fit specific situations.

W HAT MIGHT A DUTY TO TEST REQUIRE ? The discussion thus far has assumed the existence of a duty to test chemicals for toxicity without specifying in detail what that duty mightrequire. Public nuisance actions to enforce that duty will requirecourts to grapple with its contents. In this Part, I explain how thegeneral duty to test may be translated into concrete and specificrequirements. In enforcing the duty to test, courts will have to gain abasic familiarity with toxicity testing methods. This is a manageabletask comparable to what courts normally do, and does not demandthat courts develop the technical expertise a regulatory agency mightpossess or to conduct activities better suited to the legislature. 241 After providing a general overview of toxicity testing methods, including invitro, in vivo, and epidemiological studies, I suggest that courts focuson in vitro and in vivo options for purposes of determining what sortof testing may be sufficient in a specific case. A. Toxicity Testing Methods in General A primary objective of toxicity testing is to determine the possible hazards associated with exposure to a chemical substance and to char-acterize the risk in a qualitative or quantitative manner. 242 Important 240 Cf. Alice Kaswan, The Domestic Response to Global Climate Change: What Role for Federal, State, and Litigation Initiatives? , 42 U.S.F. L.

Am. Elec. Power Co., 406 F. Supp. 2d 265, 272 (S.D.N.Y. 2005), vacated and remanded 309 (2d Cir. 2009) (listing \"tran- scendently legislative\" tasks that court would have to accomplish in order to grantrelief in global warming litigation), a public nuisance action for failure to test wouldsimply require courts, in designing the appropriate relief, to determine whether moretesting is necessary and to set a testing schedule. 242 See FRANK A.

Clinicaltrials involving humans, however, are not a viable option for determin-ing the toxicity of chemicals ex ante because of the ethical and practi-cal difficulties of human experimentation. 253 And epidemiological studies often may not be helpful or even possible ex post because ofthe absence of data and the limited ability of such studies to detectchronic risks and small increases in risks. 254 Given these difficulties, courts should focus on in vitro and in vivo options for purposes ofestablishing what sort of toxicity testing is sufficient. The followingsection examines these two options in detail. B. In Vitro and In Vivo Testing 1. In Vitro Methods Determining the potential toxic hazards associated with a sub- stance begins with basic testing to identify its physical and chemicalproperties. 255 This data, which can shed light on the nature of the substance and the probability of its release, includes, but is not limitedto, molecular structure, boiling point, melting point, water solubility,impurities, and general reactivity. 256 TSCA requires that some\u2014but not all\u2014of this information be submitted to EPA for all new chemi-cals. 257 Although this information is insufficient to determine the 251 See Neubert, supra note 243, at 1165 (\"It is one principle of epidemiology that R such single studies do not allow us to prove a causal relationship.\"). 252 See Lin, supra note 15, at 1448.

Taking this approach one step further, R EPA relies heavily on quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) analysis, which studies the biological activity of a chemical compound in relation to its molecu-lar structure, to predict how a structurally analogous chemical may react under thesame circumstances.

In vitro toxicology avoids popu- lar objections to animal testing and can be performed more quicklyand inexpensively than in vivo tests. 266 In vitro tests, however, are subject to a number of limitations.

Such studiesgenerally seek to uncover cancer, reproductive, or developmentaleffects. 277 Chronic studies provide the most information regarding potential toxicity, but require the most time, resources, and plan-ning. 278 Whereas acute studies typically run for about fourteen days and subchronic studies ninety days, chronic studies often last sixmonths to two years. 279 Traditionally, in vivo studies have served as the basis for human health risk assessment because it is believed that they best mimichuman exposure. 280 In vivo studies can test certain exposure routes that in vitro studies cannot, and they also can test multiple exposureroutes. 281 Moreover, because testing occurs within living organisms with operating physiological systems, there is less of an inferential leapin extrapolating test results to humans. 282 While no animal species perfectly models the human system,283 appropriate species can be 274 See STELLJES , supra note 253, at 61.

Such an approach also would estab-lish a readily administrable bright-line rule for companies, courts, andother interested parties. In a world without transaction costs, determining whether a com- pany has satisfied the duty to test would involve a case-by-case consid-eration of the facts and of expert opinions regarding what specifictests can reveal. If courts opt for such an approach rather than recog-nizing a safe harbor based on the performance of a CSA, or ininstances where a company has performed some testing short of a fullCSA, the courts can follow guiding principles based on the SIDS pro-gram and the relative merits of various testing methods. First, basicchemical analysis should be required in all cases. Analysis of funda-mental physical and chemical properties, such as molecular structure,boiling point, melting point, vapor pressure, water solubility, impuri-ties, and general reactivity should be done as a matter of routine.Such information is relatively inexpensive to obtain and can be invalu-able in identifying potential hazards and routes of exposure. 309 Sec- ond, simple in vitro screening tests that have been validated should beexpected for all chemical substances. The Ames test revealsmutagenicity and is widely recognized as a quick and cost-effectivescreen for potential carcinogens. 310 Other scientifically validated in vitro tests, such as tests for skin corrosivity and embryotoxicity, alsogenerate data that can be usefully extrapolated to in vivo exposure OECD, SIDS , supra note 304, at annex 1, available at http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/ R 13/17/36045066.pdf. 307 I am indebted to Wendy Wagner for this suggestion. 308 See supra text accompanying note 232.

Manufacturers have a duty toundertake reasonable testing, not the amount of testing that a courtwould do if it were a manufacturer with unlimited time and resources.This deference does not mean, however, that courts should be blindto the economic and legal incentives for industry to do insufficientsafety testing. 315 Rather, courts should give a hard look at testing deci- sions but recognize the limits of their own knowledge and experi-ence. 316 Taken together, these guidelines can add an element of 311 See BARILE , supra note 242, at 175-84; Balls, supra note 70, at 30-31 (listing R validated in vitro tests). 312 See STELLJES , supra note 253, at 69; Balls, supra note 70, at 31 (listing examples R of in vitro methods being validated or prepared for validation).

C ONCLUSION Public nuisance actions offer a potentially powerful tool to goad chemical manufacturers into performing safety testing that theyalready should be doing under fundamental principles of tort law andresponsible corporate behavior. The range of chemicals possibly sub-ject to such actions is quite broad, but public officials would almostcertainly focus their limited resources on a narrow subset of thethousands of chemicals found in commerce. In setting their prioritiesfor investigation and subsequent litigation, officials likely would con-sider factors relating to both risk and exposure. On the risk side,these factors could include: anecdotal accounts of adverse effects; sta-tistical clusters of symptoms or illness; known or suspected hazards insimilar chemicals; or studies suggesting positive correlations betweenchemical exposure and illness, even if those correlations fall short ofstatistical significance. On the exposure side, factors worth consider-ing might include: widespread distribution or use of a chemical;intended use or foreseeable misuse of a chemical product; likely expo-sure among children, pregnant women, and other vulnerable popula-tions; and the tendency of a chemical to disperse in the environment.None of this is to suggest that any of these factors is necessary in orderto bring a failure to test claim; rather, these factors are among thosethat may be relevant to the choice of chemicals to target for publicnuisance actions. Ultimately, a statutory mandate to develop risk assessments for all chemicals in commerce\u2014or even a more limited approach akin toREACH\u2014could serve as a more comprehensive response to the wide-spread failure of manufacturers, processors, and distributors to con-duct adequate testing. Whether such a mandate will be enacted in thenear future, however, is uncertain, given the opposition it would likelyencounter from the chemical industry. 317 Public nuisance actions for States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)); see also Greater Boston Television Corp. v.
