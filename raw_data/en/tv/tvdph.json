Could what you make for dinner tonight help support your immune system? Maybe. \"The immune system is the body's defense mechanism, and it works tirelessly to protect us from substances that can make us ill, like bacteria, viruses, parasites, and environmental toxins,\" says [Karen Ansel, RDN](http://www.karenansel.com/), who practices in Syosset, New York, and is the author of [Healing Superfoods for Anti-Aging](https://www.amazon.com/Healing-Superfoods-Anti-Aging-Younger-Longer/product-reviews/1618372289?reviewerType=all_reviews). And, she explains, \"like the rest of the body, the immune system requires certain nutrients to perform at its best.\" In fact, specific nutrients have a direct effect on the production and activity of immune cells and antibodies, according to [Harvard Health Publishing](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-to-boost-your-immune-system). So how do we support our immune system with what's on our menu? \"Diet-wise, the best thing you can do for a strong immune system is to focus on whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein,\" Ansel says. \"Fruits and vegetables are filled with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that support the body's immune soldiers so that they can quickly spring into action to fight off foreign invaders, while protein helps build infection-fighting antibodies,\" says Ansel. On the flip side, an ultraprocessed diet, as well as a Western diet high in sugar, alcohol, and red meat and low in fruits and veggies, can be harmful to your immune system and even suppress it. \"That doesn't mean that you have to nix these entirely, but you may want to consume them in moderation to keep your immune system strong and healthy,\" Ansel adds. Check out these recipes below that all contain immune-supporting superstar ingredients, from turmeric to tangerines, and ginger to garlic. Then consider making one of these dishes today to keep your immune system running smoothly.
