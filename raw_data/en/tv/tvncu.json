Moreover, many other techniques used to achieve personal transformation were enlisted in the effort to bring about \"planetary healing\" and societal transformation. The movement also spoke to the sick and psychologically wounded, especially those who had been unable to find help though traditional medicine and psychotherapy. Aligning themselves with the [Holistic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Holistic) Health movement\u2014which advocated [alternative](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alternative) and natural healing practices such as [massage](https://www.britannica.com/science/massage), natural food diets, [chiropractic](https://www.britannica.com/science/chiropractic), and acupuncture\u2014believers in the New Age promoted spiritual healing. They also sought the [integration](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/integration) of older divinatory practices (astrology, tarot, and [I Ching](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Yijing)) with standard psychological [counseling](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/counseling). Two transformative tools, channeling and the use of crystals, were identified with the New Age movement as it peaked in the 1980s. Many New Agers discovered their psychic abilities and became known as channels. Either consciously or in a trance, they claimed to establish contact with various [preternatural](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/preternatural) or extraterrestrial entities who spoke through them on a wide range of spiritual, philosophical, and psychological topics. Some of the beings who \"spoke\" through channels (e.g., Seth, Ramtha, and Lazarus) became popular teachers themselves, and some of the more popular channelers founded new organizations. Drawing upon the [myth](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/myth) of [Atlantis](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Atlantis-legendary-island), one channeler, Frank Alpert, proposed the use of [crystals](https://www.britannica.com/science/crystal) as healing-transformative tools. He suggested that the ancient civilization had lived off the power of crystals and fell because of its ruler's unwise and immoral use of them. Crystals were thought to be great reservoirs of energy and distinct healing and of transformative powers that could be released for personal benefit. In the 1980s they were among the most popular items at New Age stores and conventions; however, critics were quick to point out the unscientific nature of the movement's claims for crystals. Some members of the movement found support for their belief in their ability to transform world [culture](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/culture) in a story about monkeys learning to wash food. According to the story, reportedly taken from the anthropological literature, a number of monkeys learned by example to wash their food. After the 100th monkey had absorbed the lesson, all monkeys jumped ahead in [consciousness](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consciousness) and started washing their food. The story turned out to be a significant distortion of the scientific report; however, many New Agers believed that if a small critical mass of people adopted the more advanced perspective of the New Age, there would be a sudden explosion of higher consciousness throughout the world. The 100th-monkey [idea](https://www.britannica.com/topic/idea) led to a series of mass gatherings beginning with the Harmonic Convergence, which was a set of coordinated gatherings of people at various places around the world on August 16-17, 1987 that was designed to bring about a leap in human consciousness. Post-New Age By the end of the 1980s, the New Age movement had lost its momentum. Although primarily a religious movement, it was derided for its acceptance of unscientific ideas and practices (especially its [advocacy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/advocacy) of crystals and channeling). Then Spangler, Los Angeles publisher Jeremy Tarcher, and the editors of several leading New Age periodicals announced that although they still adhered to the goals of personal transformation, they no longer believed in the coming New Age. By the mid-1990s, it was evident that the movement was dying, and New Agers in Europe began to speak of the move from \"New Age to Next Stage.\" The New Age movement proved to be one of the West's most significant religious phenomena of the 20th century. It improved the image of older [esoteric](https://www.britannica.com/topic/esotericism) religious groups, which continue to be referred to as the New Age [community](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/community), and allowed many of its largest groups to find a place in the West's increasingly pluralistic culture. Although its vision of massive social transformation died, the movement attracted hundreds of thousands of new adherents to one branch or other of the Western esoteric-metaphysical tradition. More than one-fifth of adults in the West give [credence](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/credence) to astrology; an equal number have practiced some form of meditation. Three to five million Americans identified themselves as New Agers or as accepting the beliefs and practices of the New Age movement in the late 1980s. The continuing presence of New Age thought in the post-New Age era is evident in the number of New Age bookstores, periodicals, and organizations that continued to be found in nearly every urban centre.
