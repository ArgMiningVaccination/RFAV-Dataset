Many people wear their busyness as a badge of honor. They take pride in declining invitations in the name of mindlessly rushing from one to-do list task to the other. The problem is that this busyness can lead to mental clutter. Meditation and breathwork can help you become more self-aware and intentional with your actions. Tips for Developing Your Meditation Practice Meditation doesn't have to be complicated. But it does require you to stop procrastinating and start somewhere. Here are some tips for beginning your practice. Focus on Your Breath Is your breathing quick and shallow or slow and deep? If you don't have a meditation practice, it's not uncommon to subconsciously hold your breath throughout your day. As you inhale and exhale, concentrate on feeling and listening to your breath. It's typical for your attention to wander. Bring it back with focused breathing. Be Comfortable There's no need to sit in the stereotypical cross-legged position while meditating. For many people, this position is uncomfortable without elevation under your hips. The ideal position for the average person is sitting in a chair or couch with your arms uncrossed, feet flat on the floor, and a cushion or towel rolled up underneath your backside to encourage an upright position. Try Mantras or Movement A mantra is a word or phrase that you can repeat to focus on meditation, such as, \"I am at peace.\" Using this tool can lead to improved results from your meditation practice. When you think of meditative movement, you may think of yoga -- but it doesn't have to be. Walking can become a meditation. Instead of focusing on a particular destination, concentrate on your legs and feet. Repeating action words in a mantra such as \"lifting,\" \"moving,\" and \"placing\" as you slow down your walking pace can help you to focus. Notice What You Feel As you breathe, notice how you're feeling physically. Are there areas that feel tenser than others? Take a scan of your body from the crown of your head, and breathe into those areas. Stop focusing on areas of particular tension. Choose a Time and Place Morning meditation can be a beneficial way to start the day. But if your circumstances prevent it, commit to meditating at the same time and place daily. To make meditation a lasting habit, it's key to make it a regular part of your everyday routine. Let Thoughts Come and Go Thoughts and feelings will inevitably pop up in your mind during meditation. The purpose of meditation isn't to clear your mind but to focus your attention and energy. Try to avoid judging your thoughts. Instead, redirect your mind back to your deep breathing. Show Yourself Kindness Meditation isn't about earning a trophy. It can be tempting to determine your meditation practice as \"good\" or \"bad.\" You won't experience dramatic life shifts or soft and fuzzy consolation due to each meditation session. The key is noticing whether you feel any different from when you sat down. Maybe you feel slightly less tense than you did previously.
