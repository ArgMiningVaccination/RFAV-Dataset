Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 7 Statement of Purpose In accordance with requirements set by the Illinois Department of Public Health rules, Title77:Part 600.400:Public Health Practice St andards, the Vermilion Count y Health Department submit s the 2017- 2022 Vermilion County Community Health Plan. This document was designed under the guidance structure provided by the Illinois Project for Local Assessment of Needs (IPLAN). The plan is the result of a comprehensive, com munity -based public health needs assessment, including reviews of relevant data, collective perceptions of the community participants, and dialogue about the overall health of Vermilion County. This document is presented as a guidance structure to improve the overall health and well -being of Vermilion County residents over the next five years, by setting attainable goals with measurable outcomes. Executive Summary There are many factors that can influence the health and well -being of a community. The heal thier a community is, the better its future will be. Vermilion County has had a long history of challenges facing it as a community. Vermilion County has been ranked in the bottom quartile of the County Health Rankings (Robert Woods Johnson Foundation) s ince the rankings were presented in 2010. Many of these problems are deep -rooted and have become the community cultural norm such as a high teen pregnancy rate. At the national level, Healthy People 2020 provides a comprehensive set of 10 -year national goals and objectives for improving the health of all Americans. Healthy People 2020 contains 42 topic areas for communities to focus their attention to, including Leading Health Indicators that have been selected as a high priority. The Vermilion County Health Department, as a certified local health department for Vermilion County, Illinois , is charged to assess the health and well -being of our community by retrieving and presenting relevant data, seeking community input, generating dialogue, and identifying existing and needed resources that lead to the development of strategies with measurable outcomes to address the identified priorities. In 2012, the Vermilion County Health Department submitted their 2012 -2017 Community Health Plan. In 2014, a reassessment was conducted because hospitals were also required to assess the community every 3 years. Since the health departments are required to do their assessment every 5 years and there is an overlap, an Executive Assessment Committee was formed. The Executive Committee members consist of Presence United Samaritans Medical Center, Carle, United Way of Danville Area, I Sing the Body Electric, and the Vermilion Coun ty Health Department. The priorities identified in the 2014 reassessment matched the 2012- 2017 Community Health Plan Priorities: Teen Pregnancy, Substance / Alcohol Abuse, and Obesity. The Executive Committee also includes Champaign Urbana Public Health District and United Way of Champaign County because both Carle and Presence are located in Champaign as well. In 2015, a Regional Community Health Plan Coordinator was hired through United Way of Champaign with funds coming from Carle and Presence, but a re under the supervision of both Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 8 Champaign Urbana Public Health District and Vermilion County Health Department. This position reports to the Executive Committee and is responsible for planning and coordinating strategies that result in the completion of both Champaign and Vermilion Counties' needs assessments and workgroups. At the end of 2015 and the beginning of 2016, workgroups in Vermilion County for each priority area were established. The 2017- 2022 Vermilion County Community Health Plan was accom plished with direct contribution from the Vermilion County Health Department, the Executive Committee , the Regional Community Health Plan Coordinator and over 50 individuals representing a variety of agencies and organizations (see list of Executive Commit tee Members and Community Advisory Committee Members) from across the county. In addition, we received direct input from over 1500 county residents via a community survey. Development of this plan was truly a collaborative effort working with our communi ty partners, our local schools of nursing, our local and state government representatives , and input from our county residents. In 2015, the Vermilion County Board of Health asked the Vermilion County Health Department to develop a 5 -year strategic plan to identify the challenges facing the health department and to capitalize on its strengths and opportunities. The Board of Health seeks to ensure ongoing viability and sustainability for the health department as the health department continues to serve th e critical needs of the residents of Vermilion County. The 5 -year strategic plan was approved by the Board of Health on November 10th, 2015. ( See Appendix H for the 5 -year Strategic Plan ) The community phase of the process began during the summer of 2016, as staff worked to compile relevant data for the Executive Committee and the Community Advisory Committee to review during its assessment of needs. The Vermilion County Health Department and the Regional Community Health Plan Coordinator worked collabora tively with a Presence Intern in researching and compiling much of the data used. An array of representative community leaders were identified and invited to join in the IPLAN process. The community partner phase of the I PLAN began in January 2017. The meetings were facilitated by Melissa Rome, Emergency Planning and Response Coordinator / Community Liaison and Julia Willis, Regional Community Health Plan Coordinator. The community advisory committee invested a great deal of though t and effort into id entifying the priority areas. In the past we have only addressed three priority areas. The community advisory committee demonstrated a genuine concern to weigh and balance all the information provided including the data presented, their own beliefs, experiences and perceptions as community stakeholders, as well as the information obtained from our county residents. The committee expressed considerable concern about how we, as a community, can address many of the health issues as the state fiscal crisis co ntinues and funding sources diminish. There was extended dialogue about how much our challenges are inter- related with many of the contributing factors being the same for all priority areas including education, abuse, and a lack of hope and dreams of a fu ture. The community advisory committee discussed strategies about being proact ive in our approaches and ensuring action and a way to measure those actions. After discussion from the first meeting, the group Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 9 consensus was reached that we were not finished with the current priorities and still had a lot of work to accomplish them , so group decided to maintain the current priorities, but wanted to add a fourth priority, mental health. As the planning process moved forward, we addressed each priority by setting attainable goals with measurable out comes throughout the 2017 -2022 P lan.

Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 15 The Process This document was designed under the guidance structure provided by the Illinois Project for Local Assessment of Needs (IPLAN). The Vermilion County Health Department (VCHD) IPLAN team chose to follow the Assessment Protocol for Excellence in Public Healt h (APEX -PH) model for assessment and development of the Community Health Plan. In May of 2016, the Vermilion County Health Department presented their timeline to the Executive Committee that they would begin the IPLAN process in the summer of 2016. Meli ssa Rome, Emergency Planning and Response Coordinator / Community Liaison and Julia Willis, Regional Community Health Plan Coordinator would be responsible for writing and coordinating the IPLAN process. The Executive Committee would continue monthly meetings to determine progress of the IPLAN process. All committee agendas, meeting minutes, workgroup information, and other documents are kept in a secure web -based program called the CEMP. All Executive Committee Members have access and can make comments when necessary. Organizational Capacity In 2015, the Vermilion County Health Department completed a 5 -year Strategic Plan. All VCHD staff were asked to identify future challenges and to identify its strengths and opportunities. The Board of Health also completed a SWOT analysis to identify the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats facing the Health Department. Board of Health members then ranked the top 5 issues in each category and the Vermilion County Health Department developed goals and strategies for the top issues. Th e overall plan is designed to ensure the Vermilion County Health Department is well prepared for what comes next. In addition, the Vermilion County Board Chairman has created an adhoc committee to develop a strategic plan (VC 2025) for the County as a whole and the VCHD Board of Health wishes to ensure health department goals compliment the County's long term plans. The 5 -year Strategic Plan was then approved by the Board of Health on November 10, 2015. Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 16 Purpose of the Assessment The purpose of the Community Health Data Assessment was to examine the health status indicators for the population of Vermilion County and to identify key concerns and assets within our community. The ultimate goal is to develop strategies to address these identified issues and health needs. Assessment Process Collection of raw data began in the summer of 2016 as the VCHD Emergency Response Coordinator / Community Liaison and the Regional Community Health Plan Coordinator began working collaboratively with Pre sence Health and a summer intern in researching, compi ling and organizing data. Analysis of all data began in August 201 6. The IPLAN team revised the previous community health survey that was collected in 2012. The survey elimin ated redundant questions and added some questions specifically tailored for the current priority workgroups. The survey was developed both as a hard copy and was accessible to be complete d online through Survey Monkey. Survey Monkey is an online survey t ool. The VCHD worked collab oratively with the UIC School of Nursing to help distribute and collect community survey data. The VCHD also worked with community partners to help distribute and collect community survey data. Survey information was collected between August 30 th, 2016 through November 18th, 2016 with over 1500 surveys completed. The VCHD extends its appreciation to the nursing students and all our community partners in ensuring that the survey sample represented all of the communities within t he county including rural and urban, villages and cities. During the survey process, the nursi ng students reported back to us the following findings for barriers : Males are still presenting a challenge for filling out surveys. Only about 20% of surveys collected were from males. It would be helpful for visually impaired individuals to have an IPad to help increase font size or auto speech.

Persons who moved to a new household from a different household within their current county of resident are not included. While the mobility percentage is lower than that of the State of Illinois and the United States, it still proves to be a challenge for many of the local schools. Some families move back and forth fro m Vermilion County to Chicago and obtaining accurate records has been a challenge.

Key Findings The number of adults 25 and older with less than a high school diploma or equivalent went down 1.4%. There was a 7.6% increase in the number of people with a t least a high school diploma from 2000 - 2014. The Vermilion County percentage of 86.3% still lags behind the state percentage of 87.6%, but is identical to the nation's percentage of 86.3%. The percentage of Vermilion County residents with at least a bachelor's degree rose slightly from 13.7% in 2010 to 13.8% in 2014, however, this is well below the State of Illinois' percentage of 31.9% The number of population 18 to 24 years of age that are enrolled in college or graduate school decreased by 5.8%. EDUCATION Whi le Vermilion County has seen some improvement in the edu cation attainment, we are far below the State of Illinois and National averages. Education provides economic benefits to a community in many ways. The more educated a person is, the better he or sh e is equipped for higher- level jobs, improved health, more stable families, improved environments, and lower crime rate. Vermilion County has seen a slight decrease in the percentage of adults 25 years and above who have completed less than high school (Table 2.1) . This went down from 15.1% in 2010 to 13.7% in 2014. The percentage of adults 25 years and above who have reported they have at least had some College or an Associate's Degree increased from 30.8% in 2010 to 32 .1% in 2014. Percentages for Hig h School Graduate and Bachelor's Degree completion had very little change. What has changed from 2012 to 2014 is fewer people are attending college (Table 2.2) . The percentage went from 27% in 2012 to 26.2% in 2014. This was not just a trend in Vermili on County, but a national trend beginning in 2012. According to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, college enrollment has fallen by 1.7% since last year . The percentage of high -school graduates who immediately enrolled in college fell fr om 69% in 2008 to 66% in 2013 (2016) . While this may seem like bad news, it usually follows a healthier economy, because people are pulled back into the workforce instead of going to college.

Self -reported health status is a general measure of health -related quality of life in a population. Recipients of the study were asked the following questions: \"In general, would you say that your health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor? The value reported is the percentage of adult respondents who rate their heal th as \"fair\" or \"poor\". The other question asked: \"Thinking about your physical health, which includes physical illness and injury, for how many days during the past 30 days was your physical health not good?\" The value reported is the average number of days a county's adult respondents report that their physical health was not good.

Due to a data collection change from the County Health Rankings, between 2015 and 2016, compar ing data from previous years would not give an accurate picture of change. The change was due to adding cellphone lines to the data collection as opposed to landline only lines. Vermilion County's perce ntage of adults smoking was 18%, which was unchange d from 2016. This is higher than the State of Illinois' percentage of 1 5% and above Top US Performers' percentage of 14%.

Once inhaled, these particles can affect the heart and lungs and cause serious health effects.\" Vermilion County's Air Pollut ion - Particulate Matter is 10.8 . This is the average daily density of fine particulate matter in micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5) in a co unty. Top US Performers are 6.7 , while the average of t he state of Illinois is 10.5 (County Health Rankings 2017) . Drinking water violations is an indicator of the presence or absence of health -based drinking water violations in counties se rved by community water systems. Previous measures had the number of times there was a water violation. In 2016, this was changed to a YES or NO indication. There are a number of limitations with this measure as there is no actual number associated with the violations. According to the 2017 County Health Rankings , Vermilion County measured a YES in this category, indicating the presence of a violation.

The highest teen pregnancy rate Vermilion County has seen since 1970 was 24.0 in 1975, while the lowest teen pregnancy rate Vermilion County has seen was 11.0 in 2014. T he graph ( 8.2) shows the percentages of teen pregnancies in Vermilion County and the State of Illinois between 2010 and 2014. According to the 2017 County Health Rankings , Vermilion County's teen pregnancy rate per 1,000 (female population ages 15 -19) was 54. This rate outcome met our 2012 -2017 IPLAN objective goal of reducing the teen pregnancy rate by 10%. Graph 8 2 Source: Illinois Department of Public Health, Birth Statistics *Rates are based on percentages of teen pregnancies and live births Teen pregnancy can have a significan t impact on the mother, the child , and the community as a whole. Teen moms are less likely to graduate, daughters of teen mothers are 3 times more likely to be teen moms themselves, and taxpayers spend about 12 billion annually on publicly financed medical care for women who experience un intended pregnancies ( The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy ). 13.4 12.5 12.9 13.8 11 9.1 8.2 7.7 6.8 6.1 0246810121416 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014Teen Pregnancy Vermilion County IllinoisVermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 62 The following information is from the 2016 I Sing the Body Electric Survey Data regarding sexual behaviors among Vermilion County youth. 45.4% of Vermilion County teens surveyed have had sexual intercourse at least once in their lives. This number is a 9.2% decrease since 2014. This percentage outcome met our 2 012-2017 IPLAN goal objective by reducing sexual intercourse by 10%. 5.1% of these teens report having sex bef ore reaching 13 years old. 6.0% of students have been pregnant one or more times or have fathered a child one or more times. This is a 22.1% decline since 2014. 7.3% of sexually active teens surveyed report they have unprotected sex. Vermilion County developed a Teen Pregnancy Workgroup in 2015 to help reduce the number of teen pregnancies. The group meets on a regular basis consisting of multiple agencies from the county. In August and September of 2016, the group developed a Teen P regnancy Survey for mothers who had t heir children as teens. Twenty -nine surveys were collected. The ages mothers were when they got pregnant ranged from 13 to 20, with the majority of ages between 16 -19. Findings included: The primary source of informa tion about sex these mothers received were from a parent (71%). Only 25% said their primary source was as a classroom subject. 96.5% felt they were given valid, accurate information. When asked what the reason for their sexual activity was: 47.37% - Acceptance / expectation from boyfriend 36.84% - Desire to be loved 31.58% - Goal of becoming a parent 10.53% - Peer Pressure 5.26% - Seeking attention from parent When asked why they became pregnant: 50% - Poor / unsuccessful birth control method 26.92% - Wanted to have a baby 15.38% - No access to birth control 11.54% - Other When looking at these results, it is difficult to address the teen mothers who have the goal of becoming a parent as their reasons for sexual activity and getting pregnant. This will take a community approach including having safer neighborhoods, access to schools and advanced education, access to healthcare, jobs, and opportunities.

Many of the factors that can affect this indicator are poverty, teen pregnancy, education levels, or the increase in the number of low -birth weight infants. Vermilion County has and conti nues to struggle with many of these risk factors. Child mortality rates are much higher in Vermilion County than in Illinois as seen in the t able (8.3).

Child abuse and neglect can lead to various effects including anxiety, depression, anger, dissociation, drug use, death, injury, among others. Substantiated cases of child abuse and neglec t are those in which an investigation by the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services produced sufficient evidence to confirm that child abuse and neglect did occur. Rates of child abuse and neglect are the number of substantiated cases relativ e to the child population. Vermilion County's rates are more than double the rate of Illinois.

Gender The majority of the surveys collected were from women. According to the United States Census 2015 (estimated), Vermilion County's population is 49.2% Male and 50.8% Female. It remains a struggle to reach more men to fill out the survey. Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 86 Relatio nship Status Almost half of the individuals who filled out the survey were married. Ethnicity / Race The Community Health Survey data results according to ethnicity and race were very close to Vermilion County's population breakdown. Also included in the survey was a question if the individual was of Hispanic or Latino Origin. 5.22% of the individuals responded yes . See page 19 for a comparison. We feel that the data collected was a good representation of our community. Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 87 Education Of the surveys completed, 65.5% were filled out by persons with at least some college. Vermilion County continues to have a very high number of residents with only a high school diploma or less. Household Income Of the surveys that were completed, 76.4% were filled out by individuals who have an annual household income of less than $50,000. Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 88 Health Insurance The percentage of individuals who identified themselves as not having health insurance or having to pay cash was 3.14%. Compared to our last survey in 2012, 13.4% identified themselves as not having health insurance. This is a significant change. Howeve r, some statements included that while they had insurance, they still could not \"afford\" the insurance or the care. Healthcare This was a new question added to the survey about where people usually go for their healthcare. 13.8% of the individuals stated that the Hospital Emergency Department was their usual place to go when they were sick. Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 89 Health and Community Information This was also a new question about where individuals like to get their community and health information. The top three were from their Doctors / Medical Pro vider, t he Internet, and from Friends and Family. Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 90 Other Demographic Questions Individuals were asked if they had children under the age of 18 living in their home. 60.94% of the individuals that answered the question re sponded that yes, they did have children living in their home. Individuals were asked if they lived and worked in Vermilion County. Of the individuals that answered these questions, 96.63% responded that they lived in Vermilion County and 66.80% said th ey worked in Vermilion County. VCHD will redo the \" working in Vermilion County \" question during the next IPLAN cycle as some would write next to the \"No\" that they were retired or were unemployed. The next cycle we will ask them to define their work stat us. Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 91 Community Assessment Survey Questions Top 5 Greatest Strengths of Vermilion County The top 5 strengths chosen of Vermilion County were Police, Fire Rescue Services; Parks and Recreation; Public Transportation; Good Schools; and Affordable Housing. The same question was asked of local Community Stakeholders. Their top 5 strengths chosen of Vermilion County were Parks and Recreation; Police, Fire Rescue Services; Friendly Community; Religious / Spiritual Values; and Good Schools. Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 92 If we look at the individuals who make less than $30,000 for their household income, the top 5 strengths were Public Transportation; Police, Fire, Rescue Services; Access to Healthcare; Affordable Housing; and Early Childhood Services. We found it interes ting and encouraging that public transportation was rated the highest as a strength among this demographic group. Transportation has always been an easy target for why people are not getting the services they need. The transportation access has greatly i mproved over the last 5 years with added bus lines, improvements to the changing stations, a bus line that travels to Champaign -Urbana, and more. Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 93 Top 5 Health Concerns of Vermilion County The top 5 health concerns of Vermilion County chosen were Alcohol / Drug Abuse / Prevention; Child Abuse / Neglect; Domestic Violence; Teenage Pregnancy; and Mental Health Problems. Of the individuals who make less than $30,000 Household income, the top 5 health concerns were Alcohol / Drug Abuse / Prevention; Child Abuse / Neglect; Bullying; Domestic Violence; and Sexually Transmitted Diseases / HIV / AIDS. The Community Stakeholders that completed the survey felt the top 5 concerns were Alcohol / Drug Abuse / Prevention; Mental Health Problems; Teenage Pregnancy; Obesity; and Low High School Graduation Rate. Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 94 Community and Personal Health Rating Individuals were asked to rate the community's health and their own personal health. 63.72% of individua ls that answered the question felt that the community was at least somewhat healthy or better and 93.99% of the individuals that answered the question felt that their own personal health was at least somewhat healthy or better. Below is the breakdown: Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 95 Community Focus The top 5 areas that the community thought Vermilion County should focus on were Low Crime / Safe Neighborhoods; Good Jobs and Healthy Economy; Access to Alcohol / Drug Prevention; Access to Mental Healthcare; and Programs for Youth Outside of School. The Community Stakeholders top 5 focus areas were Access to Alcohol / Drug Prevention; Access to Mental Healthcare; Good Jobs and Healthy Economy; Low Crime / Safe Neighborhoods; and Teen Pregnancy Prevention. This question was a newly added question to the survey this year. We wanted to get an understanding of what the community wanted us to work on as a whole, which is why areas that are not always necessarily cat egorized as \"health concerns\" were added. Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 96 Health Statements This question was a new question added this IPLAN Cycle. We wanted to have some health statements from our community to help get some information for our current workgroups and future priorities. Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 97 Health Statements for households making below $30,000 We also wanted to analy ze the results from individuals who reported their household income as less than $30,000. See page 98 for comparisons to households making more than $30,000. Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 98 Health Statements for Households Making over $30,000 The households who made more than $30,000 were more slightly likely to exercise overall and eat at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables than those who made less than $30,000. Those who made over $30,000 were also more likely to drink excessively by 2%. The under $ 30,000 households were much more likely to consume more than one sugary drink per day, smoke, use illegal drugs, and were less likely to have access to wellness programs. The number of people stating that they eat fast food more than once a week was similar for both groups. Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 99 Service Availability This question was also added this IPLAN cycle as we wanted to get a good understanding if the community felt that the services in Vermilion County were available and accessible. The services that received the most \"no's \" that individuals felt were not accessible and available were, Access to Affordable Childcare (43.60%); Easy Access to STD Services (42.89%); Easy Access to Contraceptives (39.12%); Access to Affordable Housing (34.32%) and Mental Health Services (32.91%). When looking at individuals whose household income was lower than $30,000, the services that received the most \"no's\" were pretty much the same as the general population. Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 100 Community Health Plan Statement of Purpose The purpose of the Community Health Plan was to bring together information from the initial Commun ity Health Assessment and data collection and use these findings to determine the priorities for the next IPLAN cycle. The IPLAN team, along with the Community Stakeholders det ermined which issues were critical to the community to address. The process to which we achieved our priorities is explained below. The Community Health Plan Process In December 2016, the IPLAN team extended an invitation to a list of community stakehol ders to participate in the Community Advisory Committee meetings. In addition, a Community Stakeholder survey was sent to all partners to also identify health concerns/ issues and their perception of the community problems. The first Community Advisory Committee meeting was held on January 18th, 2017 at the Danville Area Community College with 38 participants from a variety of agencies and organizations from across the county. Doug Toole welcomed everyone to the meeting. Melissa Rome and Julia Willis f acilitated the meeting and began by explaining the IPLAN process and reviewing the current priorities and workgroups. Ms. Rome presented the Vermilion County raw data analysis and statistics. Julia Willis provided the information collected from the Community Survey data from the surveys. Ms. Willis also provided stakeholder information that had been collected via the Stakeholder Community survey. Ms. Willis identified the top health concerns from the community surveys: (1) Alcohol/Substance Abuse/Pre vention, (2) Child Abuse / Neglect, (3) Domestic Violence, (4) Teen Pregnancy, and (5) Mental Health Problems. The stakeholders top health concerns were: (1) Alcohol / Drug Abuse Prevention, (2) Mental Health Problems, (3) Teenage Pregnancy, (4) Obesity, and (5) Low High School Graduation Rate. Ms. Rome solicited input from the committee about the top health concerns. The group also looked at the top concerns from households that made below $30,000. Participants discussed key issues facing the communi ty, basing those decisions on existing supportive data. It was brought up by staff from the Housing Authority of the City of Danville that we as a community had not yet completed our work with the current priorities and felt that we should keep those prio rities for the next IPLAN process, but to also include Mental Health as that was continuously brought up in discussion and a desperate need in the data. Ms. Rome asked for a consensus of the group on this idea and all those attending agreed. Ms. Brown wi th CRIS Healthy Aging Center asked if we as a community continue these priorities with the addition of Mental Health to focus on all ages for each of them. The group once again agreed. The 2017-2022 priorities were decided as such in the following order of importance: 1) Substance Abuse / Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 101 Alcohol Prevention, 2) Mental Health, 3) Teen Pregnancy, and 4) Obesity. This was based on survey data between both the community and community stakeholders. The second Community Advisory Committee meeting was held on February 22nd, 2017 at Danville Area Community College. Ms. Rome and Ms. Willis facilitated the meeting. Ms. Rome began the discussion by identifying the proposed timeline for the IPLAN process. Thirty -eight participants from a wide variety of agencies and communit y sectors were engaged in the day's discussion. Ms. Rome identified that the purpose of the second meeting was to go over current resources and gaps for each of the priorities. The group would also be providing input to help develop and execute goals and objectives for each of the 4 chosen priorities. Ms. Rome discussed current / existing programs in Vermilion County. A Community Resource Summary sheet which outlined the details of current resources throughout the County was distributed to the group. Ms. Rome stated this was the information VCHD currently was aware of or that the Resource Directory, 2-1-1, had on their website. Ms. Rome stated that if information was incorrect, the affected agency should contact 2 -1-1 and updated their records. The group chose to talk about each priority as a whole instead of small groups, as some agencies had a stake in multiple priorities. The participants were also given a list of preliminary gaps, barriers, goals, and objectives for each priority. The group dis cussed what was missing or inaccurate in each area. The group was given an activity and timeline worksheet to take back to their agency as to what they would contribute to each priority in the next five years that they were not currently doing. The current workgroups in each priority area would continue and modify their goals and objectives with the onset of the IPLAN. A current group already meets for Mental Health issues and would be used as the Mental Health workgroup as opposed to creating a new one to prevent redundancy. Ms. Rome asked that all worksheets and changes to resources be given to the VCHD by March 31 st, 2017. Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 102 Teen Pregnancy Description Teen pregnancy has been identified as a community health priority for the 4th time since the IPLAN process began. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the rate of babies born to women aged 15 -19 years in 2014 was 24.2 per 1,000 women in this age group. This is a historic low for US teens and is a drop of 9% from 20 13. Although reasons for this drop are unclear, speculations are that teens are del aying sexual activity and have better access to birth control than in previous years. While Vermilion County's birth rate (percentages) was also at a historic low in 2014 (11%), it is almost double the rate of the state of Illinois (6.1%). Vermilion County has had over a 40 year history of high teen pregnancy rates. This highest rate was in 1975 at 24%. See Appendix B for a breakdown of the Teen Pregnancy Rate for Vermi lion County. Teen pregnancy in Vermilion County has unfortunately become institutionalized and multi -generational. It is socially acceptable and has become the community social norm. Teen Pregnancy Prevention is one of CDC's top seven priorities as the y feel it is important to the health and quality of life for our youth. \"The CDC supports the implementation of evidence- based teen pregnancy prevention programs that have been shown, in at least one program evaluation, t o have a positive effect on preven ting teen pregnancies, sexually transmitted infect ions, or sexual risk behaviors (CDC) .\" According to the Guttmacher Institute, although teen pregnancy rates have declined in recent decades, the US rate is still one of the highest in the developed worlds. Teen pregnancy, birth , and abortion rates reached historic lows in 20 11 in the US . In 2011, about 553,000 pregnancies occurred among teen women aged 15 -19, for a national rate of 52.4 pregnancies per 1,000 women in that age- group. This is the lowest rate observed in the last four decades , and it marks a 23% decline from the 2008 teen pregnancy rate of 68.2. National teen birth and abortion rates have also declined sharply. In 2011, there were 31.3 births per 1,000 teen women (down from 40.2 in 2008) an d 13.5 abortions per 1,000 teen women (down from 18.1 in 2008). Analysis completed by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy showed that teen childbearing in the United States cost taxpayers (federal, state, and local) at least $9.4 billion dollars in 2010. Most of these costs are associated with healthcare, foster care, incarcerations, and lost tax revenue. These key data points highlight the need for prevention: 38% of teen girls who have a child before 18 get a high school diploma by age 22. 30% of teen girls who have dropped out of high school cite pregnancy or parenthood as a reason. 67% of teen mothers who moved out of their own families' household live below the poverty level. Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 103 Children born to mothers younger than 18 years o ld score significantly worse on measures of school readiness including math and reading tests. ( National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy ). Vermilion County continues to have a very low high school graduation rate and a low college degree attainment rate. Every child that disconnects from the education system impacts the entire community's future. Multiple generations of births to teens in our county may be a significant contributing factor to low graduation rates. These intertwined issu es require parental involvement and a community that is actively engaged in helping school systems build healthier futures. The Vermilion County high school dropout rate has been above the state rate for several years. According to the 2017 County Health Rankings, Vermilion County's graduation rate was 79 %, th e state of Illinois' rate was 86 %, and top US performers were 95%. Vermilion County's rate of a person with at least some college was at 5 0%, while the state of Illinois' rate was 6 8%. Top US perf ormers' rate was 72%. In 2016, the Vermilion County Teen Pregnancy Prevention Workgroup was established (a 2012 IPLAN Objective). The workgroup has members from multiple sectors including schools, hospitals, health department, housing authorities, and s ocial service agencies. In 2016, t he workgroup developed a survey for teen mothers that were participants in the home visiting programs through Aunt Martha's, a Federally Qualified Health Center . The ages of the mothers when they became pregnant ranged from 13 - 20, with the majority of ages being between 16 -19. It was disturbing to see that of the 29 participants that filled out the survey, 31.58% stated that the reason for their sexual activity was due to a \"goal of becoming a parent\". When asked why they became pregnant, 26.92% stated they wanted to have a baby. For a more detailed report of this survey, please see page 62 of this Community Health Plan. This data reveals the monumental challenges faced when addressing the teen pregnancy issues. Th is is not just an access to care issue. It goes beyond and intertwines with mental health and the ability to hope for a better future. Vermilion County teens also provided valuable data from the I Sing the Body Electric Behavior Survey (ISBE) in 2016. This survey has been collected locally since 2002. Based on the administration of the Illinois Youth Survey (2016) , the I Sing the Body Electric report provides community -level data on a variety of health and social indicators such as drug use, bullying, and school climate. Since 2002, Vermilion County youth have ranked topics of sexual behaviors (including AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, and teen pregnancy) in the top 3 of their health risk concerns. In 2016, it was ranked as number one. 2,118 V ermilion County students (69% of all students in grades 9 -12) were surveyed for the 2016 I Sing the Body Electric Report. Survey data indicated the following information on the topic of sexual behaviors. Nearly one- half of our teens (45.4%) have had sexu al intercourse at least once in their lives. Overall numbers have decreased 9.2% since 2014. One in 19 VC teens (5.1%) reports having sex before reaching 13 years old. One in 16 high school students (6.0%) has been pregnant one or more times or has fa thered a child one or more times - a 22.1% decline since 2014. Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 104 One in 13 sexually active VC teens (7.3%) had \"unprotected\" sex. One in 11 teens (8.6%) reports drinking alcohol or using drugs before sexual intercourse - a 19.6% decrease from 2014. This was an IPLAN 2012 objective accomplishment as 11.25% was the intended target. While improvements have obviously been made in teen pregnancy, Vermilion County still has a lot of work to go. In 2012, the IPLAN objective for reducing the pregnancy rate am ong adolescent females aged 15-19 was at a target of 58.5 pregnancies p er 1,000. According to the 2017 County Health Rankings, the teen pregnancy rate w as 54 pregnancies per 1,000. This is a great achievement to have been met, however, Healthy People 202 0 would like to see the rate being 36.2 pregnancies per 1,000. According to the ISBE survey, the number of teens that have not had sexual intercourse at least once in their lives is at 54.6%. In 2012, the IPLAN objective for the proportion of adolescents age 17 years and younger who have never had sexual intercourse was 48.7%. Once again, we are headed in the right direction. At the time, the baseline was at 44.3%. With the understanding that we have made some great strides in the number of teen pregnancies, it will be crucial to see if the reduction is a trend rather than a mere blip. Vermilion County still has one of the highest teen pregnancy rates in the state. Parental and community involvement is critical in addressing any issue related to our youth and none less so in the issue of sexual health. When looking at the survey data from our teen parents, 96.5% felt they were given valid, accurate information about sexual education. This data would show that it i sn't that our teens are not getting the right information, they ar e instead making poor choices. We also need to make sure our parents are involved with their children. Questions regarding parental involvement with their child for the I Sing the Body Ele ctric survey resulted in: 83.3% of youth say they have a trusted adult they can talk to 17.5% say they \"never\" eat dinner with their parents 33.8% of youth say, \"When I am not home, one of my parents / guardians sometimes or most of the time knows where I am and who I am with.\" According to the ISBE Survey Report, students were asked to list how many activities and opportunities they participated in. A range of 22% to 27% of the students stated that they participated in no activities and opportunities. Children who are more involved in activities are less likely to engage in ri sky behaviors. Our community's future depends on keeping our children in school and making them believe there is hope and a possible future. Education and parental involvement a re critical to accomplishing this. In 2017, the Vermilion County Health Department was able to hire a dedicated Health Educator that was not tied to any grant funding. The Health Educato r will be paid through funds previously paid for rent to the county for the Health Department occupancy of the building. Since 2010, the Vermilion County Health Department has been without a health educator. Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 105 The Community Advisory Committee, a group of more than 50 stakeholders, outlined current resources, risk factors, contributing risk factors, strategies and barriers impacting teen pregnancy in Vermilion County. The Community Health Worksheet depicting the results of these discussions is included in the following tables.

Illicit drugs include: marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, and methamphetamine, as well as the misuse of prescription pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives (NSD UH 2015). The most frequently used illicit drug was marijuana followed by the misuse of prescription pain relievers, with 22.2 million current marijuana users aged 12 or older and 3.8 million people aged 12 or older who reported current misuse of prescrip tion pain relievers (NSDUH 2015). Binge drinking is defined as drinking five or more drink s for men or four or more drink s for wome n on the same occasion on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. Heavy drinking is defined as binge drinking on 5 or more days in the past 30 days. In 2015, there were 138.3 million Americans aged 12 or older who reported current use of alcohol. 66.7 million of those reported binge alcohol use in the past month and 17.3 million reported heavy alcohol use in the past month. Binge drinkers represented 24.9% of the population while heavy drinkers made up 6.5% of the population aged 12 or older (NSDUH 2015). Substance use has a wide range of short and long term effects as well as man y direct and indirect effects. These effects differ based on the drug used, how they are taken, the individual's health, and other factors. Short term effects can include wakefulness, heart rate, blood pressure, heart attack, p sychosis, overdose , and death. These health effects can occur after just one use. Long term effects of substance use can include heart or lung disease, mental illness, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, cancer, and many others. Drug addiction is categorized as a brain disorder ( National Institute on Drug Abuse). According to SAMHSA's 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) an estimated 20.2 million adults (8.4%) had a substance use disorder. Substance use disorders occur when the recurrent use of alcohol and/or drugs causes significant impairment, such as health problems, disab ility, and failure to meet major responsibilities at work, school, or home. It's estimated that 7.9 million adults had both a mental disorder as well as substance use disorder. These co -current disorders carry a high burden of disease, resulting in signif icant costs to individuals, families, employers and health systems such as loss of economic productivity, and increased rate of crime, disability, and death (NSDUH). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), excessive alcohol use causes 88,000 deaths a year. In 2015, there were 52,000 drug overdose deaths in the United States. 29,728 of those were attributed to prescription drugs, 6,784 to cocaine, 12,989 to heroin, an d 33,091 to overall opioid use (NIDA) . Of the 217.1 million Ame ricans with a Substance Use Disorder, just over 10 percent ultimately receive treatment (Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority, ICJIA) . 78% of violent crimes involve drugs and/or alcohol. Approximately 75 % of the 2.3 million prison inmates in t he US meet the criteria for Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 114 substance abuse or addiction ( ICJIA). Addressing the impact of substance use alone is estimated to cost more than $600 billion annually in the US (SAMHSA) . According to the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority, the US government spends an estimated $74 billion on court processing, community supervision, and imprisonment of individuals with substance use disorders. Just 1 percent of that amount is spent on prevention and treatment for these individuals. Additionally, a bout 11 percent of prisoners with substance use disorders receive treatment (ICJIA) . Vermilion County Substance Use Vermilion County has seen a significant increase in drug -related overdose deaths and heroin specific overdose deaths. Vermilion County has seen an increase of 122% in total deaths due to any type of drug between 2013 and 2016. Heroin deaths have seen an increase of 300% between 2013 and 2016. In 2016 there were 20 drug overdose deaths in Vermilion County which is up fro m 9 overdose deaths reported in 2013. Of these 2016 overdose deaths, 12 are attributed to any opioid overdose (including heroin) compared to 7 opioid overdose deaths in 2013 (Illinois Department of Public Health). In 2015, there were 435 drug related arrests made in Vermilion County (Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority). In the 2017 County Health Rankings for Vermilion County reported: The adult smoking rate is 18% which is higher than the state of Illinois average of 15%. The adult excessive alcohol use was 18% which is better than the Illinois state average of 21% . Vermilion County's alcohol impaired driving deaths, which defined as the percentage of driving deaths with alcohol involvement, is 29% compared to 34% state of Illinois average. The Vermilion County Community Health Survey data shows : Alcohol and drug abuse as the number one health concern by a large margin, with 61.58 % of survey participants reporting it in their top 5 health concerns. 3.23% of those surveyed reported illegal drug use. 1.52% reported overusing or abusing prescription drugs . 10.1 % reported sometimes or always consuming four or more drink a day . 32.68 % reported they do not feel Alcohol and Drug Abuse treatment/pre vention services are accessible in Vermilion County . Youth Substance Use Substance use among adolescents is not an \"individual\" problem. It's a complex social problem compounded by contributing factors within the home, school, and community. Addressing local contributing factors is crucial when d eveloping strategic solutions to youth substance use. Some common contributing factors to youth substance use includes permissive family norms, ease of access, peer perception of substance use, lack of provision and/or communication from parents regarding sub stance use, and low perceived risk o f harm to themselves or others. Results from the 2016 Vermilion County survey of area high school students through Presence United Samaritan Medical Center's Foundation program, I Sing the Body Electric, showed alcohol and drug use Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 115 are among the biggest problems for youth. 2,118 Vermilion County students (69% of all students in grades 9 -12) were surveyed for the 2016 I Sing the Body Electric Report. These findings included: Overall numbers of VC youth wh o have had at least one drink of alcohol in their lifetimes have fallen to the lowest level in ISBE survey history going from 77.8% in 2002 to 55.9% in 2016 - a 28.1% decline in use .

Intervention Strategies Take B ack Vermilion County is a substance use coalition formed in March of 2016 through the leadership of community health providers in the County. The goals of the coalition are to enhance collaboration among community organizations and increase community participation to prevent and reduce substance abuse and related risk factors in Vermilion County by implementing or expanding multiple community and school -based prevention strategies through well -coordinated and community -supported prevention initiatives. Vermilion County faces a lack of substance use prevent ion dollars available due to many budget cuts to state agencies and lack of state budget. These cutbacks and slow payments from the State resulted in current hiring and program freezes at several organizations involved in substance use prevention and treat ment. In spite of these challenges, members of the coalitions have acti vely been involved in identifying goals and objectives to decrease substance use and increase their perception of harm and risk regarding substance use. The coalition has maintained inv olvement from representatives of a myriad of community sectors. The Coalition has been constructed to include members of different cultural groups. Take Back Vermilion County includes members with the proven ability to carry out planning, problem solving a nd decision making tasks. Members are called upon to provide resources and to mobilize community members and groups for active participation in specific prevention efforts. Take Back Vermilion County Strategies By May 2018, host 3 town hall meeting s to increase knowledge on youth substance abuse and related problems in Vermilion County to local community groups Engage community stakeholders in youth substance abuse prevention by hosting 2 local trainings by Prevention First and Prairie Center for at leas t 20 coalition and community stakeholders Implement community wide media campaigns and advocacy aligned with annual national youth prevention campaigns : Red Ribbon Week , National Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month, National Prevention Week Prov ide the SAMSHA approved Youth Prevention Education curriculum, Too Good for Drugs, a life skills Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 124 and drug prevention education curriculum to the 3 elementary and 4 middle schools in Vermilion County Develop campaign materials consistent with various evidence based cognitive, behavioral and deve lopmental theories in order to a ffect the beliefs, intentions and behaviors of students to be released to teachers, community organizations, and parent groups Continue supporting I Sing the Body Electric project at High schools in Vermilion County Develop workplace initiatives - workplace education and outreach programs, coordination with employee assistance, wellness, and benefits programs and as well as supervisor training on signs and symptoms of subst ance abuse Promote 211 as resource guide of available community resources Develop ongoing community awareness campaign Pursue grants and funding opportunities to build organizational capacity to address substance use Vendor and beverage seller compli ance checks Educate parents, educators, landlords, and other community members about substance use: what to look for, and how to respond appropriately, and how to prevent use in the first place Work with the prescribing providers in Vermilion County (phy sicians, dentists, mental health practices) to encourage the use of agreements with patients who are prescribed highly addictive prescriptions Nursing Students / Interns University of Illinois Nursing students completed a project for Take Back Vermilion County in March, 2017. The students surveyed all schools K through 12 in the county. They asked for information on existing drug education, if any, each school currently covers. This information helps Take Back Vermilion County determine the best way to implement substance use education programs in each school. VCHD will continue to work with the students and any future interns to complete projects that can be used by the Take Back Vermilion County and the VCHD. Estimated Funding for Teen Substance Abu se Interventions $,930,000 over five years Anticipated Sources of Funding for Substance Abuse Interventions In-kind contributions from participating organizations County Government - Salaries Partnership with Executive Committee / Corporate Support - Salaries Possible Drug Free Communities Grant - $125,000 over 4 years. Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 125 Community Partnerships During the IPLAN meetings, VCHD asked each agency to complete an activity and timeline worksheet for activities per priority that they were not currently doing , but would try to implement during the next 5 years. Below is a list and description of some of these programs and strategies that the health department received that will address the 2017 -2022 priorities: Agency Timeline Activity Big Brothers Big Sisters / Young Women Aware July 2017 Have a counselor come and speak from the Prairie Center to talk about the effects of drugs and alcohol Presence Health Community Resource Center Ongoing Ongoing The CRC will continue to work with patients/clients to link them to needed resources. As the IPLAN develops strategies to address these needs, the CRC can help spread the word and get our patients/clients engaged in those services. The CRC can provide information on unmet needs or trends that are being seen in the ED as well as throughout the hospital. This data would be limited to what HIPAA would allow, but could help keep the group informed. Vermilion County Health Department As of April, 2017 VCHD's newly hired Health Educator will be able to get back into the schools, after school activities, service groups, etc. Evaluation The Take Back Vermilion County coalition will look at the following tools for evaluation of their progress: I Sing the Body Electric Data (collected every 2 years) Baseline increases for current programs Pre/Post analysis of school based programs Compliance checks - comparing annually Increased utilization of 211 ER visit analysis Treatment numbers Number of workplace init iatives Evaluate the community reach of the town hall meetings/forums using sign in rosters. After any developed materials have been designed, collect feedback from a representative sample of the target audience regarding effectiveness and materials will be modified as needed. Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 126 Obesity Description Obesity contin ues to rise across the United States. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) defines obesity as having a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30. Obesity is a contributing cause of many health problems. It is associated with poorer mental health outcomes, reduced quality of life, and the leading cause of death in the U.S. and worldwide, through contributing to heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some types of cancer. Obesity is a top comm unity health priority in Vermilion County. CDC states the following facts about obesity in adults (CDC NCHS Data Brief. Nov 2015) More than one -third (36.5%) of U.S. adults are obes e 70.7 % of adults age 20 years and over are overw eight, including being o bese (2013 -2014) 78.6 million adults in the U.S. are obese. In every state, more than 20% of adults are obese, and in twenty -five states, over 30% of adults are obese No state has an obesity rate less than 20% The prevalence of obesity was higher in women (38.3%) than in men (34.3%). Among all youth, no difference was seen by sex. Annual medical care costs are staggering. Annual estimates of medical costs are as high as $147 billion in the U.S. The medical costs for people who are obese are estimated to be $1,429 higher than those of a normal weight. CDC identifies the national epidemic of obesity is the result of a combination of causes and contributing factors including individual health behaviors, genetics, and societal factors. Societal and Communit y Environment Physical environment Communities are built in ways that make it difficult or unsafe to be physically active Access to parks and recreation centers may be difficult or lacking and public transportation may not be available Safe routes for walk ing or biking to school, work, or play may not exist Education and skills Too few students get quality, daily physical education in school Food marketing and promotion Foods high in sugar, fat, and salt are frequently ad vertised and marketed It is often ea sier and cheaper to get less healthy foods and beverages Genetics Medication use and d isease Individual health b ehaviors Physical inactivity Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 127 Sedentary lifestyle such as wat ching television or other screen devices for over 2 hours a day. Dietary patterns Some Americans have less access to stores and markets that provide healthy, affordable food such as fruits and vegetables. Restaurants, snack shops, and vending machines provide food that is often higher in calories and fat than food made at home. Accordi ng to CDC Data trends 6 in 10 youth (63%) and 5 in 10 adults (49%) drank a sugar -sweetened beverage (SSB) on a given day (2011- 2014) On average, U.S. youth consume 143 calories from SSB's and U.S. adults consume 145 calories from SSBs on a given day. Ac cording to the Vermilion County Community Health Survey 68.5 % of participants reported they sometimes or always drink more than one sugary beverage a day. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Trust for America's Health organization have collaborated to produce an annual extensive report: The State of Obesity (2016 ). This report reiterates many of the issues influencing the obesity epidemic in the U.S. In addition, the State of Obesity lists these additional considerations: Adults consume d approximately 460 more calories daily in 2010 than they did in 1970 Portion sizes have grown significantly over time. There has been an increasing size of meal portions, both at homes and in restaurants (identified as \"portion distortion\"). Many restaura nt portion sizes have doubled or tripled over the past 20 years. U.S. adults consume nearly three times the recommended amount of sugar. Over the past decade there has been a decreased in -home cooking with a rising number of meals eaten or bought from restaurants. One -third of the calories Americans consume - and nearly half (48%) of their food budget is from eating out. Foods eaten outside the home tend to be higher in fat, sodium, and calories. There are significant racial and ethnic inequities There is income and/or education inequities - Obesity rates are highest among people who live in low income communities. This population is more likely to have limited access to healthy options and progress in addressing the inequalities has been limited so far. Increased advertising and marketing of unhealthy foods, particularly to kids An abundance of digital devices which discourages physical activity County and State Adult Obesity Statistics The State of Obesity 2016 Report: Adult obesity rate for Illinois was 30.8% Illinois adult o besity rates by sex: Female 28.0%; Male 28.2% Illinois adult o besity race: White 28.3%; Black 40.7%; County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 128 Illinois adult o besity rates by age : 18-25 years old 17.1%; 26- 44 years old 30.3%; 45- 64 years old 36.1%; 65+ years old 31.3% Obesity trends in Illinois : (State of Obesity 2016) 25 years ago (1988- 1990) 12.1 % of adult Illinois residents were obese 20 years ago (1993- 1995) 15.3% were obese 15 years ago (1998- 2000) 20.4% were obese 10 years ago (2003- 2005) 23.2% were obese 5 years ago (2008 - 2010) 27.7% were obese Current (2013 - 2015) 30.8% are obese 66.2% of adults in Illinois are either overweight or obese (Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of (BRFSS 2013 -2015 Survey Results) . According to the Co unty Health Rankings 2017, a dult obesity rates in Vermilion County have risen to 35% and adults reporting that they are inactive are at 27%. While this was a reduction from 2016's County Health Rankings of 37% for the adult obesity rate, it is still an in crease from 28% in 2010 when the County Health Rankings began. Childhood Obesity National childhood obesity statistics have remained stable over the past decade at 17% (NCHS Data Brief 2015) . Rates are declining among 2 -5 year olds, stable among 6 -11 year olds, and increasing among 12 -19 year olds (NHANES, 2011 -2014) . Available county -level childhood obesity statistics are limited. There is currently no data collection system in place to sh are information among local schools, WIC office s, doctors' offices, and other locations In Vermilion County where childhood BMI is measured. Developing a system of data sharing is presented as an objective f or addressing childhood obesity in Vermilion County. The State of Obesity 2016 reports the following about childhood obesity at the national and state level: Almost 1/3 (31.3%) of U.S. children and adolescents between the ages of 2 and 19 are overweight or obese (2011- 2012, National Survey of Children's Health, phone surveys of parents in each state). Children who are overweight or obese are more likely to be obese as adults. The 2015 Illinois obesity rate for high school students was 12.6 % Children growing up in low -income families and neighborhoods have a higher risk of being obese. 20.9%, more than 15 million children in the U.S. , experience food insecurity annually. County Health Rankings 2017 reported that 16% of children living in Vermilion County have limited access to food, known as food insecurity. Food insecurity is having limited access to adequate food and nutrition due to cost, proximity, and accessibility. Less expensive food options, such as processed or fast foods are more likely to be low in nutritional value and high in added sugars , sodium, and f at. A 2016 Vermilion County survey of area high school students through Presence United Samaritan Medical Center's Foundation program, I Sing the Body Electric , provided a significant number of fin dings Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 129 regarding body image, nutrition and physical fitness among this population. 2,118 Vermilion County students (69% of all students in grades 9 -12) were surveyed for the 2016 I Sing the Body Electric Report . These findings included: Students' self -reported weights on the survey indicate that 61.8% of them are at a healthy weight, 20.3% would be considered overweight, and 16.3% are obese based on the CDC guidelines. To become healthier, almost nine out of 10 Vermilion County teens (88.5%) are choosing to exercise, and almost four out of 10 Vermilion County teens (37.5%) are choosing to eat sensibly. 89.3 % of Vermilion youth reported they ate fruit at least one time in the past week. 86.0% reported they ate vegetables at least one time in the past week. Slightly more than one in four teens (25.5%) was physically active for a total of at least 60 minutes every day for a week. Three out of ten teens (31.8%) spent three or more hours of an average school day watching TV, and nearly six out of ten (57.5%) p layed video or computer games or used a computer for non - school related activities in the same time frame. Maternal Health and Obesity Poor maternal health, including obesity and poor nutrition, can increase the risk for miscarriages, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, obesity , slow fetal growth, prematurity, l ow birth weight babies, and lower IQ in babies (State of Obesity 2016) . Women, Infants, and Children Program ( WIC ) provide s nutrition support to low income pregnant, postpartum and bre astfeeding women, infants, and children up to the age of 5. WIC allows families to access healthy foods like fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and low -fat dairy all of which are important to pregnant women, breastfeeding women, and growing children. In 2016, Vermilion County WIC completed 4 ,430 Nutrition Assessments among WIC parents and children. Breastfeeding is associated with many health benefits for mother and child. The State of Obesity Prenatal and Maternal Health 2016 Report states som e of these benefits include: One year postpartum, women who exclusively breastfeed for at least three months are more likely to return to the same or lower BMI as pre- pregnancy compared to women who do not breastfeed or breastfeed non -exclusively. For the infant, breastfeeding lowers the risk of gastrointestinal infections, diabetes, and obesity. Breastfeeding families can save on the cost of formula. Also, it is estimated that around $2.2 billion could be saved in the U.S. annually in medical costs if breastfeeding recommendations were met. In Illinois , 47% of women are breastfeeding at 6 months, compared to the U.S. rate of 49.4% who are breastfeeding at 6 months (CDC Breastfeeding Report Card 2014) . The Vermilion County WIC program tracks the numbe r of mothers who initiate breastfeeding while enrolled in the program as well as the Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 130 duration rate of breastfeeding at 6 months. From July 2015 to July 2016, WIC reported 855 infants (58%) were breastfed among WIC clients. In that same year, 298 (13%) clients were still breastfeeding their infant at 6 months. Complications of Obesity Obesity is linked to a wide range of health consequences. According to the CDC, people who are obese, compared to those with a normal or healthy weight, are at an increased risk for many serious diseases and health conditions, including: high blood pressure, high LDL cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea and breathing problems, some cancers, low quality of life, mental illness, and body pain and difficulty with physical functioning. Diabetes According to the CDC, diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States. Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, end stage kidney disease, and lower -extremity amputations. In 2015, the Illinois diabetes rate was 9.9%. It was reported that there were 7,539 people living with diagnosed diabetes in Vermilion County in 2013 (CDC) . In a four year period, 2012 to 2015, there were 88 diabetes - related deaths in Vermilion County (IDPH, Death Statistics) . Heart Disease Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in the U.S. for both men and women. The CDC reports that more than 600,000 Americans die each year from heart diseases, which accoun ts fo r 1 in every 4 deaths in the United States . Obesity, eating an unhealthy diet, and not getting enough exercise all increas es the risk for heart disease. I n Vermilion County, 3,390 or 5.3% of adults aged 18 and older have ever been told by a doctor th at they have coronary heart disease or angina. Hypertension Obesity greatly increases the risk of developing hypertension. Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, increases your risk of heart disease and stroke which are two leading causes of death for Americans. In Vermilion County, 17,474 adults (28.3%) aged 18 and older have been told by a doctor that they have high blood pressure. According to the CDC Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention Hypertension was a primary or contributin g cause of death for more than 410,000 Americans in 2014\u2014that's more than 1,100 deaths each day. High blood pressure costs the nation $48.6 billion each year - this includes health care services, medications to treat high blood pressure, and missed days of work. Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 131 Economics of Obesity Obesity and its related health problems have a strong economic impact in the U.S. It's one of the largest preventa ble chronic diseases in the United States. Obesity is linked with higher healthcare costs for adults and child ren through direct medical costs , along with impacting job productivity and absenteeism. In 2008, obesity and its related health consequences accounted for an additional $1 47 billion in health care costs (CDC) . Obesity's associated health factors are li nked with job absenteeism, costing around $4.3 billion annually. As an adult's BMI increases, the number of sick days, medical claims, and healthcare costs rise (State of Obesity 2016) . Lower job productivity is associated with obesity related health fact ors, costing employers $ 506 per obese worker per year (S tate of Obesity 2016) . Obese adults spend on average 42% more on direct healthcare costs than adults at a healthy weight. The health care cost for a severely or morbidly obese adult, whose BMI is greater than 40, is estimated to be 81% higher than for a healthy weight adult (State of Obesity 2016) . Overweight and obesity in children alone is estimated to cost an additional $14.1 billion dollars in prescription drug, ER visits, and healthcare visits. It's estimated that an obese 10 -year old who continues to gain weight throughout childhood and into adulthood has a lifetime medical cost that is $19, 000 hi gher compared to 10 year old who maintains a healthy weight (State of Obesity 2016) . The CDC also notes that i n addition to these costs, data shows implications of obesity on recr uitment by the armed forces. In 2008, an assessment of the percentage of U.S. military -age population whose standards for weight for height and percent body fat based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was performed. It was found tha t 5.7 million men and 16.5 million women who were eligible for military service exceeded the Army's enlistment standards for weight and body fat. Reducing obesity, increasing activity, and improving nutrition can have a strong impact on lowering health c are costs through fewer prescription drugs, sick days, ER visits, doctor's office visits, and admissions to the hospital. In 2008, the Urban Institute, The New York Academy of Medicine, and Trust for America's Health did a study which found that an invest ment of $10 a person in evidence based community programs to increase physical activity, improve nutrition, and prevent smoking tobacco could save the county more than $16 billion a year within the five years. Out of that $16 billion, Medicare could save m ore than $5 billion and Medicaid could save $1.9 billion. That's an estimated return of $5.60 for every $1 invested in obesity prevention. Expanding prevention program s would be the most effective strategic investment that w ould yield the greatest result s (Trust for America's Health) . Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 132 Community Health Plan - Obesity The Community Advisory Committee, a group of more than 40 key stakeholders, outlined a number of risk factors and contributing factors impacting the prevalence of obesity in Vermilion Coun ty. Barriers and prevention strategies as well as better utilization of community resources were also discussed. The Community Health Worksheet depicting the results of these discussions is included in the following table.

Intervention Strategies Obesity has been a national and local health issue for many years now. Obesity was a chosen priority area for the previous IPLAN (2012 - 2017). Vermilion County did not mee t any of the 2012- 2017 IPLAN objectives for obesity, when in fact, the percentages for adult obesity increased at a high rate. Some of the objectives that were chosen in 2012 were based on questions asked from the Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Survey an d with the latest surveys completed, they did not include prior healthy eating / physical activity questions. There were also some changes to the questions in the I Sing the Body Electric when they adopted the Illinois Youth Survey. This makes it difficu lt to measure any progress that was made. There have been many groups, organizations, hospital programs, schools, churches, and individuals in the past five years working to address the obesity in the County. A few of these efforts directly relating to Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 137 2012-2017 IPLAN obesity objectives include: Presence Health's HALO project implemented many different strategies which brought together many different community members and organizations to collaborate on healthy living projects such as: Danville Let's Move Initiative for Childhood Obesity Let's Walk Vermilion County Project (d eveloped with funds from the We Choose Health Grant, which included a b rochure that identified walking paths in 15 communities within Vermilion County ) Fit Me In Booklet and Bookmark, which included w ays to fit exercise and healthy eating into everyday practices Rethink your Drink Initiative Healthy Food Kiosk at County Market - information ab out healthy eating for all ages Women Aware through CRIS Healthy Aging held quarterly education seminars focused on better health for the elderly . Faith in Action has continued to offer produce sharing and community gardens. U of I extension provides many nutrition and wellness programs, including the Master Gardener's program which provides education on using produce and gardening. Healthy Vermilion County In February 2016, Healthy Vermilion County (HVC) wa s formed as a workgroup in response to the identified 2012 -2017 IPLAN priority area, obesity. HVC focuses on getting healthy inf ormation and practices into the community and brings together a diverse group of community members and organizations to address the rising obesity issues in Vermilion County. HVC focuses on healthy eating and nutrition and active living. Membership of HVC includes representation from: CRIS Healthy Aging DACC Danville School Dist. 118 Danville Housing Authority Lakeview College Local County Citizen Local Gym owners Presence, HALO Master Gardeners U of I Extension United Way of Danville Area Vermilion Adv antage Vermilion County Health Department Vermilion Gardens WIC YMCA In the summer of 2016, HVC implemented a Rethink Your Drink initiative into the community. Sweetened beverages play a big role in contributing to the increasing rates obesity. This initiative focuses on providing information and practices to help participa nts decrease consumption of sweetened drinks and increase water consumption. Visual display boards presenting sugar content in popular drinks have been displayed at local farmers markets, businesses, YMCA, park events, U of I Ext nutrition events, and local health fairs. As part of an initiative to promote healthy snacks and drinks for sports teams, HVC developed materials and resources to encourage coaches and parents to make healthy nutrition choices within sports programs. The materials were distributed to local soccer programs. HVC has also Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 138 developed a social media campaign with a Healthy Vermilion County Facebook page to promote local health and wellness events along with spread ing information on nutrition and physical activity. These will be some of t he strategies that HVC will work towards in the upcoming IPLAN period.

Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 142 Mental Health Description According to Healthy People 2020, \"Mental health is a state of successful performance of mental function, resulting in productive activities, fulfilling relationships with other people, and the ability to adapt to change and to cope with challenges. Mental health is essential to personal well -being, fa mily and interpersonal relationships, and the ability to contribute to community or society.\" In any given year, about 18.1% of adults in the United States ages 18 years or older suffer from a mental illness and about 4.2% suffer from a seriously debilita ting mental illness (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality) . In Illinois , between 2013- 2014, about 363, 000 adults aged 18 or older had a serious mental illness within the year prior to being surveyed (SAMHSA). Only 44.6% of all adults with any mental illness in Illinois received mental health treatment / counseling within the year prior to being surveyed (SAMHSA) . According to the 2017 County Health Rankings, the average number of days Vermilion County adult respondents reported that their mental health was not good was 3.9 days.

United Way 2 -1-1 is a hotline for times of crisi s as well as for everyday needs, however, for immedi ate crisis needs, the public still needs to call 9 -1-1. 2-1-1 call specialists are available 24/7 to help individuals locate health and human services in their area - from mortgage, rent, and utility assistance to food, clothing, emergency shelter, coun seling and much more. They are th e same specialists that are called for the suicide hotline. Between April 2015 -March 2016, there were 75 calls for mental illness, 32 calls for homelessness, 30 calls for homeless shelter, and 20 calls for Suicide. Betw een October 2016 - December 2016, there were 6 calls for suicide (United Way 2 -1-1 Reports) . Children in Vermilion County are also at a greater risk for mental health problems.

Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 150 Intervention Strategies Since Access to Ment al Health is a new priority, the IPLAN group decided to join an already current workgroup in Vermilion County called the Vermilion County Mental Health Initiative which has been meeting since April 2015. The committee began as a steering committee for sui cide prevention efforts. Their goals are based on suicide prevention reduction of stigma / increased awareness, and identifying resources. The following are proposed strategies that the IPLAN Community Advisory Committee developed for the Mental Health W orkgroup. Workgroup Strategies Deliver a Mental Health Needs Assessment every three years. Promote Mental Health First Aid Training Survey physician offices to see what type of mental health screening they are performing and how often Integrate mental health services into primary health care Promote more mental health screenings for children and youth at regular annual check -ups / school physicals Promote agency referrals Identify and reach those in need of care Raising awareness about mental heal th disorders through education and advocacy for more respect and less stigma Widen the use of health information technology (TeleHealth) Promote Evidence Based Practices Increase the number of support gr oups for children and adults / raise a wareness of current support groups Develop a Resource Guide for Mental Health Services Estimated Funding for Mental Health Interventions $500,000 over five years Anticipated Sources of Funding for Mental Health Interventions In-kind contributions from participating organizations County Government - Salaries Partnership with Executive Committee / Corporate Support - Salaries Mental Health First Aid Training through Aunt Martha's Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 151 Community Partnerships During the IPLAN meetings, VCHD asked each agency to complete an activity and timeline worksheet for activities per priority that they were not currently doing, but would try to implement during the next 5 years. Below i s a list and description of some of these programs and strategies that will address the 2017 -2022 pr iorities: Agency Timeline Activity Presence Health Community Resource Center Ongoing Ongoing The CRC will continue to work with patients/clients to link them to needed resources. As the IPLAN develops strategies to address these needs, the CRC can help spread the word and get our patients/clients engaged in those services. The CRC can provide information on unmet needs or trends that are being seen in the ED as well as throughout the hospital. This data would be limited to what HIPAA would allow, but could help keep the group informed. Presence Health - Faith in Action Ongoing Luncheons held 4 times a year to focus on IPLAN and identified Emergency Department Needs East Central Illinois Community Action Agency Ongoing Head Start Maternal and Infant and Early C hildhood Home Visiting Services (includes mental health screenings and educati on) Education Talen t Search College Preparatory Services Community Services Block Grants Help with Homeownership - preparing individuals interested in the home -buying process Energy Bill Assistance / Energy Upgrade Assistance Affordable Housing in Hoopesto n.

Who We Serve The Vermilion County Health Department serves the 81,000 residents of Vermilion County. Our Programs and Services The Vermilion County accomplishes its mission through the following programs: Vital Records Women, Infant and Children (WIC) Communicab le Disease Control Program Immunization Program Tuberculosis Program Annual Seasonal Flu Project Environmental Health Division Food Service Sanitation Potable Water Supplies Private Sewage Disposal Vector Prevention and Pest Control Housing Program Solid Waste Nuisance Control Lead Poisoning Prevention Smoke Free Illinois Act Enforcement Emergency Planning and Preparedness Education Services for Students in Health Care Professions Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 168 Vermilion County Health Department Strategic Plan 2015 -2020 Our Goals 2015 -2020 1. Strengthen the economic sustainability of the Vermilion County Health Department (VCHD) 2. Enhance communications, marketing and promotion of VCHD; Enhance community relations 3. Address community needs through programming, services and education 4. Maximize VCHD workforce capacity, efficiency and retention of employees 5. Enhance Emergency Preparedness and response capabilities Background and Context Local health departments in Illinois face many challenges and opportunities. The Vermilion County Board of Health along with key Vermilion County Health Department staff recently embarked on a strategic planning process to identify the challenges facing the health department and to capitalize on its s trengths and opportunities. The Board of Health seeks to ensure ongoing viability and sustainability for the health department as the health department continues to serve the critical needs of the residents of Vermilion County. Process The Board of Healt h completed a SWOT analysis (see Appendix A -1.1, 1.2) to identify the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats facing the Health Department. Board of Health members then ranked the top 5 issues in each category and goals and strategies were develop ed. The overall plan is designed to ensure the Vermilion County Health Department is well prepared for what comes next. In addition, the Vermilion County Board Chairman has created an adhoc committee to develop a strategic plan (VC 2025) for the County as a whole and the VCHD Board wishes to ensure health department goals compliment the County's long term plans. Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 169 Vermilion County Health Department Strategic Plan 2015 -2020 Our Goals 2015- 2020 Goal 1: Strengthen the economic sustainability of the Vermilion County Health Department The State of Illinois fiscal crisis is an ongoing threat to many organizations, agencies and programs including local health departments (LHDs). LHDs have continued to see reductions in funding and reduced revenue stream s over the last several years. VCHD seeks to monitor all areas of revenue that impacts its economic stability and sustainability. Intervention Strategies: Evaluation a) Seek grant opportunities especially with community collaboration and partnerships # of ne w grants added by 2016, 2018, 2020 b) Research non -grant funded revenue resources, including but not limited to, establishing a Health Department Foundation a. By June 2016 research barriers, identify requirements, etc.in establishing a VCHD Foundation # and type of any new revenue sources added c) Monitor impact of Affordable Care Act (ACA) as potential revenue source Annual & PRN Review of legislative changes related to ACA. Annual review of any revenue achieved related to ACA d) Monitor and maximize billing efforts (especially as related to billing for immunizations) Annual review of vaccine expenditure vs revenue a. By Dec 2016 train at least 1 additional VCHD staff person to do insurance billing b. By Sept. 2016, assess need for addition of billing software (for billing insurance for immunizations, etc.) c. By Dec. 2016 explore vendors offering immunization billing software and cost of software Name and date of VCHD employee trained to do billing Need assessment report List of vendors and cost of billing software (if assessed as needed) e) Advocate with County Board to eliminate rent by CFY 2016 -17 Rent status; budget amendment or adjustment as needed f) Advocate with County Board to maximize full use of tax levy appropriated for health department by 2016 -17 County Board office /Finance Committee discussions; County Board actions; Budget amendment or adjustment as needed g) Advocate with State representatives and senators to improves funding of LHDs (i.e., increase Local Health Protection Grant funding) IPHA advocacy e ffort outcomes VCHD advocacy efforts State of Illinois Budget LHPG line item increase h) Review VCHD fee schedules: 1) Immunizations/ annually and as needed; 2) Environmental Health fees and Vital Record fees, minimum of every 3 years or sooner as needed Annual cost analysis of Immunization fees Cost analysis of EH fees/ Vital Record fees every 3 years i) Work with County Software OpenGov.com to provide timely, relevant fiscal data. VCHD Administrator and Financial Director registered users on OpenGov .com b y October 2015 Data reports utilized for monthly budget reports and/or annual budget preparation Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 170 Vermilion County Health Department Strategic Plan 2015 -2020 Our Goals 2015- 2020 Goal 2: Enhance communications, marketing and promotion of VCHD; Enhance community relations The Vermilion County Health Department, for almost 50 years, has quietly provided critical programs and services for the resi dents of Vermilion County. The nature of our work often requires dealing with private and protected informat ion making it difficult to share what we do with the public and media due to confidentiality requirements. In addition, public health is about prevention efforts and \"showing\" prevention is often not appreciated or seen as \"news worthy\". Public Health of ten only makes the news in a crisis situation. VCHD would like to take a more pro -active approach in promoting who we are and what we do. Our primary mission is to improve the quality of life for all residents of Vermilion County utilizing disease preve ntion, health protection and health promotion programs....through enhanced community collaborations, cooperation and communication. Intervention Strategies: Evaluation a) Provide communication training (specifically how to deal with media) to VCHD Administration, Supervisors and key staff by July 2016 Date of training(s) provided; List of employees trained b) Increase promotion of the Health Dept. via VCHD website, Facebook pages, Vermilion Advantage tab pages and other media # \"Likes\" on FB pages for VCHD general FB page and WIC FB page # of Vermilion Advantage tab pages completed # of other media reports, stories, etc a. Promote ongoing VCHD efforts at least quarterly (ongoing beginning October 2016) # of press releases # of web page promotions # of c ommunity presentations b. Celebrate key accomplishments including VCHD 50 year anniversary (July 2016) # of press releases # of story promotions # in attendance at anniversary open house c. Provide timely information during public health crisis events (ongoing) # of press releases # media interview # of education sessions/documents posted or published c) Ensure current media contact list and maintain ongoing media relationships Annual Review (and prn) by PIO and/or Community Liaison of media contact list d) Utilize Community Liaison (currently 25% staff position) and key staff to engage with community organizations # of presentations # of community partner meetings attended Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 171 Vermilion County Health Department Strategic Plan 2015 -2020 Our Goals 2015- 2020 Goal 3: Address community needs through programming, services and education Vermilion County Health Department is required by the State of Illinois to complete a community assessment and develop a community plan to address identified needs as part of the health department's recertification process every 5 years. Many other community agencies including local hospitals are also required to complete a community assessment. There has been an ongoing effort over the last several years to identify a process to complete a community assessment that satisfies the requirements of the variety of agencies, organizations, and of the health department. Timing requirements by the state and accrediting bodies ha s made doing a single community assessment a ch allenge; hospitals are on a 3 year cycle, LHDs are on a 5 year cycle. Due to the State fiscal crisis in 2010, VCHD lost 14 programs and 60% of staff. Community health needs did not go away but t he capacity to address those needs were critically impacted. Some programs or parts of programs were picked up by other agencies and organizations within our community but there are still gaps in needed services to improve the health and quality of life of Vermilion County residents. Intervention Strategies: Evaluation a) Enhance partnerships to complete the community assessment process that is required for LHDs and local hospitals. By Nov 2015, hire Regional Community Health Plan Coordinator through partnership with Presence, Carle, VCHD, CUPHD and United Way. Employee hired date # of community meetings attended # of new work groups established Community Assessment reports b) Complete IPLAN/VCHD certification process by Nov. 2017 IPLAN continued VCHD Organizational Capacity completed by Spring 2017 # of internal and external IPLAN meetings; # of surveys completed, etc. by 2016 -2017 Preliminary review of IPLAN submitted to State by Date Aug 2017 Submission of IPLAN to BOH by Date Sept 20, 2017 Submission to State by Sept 30, 2017 of final IPLAN and accept ance by State by Nov 2017 c) Add programs and services to address community needs as funding and resources allow Explore adding STD services (via urine testing by May 2016) Date and type of new programs or services offered d) Add Health Educator position by 2016 -2017 to address identified community health needs Name and date health educator hired Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 172 Vermilion County Health Department Strategic Plan 2015 -2020 Our Goals 2015- 2020 Goal 4: Maximize VCHD workforce capacity, efficiency and retention of employees VCHD currently has a staff of 27 employees. Loss of 60% of staff in 2010 has severely impacted any redundancy in program are as; staffing limitations has occasionally required reduction or limitation in the availabilit y of the remaining service at the health department. A variety of issues constrains our ability to rebuild workforce capacity including the state fiscal crisis, red uction in grant funding, flat funding of the Local Health Protection, less competitive wag es and continual reduction in other employee benefits. In addition, VCHD has been experiencing a steady loss of long -term employees due to many reaching retirement age. This loss impacts \"institutional knowledge\" and reduces and threatens our expertise i n many program areas. Intervention Strategies: Evaluation a) Continue to work with staff to improve knowledge as current staff are eligible to retire. Develop departmental contingency plans by January 2016 Contingency plan completed for each department. Re- evaluate annually and as needed b) Continue to explore ways to enhance hiring competition Meet with County HR Director at least annually and prn # of meetings with HR Strategies developed c) Increase recruitment efforts for MRC volunteer pool, including but not limited to nursing staffing # of presentations # of volunteers added d) Maintain ongoing MOUs with Lakeview College of Nursing, University of Illinois College of Nursing, DACC Nursing program MOUs on file with nursing programs e) Utilize unpaid Internships By 2016, annually enlist at least 1 intern at VCHD # of interns utilized # and type projects completed by intern(s) f) Partner with other agencies to enhance/ supplement our efforts (ex: U of I Extension provides nutrition education for WIC program) List of agencies or partners utilized to enhance VCHD services g) Update technology resources Review and purchase annually needed software upgrades; improved server capacity/capability. Upgrade computers, printers, as needed a. Continue to work towards moving paper records to online systems, i. Environmental Health. By 2020, upload 8300+ sewage files in an electronic database. ii. Investigate process and resources needed to have food files in an online format by 2025. # of Sewage files uploaded iii. Billing System (for immunization billing and other services) implemented by 2020 Name and date of billing software/system utilized iv. Electronic Medical Records by 2025 (as funding allows) Name and date EMR record system implemented b. Ensure compatibility with State online systems such as ICARE, INEDSS, CEMP, Cornerstone, etc. Annual review and prn as new online systems are added at VCHD. Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 173 Vermilion County Health Department Strategic Plan 2015- 2020 Our Goals 2015- 2020 Goal 5: Enhance Emergency Preparedness Response and capabilities VCHD continually develops and implements all hazards emergency prepared/emergency response plans and develops and coordinates community volunteer resources in the event of a public health emergency such as a pandemic, mass outbreak, environme ntal emergency event or bioterrorism event. VCHD seeks to enhance our capabilities where possible and assure our readiness to respond to a public health emergency. By 2020, VCHD seeks to add at least 25 volunteers to its volunteer roster . Intervention Strategies: Evaluation a) Continue to partner with Vermilion County Emergency Management, Hospital Emergency Prep folks (ongoing) List of areas of cooperation: # of shared exercises # of shared documents/ reports # of collaborative meetings/ emails, etc b) Seek new partnerships with Village Mayors to enhance emergency preparedness efforts. By 2016, identify key contact person in county towns/villages. By 2017, develop strategy(s) to share emergency information to each community in a timely and effective manner. List of key contacts for each community within VC # of presentations/meetings with village mayors/council to develop best strategies for sharing information in emergency situations. Description of strategies to be utilized c) Enhance recruitment of vol unteers utilizing Nursing school partnerships. By 2016, provide 1 -3 presentations annually at schools/colleges of nursing # presentations # of volunteers added d) Seek new partnerships with School Districts including Dist 118 and county schools to enhance e mergency preparedness efforts # of presentations or collaborative meetings, emails, etc provided to school districts a. By fall 2016, explore utilization of established school communication systems with parents and family to \"blast\" or share information in emergency situations and to promote VCHD in general with at least 1 school district. By 2018, make contact will all county schools. # and list of partnering schools Description of how communications are shared with and throughout each school district Vermilion County Community Health Plan 2017 -2022 Vermilion County Page 174 Vermilion County 2020 Appendices A-1.1 Analysis/Strengths & Weaknesses A-1.2...............................SWOT County Community Health Plan -2022 Vermilion County Page 175 APPENDICES - A-1.1 SWOT Analysis Strengths What do we do well?

Availability of Grants and Programs 2. Comm. Assessment process is time consuming/labor intensive; we have limited staff who know how to do this 3. Too dependent on grant funding/grant funding is program specific/ tax levy too low 4. Under -staffed 5. Less off -site program opportunities (tied to understaffing and diminished programs) 6. Lack of programs to address community needs (i.e., smoking, obesity, alcohol related problems) 7. Due to diminished staff size/ lack of redundancy/sometimes programs or services may be temporarily unavailable due to staff off 8. Salaries are too low/ Benefits continue to be reduced making it challenging to hire qualified staff / difficulty attracting medical providers and/or professional staff 9. Decreased time for training due to funding/time and limited staff (If we send staff to necessary training do we shut down services?) 10. Outdated resources/technology (need u pdated billing systems, electronic health record systems, EH online systems) 11. We do not promote the Health as well as we could (website, Facebook, media)/ Limited staff time to move forward with promotion) 12. Categorical funding inhibits \"system thinking\" 13. Reluctance to embrace change on part of some staff 14. Do not have a Health Educator to implement programs/provide education for community, etc 15.

What trends could we take advantage of? How can we turn ou r strengths into opportunities? Threats What obstacles do we face? Italicized bullet points indicate threats over which VCHD does not have control 0-1 Grant opportunities still exist/ especially with community collaborations and partnerships.
