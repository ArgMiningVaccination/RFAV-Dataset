Drawing on safe, effective techniques from around the world, our specialists focus not just on relieving symptoms but on maximizing whole person healing and empowering patients. We typically devote a full hour to the initial evaluation, to give our patients the chance to fully tell their story and begin establishing a relationship with their new care provider. This visit includes a thorough discussion of individual concerns, goals and values, so we can partner with patients in their wellness journey and tailor a personalized plan that supports the needs of body, mind and spirit.
