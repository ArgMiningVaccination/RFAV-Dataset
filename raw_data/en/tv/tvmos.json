The discipline hasevolved over millennia by drawing on the religious beliefs andsocial structures of numerous indigenous peoples, by exploit-ing natural products in their environments, and more recentlyby developing and validating therapeutic and preventiveapproaches using the scientific method. Public health andmedical practices have now advanced to a point at whichpeople can anticipate\u2014and even feel entitled to\u2014lives thatare longer and of better quality than ever before in humanhistory. Y et despite the pervasiveness, power, and promise of con- temporary medical science, large segments of humanity eithercannot access its benefits or choose not to do so. More than80 percent of people in developing nations can barely affordthe most basic medical procedures, drugs, and vaccines. In theindustrial nations, a surprisingly large proportion of peopleopt for practices and products for which proof as to their safetyand efficacy is modest at best, practices that in the aggregate areknown as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) or as traditional medicine (TM). Much of this book considers the formidable challenges to advancing human health through the further dispersion ofeffective and economical medical practices. This chapter con-siders both proven and unproven but popular CAM and TMapproaches and attempts to portray their current and potentialplace in the overall practice of medicine. With globalization, the pattern of disease in developing countries is changing. Unlike in the past, when communica-ble diseases dominated, now 50 percent of the health burdenin developing nations is due to noncommunicable diseases,such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension, depression, and use of tobacco and other addictive sub-stances. Because lifestyle, diet, obesity, lack of exercise, andstress are important contributing factors in the causation ofthese noncommunicable diseases, CAM and TM approachesto these factors in particular will be increasingly importantfor the development of future health care strategies for thedeveloping world. DEFINITIONS AND DOMAINS OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVEMEDICINE AND TRADITIONAL MEDICINE We refer to medical practices that evolved with indigenous peoples and that they have introduced to other countriesthrough emigration as traditional medicine. We refer toapproaches that emerged primarily in Western, industrialcountries during the past two centuries as scientific or Westernmedicine, although we acknowledge that not all Westernmedicine is based on scientifically proven knowledge. Theterms complementary and alternative describe practices and products that people choose as adjuncts to or as alternatives toWestern medical approaches. Increasingly, the terms CAM and TM are being used interchangeably (Kaptchuk and Eisenberg 2001; Straus 2004). Endless varieties of practices are scientifically unproven and poorly accepted by medical authorities. For the sake of organ-izing an agenda for research into these approaches, theU.S. National Institutes of Health has grouped them into fiveChapter 69 Complementary and Alternative Medicine Haile T. Debas, Ramanan Laxminarayan, and Stephen E. Straus somewhat overlapping domains (http://nccam.nih.gov/health/ whatiscam) as follows: Biologically based practices. These include use of a vast array of vitamins and mineral supplements, natural products suchas chondroitin sulfate, which is derived from bovine or sharkcartilage; herbals, such as ginkgo biloba and echinacea;and unconventional diets, such as the low-carbohydrateapproach to weight loss espoused by the late Robert Atkins. Manipulative and body-based approaches. These kinds of approaches, which include massage, have been usedthroughout history. In the 19th century, additional formalmanipulative disciplines emerged in the United States: chi-ropractic medicine and osteopathic medicine. Both origi-nated in an attempt to relieve structural forces on vertebraeand spinal nerve roots that practitioners perceived as evok-ing a panoply of illnesses beyond mere musculoskeletal pain. Mind-body medicine. Many ancient cultures assumed that the mind exerts powerful influences on bodily functions andvice versa. Attempts to reassert proper harmony betweenthese bodily systems led to the development of mind-bodymedicine, an array of approaches that incorporate spiritual,meditative, and relaxation techniques. Alternative medical systems. Whereas the ancient Greeks postulated that health requires a balance of vital humors,Asian cultures considered that health depends on the bal-ance and flow of vital energies through the body. This lattertheory underlies the practice of acupuncture, for example,which asserts that vital energy flow can be restored byplacing needles at critical body points. Energy medicine. This approach uses therapies that involve the use of energy \u2014either biofield- or bioelectromagnetic- based interventions. An example of the former is Reiki ther-apy, which aims to realign and strengthen healthful energiesthrough the intervention of energies radiating from the handsof a master healer. Alternative systems of medicine use elements from each of these CAM and TM domains. For example, traditional Chinesemedicine incorporates acupuncture, herbal medicines, specialdiets, and meditative exercises such as tai chi. Ayurveda in Indiasimilarly uses the meditative exercises of yoga, purifying diets,and natural products. In the West, homeopathic medicine andnaturopathic medicine each arose in the late 19th century asreactions to the largely ineffectual and toxic conventionalapproaches of the day: purging, bleeding, and treatments withheavy metals such as mercury and arsenicals. DEMOGRAPHY, USE, TOXICITY, AND EFFICACY The use of CAM and TM varies widely between and within coun-tries.The World Health Organization (WHO) has published andsummarized numerous surveys of use (table 69.1). In developing nations, TM is the sole source of health care for all but the privi-leged few. By contrast, in affluent countries individuals selectCAM approaches according to their specific beliefs.For example,as many as 60 percent of those living in France, Germany, and theUnited Kingdom consume homeopathic or herbal products.Only 1 to 2 percent of Americans use homeopathy,but 10 percentof adults use herbal medicines, 8 percent visit chiropractors, and1 to 2 percent undergo acupuncture every year (Ni, Simile, andHardy 2002). Use of CAM and TM among patients with chron-ic, painful, debilitating, or fatal conditions, such as HIV/AIDSand cancer, is far higher, ranging from 50 to 90 percent(Richardson and Straus 2002). There is remarkably little correlation between the use of CAM and TM approaches and scientific evidence that they aresafe or effective. For many CAM and TM practices, the onlyevidence of their safety and efficacy is embodied in folklore.Beginning more than 1,500 years ago, data on the use ofthousands of natural products were assembled into impressivemonographs in China, India, and Korea, but these compendi-ums\u2014and similar texts from Arabic, Egyptian, Greek, andPersian sources and their major European derivatives\u2014aremerely catalogs of products and their use rather than formalanalyses of safety and efficacy. 1282 | Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries | Haile T.

StrausTable 69.1 Estimated Use of CAM and TM by Patients and Practitioners Worldwide Region or country Extent of use Africa Used by 80 percent of the population for primary health care Australia Used by 49 percent of adultsChina Accounts for 30 to 50 percent of total health care Fully integrated into the health system95 percent of Chinese hospitals have TM units India Widely used 2,860 hospitals provide TM Indonesia Used by 40 percent of the entire population Used by 70 percent of the rural population Japan 72 percent of physicians practice TMThailand TM integrated into 1,120 health centers Vietnam Fully integrated into the health care system 30 percent of the population is treated with TM Western countries CAM and TM not strongly integrated into the health care system France: at least 75 percent of the population has used CAM at least once Germany: 77 percent of pain clinics provide acupunctureUnited States: 29 to 42 percent of population uses CAM Source: WHO 2002.Many people who today choose herbal products in lieu of prescription medications assume that because these productsare natural, they must be safe, even when the evidence for thisassertion is essentially anecdotal. Recent studies have shownthat herbals are highly variable in quality and composition,with many marketed products containing little of the intendedingredients and containing unintended contaminants, such asheavy metals and prescription drugs. A few herbals are bannedoutright in several countries. Comfrey and kava have beenassociated with liver failure, aristolochia with genitourinarycancer (De Smet 2002), and ephedra with heart attacks andstrokes (Shekelle and others 2003). More important, herbalscontain ingredients that can accelerate or inhibit the metabo-lism of prescription drugs (table 69.2). The most notorious ofthese is St. John's wort, which affects the metabolism of nearly50 percent of all prescription drugs (Markowitz and others2003). The cumulative data on the pharmacological and poten-tial adverse effects of herbal supplements now dictate thatpatients discuss their use of supplements with knowledgeablepractitioners before initiating treatment. As to evidence of the efficacy of CAM and TM approaches, thousands of small studies and case series have been reportedover the past 50 years. Few were rigorous enough to be at allcompelling, but they are sufficient to generate hypotheses thatare now being tested in robust clinical trials. The existing bodyof data already shows that some approaches are useless, that formany the evidence is positive but weak, and that a few arehighly encouraging (table 69.3). ECONOMICS OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE AND TRADITIONALMEDICINE Although social, medical, and cultural reasons may account for why people in a given country prefer CAM and TM to conven-tional (Western) medicine, economic forces are also at play.This section describes the socioeconomic determinants of seeking treatment from traditional healers and providers ofCAM; reviews the evidence on the cost-effectiveness of CAMand TM; and discusses cost-effective approaches to regulating,improving, and expanding the use of CAM and TM. Much ofthis evidence is from industrial countries; few studies have beenconducted in or are applicable to low- and middle-incomecountries. This caveat is important for two reasons. First, theCAM and TM modalities discussed in this section may not beused in many developing countries. Second, the limited data oncost-effectiveness may not be applicable in the case of thosecountries. Nevertheless, the data give a rough picture of the rel-ative cost-effectiveness of a number of CAM and TM practices. Economic Factors That Influence the Use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine and Traditional Medicine Users of CAM and TM approaches choose health practices that resonate with their beliefs about health (Astin 1998). Althougheconomic factors play a role in this choice, the underlyingincentives are not always predictable. For instance, a commonmisconception is that patients opt for CAM and TM servicesbecause they are cheaper alternatives to conventional medicalcare. Even though there are certainly instances when the cost oftreatment using CAM or TM is much cheaper than the cost ofaccessing a conventional medical service, several studies havefound that CAM and TM cost the same or more than conven-tional treatments for the same conditions (see, for example,Muela, Mushi, and Ribera 2000). At least one study has shown that financial considerations are rarely the primary factor in choosing a traditional healer,ranking behind such reasons as confidence in the treatment,ease of access, and convenience (Winston and Patel 1995). Inthe United States, the average cost of a single visit to a Navajohealer was US$388, and the average annual cost of using atraditional healer represented roughly a fifth of the reportedannual income of respondents in a survey (Kim and Kwok1998). The high cost of using a healer was cited as the mostcommon barrier to seeking care from this source. In Kenya, theaverage charge per patient per visit to a TM practitioner wasK Sh 46 (US$4 in 1981), which was significantly greater thanthe average charge per visit even in private health care facilities(Mwabu, Ainsworth and Nyamete 1993). Finally, a survey inZimbabwe reported that the median cost of consulting anherbalist was Z$23 per visit, compared with Z$1 for a govern-ment clinic and Z$29 for a private doctor (Winston and Patel1995). The same survey found that outcomes tended to be bet-ter when patients went to government clinics (67.3 percent ofvisits resulted in a good outcome) than when patients consultedherbalists (50 percent of visits resulted in a good outcome). TM is not always more expensive than conventional medi- cine, however. Survey respondents in Ghana reported that the Complementary and Alternative Medicine | 1283Table 69.2 Some Natural Products That May Alter Drug Actions Herbal product Class of drug Ephedra ( ma huang ) Alpha and beta control Valerian Sedatives Source: Niggemann and Gruber 2003.cost of malaria treatment at a health clinic ranged from \u00a21,900 to \u00a23,000 (US$1.30 to US$2.00 in 1997), treatment at homeusing drugs bought from pharmacies or health care workersranged between \u00a2200 and \u00a21,000 (US$0.10 to US$0.70), andtreatment by an herbalist was virtually free (Ahorlu and others1997). Another common misconception is that the poor are more likely to use TM. At least one study shows that this may not betrue. In Zimbabwe, the mean monthly income of householdsvisiting an herbalist, Z$877, was greater than the mean monthlyincome of households using government clinics, Z$718(Winston and Patel 1995). Although some traditional healers charge more than con- ventional practitioners, their fees may be negotiable, themethod of payment may be flexible (often on credit or inexchange for labor), and payment may be contingent on out- come. The availability of an outcome-contingent contractfavors TM over Western medicine when the disease conditionrequires providers to both exert effort in curing patients andinduce patients to comply with their recommendations.Nonetheless, this strategy may be difficult to apply to the largerhealth care system. Furthermore, patients tend to seek care from traditional healers for conditions such as mental illness, impotence, andchronic disorders, which they perceive as requiring greaterinvolvement by the extended family and kinship group.Accordingly, the availability of financial support for seekingtreatments for these disorders is greater than it is for illnessessuch as malaria or diarrhea, for which patients more often seekconventional treatment. 1284 | Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries | Haile T.

The data presentedhere on the use of traditional healers are extracted from theWorld Bank's living standards surveys in Vietnam to provideone nationally representative snapshot of the situation. Of28,254 individuals in the sample, 10,033 had consulted a healthcare provider in the four weeks preceding the survey. Theseconsultations included both home visits and visits to aprovider. Of the 10,033, 1,829 had been to a public provider,1,431 to a private provider, 7,650 to a pharmacy, and 259 to atraditional healer. 1The most common reasons for visiting a traditional provider were headache, followed by cough andfever. The per visit drug cost for consulting a traditional healerwas D 46, and the total cost per visit was D 51, compared withdrug costs of D 38 and total costs of D 41 for going to a privateclinic. One commonly cited motivation for using CAM and TM is that their use might lower the incidence and costs of side effectsassociated with conventional treatments, but the published evi-dence on this point remains mixed. There is some evidence thatCAM is used in addition to conventional treatments (Thomasand others 1991), but CAM may also have the effect of displac-ing conventional treatments. An outpatient survey found that,of 246 patients who had been receiving conventional treatmentfrom the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital since the onsetof care, a third had halted their conventional treatment andanother third had reduced their intake of conventional med-ication (van Haselen 2000). 2The extent to which homeopathic treatment displaced conventional treatment varied by indica-tion. The use of homeopathic treatment often replaced con-ventional treatments in patients with skin and respiratoryinfections; in patients with cancer, its use was purely comple-mentary and therefore added to overall health care costs. Thomas and others (1991) observe that patients who use CAM and TM also commonly access conventional medicalcare. In industrial countries, most CAM usage complementsconventional care, but this is also common in developingnations. For instance, Mwabu (1986) provides evidence fromKenya that patients are likely to use more than one type ofprovider from the range of those available, such as governmentfacilities, mission clinics, private clinics, pharmacies, and tradi-tional healers. Furthermore, the choice of provider depends onpatients' illness, condition, socioeconomic status, and educa-tion. If an initial visit to one kind of provider did not resolvethe disease satisfactorily, a follow-up visit was made to a differ-ent kind of provider. Finally, the quality of care\u2014includingefficiency of service and waiting time at government and pri-vate clinics\u2014is an important determinant of whether patientschoose to go to traditional healers. Most traditional healers sur-veyed in a second study referred patients to Western practicesfor treatment when necessary (Mwabu, Ainsworth, andNyamete 1993).Economic Evidence Although most studies tend to focus on a specific CAM or TM practice, Sommer, Burgi, and Theiss (1999) looked morebroadly at whether the provision of CAM and TM servicesthrough prepaid health plans or government insurancereduces the overall costs of health care and found that it doesnot. A possible reason is that few individuals who are offeredaccess to CAM use them, and those who do might access thoseservices in addition to, not in place of, more conventionalhealth services. Studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of different CAM and TM approaches using the same analytical frameworkare rare. One such study in Peru looked at the costs and cost-effectiveness of treatment using conventional medicine andTM (EsSalud andOPS 2000). Complementary medical prac-tices evaluated included acupuncture, homeopathy, tai chi,meditation, reflexology, hydrotherapy, naturopathy, and mas-sage. Patients were enrolled in either the Western medicinegroup or the CAM group. Patients were not randomizedbetween the two treatment groups, but they were matched bydisease pathology and severity, age, and sex. Furthermore,selected patients had completed at least one year in the healthsystem, as the investigators reasoned that this would enablethem to evaluate their follow-up. Overall, the investigatorsfound that complementary medicine was between 53 and63 percent less expensive than conventional medicine forachieving equivalent levels of effectiveness. Complementarymedicine was especially cost-effecti ve for osteoarthritis, hyper- tension, facial paralysis, and peptic ulcers. The rest of this section looks at the economic evidence on specific forms of CAM or TM. Acupuncture. Lindall's (1999) study finds that an acupunc- ture referral for musculoskeletal conditions costs a mean ofUS$422, roughly 60 percent less than the cost of referral to aWestern practitioner. However, this study was not randomized,and patients had to have failed first-line drug treatment beforebeing offered the choice of second line-treatment, either withacupuncture or with Western medicine. Homeopathy. Evidence indicates that the cost of homeopathic medication is lower than the average cost of allopathic prod-ucts, which would be an economic factor in favor of its use ifhomeopathy were proven to be effective. A study by theNational Health Service in the United Kingdom found that thedrug costs associated with homeopathy were lower than thoseof allopathic practitioners (Swayne 1992). A four-year study of100 patients that compared homeopathic drug costs with thoseof conventional drugs found an average cost saving of US$96during the study period for those using homeopathic drugs(Jain 2003). 3 Complementary and Alternative Medicine | 1285Ayurveda. A study that compared medical expenditures over a four-year period for participants in a comprehensive programof ayurvedic-based natural medicine (which included antioxi-dant strategies, mind-body medicine, and other techniques)with participants whose expenditures were covered through aBlueCross BlueShield health insurance plan found that theexpenditures for the ayurvedic group were 50 percent lower perperson (Orme-Johnson and Herron 1997). However, the studywas not randomized and failed to control for the inclination ofonly a subset of people to accept and remain compliant withayurvedic approaches. Chiropractic. Some studies found that spinal manipulation is less expensive than conventional treatments for episodes ofback pain. One nonrandomized study found that the cost ofchiropractic treatment over a five-year period, including bothprovider costs and equipment costs (US$28,902), was 24 per-cent less than the cost of Western pain therapy (US$38,029)(Kumar, Malik, and Demeria 2002). Moreover, 15 percent ofpatients in the chiropractic group were able to return to work,compared with none in the control group. However, other larger and better-controlled studies failed to find a difference between chiropractic and physical therapyin terms of either outcomes or costs (Cherkin and others1998; Skargren and others 1997; Skargren, Carlsson, andOberg 1998). A study of adults with low back pain who wererandomly assigned to physical therapy or chiropractic manip-ulation or were just given an educational booklet found nosignificant differences in either the mean costs of care or theoutcomes between the physical therapy and chiropracticgroups (Cherkin and others 1998). Three-quarters of the par-ticipants in these groups\u2014who incurred costs of roughlyUS$430 over the two-year period of the study\u2014reported thattheir outcome was either good or excellent, compared with athird of those who were assigned booklets; however, the meancost of care for the booklet group was only US$153 for thetwo-year period. Mind-Body Treatments. Little evidence is available on the cost-effectiveness of practices such as meditation and yoga, butthe cost of acquiring the skills required for these practices,as wellas the time costs of practicing them, are so low relative to con-ventional medicine that evidence of their clinical effectivenessmight suffice to justify their use on economic grounds. Availableevidence from clinical studies suggests that mind-body treat-ments can be cost-effective (Caudill and others 1995; Hellman and others 1990; Sobel 1995).Blumenthal and others (2002) find significant declines in coro-nary events and in predicted costs of care for patients who wereassigned to a one-and-a-half-hour long weekly class on stressmanagement, relative to usual care for each of the first two yearsof follow-up and after five years.Beyond Cost-Effectiveness: Ancillary Benefits and Costs of CAM and TM Although cost-effectiveness is one guiding rationale for deter- mining resource allocations for expanding (or restricting)access to CAM and TM, additional societal benefits and costs,such as effects on biodiversity, must also be considered. CAMand TM could provide a rationale for conserving species, butoverharvesting of endangered species for medicinal purposes isalso a concern. According to WHO, 85 percent of the world'spopulation (principally those in developing countries)depends on plants for medicine, and 25 percent of prescriptiondrugs have an active ingredient derived from a flowering plant(Cox 2001). The possible extinction of medicinal plants is ofconcern not only to developing countries but also to industrialcountries, as in the cases of poaching of American ginseng andoverharvesting of native saw palmetto. Similarly, the reliance ofChinese TM on tiger genitals, bear gallbladders, and black rhi-noceros horns has played an important role in poaching andthreatens to wipe out these mega fauna. Local knowledge and culture regarding the uses of medici- nal plants may be important determinants of whether a certainspecies will survive (Etkin 1998). In addition to the biodiversityvalue of these saved species, scientists may be able to analyzethese plants for potential clinical application on a broader scalethan TM permits. Although preserving traditional knowledgeof healing practices helps preserve the culture and identity ofindigenous populations, CAM and TM may impose significantcosts. In such instances, promoting conventional treatmentsthat do not depend on endangered species may bring impor-tant benefits to society. EXPANDING THE BENEFICIAL USE OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINEAND TRADITIONAL MEDICINE Despite the uncertainty about the clinical efficacy and cost- effectiveness of certain CAM and TM practices, expansion oftheir use in instances in which moderate evidence of their effi-cacy and good evidence of their safety exists could yield health,social, and economic benefits. A number of surveys show thatlocal pharmacies are the primary source of treatment for manyailments, especially in rural areas where government or privateclinics are less accessible. In these situations, improving thequality of TM might serve as an effective substitute for allow-ing the unregulated use of conventional medical treatments.Training traditional healers is substantially less expensive thantraining doctors or nurses. A study of 52 traditional healersinterviewed as part of a survey in Kenya estimated that theaverage out-of-pocket (cash) costs of training to be a tradi-tional healer were K Sh 418 (US$40 in 1981) (Mwabu,Ainsworth, and Nyamete 1993). 1286 | Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries | Haile T. Debas, Ramanan Laxminarayan, and Stephen E. StrausTraditional healers can also be recruited into a more broadly based system for delivering public health; for example, withadditional training, traditional healers can serve as primaryhealth care workers (Hoff 1997) and provide advice on suchmatters as sexually transmitted diseases and oral rehydrationtherapy (Nations and de Souza 1997; Nations and others 1988;Ndubani and Hojer 1999). In addition, permitting access toCAM and TM within the context of the conventional healthcare system would facilitate access to multiple health services atone location. Comprehensive policy on CAM and TM is lacking in most countries, including the United States. According to the 1994Dietary Supplement, Health, and Education Act, the U.S. Foodand Drug Administration cannot require proof that dietarysupplements and herbal products are safe and effective beforethey are sold, although it is charged with requiring good man-ufacturing practices. The quality of herbal products is not reg-ulated, and herbal products typically differ from source tosource and from batch to batch in terms of their componentingredients and respective amounts and in terms of whetherthey contain contaminants. In the United States, no singleentity is responsible for all aspects of CAM and TM control,education, information, and research, and no national, volun-tary system of self-regulation exists. National nongovernmen-tal organizations, such as the Accreditation Commission forAcupuncture and Oriental Medicine, the American Board ofMedical Acupuncture, the Council of Chiropractic Education,the Council of Homeopathic Education, and the Commissionon Massage Therapy Accreditation, accredit education insome CAM and TM fields, but such accreditation bodies donot exist in many developing countries. Nearly all countrieslack rigorous research training programs in CAM and TM. A common misperception is that in the developing world CAM and TM is used primarily by poorer, uneducated popu-lations, while in industrial countries it is used more by affluentand better-educated segments of the population (Eisenbergand others 1998). In both settings, relatively little evidencesupports this view. Many investig ators have failed to critically assess the use of CAM and TM by minority and immigrantpopulations in Western nations. In Africa, nearly 85 percent ofthe population uses TM, often as the only way to obtain pri-mary health care, and wealthier people in developing coun-tries often use TM (WHO 2002). Investments in improvingthe quality and consistency of TM could reduce the cost ofhealth care delivery, especially for chronic conditions sucharthritic pain and AIDS, where TM interventions mayimprove patients' sense of well-being, appetite, and energy. Atthe same time, in the absence of resources to extend the publichealth infrastructure, a network of certified CAM and TMproviders could provide the infrastructure for deliveringother care, such as immunizations and maternal-child healthprograms.Recognizing the redistributive nature of investment in TM is important. Indigenous people will seek the help of tradi-tional healers because of proximity, familiarity, and trust.Investments in TM could therefore be used strategically toincrease access to conventional preventive and therapeuticcare. Including the traditional healer as part of the health careteam may thus be an important strategy both to attractpatients and to upgrade the skills and training of traditionalhealers. How equity is affected by the proportions in which different condition-specific interventions are combined and how otherinterventions (regulations, tax policy, managerial changes) arelikely to affect equity need to be studied. Given that the major-ity of indigenous populations in developing countries use TMfor their primary health care, the availability, safety, and afford-ability of TM, including herbal medicines, should be ensured asa matter of equity. One way to do this is by supporting localproduction of safe and effective herbals such as artemisia ataffordable prices. In addition, rigorous research on TM shouldbe supported. WHO is currently conducting collaborative studies on herbal treatments for HIV/AIDS, malaria, sickle cellanemia, and diabetes. Ineffective or unsafe herbal productsidentified by such studies should be removed from use, whilethose with proven efficacy and safety should be made availablefor therapeutic use. LESSONS LEARNED AND IMPLEMENTATION The pervasiveness of different modalities of TM and CAMvaries greatly from country to country. For example, in China,where traditional Chinese medicine is well integrated into thehealth system, many different modalities may be used to treat agiven condition. In the United States, by contrast, CAM pro-grams are slowly being integrated with conventional medicine.Several medical schools have nascent CAM programs and haveintegrated them into medical school curricula to differingdegrees. One of the more acclaimed programs of this kindin the United States is that developed by Andrew Weil atthe University of Arizona Health Sciences Center. HisIntegrative Medicine Fellowship Program trains physicians inCAM and TM and strives to produce a new delivery modelwhereby physicians, patients, and nurses form a healing teamfor the care of the patient. However, this program needs to becritically evaluated before its adoption by more institutions canbe urged. Despite the complexity, diversity, and controversy surrounding CAM/TM approaches, some notable successstories reveal the influence of globalization, wherebymodalities discovered in the developing world have beenadopted in the West, with or without modifications, and viceversa. Complementary and Alternative Medicine | 1287Artemisinin Artemisinin is a recently developed, active metabolite of artemisia, an herbal extract that has been used in China forcenturies to treat fever. Chinese scientists determined the activeingredient of the herbal in the 1970s, and Western pharmaceu-tical companies have developed several derivatives as drugs foruse against resistant Plasmodium malaria (Li and others 2000). Randomized clinical trials have shown that one such drug,dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, is effective against drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria (Hien and Dolecek 2004). Another artemisinin derivative, artesunate, was shownto increase parasite clearance and reduce the gametocyte countwhen added to existing drugs to combat malaria (Adjuik andothers 2004). Acupuncture Another CAM and TM modality that has considerable accept- ance is acupuncture. Many pain management clinics, hospitals,and academic centers in the West now provide acupunctureservices, and some insurance companies reimburse foracupuncture services. Rigorous clinical trials have demonstra-tive positive efficacy in two areas: (a) management of postop-erative nausea and emesis (Shen and others 2000) and (b) ame-lioration of the pain of chronic osteoarthritis (Ezzo and others2001; Soeken 2004; Tukmachi and others 2004). Studies pro-viding rational explanations of the mechanisms wherebyacupuncture might be achieving its effects complement the evi-dence about its efficacy; for example, one mechanism of actionappears to involve opioid-dependent brain pathways. This kindof two-step process\u2014that is, initial demonstration of clinicalefficacy followed by scientific research into the mechanism ofaction\u2014is one way that CAM and TM will gain scientificacceptance and integration into conventional medicine. Chiropractic Medicine and Osteopathy Chiropractic medicine was invented in the American heartland during the waning years of the 19th century. It uses spinalmanipulation to treat an array of conditions thought to arisebecause of abnormal alignment of or stresses on vertebrae,most often in patients with musculoskeletal complaints. Twoaspects of chiropractic medicine are success stories. First, eventhough practitioners of conventional medicine ostracized prac-titioners of chiropractic medicine in the late 19th century andthe first half of the 20th century, it has gradually evolved into aviable healing discipline that is increasingly accepted by theconventional medicine community. The evolution of chiro-practic can be compared with that of osteopathy. Osteopathywas developed in the United States in parallel with chiroprac-tic, but the field elected to accommodate rather than reject allo-pathic techniques.The second success story is research showing that chiro- practic manipulation for low back pain is superior to bed rest,physical therapy, or provision of an educational booklet(Cherkin and others 1998). Chiropractic manipulation has alsoshown results comparable to those achieved with nonsteroidal,anti-inflammatory drugs in alleviating back pain (Straus 2004). Homeopathy Homeopathy is a success in terms of its broad appeal and use, not because of the strength of evidence supporting it. Indeed,few conventional scientists and physicians find homeopathy tobe plausible. According to the \"principle of similars\" underly-ing homeopathy, practitioners choose remedies that, whengiven in high concentrations, produce symptoms similar tothose that the patient presents with. The substance is then putin solution and serially diluted by as much as 10 60,w e l l b e y o n d the point defined by Avogadro's number (at which a singlemolecule of the original substance could remain in the solu-tion). Homeopathy claims that the acts of serial diluting andvigorous shaking imprint information into water so thatmedicinal properties are retained even when no or few mole-cules of the starting medicine are present. As implausible as this claim may seem, homeopathy is used worldwide with reported success (Jonas, Kaptchuk, and Linda2003). Randomized controlled trials have suggested that itmight be effective for treating influenza (Vickers and Smith2000), allergies (Taylor and others 2000), and postoperativeileus (Barnes, Resch, and Ernst 1997). However, critics havequestioned the quality and analyses of these trials. Some havequestioned the validity of pooling data from trials of differentpopulations, interventions, and outcome measures, as severalreviews of homeopathy have done. Jonas, Kaptchuk, and Linda(2003, 393) assert that \"there is a lack of conclusive evidenceon the effectiveness of homeopathy for most conditions.Homeopathy deserves an open-minded opportunity todemonstrate its value by using evidence-based principles, but itshould not be substituted for proven therapies.\" Mind-Body Intervention The work of David Spiegel at Stanford University on group support for breast cancer patients excited wide interest in thepotential value of mind-body interventions (Spiegel and others1989). The study was a randomized controlled trial with a 10-year follow-up involving 86 women with metastasizedbreast cancer. A one-year psychosocial intervention consistingof weekly supportive group therapy with self-hypnosis for painshowed that the mean survival time in the treated group was37 months, compared with 19 months for the control group.Moreover, Spiegel (1994) notes that appropriate psychotherapy(both group and individual) not only reduced depression and 1288 | Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries | Haile T. Debas, Ramanan Laxminarayan, and Stephen E. Strausanxiety and improved coping skills, but also saved money by reducing the number of office visits, diagnostic tests, medicalprocedures, and hospital admittances. Although Spiegel's find-ings have not been replicated, they do illustrate the potentialbenefits of mind-body intervention and have led to studies ofpossible mechanisms through which such interventions mayoperate. THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGENDA The lack of product quality and consistency and the absence ofcompelling data on the safety and efficacy of most CAM andTM approaches present major challenges to any effort to opti-mize the distribution of precious health resources. These diffi-culties also pose opportunities for research. Other formidablechallenges include the variability in training, credentialing, andlicensing CAM and TM practitioners. Increasingly, efforts arebeing made in several countries to regulate both products andpractitioners. Ultimately, stringent controls on training, prac-tices, and products must be complemented by rigorousresearch to ascertain which approaches are safe and effective\u2014and for which indications. The global use and potential effect of CAM and TM practices, the lack of adequate data validating their safety andefficacy, and the existence of highly effective conventional alter-natives for many of them dictate that resources should bedevoted to fuller characterization and standardization of CAMand TM approaches. Investing precious resources in integrat-ing such approaches further into health care infrastructurescan be justified only on the basis of compelling data. This pointleads to the question of what constitutes a rational agenda forthis work. For resource-rich industrial nations, one model for CAM and TM research is that being implemented by the NationalCenter for Complementary and Alternative Medicine(NCCAM) of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (http://nccam.nih.gov). In 2004, NCCAM planned to invest US$117million in research and research training. It is supporting some800 individual projects at present, including studies of thecomposition of natural products and their pharmacologicaleffects, studies of the neurobiological mechanisms of acupunc-ture and the placebo effect, and clinical trials with 30 to 30,000participants. NCCAM now has a strategic plan for its interna-tional programs that emphasizes research, training, and effortsto learn about the rich, indigenous TM heritage. Australia,through a government agency similar to NCCAM, is conduct-ing research and training programs in collaboration with itsindigenous people. Although the scope of NCCAM's researchagenda is larger than what most other nations could accom-modate, its underlying philosophy should be universal. That is,the standards for research into CAM and TM approachesshould be no different from those used in conventional bio- medical research. Both CAM and TM and biomedical practitioners need to understand the strengths, limitations, and contributions oftheir particular approaches so that they can work together inways that ensure the best possible care for their patients and theachievement of their shared goals of improved individual andpublic health. Once these issues have been addressed, countriescould devote additional resources to studying those CAM andTM approaches that appear to be the most promising in rela-tion to their most pressing public health problems. Some pri-ority areas for CAM and TM research are widely applicable,including studies of approaches to palliate chronic pain andsuffering, relieve depression, help release the grip of addictivesubstances, and slow the progression of degenerative disorderssuch as arthritis and dementia.
