Deeply meditative, this experience brings the body's seven main Chakras into alignment through a fluid combination of massage, specific essential oil blends and healing crystals. This unique experience leaves guests feeling calm and in a state of harmony, resulting in an increased feeling of wellbeing. Chakra Balancing is a form of energy healing that focuses on channelling energy into the seven chakras. When we talk about treating chakras we are referring to treating your energetic body. The body is not only made up of the physical body, we have an energy that extends beyond our physical wellbeing. There are 7 main energy centres or chakras that run along the spine: 1. Root Chakra - Sits at the base of your spine or tailbone. Physical imbalances manifest themselves as problems in the legs, rectum, tailbone, immune system, male reproductive parts and prostate gland. Emotional imbalances manifest themselves as feelings affecting the basic survival needs; money, shelter, food and the ability to provide life's necessities. 2. Sacral Chakra- Two inches below your navel Physical imbalances manifest themselves as sexual and reproductive issues, urinary problems, kidney infections, hip pelvic and lower back pain. Emotional imbalances manifest themselves as fear of commitment to relationships, expressing emotions, fears of impotence, betrayal and addictions. 3. Solar Plexus Chakra - three inches above your navel Physical imbalances manifest themselves as digestive problems, liver dysfunction, chronic fatigue, high blood pressure, diabetes, stomach ulcers and colon issues. Emotional imbalances manifest themselves as issues of personal power and self-esteem. 4. Heart Chakra - at the heart Physical imbalances manifest themselves as asthma, heart disease, lung disease, issues with breasts, lymphatic systems and upper back and shoulder problems. Emotional imbalances manifest themselves as jealousy, abandonment, anger, bitterness and fear of loneliness. 5. Throat Chakra - at the throat Physical imbalances manifest themselves as thyroid issues, sore throats, laryngitis, ear infections, neck and shoulder pain. Emotional imbalances manifest themselves as fear of communication, will-power and being out of control. 6. Third Eye Chakra - in the middle of the eyebrows Physical imbalances manifest themselves as headaches, blurred vision, sinus issues, seizures, hearing loss and hormonal imbalance. Emotional imbalances manifest themselves as moodiness, volatility and self-reflection. 7. Crown Chakra - top of the head Physical imbalances manifest themselves as depression, inability to learn, sensitivity to light, sound and the environment. Emotional imbalances manifest themselves as confusion, prejudice and self-doubt. These chakras bring in and emit energy which flows in our day to day lives. Each chakra relates to a different part of our life and being. In time of struggle or change the energy can stop flowing freely and cause the Charka(s) to become blocked or imbalanced. These blockages can manifest in many ways. For example, the throat chakra is strongly linked to communication, if you are in a relationship where you are not able to say how you truly feel you may lose your voice physically. The treatment aims to identify any possible blockages in the guest using crystals, essential oil blends, massage and energetic techniques. The aim is to release any chakra blockages and promote a free flow of energy to restore balance and a sense of wellbeing. By balancing your Chakras you may be able to: 1. Remain calm within your everyday life 2. See challenges for what they are, and not be as affected by them. 3. Overcome past life experiences which could have left their mark on you. 4. Help others without their problems affecting you. 5. Develop confidence, energy, freedom and happiness to feel good about yourself and life every day At the start of the treatment your therapist will do a thorough consultation with you and during this time will use senses such as smell and touch to help identify any possible imbalances. The therapist will then use specialised massage techniques to relax and open up the energy flow through the lower chakras. Using a combination of massage, energetic work, aromatic inhalations and crystals the therapist will treat the chakras on the back of the body. The therapist will then move to the front of the body, focusing on the chest, beck, shoulders, face and head to relax further and open up the energy flow through the upper chakras. The guest will experience a guided visualisation to treat the chakras on the front of the body. To conclude the therapist will focus on the feet and perform a grounding and cleansing technique. The essentials oils and crystals in the treatment have been used for thousands of years in alternative medicine to treat physical and emotional conditions. These emit vibrations that draw you to them. The experience during a chakra treatment will vary with some experiencing an emotional release during or after the treatment. The aim is to leave you feeling completely relaxed and refreshed with a great sense of calm and over-all well-being. This is a perfect treatment for someone going through anything significant in their life or for anyone wanting to maintain balance, wellbeing and energetic health. "}
