This waiver will end on May 11 , 2023. This waiver was intended to provide flexibility in staffing during the pandemic. The following rules were suspended: 26 TAC \u00a7554.1001(a)(4)(A)(ii) 26 TAC \u00a7554.1001(a)(4)(B), (C), (E), (F), and (H) Under the CMS waiver and the suspension of nurse aide rules, Texas nursing facilities have employed and trained numerous staff who are not CNAs to complete nurse aide tasks.

Additionally, 26 TAC \u00a7554.1001(a)(4)(D) was partially suspended, only to the extent necessary to allow the employment as a nurse aide of an individual who is not listed in the n urse aide registry due solely to the individual's having no history of employment as a nurse aide. To ensure continued staffing at nursing facilities, HHSC developed a plan to allow staff who, during the declared public health emergency, completed work training and gained experience in all subje ct areas required for a NATCEP to count this training and experience toward nurse aide certification. Each nurse aide candidate is still required to successfully complete both the written/oral and skills examinations prior to being certified and placed on the nurse aide registry.
