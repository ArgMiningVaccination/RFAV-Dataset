From inauspicious beginnings, our organization has grown and flourished only because of a long succession of challenges overcome and providential leading. After more than a century, our vision is clearer and more focused than ever. Health care in the United States is just starting to move from a dis ease focus to a wellness focus. As the organization seeks to fulfill its mission of \"continuing the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus Christ,\" more miracles will be needed, and we believe they will take place. In conjunction with Vision 2020, we continue to implement innovative strategies to meet the needs of our community. Even with immense change, the goal of LLUH remains the same - to be an example for the way patients are cared for and students are taught, in an effort to help people live longer, healthier lives. At LLUH, our commitment to wholeness goes beyond o ur jobs; it shows how we \"Live I t\". Loma Linda University Health believes in addressing community needs from a population health standpoint to transform the health of our co mmunity. These community benefit and community health investments need to be combined with a focus on improving health outcomes, shared responsibility from community partners, careful financial stewardship and measurable objectives to ensure continued impr ovement in our community's health. We continue to make concerted efforts to shift our investments to more community -based preventive interventions, rather than relying mostly on charity care in our emergency departments or hospitalizations for the increasi ng advanced and unmanaged chronic health conditions. Together we will prioritize our health concerns, providing wellness and opportunity for all in our region. Richard Hart, MD, DrPH Kerry Heinrich, JD President Chief Executive Officer Loma Linda University Health Loma Linda University Medical Center W E L I V E T O S E R V E About the Community We S erve Loma Linda University Health's primary service area can be defined, broadly, as California's Riverside, San Bernardino and Ontario metropolitan areas. San Bernardino and Riverside counties make the geographic area known as the Inland Empire due to the region's rich diversity of native peoples and agricultural history. S ituated about 60 miles inland from the Los Angeles metropol itan area and the Pacific Ocean, the Inland Empire is home to over 4.5 million people and is the 3 rd most populous metropoli tan area in the State of California and the 13 th most populous metropolitan area in the United States. San Bernardino and Ri verside County Health Rankings Published online at countyhealthrankings.org , the rankings help counties understand what influences the health of residents and average lifespans by geographic region . The rankings are unique in their ability to measure the current overall health of nearly every county in all 50 states. They also lo ok at a variety of measures that affect the future health of communities, such as high school graduation rates, access to healthy foods, rates of smoking, obesity and teen births. Communities use the rankings to help identify issues and opportunities for l ocal health improvement, as well as to garner support for initiatives among government agencies, health care providers, community organizations, business leaders, policy makers and the public. Although there are a range of factors which are important for good health, every county has communities that lack both opportunities to shape good health and strong policies to promote health for everyone. As noted in the California County health ranking data, the Inland Empire communities will need to collaborate a nd strategize their efforts to improve the health factors and health outcomes of the community. LLUH's goal is to bring people together to look at the many factors that influence health and opportunities to reduce health gaps. For programs and intervention s to have a lasting impact, they must focus on strategies that improve health from a population standpoint . For LLUH, we are strategically positioned in two counties that together, face significant economic challenges. San Bernardino ranks 44th out of 58 c ounties in California in terms of health factors while Riverside ranks 39th. In November of 2015, the Los Angeles Times reported through a documentary on the impact of the 2008 recession to our region called \"San Bernardino: Broken City.\" San Bernardino is still recovering from the recession as recently, the California Budget & Policy Center identified the poverty rate in San Bernardino was higher at 19% in 2015 than it was in 2007 at 11%. Despite the challenge, LLUH believes that our community is resilien t and with our community partners, we are addressing poverty through workforce development and education . 2015 2016 2017 2018 2015 2016 2017 2018 Health Outcomes 37 42 46 41 24 29 28 25 Length of Life 30 32 32 33 23 24 23 22 Quality of Life 50 49 52 51 38 42 41 33 Health Factors 47 47 45 44 39 39 40 39 Health Behaviors 44 41 39 37 32 33 34 31 Clinical Care 52 52 50 50 48 47 47 44 Social and Economic Factors 36 41 34 34 29 32 28 26 Physical Environment 53 57 55 55 49 56 56 56County Health Ranking (Total 58 Counties in California) San Bernardino County Riverside County Population growth: 57,017 \"With the third -highest house prices among the top 10 fastest -growing metro areas, but the fourth -lowest household income, many residents of the Inland Empire have to stretch to afford a home.\" - The Washington Post, Oct. 3, 2018 About Our Service Area Loma Linda University Health System is a 1,045 hospital beds system. As an academic medical provider, LLUH offers primary and specialty care services and programs that are the safety -net for the people in our region. Without LLUH in the community, patients would need to travel great distances for access to the most advance continuum of health care services and a major gap in community -based interventions, programs, and unique community outreach activities would be created. LLUH invests in community services outside the traditional walls of our health care facilities. I t is these programs and outreach activities that extend ac cess to the more vulnerable or disenfranchised members and how LLUH is able to address the root causes of illness . Consistent with our Christian mission of extending the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus Christ, the LLUH health care system is honored to be an important part of the lives of people in our community whether it is through community programs, our educational system, or our health care system. The four non -profit hospitals in the LLUH System are: 1. Loma Linda University Medic al Center (LLUMC) which includes two additional campuses: Loma Linda University Medical Center East Campus (LLUMCEC), Loma Linda University Surgical Hospital (LLUSH) , 2. Loma Linda University Children's Hospital (LLUCH), 3. Linda University Behavioral Medic ine Center (LLUBMC), 4. Loma Linda University Medical Center - Murrieta (LLUMC - M). While our hospitals are the flagships of our comprehensive health system, LLUH is advancing our health care delivery system as we extend access to care in the outpatient a nd community settings. Our system includes a robust offering of outpatient services in primary and specialty care clinics. Additionally, for many of the hospital -based services, LLUH is the only provider of these services. This include s services like the outpatient specialty children's clinics where many of our neonatal and Children's Hospital patients receive extensive follow -up to manage their complex conditions ; the outpatient rehabilitative services for children and adults that provides therapy services for many of those in our region with disabilities or developmental challenges as we maintain an institutional commitment to growing their ability to thrive; and our inpatient and outpatient behavioral medicine clinics and programs that provide behavioral health service s in high -demand as California is under -resourced for behavioral health care. The LLUH system serves a large number of people who qualify for means -tested programs like Medi -Cal and it is core to our Christ -center mission to serve those li ving near or at the poverty level as we increase access to the full continuum of care for the most vulnerable children, families, adults, and seniors in our region. People from vulnerable communities or those living in difficult socioeconomic conditions account for almost 1 in every 3 pati ents seen at LLUH, based on patient Medi -Cal status . As a leader in patient care we are not only investing in a comprehensive network of care, we are dedicated to offering state -of-the-art care for the most vulnerable .

Our Community Benefit Program LLUH is unique amo ng many health systems as the hospitals have made a consistent and historic investment in the operations necessary to effectively coordinate and partner with our community . The Institute for Community Partnerships (ICP) and the office of Community Health Development are the strategic arm of the four hospitals community benefit programming. The Institute implements research and programs operated by LLUH and oversees the office of Community Health Development to ensure the strategic inv estment with partner organizations, and the coordination and reporting of community benefit outcomes on behalf of LLUH. This unique model allows LLUH to focus our impact on the community towards the social determinants ( workforce development a nd education ) and in the health priorities of obesity, diabetes, and mental health. The Institute for Community Partnerships serves as the primary portal for connecting hospital resources to the needs and people as the LLUH liaison to our community. The mission of ICP is to assist LLUH and ensure LLUH remains responsive and relevant to the community. ICP has created a community partnership database and interactive map to make it easier for community members, faculty, and students to get involved in alrea dy existing community projects. These tools will foster interdisciplinary collaboration and create awareness of who is doing community engagement throughout the institution. The institute is committed to strategically working with our community partners to better understand and address the needs of the community through activities such as research, teaching and service -based learning. Community participation is at the core of our efforts, with structured learning opportunities for underrepresented minority students, training programs for community health workers and community research projects. ICP implements the LLUH -operated community benefit programs and assessment and provides the research necessary to better target health system interventions to the underrepresented people and in under -estimated communities to promote resiliency and hope. Prioritizing access to education for our region's youth ICP has two primary areas of strategic focus for hospital investment in the community: pipeline to educatio n programs and workforce development of community health workers. African Americans, Latinos, and American Indians are about one quarter of the population of the US but represent less than 10% of the workforce in the health professions of medicine, nursin g, dentistry, and pharmacy. Studies show that although minorities are less likely to attend four -year colleges, they are as likely as non - minority students to major in the biological sciences. A critical time for intervention is during primary and seconda ry education , especially during high school. ICP's programs ensure that LLUH extends access to children and youth from traditionally under - represented populations to h elp encourage and prepare minorities to graduate from high school and attend college. Ear ly exposure to the health professions and investment in our region's youth means that they will be more likely to go on to pursue a career in the health sciences and may even be more likely to return to their own communities to serve. Prioritizing access to education and the workforce for people in our community As a provider of higher education in the health professions, ICP is also focused on the creation of the workforce that will capture students coming from our pipeline programs through trianing programs that extend access . For youth living in poverty, commuinty college is often too big a jump for many of our region's students as they feel the pressure to earn an income . Additionally, many adults in our region are in need of work force training are seraching for affordable access to the health professions. In collaboration with San Manuel Gateway College, ICP focuses the hosptial's community investment in community health worker education , workforce integration into complex health care asystem, and through scholarship support , detailed in the program highlights.

The office reviews a range of investments in community partners to build the capacity of those organizations to meet the regional and LLUH priorities for our community. CHD also manages the implementation of the community health needs a ssessment and community health implementation strategy to ensure that the hospital's community benefit investments foc used, impactful, and strategic. In 2016, ICP and CHD initiated a unique funding opportunity through \" Grants and Community Investments \" for non-profit community based organizations (CBOs) that would provide them with monetary support and expert consultation for program design and evaluation. The purpose of the annual funding opportunity is to sponsor and oversee programs or activities through direct community engagement that promote health and healing in response to identified community needs. Licensed public or private nonprofit community based organization in San Bernardino or Riverside counties were eligible to apply and funded organization s are featured in the community benefit highlights section. Objectives of CHD: Provide a technical assistance for funded partners to sustain innovative pilot programs and/or help sustain ongoing programs Empower and support local non -profit community programs within our community aligned with LLUH community benefit focus areas : Workforce Development, Education, Obesity, Diabetes, and Mental Health. Strategically invest the hospitals' community benefit dollars in partners that sustain interventions and resources on behalf of the most vulnerable, socio -economically disadvantaged, or under -served members of our community. Community partners like Huerta del Valle in Ontario provide access to healthy , affordable food options to populations living in a food desert and are on the frontlines in the fight against obesity . 64 % of RI County and 71 % of SB County students are e ligible to receive free o r reduce d price school meals - County Health Ranking, 2018 Overview of Community Benefit PATIENT CARE SERVICES LLUH is committed to providing patients with the very finest possible medical car e. Our community benefit patient care services program offers free or low -cost coverage for children and adults with limited resources. LLUH reports only net benefit, or t he amount unreimbursed ca re provided after all revenue has been accounted for , and reports uncompensated dollars as community benefit patient care services. 1. Medi -Cal and other Means tested Government Sponsored Programs : a. Medi -Cal Medi -Cal offers low -cost or free health coverage to eligible Californian residents with limited income. Medi -Cal covers low -income adults, families with children, seniors, persons with disabilities, pregnant women, children in foster care and former foster youth up to age 26. Covered California is the s tate's health insurance marketplace where Californians can shop for health plans and access financial assistance if they qualify and LLUH serves patients enrolled in Covered California plans. b. State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCH IP) The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is a partnership between the federal and state governments that provides health coverage to uninsured children whose families earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, but too little to afford private health coverage . Benefits vary by state and by the type of CHIP program, but all states provide comprehensive coverage , like immunizations and well -baby/well -child care , at no cost. The federal government establishes general guidelines for the administration of CHIP benefits. Eligibility depends on your income, the number of people in your family and state rules . In almost every state, children in families with income up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level are covered ($48,500 per year for a family of four) . In m ore than half the states, the income eligibility for children can be even higher. c. California Children's Services California Children's Services (CCS) is a state program for children with certain diseases or health problems. Through this program, children up to 21 years old can get the health care and servi ces they need. CCS connects families to doctors and trained health care providers and professionals 1 in every 3 LLUH patients are Medi - Cal patients. who know how to care for child ren with special health care needs. Examples of CCS - eligible cond itions include, but are not limited to, chronic medical conditions such as cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, cerebral palsy, heart disease, cancer, traumatic injuries, and infectious d iseases . CCS also provides medical therapy services that are delivered at public schools. 2. Financial Assistance Program/Charity Care Charity Care is defined as any medically necessary inpatient or outpatient hospital service provided to a patient who has an income below 200% of the current federal poverty level and who has establis hed qualification in accordance with requirements outlined in the LLUH Charity Care and patient financial assistance policies . 3. Subsidized Health Services Discount Payment through the Subsidized Health Services is defined as partial charity care which results from any medically necessary inpatient or outpatient hospital service provided to a patient who is uninsured or whose insurance coverage does not otherwise provide a discount from the usual and customary rates of LLUMC . The requirements for subsidized care are that a patient 1) desires assistance with paying their hospital bill; 2) has an income at or below 350% of the federal poverty level; and 3) has established qualification in accordance with requirements cont ained in the LLUMC Charity Car e Discount Payment Policy. HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION At Loma Linda University Health, our experienced health care workforce is committ ed to helping health professionals in training succeed in their graduate medical education. Students from various medical professions such as medicine interns and residents, and pharmacy, chaplain cy and the a llied health professionals are offer ed diverse clinical experiences and are mentored through a collaborative , team -based learning environment to complement their education as they discover w ays to improve patient care. The residency programs give students the unique opportunity to learn at the only Level 1 Trauma Center in San Bernardino County and the Inland Empire. LLUCH the only Level 3 N eonatal Intensive Care Unit (N ICU) in the region and is the only area facility equipped to provide pediatric transplants in Southern California. Residents an d students receive comprehensive education and an opportunity to participate in clinical trials and train on multidisciplinary teams in the medical simulation laboratory . Our Medical Simulation Center (MSC) is one example of how we combine technology and p ractical clinical simulations to create a compressive learning experience to enhance patient safety, quality of patient care, and inter -professional health care provider education . The MSC provides: An adequately staffed, professional, and cohesive team A leadership role in providing best practices in simulation methodology Proactive standardized processes in providing quality simulation learning experiences RESEARCH The world -renowned scientists at Loma Linda University are striving to advance the unde rstanding and care of human health in order to fulfill the institution's mission \"to make man whole.\" The office for Research Affairs facilitates and promotes high quality research conducted at Loma Linda University, Loma Linda University Medical Center an d all affiliated entities.

Community Health Research With the mission to serve and enhance the health of our communities, o ur research activities are strategically designed to focus on reduc ing health disparities , improv ing health , and promoting wholeness in the region . We achieve this by fostering academic and community -based partnerships that help and support our research endeavors. Our institution works closely with community members and partner organizations in these research efforts . One such example is the \" Community -Engaged Research at San Ber nardino School District.\" Loma Linda University Health holds a memorandum of understanding with San Bernardino City Unified School District (SBCU SD) to aid with its strategic plan of Health, Wellness & Safety. This plan aims to build an environment and foster a culture which sustains good health, lifelong wellness, and safety for all members of the SBCUSD community. The San Bernardino City Unified School District is the 8th largest school district in California serving over 54,000 students. Total of over 120 Research Programs at LLUH Community Health Services Investing in primary care providers that serve the most vulnerable populations : LLUH has made a significant community benefit health services investments in a partner organization that provides access to health services for the most underserved residents near downtown San Bernardino. The SAC Health System (SACHS) is a non -profit commu nity health care corporation serving the Inland Empire. The clinics provide affordable health care services for all, and primarily serve uninsured patients and their families. They accept Medi -Cal and Medicare, and offer many federal, state and local programs to those who qualify. For those who are ineligible for programs, they offer a sliding fee scale based upon income. LLUH also supports SAC Health System's Electronic Health Records integration as part of our community benefit due to the populations served by the clinics . History of SACHS Social Action Corps (SAC) began in the late 1960s as an outreach effort from students and staff at Loma Linda University and Medical Center. Over the course of 30 years these volunteers offered temporary medical clinics in donated spaces within the communi ty. In the early 1990's, SAC began to look for a permanent location and by 1992 Norton Air Force Base was closing and provided an opportunity for SAC to acquire a medical facility. SAC incorporated into a 501(c ) (3) community health care corporation and evolved into an independent community health system operating community clinics. SACHS has recently received the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education Program designation for Family Medicine, Pediatrics and Psychiatry resulting in one of the n ation's largest programs. In 2015, SACHS acquired the Federal Qualified Health Center Status. Binational Health Fair at SACHS: a partnership between SACHS, the Mexican Consulate, and LLUH CHWs at LLUH spend hours with patients who face multiple social determinant burdens as our team motto is: \"Time is the Medicine\" Cash Sponsorships and In -Kind Donation LLUH is committed to supportin g community -based o rganizations with our cash and in-kind donation program to empower and build capacity at these organizations. Our contributions to annual resource fairs, health initiatives, health fairs and community programs are strategically designed to help and serve the in -need members of our community. In-kind services include hours contributed by staff to the community while on health care organization work time, the cost of meeting space provide d to community groups and the donations of food, equipment, supplies , and operational support for non -profits . Community -Building Activities and Programs The i ntegration of the Community Health Workers in health, public health , and community support settings is an innovative approach to broaden the scope of services and to provide the linkages that strengthen community -based disease prevention through addressing the social determinants of health . The community - settings in which services are delivered, and the workforce resources to deliver such services, offer considerable potential to improve and address the social determinants of health, im prove long -term health outcomes , and lower health care costs. The California Health Workforce Alliance's (CHWA's) defines a Promotor , or Community Health Worker (CHW), as a pe rson who is a trusted member of or is someone who has an unusually close understa nding of the community served . CHWs play a crucial role in connecting the community to various health and social services while assisting health care organizations achiev e the Institute for Health care Impro vement's Triple Aim objectives of: population hea lth, improved quality of c are, and a more affordable system of care through cost reductions. Community Health Workers have demonstrated the ability to play a crucial role as a member of the primary care team, and can help to connect the community to clinic al services, help patients navigate the health care system and implement population health impro vement strategies. In the Spring of 2018, LLUH began a pilot program with three community health workers placed in departments that have a high percentage of patients who face undue social determinant burdens (Diabetes Treatment Center, Neo -natal Intensive Care Unit, and Transitions of Care Management Department ). The CHWs are introduced to patients receiving care at LLUH who meet the criteria for vulnerability or risk and follow patients after they leave LLUH care to their homes in order to provide intensive support to addres s social determinant burdens . This is a non -reimbursable service and the CHW commitment to patients is driven by the patient's needs: no matter how many hours or visits a patient may require to overcome transportation barriers, housing insecurity, food Ms. Alejandra Morales Martinez, CHW, works with patients with diabetes to address the social determinants of health. insecurity, enrollment and maintenance of county or social benefits or health insurance, and health system navigation. CHW interventions are provided no matter where the patient receives health care in our region . LLUH is modeling and implementation for integrating CHWs into the health system while keeping their focus on community members who are the most vulnerable in a patient -centered model . Results fro m the pilot study will be published and shared with other hospital partners locally and nationally to advocate for CHW workforce development. Community Health Workers like Silvia Ortega are helping LLUH expand care beyond the hospital through home visits in order to provide supportive services to patients that increase their access to resources and provide community members with support for the social determinants of health that impact their well -being. Community -Based Research Highlight In 2017, ICP partnered with the Desert Health Care District in the Coachella Valley to conduct a community health needs assessment in an unincorporated n eighborhood known as the Dream Homes neighborhood. The partnership was a unique opportunity to work with the district and employ community health workers to build trust in the community in order to not only assess the needs of the community, but allow the community to lead the discussion and actions taken to improve the health of their neighborhood . CHWs have been working in the neighborhood and acting as a trusted liaison with city officials and residents . As the project results will be available in the FY 2019 report and part of the next community health needs assessment, the implementation of this unique research project illustrates the power of combining our community benefit dollars and workforce development for CHWs with the power of the research so st udents at LLUH learn to work in community -based settings.

LLUMC provides scholarships to youth who meet criteria as representing the prioity poo plations as part of our community benefit priorit y to extend access to education. The techincal certification programs are truly a gateway for under -served youth and adults in our community through these training programs: Certified Nursing Assistant Dialysis tech Medical Assistant Pharmacy tech Surgical Tech Community Health Worker 4. Workforce Development: Community Health Workers In FY18, ICP provided technical assistance to SMGC to further the training and workforce development of community healt h workers in order to build capacity in our region for this emerging workforce. The academy provides systematic education programs that train, certify and prepare CHWs to join the community workforce in population health management. Following the completio n of the basic CHW certification, CHWs have the opportunity to complete specialty areas of training for preparation to work in either health care (clinical) settings or school districts . The specialty training programs provide a CHW with the more advanced knowledge and expertise to more effectively and competently address the most at -risk patients and high -risk populations by providing them the skills to navigate highly complex systems of care. Promotores Academy offers specialty training in Clinical Care, Behavioral Health, School -based Clinics and Community Health Development, and is geared to address the objectives of triple aim and the most urgent community health needs. After the basic CHW t raining, C HWs are often employed as CHW Case Workers, CHW Outreach Workers, Health Educators, Promotores , Patient Navigators and Enrollment Specialists (CHWA study, 2013). Over 80 community members received their certification at the LLUH Promotores Academy graduat ion in 2015 -2016. The certification has provided them with the support and tools to better assist the community members and also support their professional development. 5. Community Investment Program : In 2016 ICP and CHD initiated a grant and community investment opportunity, funded by LLUMC, for community -based non -profit organizations in order to work with partners on the implementation of programmatic interventions and outcomes in the areas of workforce development, education, obesity, diabe tes, and mental health.

PossAbilities & Just for Seniors - Community Development & Outreach The PossAbilities program was originally developed in 2000 in response to the need for the continuum of care for our patients and their families after a lengthy hospital stay or a traumatic accident. Through feedback and direction from health care professionals and community members the program quickly evolved into an all -inclusive service to extend acc ess to the disabled . As the program grew, PossAbilities gained the support of the LLUH system and vital community partners , such as the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians, that allow ed the program to operate multiple support groups, resource fairs, events, and to provide access to sports and recreational activities for members. The program offers physically disabled individuals who were born with or have suffered a permanent physical injury a sense of community and a healthy social network . The mission of th e program is to provide new direction and hope through physical, social, and educational interaction with peers and their community. The program is d esigned to support p ersons with physical disabilities such as limb amputation, stroke, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, spina bifida, and others. PossAbilities is a free community outreach and includes services for children and adults. The Just for Seniors program provides outreach to seniors, links them to s upportive services and resources in the community, and provides access to recreational activities to reduce isolation and increase access to healthy activities for older adults . This i s a free membership service and open to all members of the community.

Grants & Scholarships Program - Financial support in the areas of education, home renovation, accessible equipment, and life style grants for disabled individuals. Sickle Cell Support Group - Typically diagnosed in early childhood, sickle cell disease (SCD) occurs when a protein found in hemoglobin attaches to oxygen, causing what should be a normal -round red blood cell to collapse and take the form of a sickle. The \"C\"-shaped cell makes it difficult to carry adequate oxygen to the body, resulting in healt h problems such as frequent infections, episodes of pain, vision complications and stroke. Complications of SCD include anemia, acute chest syndrome, damage to internal organs, necrosis in bones and vascu lar system and skin ulcers. For those living with SC D, the peer support groups and resources for pain and symptom management provided through PossAbilities is invaluable. Disability Sports Festival - Sports festival for disabled individuals to explore various sports in which they may participate based on their physical mobility.

LLUH - COMMUNITY BENEFIT IMPLENTATION STRATEGY - FY 2019 LLUH has undertaken some significant efforts with Vision 2020 and the 2016 Community Needs Assessment to implement innovative strategies to meet the needs of our community. In FY 2019, LLUH will continue to focus on workforce development, education, obesity, diabetes, and mental health in fulfillment of our third year of the 2016 community health needs assessment. LLUH will also be conducting a new community health needs ass essment to identify the priorities that will guide community benefit programs 2019 -2022. 1. Vision 2020 As a long -time leader for quality health care and community health in the Inland Empire, LLUH continues to lead and to address the needs of our commu nity with the construction of two new health care facilities on our campus. With n ew California mandatory seismic regulations set to take effect in 2020, we saw this as an unprecedented opportunity for us to re-imagine health care for the populations and c ommunities we serv e. Two new towers, an adult and a children's tower , will be constructed to not only meet the new seismic requirements, but to create innovative patient care and treatment facilities. This is no small task. As the organization seeks to ful fill its mission of \"continuing the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus Christ \", the most modern and safe infrastructure and facilities are needed in support. In conjunction with Vision 2020, we continue to implement innovative strategies to meet the ne eds of our community. Even with immense change, the goal of LLUH remains the same - to be an example for the way patients are cared for and students are taught, in an effort to help people live productive , healthier lives. At LLUH, our commitment to wholen ess goes beyond our jo bs; it shows how we \"Live it\".

Collaborations and New Facilities Loma Linda University Health - Beaumont -Banning The Highland Springs Medical Plaza was renamed Loma Linda University Health - Beaumont -Banning on October 1 , 2017 . Loma Linda University Health has been offering prim ary and specialty care at the Highland Springs facility since 2009 to significantly expand primary care services. The expanded primary care services include advanced ima ging , an outpatient surgery center, and an infusion center. Primary care physicians will also help patients gain access to the entire Loma Linda University Health system. The center also features an urgent care center , offering walk -in care to community residents 365 days per year . Loma Linda University Children's Hospital Indio Outpatient Pavilion The Coachella Valley communit y is the new home to Loma Linda University Children's Health - Indio, Jill and Barry Golden Pavilion, the largest pediatric clinic in the area. The grand opening was celebrated March 11 , 2018 with a ribbon -cutting ceremony and the \"All About Kids \" Health E xpo. LLUCH is the provider of choice for children of the Coachella Valley. As the health needs of children continue to grow and evolve, so must our treatment methods and service locations. At this new location we will team up with our partner SAC Health System to offer all family members comprehensive primary care. Children will also be able to receive specialized pediatric outpatient care . This clinic s ignificantly enhances access for some of the most vulnerable children in the Coachella Valley as childr en's services are severely lacking in this region. LLUH is committed to bringing hope through healing to kids and their families through these exciting new offerings of much needed services . In 2019, LLUCH is investing in an administrative community liaiso n who will work with ICP and the East Coachella Valley community, a historically disenfranchised and impoverished community, to improve community investment, partnerships, and support of this deeply under -served area. Community Benefit FY 2019 LLUH throu gh the Institute for Community Partnerships and the office of Community Health Development will continue to strive to enhance population health by addressing the social determinants of health, health education, improved access to care and reduced bur den on the health care systems, and to commit to reporting on the outcomes of our three -year community health implementation strategy based on the 2016 assessment. LLUH's Community Health Investments Priority Areas 2018 -2019 : Workforce Development Education Health and Wellness o Mental Health o Diabetes and Pre -diabetes o Obesity Integration of Community Health Workers (CHWs) in LLUH system CHWs play a key role in increasing communi ty access to health care system as they conn ect members to a medical home, p romote increa sed access to preventive care, r emove barriers interfering with community member's abilities to access primary care and most importantly, help patients overcome barriers in the system due to the social determinants of health. CHWs provide peer support through mentoring patients on how to access systems of care, increase their access to community and government support services, and improve patient's sense of self efficacy and knowledge in how to navigate. In FY 2019 , our Community Benefit pro gram will support programs designed to integrate CHWs into health care systems, school districts, and community -based organizations. LLUH is conducting a pilot program to integrate three C HWs will be integrated and p laced in areas where patients face a hig h social determinant burden that intervenes with their health improvement. Through community -based interventions, the CHWs provide free outreach and support to patients and community members. The integration of CHWs will be studied and the successes of thi s strategy will be comprehensively evaluated to see how LLUH can teach and provide technical assistance to other health systems on integrating this vital workforce to increase health equity . Through ICP, LLUH is working on the integration of CHWs in school districts t o overcome chronic absenteeism , address mental health in children, youth, and families, and in an innovative pilot project with a mobile food pantry. Community Health Assessment Cycle 2019 -2022 In 2019, LLUH's four licensed hospitals are conducting a community health needs assessment in collaboration with SAC Health Systems in fiscal year 2019 to update our existing strategy and review the institutional priorities for community health investment that will guide the next phase of community investments. One of the relationships LLUH & SAC HS are studying more closely is the how an increased burden of social determinants impacts the highest utilizers of care at LLUH, what contributes to a lack of access to care in our region , and what shared health priorities can be identified in the care of vulnerable p opulations. This collaborative assessment will attempt to identify the top social determinant barriers in our service region and the priority areas for population hea lth interventions community members who seek care between our systems. What is unique to LLUH & SAC Community Health Needs Assessment? The Voice of the Community : This collaborative assessment will feature not only a robust primary data and expert revie w, but will involve an extensive qualitative assessment to capture the voice of a diverse range of community members. This assessment will feature one of the largest community conversations and focus group discussions in our region, representative of the d iversity and life experience of many people living in the Inland Empire. The community will help LLUH determine what top priorities will help improve the health of the community. A Regional Conversation on Priorities: The LLUH & SACHS joint community health needs assessment will conduct a secondary data analysis of the major infrastruct ural partners in the region the in order to identify where major areas of focus are concentrated. By trending major areas of focus of regional inf luencers, such as the counties, other hospitals and health systems, school districts, and community -based service providers and organizations, LLUH will identify areas of concentration to support a regional discussion on where there is already consensus on community nee ds and strengths. Hosting a multi -sector, regional conversation with community leaders is a unique aspect of our assessment this year as LLUH & SAC work together to obtain guidance on our health investment priorities and how those priorities align to regi onal at the macro level and is part of the ongoing community dialogues ICP has with the community to listen, respect, and act according to the communities ' priorities. How is LLUH & SAC Health System Capturing the Needs & Strengths? To begin to better understand the needs of the community, LLUH has made significant investments in not only our electronic health system, but as a major health care provider, we have invested in bringing health providers like health clinics onto our platform. As part of the EPIC system, LLUH and partner organizations are able to assess population health trends and for the next CHNA cycle, LLUH and SAC are testing the implementation of social determinant screening tool in both the inpatient and outpatient care settings. Additionally, LLUH is utilizing the ESRI ArcGIS data mapping and visualization platforms. Over this next CHNA cycle, the combined leanings from this standardized screening tool will not only support our providers in the care of our patients, it w ill also allow the two systems to correlate the social determinant burdens with populat ion health trends in real -time. The long -term goal is to create the tools that allow LLUH to perform continuous assessment and asset mapping of the strengths and resourc es that in our region. Our Community Benefit in 2019 & Beyond This is an exciting time for community -based, population health. The four hospitals in the LLUH system have expanded their outreach and partnerships wi th organizations that serve some of the most vulnerable or underserved populations in our region. 2019 is an exciting third chapter in the community health implementation strategy we began in 2016 as we make strategic investments in community partners who address our priority areas . In 2019, we are working with partners who double -the- impact of every dollar we invest in the community. It is difficult to gain and maintain health without access to income, housing, and nutritious food. Education and employment are incredibly strong determinants of health as more and more studies correlate the lifespan and quality of life of a person to their zip code. As jobs and un - employment growth has been slow in our region since the recession of 2008, LLUH is one of only a few health systems to focus on key social determinants for health investment: workforce development and education. LLUH lives the mission of education for the medical professions, but many high school students in our region never dream of, nor get to the point where they can access higher educat ion and the health professions. Our pipeline programs are aimed at increasing educational attainment for students of all ages and we are investing in community partners who give access to education or career development services through unique progra ms that provide supportive service to people as they increase their education or apply for jobs. To meet our priority areas obesity, diabetes and mental health, LLUH is investing in the workforce development of community health workers in the health care system, school districts, and community -based organizations as of our double -impact strategy. When community health workers can build trust and work with vulnerable populations who lack access to care and services, incredible change can happen in health ou tcomes of people and families. CHWs build the self -efficacy of individuals and teach them the vital skills of how to navigate the resources available to them in order to improve health and well -being. For this last year of the current CHNA cycle, LLUH is partnering with community organizations who are hiring community health workers to achieve a greater impact in linking vulnerable, under -served, and under - resourced members of our region to the services and care they need that we look forward to reporting o n in the 2019 Annual Report. LLUH is targeting new community investments in order to reach some of the most under -served communities. Most importantly, we are dedicated through a strengths -based approach, to build hope in some of the most under -estimated communities in our region.
