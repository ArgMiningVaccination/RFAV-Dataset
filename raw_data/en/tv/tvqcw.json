However, there are millions of Americans out there who are still suffering from debilitating conditions that are not successfully healed by traditional medicine. Many end up relying heavily on strong medications just to function. In cases like this, you should never give up! You do not have to live with pain when there are multiple alternative treatments that you may respond positively to. ](https://doylechiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/acupuncture-needles.jpg) [Dr. Cody Doyle](https://doylechiro.com/meet-dr-doyle/) provides Keller TX acupuncture and other complementary treatments to help your body heal itself.

[Call our Roanoke, TX office at 817-767-5430 or request an appointment online.](https://doylechiro.com/contact-us/) How Does Acupuncture Work? Acupuncture treatments have many theories behind their efficacy. In the ancient Chinese tradition, practitioners believe that acupuncture/acupressure points on the body stimulate and redirect the flow of energy (qi). While there is little scientific data to support this theory, there is evidence that acupuncture does something to stimulate circulation and nerve pathways and help improve musculoskeletal function. While other practitioners may provide acupuncture to treat specific conditions or break bad habits (such as smoking)\u2014Dr. Doyle only provides [acupuncture and auriculotherapy](https://doylechiro.com/treatments-roanoke-tx-chiropractor/acupuncture-and-auriculotherapy/) to treat dysfunction in very specific points within your musculoskeletal tissues. If you suffer from one of the following conditions, Dr. Doyle may suggest acupuncture as part of a more comprehensive treatment plan. - Neck and back pain - Asthma, allergies, and sinusitis symptoms - Migraines and headaches - TMJ disorder - Muscle spasms and pain - Arthritis symptoms - Menstrual cramps - Lower or upper extremity pain - Stress and anxiety symptoms - Digestive symptoms (musculoskeletal component) Do Insurers Cover Acupuncture and other Complementary Therapies? Today, many insurers will cover chiropractic care, but what about acupuncture, myofascial release therapy, or ultrasound therapy? If you are living with pain and dysfunction it may seem unfair to have your reimbursement requests denied, when all you are trying to do is find a way to be well again! The truth is that more and more insurers are covering what's referred to as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). This can include a number of treatments offered by complementary medical practitioners, such as Dr. Cody Doyle. However, this doesn't mean you will automatically be reimbursed for treatments you seek out on your own. Insurers often need evidence that your treatments are medically necessary. If you are in a situation in which you have been seeing a doctor regularly for a condition, (but your pain and dysfunction are still a problem) you may need to get your primary care doctor to \"prescribe\" CAM therapies before they will be covered. When patients have been suggested to have CAM therapies, they tend to have their claims approved more frequently. Conditions that May Respond to Complementary Alternative Medicine Dr. Cody Doyle has been practicing chiropractic and complementary medicine for approximately two decades. In that time, he has treated patients for many diverse conditions. These range from age-related degenerative arthritis and spinal problems to immune system disorders and neuropathy. Some of the more common conditions Dr. Doyle treats include: - Arthritis - Sciatica - Spinal disc issues - Tendonitis - Musculoskeletal dysfunction - Plantar fasciitis - Peripheral neuropathy - Neck and shoulder pain - Immune disorders and allergies If you have an ongoing struggle to manage the symptoms of your condition, contact Doyle Chiropractic and Acupuncture to learn about Keller TX acupuncture treatments.

Every part is meant to work together. Our musculoskeletal system - muscles, bones, tendons, and ligaments - is connected in a beautiful way and its health can easily be taken for granted. Think about the accomplishments of Olympic athletes, pushing their bodies to the limit. Think of kids and teens who jump and leap, seemingly without effort. The stay-at-home mom who goes up and down stairs, picking up laundry, or the professional who spends all day focused and poised over a computer with arms, neck, and back in the same position for hours. That amazing musculoskeletal system can be put to the test. When the pains and strains get to be too much, [Dr. Cody Doyle](https://doylechiro.com/meet-dr-doyle/) of [Doyle Chiropractic & Acupuncture](https://doylechiro.com/) can provide chiropractic services that can help relieve pain and restore your range of motion.

Dr. Doyle can help identify a variety of conditions including back and neck pain, upper and lower body strain, degenerative discs, and inflammatory and degenerative arthritis. Along with these familiar concerns, Dr. Doyle also treats plantar fasciitis, allergies, peripheral neuropathy, and ailments related to autoimmune diseases. If you suffer with these illnesses or experience ongoing pain, we welcome to you stop by for a consultation. While Dr. Doyle is prepared to provide traditional chiropractic care, he knows every patient is different and comes to our treatment center with varying concerns. He takes time to carefully evaluate each patient, taking into consideration their medical history and their current condition. Dr. Doyle can recommend a variety of treatments that can address specific issues and can contribute to the overall health of the whole person. What kinds of treatments do you offer? Dr. Doyle is trained to identify specific courses of treatment that can bring pain relief and promote ongoing healing. Chiropractic adjustments can manipulate the musculoskeletal system. To go along with adjustments, premodulated muscle stimulation (sometimes called e-stim) and ultrasound therapies may be used to target a specific problem area. These therapies can help reduce muscle spasms and can release tension in muscle groups and assist in restoring flexibility. [Acupuncture](https://doylechiro.com/acupuncture/) is an alternative and holistic treatment based in traditional Chinese medicine and is also available to address concerns related to dysfunction in the nervous system. These therapies can provide relief and positive results. Dr. Doyle is also focused on providing services to those pursuing overall wellness and weight loss.

[The Unexpected Benefits of Chiropractic Care](https://doylechiro.com/chiropractic/unexpected-benefits-chiropractic/) [Most patients seek out chiropractic care for pain management or neck and back issues\u2014but they often discover unexpected health benefits in the process! This is no surprise to us, as chiropractic treatment is based on the premise that the whole body works better when the spine and musculoskeletal system is in proper alignment.](https://doylechiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/family.jpg) When the vertebrae and discs are all working together correctly, the spinal cord and nervous system function better, to keep your body running like it should. For example, patients often report improved digestive, immune, reproductive, and cardiovascular health. Are you struggling with pain and medical conditions that hinder your quality of life? Roanoke, Keller, and Justin, TX chiropractor Cody Doyle would love the opportunity to help. [Call our office at 817-767-5430 to learn more about chiropractic care.](https://doylechiro.com/contact-us/) Better Digestive Health Chiropractic adjustments can't take the place of good dietary choices, but they may help ease the symptoms of disorders such as acid reflux, heartburn, or irritable bowel syndrome. Sometimes digestive malfunctions can be caused or worsened by compressed nerves, stemming from poor spinal alignment. When proper spinal alignment is achieved, nerve signals can more effectively regulate digestive functions. Many patients who come in for back and neck problems are pleasantly surprised when their digestive woes become less frequent or less severe. Improved Immune Function Patients with environmental allergies and poor immune function often respond positively to chiropractic and complementary therapies, (such as acupuncture and myofascial release therapy). Autoimmune diseases and severe allergies cannot be cured, of course, but improved blood flow and nervous system function can strengthen the body's natural defenses. Reproductive Health Did you know that the [American Pregnancy Association recommends chiropractic treatment](http://www.americanpregnancy.org/infertility/infertility-and-chiropractic/) for women who struggle with infertility? All of our organ systems rely on messages that travel through the spine, and that includes the hormones that induce ovulation and encourage conception. Chiropractic adjustments unblock compressed nerves and increase blood circulation to the reproductive organs. This also means men suffering from low testosterone and erectile dysfunction may experience better blood flow and circulation with regular chiropractic therapy. Better Respiration and Cardiovascular Health The respiratory airway, lungs, and heart rely on messages to and from the brain, which all travel through the spine. When that message-way is not impeded by subluxations in the spine, cardiovascular health and lung function often improve. Some medical conditions, such as asthma and high blood pressure, have been shown to improve with chiropractic treatments. [WebMD reported on a study](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/news/20070316/chiropractic-cuts-blood-pressure#1) that provides evidence that a specific type of chiropractic adjustment can have the same effect as a dose of blood pressure medicine. A Path Toward Wellness Spinal adjustments are not a cure for conditions like infertility, high blood pressure, or acid reflux\u2014but they can help your whole body function and heal properly. When musculoskeletal problems are accompanied by other medical conditions, many patients find that their capacity for healing improves in ways they did not anticipate. If you have conditions that cause you ongoing pain or distress, chiropractic treatments may give your body the extra health boost it needs to respond better to healthy lifestyle choices and medical interventions. Dr. Doyle has helped thousands of patients achieve better health through chiropractic adjustments and complementary treatments, such as myofascial release therapy and acupuncture.

We regularly treat: - Back and neck pain - Degenerative and inflammatory arthritis - Bursitis - Sciatica - Tendonitis - Plantar fasciitis - Heel spurs - Allergies - Shoulder pain - ACL and MCL sprains - Bulging or herniated discs - Degenerative disc disease - Peripheral neuropathy - Stress and anxiety - Migraines - Weight loss When you visit our office, Dr. Doyle will conduct a full examination and take x-rays and other diagnostic scans. You will have the opportunity to explain your medical history and describe your condition(s). Depending on your symptoms, he may recommend a combination of chiropractic, acupuncture, physical therapy, myofascial release therapy, dietary changes and supplements, or other [complementary therapies](https://doylechiro.com/treatment-methods-complementary-therapies/). Many first-time patients of chiropractic care come to us wondering how spinal manipulation can cure a problem with inflammation in the knee, for example. The spine is more than just a support system for the back; it is the foundation for all mechanical function for the whole body. Furthermore, the spinal cord is the message relay system between all parts of the body and signals to and from the brain. Correcting an imbalance or dysfunction of the spine can help your body \"communicate,\" function, and heal itself properly. Holistic Therapy As a practitioner of alternative and complementary medicine, Dr. Doyle ascribes to a holistic approach to healing. What does this mean? Quite simply, it means that sometimes you have to look at the whole body to get to the bottom of dysfunction and pain. We all readily accept, for example, that improper footwear can lead to pain in the lower back and neck, because the musculoskeletal system is a functioning whole. Holistic medicine takes this a step further and looks at the interconnectedness of multiple body systems to promote healing and proper functioning. To heal a problem with the knee, for example, you may have to look beyond the knee itself, and consider how the knee is being used, how the leg and foot are being used, what you are putting into your body, and other factors.

Below you'll find four of the most common causes of neck pain, and how to avoid them. Regardless of the cause of your pain, [Dr. Cody Doyle](https://doylechiro.com/meet-dr-doyle/) of Doyle Chiropractic & Acupuncture has more than 20 years of experience treating acute and chronic neck pain, and can provide relief for your symptoms.

[For Roanoke neck pain, contact us online or call (817) 767-5430](https://doylechiro.com/roanoke/). Your Pillow and Sleep Posture The best sleep position for avoiding neck strain is on your back or on your side. If you have tried your best to stay off your stomach but still wake up face-down each morning, you may want to consider sleeping with no pillow, or using a water pillow. Water pillows are an excellent option for neck posture because you can adjust the level of firmness to fit your needs. Avoid a hard or high pillow when sleeping in any position, as it can put your head at an angle that disrupts the natural position of the neck and spine. If you sleep on your back or side, a memory foam pillow can be an effective tool for supporting the neck and keeping the head in a natural position, If you sleep with your head elevated to reduce congestion in the night, consider getting a wedge and neck pillow to keep your spine and neck straight. Dehydration Sometimes it seems like everything can be blamed on dehydration, but there's actually connection between hydration and the function of the neck. The discs in the neck can become less pliable and therefore less effective at cushioning the vertebrae when we are dehydrated. These spongy structures are mostly made up of water, so any level of dehydration can directly affect your neck. Next time your neck feels sore, chug a big glass of water to make sure your discs are well hydrated. Poor Ergonomics When we work, we tend to focus on outcomes and output, to the point that we often ignore the subtle signs from our body that its positioning may be off. Even something as simple as making sure your chair is adjusted to the right height can have a profound effect on neck pain. If your eye level is not at the right height, you may be craning your neck at an unnatural angle every moment you are looking at your computer screen. When sitting at a desk, try to keep your back straight and supported, and your feet on the floor. Adjust the height of your monitor if you find yourself angling your head up or down to see the screen. Repetitive Neck Strain If you routinely hold your phone against your shoulder when talking on the phone, you may be in for trouble. It may be the best way to sweep the floor, type on your computer, or clean the bathroom while chatting with friends\u2014but your neck is not designed for this type of work. If you regularly multitask while talking on the phone, invest in a Bluetooth or hands-free device if you want to avoid strain. If you spend a lot of time texting on your phone, make sure you are not turning your head downward to do so. When Neck Pain Doesn't Go Away If you have tried adjusting the way you care for your neck at home and at work, yet pain persists, call Dr. Cody Doyle. He will assess your symptoms and treat them with chiropractic, acupuncture, myofascial release, or other therapies.

Many have struggled with chronic pain for years and found little lasting relief in standard medical treatments. Sometimes they are unsure of what combined alternative therapy really means, but are ready to try anything to stop their back pain.

Call us today for a consultation in [Roanoke, TX (817-767-5430) or La Grange, TX (979-968-6400)](https://doylechiro.com/contact-us/). The big question for many patients is often: how do combined alternative therapies differ from western medicine? What can you do for me that my 10+ years of doctors have been unable to do? The answer to those questions will vary from patient to patient, but there are some general differences between mainstream and alternative treatments that are easy to understand. \"Alternatives\" to Standard Medical Treatment Like conventional medical approaches, combined alternative therapies are based on research, innovation, and patient results. As nutrition science and research into supplements illustrate, many alternative therapies are gradually becoming more mainstream as we learn more about how they work. Doctors fifty years ago never recommended garlic and fish oil for heart health, but as we have learned more about their health benefits, it is now a standard recommendation. Therapies that are not fully understood and accepted by medical science remain \"alternatives,\" but that doesn't mean you can't benefit from them. Holistic Care for Back Pain Lower back pain, especially, can have many sources. If you take a look at the human body, you'll notice that the area around the waist is the critical junction that connects the lower and upper portions of the body. Redardless of your actual waist measurement, every body is generally hourglass shaped: the lower and upper sections weigh more than the small area that connects them. This puts an amazing amount of stress on the lower back to fulfil its duties. When our sitting or standing postures, weight, sleeping habits, or repeated movements (or lack of movement) are even slightly out of tune with the optimal functioning of the lower spine, the results can be painful and debilitating. Furthermore, the human body is a complexly connected structure. Any dysfunction in one part of the body can have a rippling effect that ultimately leads back to the sensitive spine. Rather than looking at how the whole body functions, the traditional medical approach is to focus on the locus of pain, rather than the source. A doctor may make the pain go away, but without an on-going holistic approach, symptoms often return. Combined Therapy Addresses Multiple Causes of Pain Pinpointing \"the problem\" in your back can be a muddy proposition. Any combination of muscles, discs, nerves, and connective tissues may be affected when back function is not optimal. An injury may lead to muscular concerns, which may in turn lead to spinal misalignment. Or vice-versa. Western medicine has a tendency to \"either/or\" its diagnoses, so treatment can be precise. Focusing on only one area may neglect the associated causes of pain. In order to get to the bottom of your pain, Dr. Doyle always does a thorough analysis of your condition. In addition to the same physical exam you've had from other doctors, Dr. Doyle will also investigate your pain history and any possible origin of symptoms, as well as consider all the factors in your life that may be contributing to your condition. When a treatment plan is drafted, it may include: [Chiropractic](https://doylechiro.com/chiropractic-care/)Adjustment: Using standard chiropractic tools and techniques, Dr. Doyle will adjust your misaligned joints back into proper position to eliminate pain and promote healthy body mechanics. [Acupuncture](https://doylechiro.com/acupuncture/): This therapy helps many patients with pain, by stimulating strategic points of the body to bring healthy blood flow in to tissues and muscles. - Premodulated Muscle Stimulation: Gentle electrical stimulation can reduce spasms, pain, and swelling in the muscles surrounding your spine. - Home Exercise Programs: Since weight and muscle tone can affect your back, Dr. Doyle may suggest a series of appropriate physical exercises for you to perform at home or a local gym. - Therapeutic Exercises: Dr. Doyle may recommend a series of physical exercises to target the specific muscles that will support proper spinal alignment and full body function. - Myofascial Release: Commonly used after chiropractic adjustments, this therapy applies pressure to muscles and connective tissues to improve flexibility and function. If you are suffering from back pain, by all means see your general practitioner or spine specialist.
