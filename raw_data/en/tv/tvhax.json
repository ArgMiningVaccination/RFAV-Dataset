Here are the best ones for eczema and how to use them.", "sitename": "Medical News Today", "date": "2019-01-21", "cleaned_text": "About 31.6 million people in the United States \u2014 more than 10% of the population \u2014 have a form of eczema. Various natural remedies can help manage eczema, such as aloe vera gel, honey, and acupressure. Eczema can affect people of all races and ethnicities. One estimate suggests that [10%](https://nationaleczema.org/research/eczema-facts/#identifier_11_6880) of Black or African American people, 11% of white people, 13% of Asian American and Pacific Islander people, and 13% of Native American people may have the condition. People often use the term \"eczema\" interchangeably with \"atopic dermatitis,\" the term for the most common type. Eczema can cause the skin to appear chapped. It may appear red on lighter skin tones or brown, purple, or gray on darker skin tones. Home remedies and natural treatments can soothe the dry, itchy skin that accompanies eczema. People can use creams, natural products, and diet and lifestyle strategies to manage or prevent [eczema](/articles/14417.php) flares, especially in the winter, when symptoms tend to be at their worst. Natural substances such as [aloe vera gel](/articles/318591) and [coconut oil](/articles/282857.php) can moisturize dry, broken skin. They can also help reduce swelling by reducing [inflammation](/articles/248423.php) and help prevent infection by protecting against harmful bacteria. Natural remedies cannot cure eczema, but they can help people manage the symptoms and prevent flares. This article explores the best natural remedies for eczema. 1. Aloe vera gel [Aloe vera gel](/articles/323507) comes from the leaves of the aloe plant. People have used aloe vera gel for centuries to treat a wide range of ailments, including to soothe eczema. A [2017 systematic review](https://www.jpccr.eu/Evaluation-of-clinical-effectiveness-of-Aloe-vera-a-review-,74577,0,2.html) looked at the effects of aloe vera on human health. The researchers reported that the gel: - has antibacterial properties - has antimicrobial properties - can bolster the [immune system](/articles/320721) - can help [heal wounds](/articles/how-to-make-a-wound-heal-faster) The antibacterial and antimicrobial effects can prevent [skin infections](/articles/324654), which are more likely to occur when a person has dry, cracked skin. Aloe's wound-healing properties may soothe broken skin and promote healing. How to use it People can buy aloe vera gel in health stores or online, or they can purchase an aloe vera plant and use the gel directly from its leaves. Individuals should aim to use aloe gel products with few ingredients \u2014 some products may contain preservatives, alcohol, fragrances, and colors, which can irritate sensitive skin. Additionally, alcohol and other drying ingredients could make eczema worse. Start with a small amount of gel to check for skin sensitivity, as aloe vera can sometimes cause burning or stinging. However, it is generally safe and effective for adults and children. 2. Apple cider vinegar Apple cider vinegar is a popular home remedy for many conditions, including [skin conditions](/articles/323160). The [National Eczema Association (NEA)](https://nationaleczema.org/get-the-facts-acv/) reports that apple cider vinegar could help with the condition. However, the organization recommends exercising caution because the vinegar's acids can damage soft tissue. No research has confirmed that apple cider vinegar reduces eczema symptoms, but it may help in the following two ways: Balancing the skin's acidity levels Vinegar is highly acidic. The skin is naturally acidic, but people with eczema may have less acidic skin than others, which can weaken the skin's defenses. Applying diluted apple cider vinegar could help balance the skin's acidity levels. Dilution is important because undiluted vinegar can cause burns. In contrast, many soaps, detergents, and cleansers are alkaline. They can disrupt the acidity of the skin, leaving the skin vulnerable to damage. This may explain why washing with certain soaps can cause eczema flares. Fighting bacteria [Research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-18618-x) How to use it Always dilute apple cider vinegar before applying it to the skin \u2014 undiluted vinegar can cause chemical burns or other injuries. People [can use](https://nationaleczema.org/get-facts-acv/) the vinegar in wet wraps or baths, and it is available in most supermarkets and health stores. To use apple cider vinegar in a wet wrap: - Mix 1 cup of warm water and 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar. - Apply the solution to cotton or gauze. - Cover the dressing in clean cotton fabric. - Leave it on the area for 3 hours. To try an apple cider vinegar bath soak: - Add 2 cups of apple cider vinegar to a warm bath. - Soak for 15-20 minutes. - Rinse the body thoroughly. - Moisturize within several minutes of leaving the bath. 3. Bleach in the bath Although it may sound dangerous, research suggests that a mild bleach bath can improve eczema symptoms because of its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. Bleach can kill the bacteria on the surface of the skin, including S. aureus, which causes staph infections. This may restore the microbiome of the skin's surface. A [2018 review](https://journals.lww.com/dermatitis/Abstract/2018/05000/Bleach_for_Atopic_Dermatitis.4.aspx) concluded that bleach baths could reduce the need for topical corticosteroid or [antibiotic](/articles/10278.php) treatments. However, other research found [no benefits](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546634.2015.1067669) of bleach baths compared to regular baths. How to use it To make a bleach bath for eczema, use regular strength (6%) plain bleach and try the [following](https://www.aad.org/media/news-releases/eczema-bleach-bath-therapy): - Add 1/2 cup of bleach to a full bathtub of water, or use 1 teaspoon of bleach per gallon of water. - Pour in the bleach while the bath is filling. - Soak for 5-10 minutes. - Rinse the body thoroughly with warm water. - Gently pat the skin dry. Use lukewarm water to prevent the skin from drying out, and moisturize immediately after drying. If a person experiences any discomfort, irritation, or redness, they should stop taking bleach baths. People with [asthma](/articles/323523) or breathing issues should also refrain from taking bleach baths because of the strong fumes. 4. Colloidal oatmeal Colloidal oatmeal, also known as Avena sativa, comes from oats that have been ground and boiled to extract their skin-healing properties. A [2015 study](http://jddonline.com/articles/dermatology/S1545961615P0043X) found that colloidal oatmeal lotion had [antioxidant](/articles/301506.php) and anti-inflammatory properties, which resulted in reductions in: - skin dryness - scaling - roughness - itch intensity Additionally, a [2014 study](https://jddonline.com/articles/dermatology/S1545961614P1265X) found that a colloidal oatmeal moisturizer offered significant benefits for skin healing. How to use it Add powdered colloidal oatmeal to a warm bath and soak. Choose a [colloidal oatmeal product](/articles/oatmeal-benefits-for-the-skin) that features oats as the only ingredient, avoiding those with fragrances or additives. Pure colloidal oatmeal is available at health stores or online. Lotions and creams that contain colloidal oatmeal are also available. Colloidal oatmeal is generally safe for all ages, but people who have an allergy to oats should avoid it. Individuals who have a gluten allergy should also be cautious, as manufacturers often process oats with wheat. 5. Baths Bathing provides the skin with essential moisture and is an important part of eczema treatment. When a person has a skin condition such as eczema, their skin needs extra moisture because the outer layer does not function as it should. For some, washing often can dry out the skin and make eczema worse. This can occur when a person: - uses water that is too hot or cold - uses soap that irritates their skin - does not moisturize afterward However, people should avoid bathing too frequently \u2014 for example, most babies and children need bathing only once or twice per week. The [NEA](https://nationaleczema.org/eczema/treatment/bathing/) recommends that adults: - bathe or shower at least once per day - use lukewarm water - limit bathing to 10-15 minutes - avoid scrubbing the skin - use gentle cleansers instead of soaps - try different types of therapeutic baths, such as those with [baking soda](/articles/321398), vinegar, or oatmeal A long, hot shower can remove natural oils and moisture from the skin. Therefore, it is best to take shorter showers with warm \u2014 but not hot \u2014 water. After bathing, moisturize within 3 minutes. Gently pat the skin dry with a towel and apply an oil-based moisturizer before the skin has fully dried. This can help seal in water from the shower or bath before it evaporates. After washing and drying the hands, apply moisturizer to help prevent eczema flares. 6. Coconut oil [Coconut oil](/articles/323154) contains beneficial fatty acids that can add moisture to the skin, which can help people with dry skin and eczema. Additionally, virgin coconut oil [may protect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2225411017300871) the skin by helping to prevent inflammation and improving the health of the skin barrier. In a [2014 study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ijd.12339) How to use it Apply cold-pressed virgin coconut oil directly to the skin after bathing and up to several times a day. Use it before bed to keep the skin moisturized overnight. Extra-virgin coconut oil is generally solid at room temperature, but the warmth of a person's body turns it into liquid. The oil is available in health stores and online. However, people who are allergic to coconuts should not use coconut oil. 7. Honey Honey is a natural antibacterial and anti-inflammatory agent, and people have used it to [heal wounds](https://www.woundsresearch.com/article/honey-biologic-wound-dressing) for centuries. A [2016 review](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09540105.2015.1104653) suggests that honey can help heal wounds and boost immune system function, which means that it can help the body fight off infections. [Another review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5424551/) When people apply it directly to eczema-affected skin, honey could help prevent infections while moisturizing the skin and speeding healing. How to use it Try dabbing a little honey onto the area. [Manuka honey products](/articles/honey-for-skin) that are suitable for wound care and skin application are available in many drug stores and online. 8. Tea tree oil [Tea tree oil](/articles/322103) comes from the leaves of the Melaleuca alternifolia tree. People often use this oil to help with skin problems, including eczema. A [2013 review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22998411) How to use it Always dilute essential oils before using them on the skin. Try mixing tea tree oil with a carrier oil, such as almond or olive oil, before applying the solution. Some products include tea tree oil in a diluted form. The oil is available in health stores or online. 9. Dietary changes Eczema is an inflammatory condition, meaning that it causes inflamed, red, sore skin. Certain foods can cause or reduce inflammation in the body, so making a few key [dietary changes](/articles/320855) could help reduce eczema flares. It may be helpful to eat more [anti-inflammatory foods](/articles/320233.php), such as: Common inflammatory foods include dairy, eggs, soy, and wheat. Try eliminating some of these from the diet and keep a food diary to help identify which foods may be problematic. 10. Gentle soaps and detergents Laundry detergent can contain harsh chemicals that [aggravate eczema](https://nationaleczema.org/eczema/treatment/bathing/). Many body washes and cleansers contain detergents, which help provide a soapy lather. Detergents and other lathering agents can dry out the skin, especially in people with eczema. Bar soaps can also be harsh on the skin because of their [alkalinity](https://www.ajol.info/index.php/sajchh/article/view/164488). Try using a gentle, no-lather, fragrance-free cleanser. Avoid products with rough particles for scrubbing or exfoliating, as these can further irritate the skin. Many people with eczema also find that switching to a more gentle, fragrance- or color-free laundry detergent can help reduce symptoms. Additionally, try skipping fabric softener, which lingers on clothes and often contains fragrances and chemicals that can irritate the skin. 11. Avoiding strong heat sources Sitting next to a fireplace or near a furnace may feel good, but it can worsen eczema symptoms. The hot-dry air [can dehydrate](https://nationaleczema.org/what-about-climate-heat-humidity/) the skin and increase the itchiness of eczema. Use a humidifier during the dry winter months and avoid getting too close to heaters and fireplaces. 12. Skin protection in cold weather Cold, harsh winter winds can [dry out the skin](https://eczema.org/information-and-advice/triggers-for-eczema/weather-and-eczema/) and cause eczema flares. Keep the skin covered when temperatures are low. Also, consider covering the face with a scarf if eczema occurs on the face. 13. Acupressure Acupressure is similar to [acupuncture](/articles/156488), but it does not require needles, and a person can do it at home. In a small [2012 trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22207450/) They felt significantly less itchiness and had more skin improvement than the group that did not use acupressure. However, further research is necessary to better determine the effectiveness of acupressure for eczema. 14. Comfortable fabrics Polyester, nylon, and other synthetic fabrics, as well as wool, may irritate the skin. Rough seams, zippers, and other fasteners may also be an irritant. Clothes made with 100% cotton may be the [best option](https://eczema.org/information-and-advice/triggers-for-eczema/clothing-and-eczema/) for people with eczema because cotton is soft and lets the skin breathe. Other comfortable, breathable fabrics include bamboo, which is also antibacterial, and silk. 15. Avoiding scratching Habitually scratching irritated skin may make healing more difficult. People may not even be aware that they are scratching. Some people with eczema in the United Kingdom [have found](https://eczema.org/information-and-advice/treatments-for-eczema/habit-reversal-and-the-combined-approach/) a combination of topical treatment and habit reversal training (HRT) helpful for preventing scratching. HRT is a type of [cognitive behavioral therapy](/articles/296579) that helps people become aware of when they are scratching and instead do a different action, called a competing response. 16. Stress management Stress is the main trigger for flare-ups, according to a [2020 survey](https://www.leo-pharma.co.uk/Files/Billeder/UK%202020/Eczema%20Unmasked%20Report.pdf) of more than 1,000 people with eczema. The [NEA](https://eczema.org/information-and-advice/triggers-for-eczema/stress-and-eczema/) recommends doing the following to help reduce stress: - learning to say no in order to avoid being overwhelmed - avoiding drinking alcohol - spending time in nature - exercising regularly - expressing one's feelings to other people While many home remedies are suitable for babies and children, always consult a doctor before using them. The following home remedies and tips may help: - Avoid dressing a baby or child too warmly. Sweating can aggravate eczema or cause [heat rash](/articles/181512.php), making itching worse. - Use mittens to prevent infants from scratching their skin. - Apply a gentle moisturizer frequently to the affected areas, taking care not to get it in the eyes or nose. - Do not cover a baby's face with a scarf \u2014 infant car seat covers can help shield a baby from cold outdoor air. Check often to ensure that the baby is getting enough airflow. - Ask a doctor before using apple cider vinegar or bleach when bathing a baby or child. - Colloidal oatmeal baths are generally [safe for children](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09546634.2017.1303569), but keep the bath water out of their eyes. - Avoid bathing infants too frequently. Most babies and children need bathing only once or twice per week unless they are visibly soiled. Bathing less frequently may help prevent dry skin. - Use fragrance- and alcohol-free baby wipes, although these may still contain irritating ingredients. Look for wipes that contain soothing ingredients such as aloe vera. Sensitive skin wipes may be useful. - Use baby shampoos suitable for children with eczema. Many eczema washes can sting the eyes, so look for eczema washes that are \"tear-free\" and carefully avoid the child's eyes. Eczema does not yet have a cure, but people can often manage their symptoms with home remedies, including natural gels and oils, therapeutic baths, and dietary changes. If eczema is severe or does not respond to home treatments, a person may want to consult a doctor. People should seek prompt medical attention if a child or baby develops a new rash. A doctor may prescribe steroid creams or other prescription medications to treat the inflammation. "}
