Dr. Marvell Scott, a sports medicine expert, asserts that chiropractic services are necessary in helping athletes maintain their health and avoid injury. [Dr. Marvell Scott](/news/dr.-marvell-scott/) 01 May, 2012, 06:00 ET [] NEW YORK, May 1, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- The Wall Street Journal's MarketWatch.com [reports](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/chiropractic-care-minimizes-risk-of-injury-in-elite-athletes-bobsled-and-skeleton-team-athletes-tout-benefits-2012-04-24) that the United States National Bobsled and Skeleton Team has noticed a decline in injuries since incorporating chiropractic professionals into its medical team two years ago. The Foundation for Chiropractic Progress credits this care with helping the team earn its most recent world championship. Dr. Marvell Scott, a sports medicine expert, agrees that the well-rounded medical approach of the team's doctors has limited the injuries its members have sustained. As such, he urges athletes to take advantage of the benefits that chiropractic provides. Dr. Eugene Byrne is an orthopedic surgeon, as well as the chief medical officer for the team. \"For sports that focus primarily on power and speed, like bobsledding and skeleton, a team approach to healthcare has proven to be most effective,\" explained Dr. Byrne. \"Repeatedly, the athletes are jostled back and forth during runs, resulting in excessive stress endured by the lower body. Due to advanced ability in addressing musculoskeletal and neuroskeletal conditions, doctors of chiropractic provide essential care to the athletes.\" Dr. Byrne adds that the medical team, with the addition of chiropractic care in 2010, has been able to improve the strength and functionality of athletes. This, ultimately, increases the quality of their performance. In addition to providing adjustments to keep the body in alignment, chiropractic care helps athletes learn muscle control, as well as strength and restoration.
