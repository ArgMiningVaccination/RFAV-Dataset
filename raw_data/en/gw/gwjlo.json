Individuals may also engage in broader noncompliant behaviours if they acquire a fear of needles as a result of negative vaccination experiences.3 There are many evi - dence-based treatments to mitigate pain at the time of vaccination; however, most are not rou - tinely used.4,5 An independent, cross-Canada multidisciplinary team, Help Eliminate Pain in Kids (HELPinKIDS), assembled in 2008 to tackle this gap in clinical care. In 2010, the HELPinKIDS team published the first clinical practice guideline on reducing pain during child - hood vaccination.6 There are currently no guide - lines on reducing pain during vaccination in adults. Scope The current guideline expands on and updates the 2010 guideline with recommendations across the lifespan. This enhanced scope led to a revised team name of HELPinKids&Adults. The intended audience is all health care provid - ers who administer vaccine injections. Recom - mendations for the management of fear in indi - viduals with high levels of needle fear (i.e., individuals with persistent, intense apprehension of or fear in response to a needle procedure, who may endure needles with intense distress or avoidance) are reported separately, as they require knowledge and skills beyond those of practitioners who usually give vaccinations (C.M.M., unpublished data, 2015). Delayed pain (hours to days after injection) was not con - sidered in this guideline.Methods Team composition The HELPinKids&Adults team included 25 individuals from across Canada with expertise in pain, fear, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, psy - chology, vaccinology, infectious diseases, epi - demiology, guideline development, knowledge translation (KT), library sciences, public health, family advisory/advocacy and health policy. Eighteen members of the HELPinKids&Adults team formed the guideline panel group. The project was funded by the Canadian Insti - tutes of Health Research, which had no input into the guideline. Financial and intellectual conflicts of interest were disclosed by all members. Individuals with self-identified conflicts were allowed to partic - ipate in all discussions, but were excluded from voting on guideline recommendations in areas of conflict. One government agency representative was an observer and did not participate in voting on recommendations. Individuals from industries manufacturing or distributing vaccines or pain treatments were excluded from participating. Guideline development We used the AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II) tool (www.agree trust.org) as the overarching methodology for guide - line development.

DOI:10.1503 /cmaj.150391 Pain at the time of vaccine injection is a common concern and contributes to vaccine hesitancy across the lifespan. Evidence-based and feasible interventions are available to mitigate pain and are part of good vaccination clinical practice. This guideline includes recommendations for pain mitigation based on five domains of pain management interventions (procedural, physical, pharmacologic, psychological and process): the \"5P\" approach.Key pointsCMAJ and Cochrane (http://handbook. cochrane.org) methods provided the general frame - work for the development of recommendations and the synthesis of research evidence (Box 1). All members of the HELPinKids&Adults team participated in delineating the scope and clinical questions, and reviewed and approved the recommendations. The guideline panel group reviewed the evidence base and approved the first draft of the recommendations before consider - ation by the whole team. Two smaller working groups oversaw the development of the evidence base (Evidence Lead group) and knowledge translation (KT group) aspects. The chair (A.T.) oversaw all aspects of the project. Practice recommendations were made for 49 clinical questions organized into five domains of pain management interventions (the \"5P\" approach): procedural, physical, pharmacologic, psychological and process. We identified relevant articles by searching MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global from their date of inception until Feb. 26, 2015. Sys - tematic reviews were carried out for each domain; the complete methodology used and results are published separately.7-13 Self-reported pain was typically identified as the critically important out - come in studies; however, related outcomes, such as self-reported fear and, in the absence of self- report (e.g., in infants and young children), observer-rated distress, were often included.The perspective of the individual undergoing vaccination was prioritized for decision-making. Because pain is an iatrogenic harm of vaccination, even small mitigation benefits were considered to be clinically significant. Recommendations were generally applied to broad developmental stages: infants and young children ( 3 yr), children (3-12 yr), adolescents (12-17 yr) and adults ( 18 yr). Where deemed appropriate, further subdivisions were made or categories collapsed. The guideline was reviewed using the AGREE II framework by individuals and organizations, including the World Health Organization. Changes were made to address concerns raised and then the guideline was finalized. Recommendations The recommendations are summarized in Table 1 and in age-based algorithms (Appendi - ces 1-4, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/ doi:10.1503/cmaj.150391/-/DC1.) Strong recom - mendations are reviewed below. Procedural interventions (injection techniques) We recommend that no aspiration be used during intramuscular vaccine injections in individuals of all ages (strong recommendation; very low confi - dence in estimates of effect). Aspiration, a long-standing practice with injec - tion of medications, can increase pain because of the combined effects of a longer needle dwelling time in the tissues and sheering action (wiggling) of the needle. In two studies including 313 infants, there was a benefit to not aspirating on infant acute distress (standardized mean differ - ence [SMD] -0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.18 to -0.46).8 Aspiration is unnecessary for vaccine injections because of the lack of major blood vessels in the anatomic sites used for injec - tion.14 In many countries, auto-disable syringes are already used, which preclude aspiration. Slight bleeding at the injection site is common with vac - cine injections and does not signal incorrect injec - tion technique. There are no documented harms of not aspirating before vaccination. It is a cost-neutral intervention for pain mitigation. We recommend injecting the most painful vaccine last (rather than first) during vaccine injections in individuals of all ages (strong recommendation; moderate confidence in estimates of effect). Many individuals receive more than one vac - cine injection at a single visit. The order of vaccine injection matters to overall pain because some vac - cines are inherently more painful than others, and pain can escalate with each subsequent injection Box 1: Summary of approach to guideline development and recommendations The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system provided the general framework for the formulation of recommendations and the synthesis of the research evidence. We rated candidate clinical questions; a two-thirds majority was set as the cut-off for inclusion in the guideline. We ranked the importance of each outcome on a scale of 1 to 9. Outcomes with scores from 7 to 9 were classified as critically important, those with scores from 4 to 6 were classified as important, and those with scores from 1 to 3 were disregarded. Critically important outcomes were prioritized for decision-making. We performed systematic reviews for all included questions. Quality of evidence across critical and important outcomes was assessed as very low, low, moderate or high on the basis of five factors: methodologic limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias. The overall quality was assessed based on the lowest confidence for critical outcomes only. We categorized recommendations as strong or weak on the basis of four factors: balance between benefits and harms, strength of evidence for critical outcomes, variability in patient values and preferences, and resource implications. Interventions with a large benefit and higher strength of evidence were more likely to receive a strong recommendation.Guidelines CMAJ, September 22, 2015, 187(13) 977(i.e., increased pain intensity following repeated painful stimuli, or hyperalgesia).15 In two studies including 196 infants, lower overall infant acute distress was observed when the most painful vac - cine was given last (SMD -0.69, 95% CI -0.98 to -0.40).8 There are no cost implications or identi - fied harms from this intervention. Examples of painful vaccines that should be given last include M-M-R II and Prevnar.6,8 Physical interventions (body position and activity) We recommend breastfeeding be used during vaccine injections in children two years and younger (strong recommendation; very low con - fidence in estimates of effect).Breastfeeding is one of the most important factors in promoting optimal health and is rec - ommended for infants up to two years or beyond (www.who.int/nutrition/topics/infant feeding _recommendation/en). Breastfeeding is hypothesized to reduce distress via multiple mechanisms, including physical comfort, sucking, distraction and ingestion of sweet-tasting and other substances that may have, individually and together, distress-relieving effects. A meta-analysis including 792 infants showed a large benefit of breastfeeding during vaccination (SMD -1.78, 95% CI -2.35 to -1.22).9 Breastfeeding is a cost- neutral intervention and does not require additional time beyond the need to latch the infant. Some privacy and a chair are suggested.

Other alternatives are described below. We recommend holding be used (rather than the child lying supine) during vaccine injections in chil - dren three years and younger (strong recommenda - tion; very low confidence in estimates of effect). Positioning that is comfortable and promotes proximity soothing from a caregiver should be used.16 Neonates that are not breastfed can be positioned skin-to-skin (also known as \"kangaroo care\"), which involves placing a diaper-clad baby prone on the mother's bare chest before com - mencing vaccine injection and continuing during and afterwards.

Sitting upright promotes a sense of control in individuals undergoing vaccination, which can have a positive impact on their experience of pain. Sitting upright has been shown to decrease fear (SMD -0.39, 95% CI -0.77 to -0.01; n distress (SMD -10.3, 95% CI -20.18 to -0.42; n = 107) in children.8 Children can sit on a parent's lap; this can also assist with keeping still the limbs to be vaccinated. Forcibly restraining children should be avoided because this can increase fear. Children, adolescents and adults can sit upright on their own. Pharmacologic interventions (pain medicine) We recommend topical anesthetics be applied before vaccine injections in children 12 years and younger (strong recommendation; very low confidence in estimates of effect). Topical anesthetics are local anesthetic- containing creams, gels and patches that block transmission of pain signals from the skin.17 Topi - cal anesthetics are a well-established therapy for the mitigation of needle-related pain in individuals of all ages.

If not breastfeeding. Alternatively, if oral rotavirus vaccine is being administered at the same time as injectable vaccines, rotavirus vaccine can be given first as it contains sucrose. \u00a7See elsewhere in the table for a recommendation in this age group.Guidelines980 CMAJ, September 22, 2015, 187(13) stantial benefit of topical anesthetics on acute dis - tress (SMD -0.91, 95% CI -1.36 to -0.47).9 There is no evidence of an adverse effect of topical anes - thetics on the vaccine immune response.9 The pro - vision of topical anesthetics should be a standard preventive measure for children, who cannot advo - cate for themselves and are at risk of long-term harm from unmitigated pain due to the develop - ment of needle fears. The majority of children are afraid of needles and report a preference for anal - gesics to be used.2,18 Because topical anesthetics incur additional time and costs, their use requires some planning. In many cases, they can be accom - modated in usual clinic waiting times.19 Otherwise, they can be applied before clinic arrival. We recommend giving sucrose solution before vaccine injections in children two years and younger (strong recommendation; moderate confidence in estimates of effect). Children who are not breastfed during vaccine injections can be given sweet-tasting solutions. In the hospital setting, sweet-tasting solutions are an established treatment for pain. Their mechanism of action is not known, but may involve release of endogenous opioids and distraction. In a meta-anal - ysis including 2071 infants undergoing vaccination, the benefit of sucrose solution on infant distress was significant (SMD -0.76, 95% CI -1.19 to -0.34).9 The typical dose is 2 mL of a 24% to 50% strength solution administered about one to two minutes before injection; glucose can be used if sucrose is not available. This intervention requires additional resources for acquisition of commercially available preparations or manufacturing by clinicians or par - ents. Alternatively, for infants scheduled to receive oral rotavirus vaccine at the same time as injectable vaccines, rotavirus can be given first because it contains sucrose (as a flavouring agent), which obviates the need for sweet-tasting solutions.20 Process interventions (education and implementation) We recommend education of clinicians adminis - tering vaccine injections about pain manage - ment (strong recommendation; low confidence in estimates of effect). Clinicians administering vaccinations are required to be competent in vaccine administra - tion techniques, and this includes pain mitiga - tion. Clinician education increases the use of pain interventions during vaccination (SMD 0.66, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.85; n = 459).13 We recommend that parents be present during vac - cine injections in children 10 years and younger (strong recommendation; very low confidence in estimates of effect).Children show lower levels of distress when parents stay before vaccine injections than when parents leave (SMD -0.85, 95% CI 1.35 to -0.35; n = 67) and prefer to have their parents present.13 Family-centred health care promotes caregiver presence whenever possible.21 Because parents' behaviour can influence a child's level of distress, education of parents is recommended to facilitate child coping and to alleviate pain, fear and distress (see below). We recommend education of parents about pain management before the day of vaccination (strong recommendation; low confidence in esti - mates of effect). Parents want to learn about strategies for pain mitigation.2 Education of parents ahead of time increases use of pain interventions during vacci - nation (relative risk [RR] 2.08, 95% CI 1.51 to 2.86; n = 300).13 We recommend education of parents about pain management on the day of vaccination (strong recommendation; very low confidence in estimates of effect). Educating parents on the day of vaccination increases use of pain interventions during vacci - nation (RR 2.42, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.99; n = 239).13 Opportunities to learn ahead of time support planning and practice. We recommend education of children three years and older and adults about pain management on the day of vaccination (strong recommendation; very low confidence in estimates of effect). Individuals undergoing vaccination should be given information about what will happen (pro - cedural information), how it will feel (sensory information) and how to cope (training in strate - gies to mitigate pain and fear).22-24 Information should mostly be given in advance. At the time of the procedure, the focus should be on neutral information about the procedure and coping strategies rather than threatening sensory infor - mation that can increase fear. There is evidence that education reduces preprocedural fear in chil - dren undergoing vaccination (SMD -0.67, 95% CI -1.28 to -0.07; n = 51).13 Implementation No single intervention included in this guideline is expected to prevent all pain (i.e., achieve a level of pain of \"0\"). Individual interventions can be combined, as appropriate, to improve pain relief. For young and school-aged children, because of the high levels of distress with vac - cine injections and higher potential for long-term Guidelines CMAJ, September 22, 2015, 187(13) 981harm (i.e., development of needle fear and health care avoidance), a more comprehensive and con - sistent approach is recommended. With maturity, a more self-directed and individualized approach can be used. Pain mitigation is considered part of good vaccination clinical practice by the World Health Organization, which has accepted the most prac - tical interventions from this guideline for global implementation.25 All involved in vaccination programs need to identify and support clinician interest, willingness and ability to adopt these guideline recommendations to achieve best prac - tices. Additional resources (e.g., supplies, per - sonnel) may be required to educate and support clinicians, parents and individuals to implement these recommendations. Methods already used for education about vaccination (e.g., verbal instruction, pamphlets, videos) are effective for education about pain mitigation. Sample resources are currently avail - able from Immunize Canada (www.immunize. ca) and HELPinKids&Adults (http://phm. utoronto.ca/helpinkids). Training can occur across various different clinical (e.g., hospital, outpatient clinic) and educational (e.g., prenatal class, school) settings. Importantly, many pain mitigation interven - tions can be offered for little or no cost. Even for those with costs, the costs may be offset by avoiding the costs of subsequent harm from unmitigated pain and fear, including the negative impact on health outcomes due to vaccine hesi - tancy and noncompliance with other health care interventions, and the costs for treatment of nee - dle fears that have developed due to poorly man - aged pain. Performance metrics can include clini - cal indicators (e.g., pain intensity, fear intensity), process indicators (e.g., use of pain interventions, compliance with vaccination) and conceptual indicators (e.g., knowledge, satisfaction). Appen - dix 5 (available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/ doi:10.1503/cmaj.150391/-/DC1) and a global vaccine safety research network (https://brighton collaboration.org)26 offer some sample tools for assessing pain and related outcomes, and docu - menting pain interventions used. We plan to update the guideline in the next 5-10 years (2019-2024), depending on the avail - ability of new research evidence and project funding. Other guidelines The differences between the original 2010 guide - line6 and the current guideline are summarized in Appendix 6, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/ suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.150391/-/DC1.Gaps in knowledge The guideline recommendations are limited to the available evidence, and certain recommendations have more research support than others. There was a noticeable gap in research evidence for adolescent and adult populations, and mass vacci - nation settings, even though concerns about pain and fear are well documented and contribute to vaccine hesitancy. School-based vaccinations should be specifically targeted to facilitate more positive experiences with health care for children. Data are needed on the painfulness of differ - ent vaccines (including their route of administra - tion), aspects of vaccine injection technique (e.g., speed of injection and injection in a single limb for multiple vaccine injections), and vaccine for - mulations and delivery systems that minimize pain. Given the potential role of memory for pain and fear in subsequent experiences of pain,27 research is needed to examine the efficacy of interventions for memory reframing. Studies on the impact of pain interventions on future pain and vaccine compliance are also warranted to show the long-term impact of pain interventions. Conclusion Pain during vaccination is an important concern across the lifespan. This guideline provides rec - ommendations for interventions that can miti - gate vaccination pain. Many interventions are feasible across vaccination settings. The full- length guideline is available in Appendix 7, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi: 10.1503/cmaj .150391/-/DC1.
