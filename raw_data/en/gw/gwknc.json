That is exactly what Kasey Altman is doing. On her 24th birthday last July, the former college Division 1 volleyball player got word that she was being hired for her dream job \u2014 working for Google in New York City. Altman, who attended Scripps Ranch High School, was ecstatic. She had graduated from college, backpacked in several continents \u2014 Europe, Asia, Australia (and New Zealand), South America \u2014 and was prepped for another adventure. About four months into her dream job, she received another jolting call. The physically-fit, diet-conscious career woman was suffering from stage 4 cancer. Her diagnosis was especially worrisome because the stealthy predator in her body was a rare, invasive sarcoma that already had metastasized into her pelvic region and elsewhere. \"For awhile I was really resentful of this,\" Kasey said in a Google interview. \"To be diagnosed with cancer sent my world into a tailspin.\" Such devastating news would level most people. Instead, it set Kasey on a new creative path. First, she gathered her family around her. Her parents, retired Qualcomm V.P. Jeff Altman and entrepreneurial mom, Delsee, immediately packed up and relocated to New York City. They wanted to be with their daughter during her nine-month regimen of chemotherapy and proton therapy treatments at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Kasey's older sister and best friend, Karli, put her 9-to-5 email marketing job on hold and also moved temporarily to New York. There, Karli continued her second job as an [online influencer](https://www.instagram.com/karlialtman/) with a following of 385,000 on her [@GoodHumansOnly](https://www.instagram.com/goodhumansonly/) Instagram site, which dishes out positive vibes and self-help advice. One day, as Kasey shampooed her hair after a chemo treatment, the sisters began chatting about left turns in life. Suddenly, the idea dawned of starting a joint podcast focusing on incredible people whose lives are forced to take a sudden change of direction. That's when their Instagram podcast, [@the.reroute,](https://www.instagram.com/the.reroute/) was born. Each Wednesday they add a 30-to-60-minute episode to their Instagram page, which now includes 17 interviews and segments. They have talked to pro volleyball player Victoria Garrick, who became a mental health advocate; nurse practitioner-turned-YouTube-sensation Rita Onyx and Kevin Hines,who survived an attempted suicide from the Golden Gate Bridge. On June 9, they chatted with their parents, exploring how the Altmans had rerouted their lives in response to Kasey's diagnosis. \"Any parent's worst nightmare is to have their kid be diagnosed with cancer \u2014 or any type of illness,\" said her dad. \"As a parent, you would trade places with your kid in a second.\" Delsee has dedicated herself to searching for groundbreaking medical treatments for a cancer that strikes about 250 people each year in the United States. At the end of Kasey's nine months of chemotherapy, are there drugs already being used to treat other diseases that might be effective in warding off a recurrence of her cancer? Could a personalized vaccine be effective? Are there viable holistic treatments? The family's questions are many. As a result, Kasey signed up for a clinical trial coordinated by UC San Diego oncologist Ezra Cohen to harvest her own cancer cells to develop a vaccine therapy to build her immunity against this aggressive cancer. The immunotherapy trial will start a few weeks after her chemo. Kasey has read the depressing research. With her particular soft tissue sarcoma cancer, she learned there is an 80 percent chance of recurrence within five years. Because Kasey's is considered a pediatric cancer, little research exists on its occurrence in adults such as her. The Altmans have become proactive, turning to crowd sourcing. They have corralled an assortment of medical experts \u2014 oncologists, medical researchers, scientists, pathologists, bio informationists, drug company reps, cancer patients and others \u2014 to weigh in at weekly virtual information-sharing roundtable discussions of cancer diagnoses and treatment options. \"I'm on the same chemo regimen that's been administered for the last 20 to 40 years,\" Kasey says. \"I want to blow up convention and take ownership of my care because, from a statistical standpoint, the current system is not going to save me.\" The Altmans have a family history of proactively tackling medical issues. Kasey's uncle, Steve Altman, former president of Qualcomm, and his wife, Lisa, gave $10 million toward building the Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute at UCSD to foster innovative medical research. Delsee contacted Brad Power, a medical consultant based in Massachusetts, to create the series of cancer brainstorming sessions, referred to as a [hackathon](https://cancerhackerlab.com/). It is designed to examine complex cases where the standard of care is failing. Participants focus on applicable diagnostic and genetic tests and on treatment options, debating the pros and cons of each. They look for crossover drugs and treatments, new therapies and those currently in clinical trials \u2014 any therapy people don't have on their radar, Power says. The end result could be a new treatment approach or affirmation by experts that the current path is best. Kasey is hopeful about the upcoming personalized vaccine to boost her immunity. \"We're trying to make sure the cancer never comes back,\" she says. "}
