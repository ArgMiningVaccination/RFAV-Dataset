Smallpox vaccine took thousands of years Next major advances took hundreds of years Measles live attenuated vaccine took a decade The Human Genome project was key for the next major advance 5 Human Genome Project 3 Billion Dollars Over 200 Labs in USA 18 other countries Took 13 years (1990 -2003) Currently: Can decode entire human genome in 24 to 48 hours for less than $1k 6 Human: 6 Billion Bases Fruit Fly: 123 Million Bases E Coli: 5 Million Bases COVID: 30 Thousand BasesComparative Size of Genetic Databases 7 NOT A VIRUS!! mRNA codes for the target protein Can be used for infectious diseases and even cancer therapy Ultra rapid development process compared to prior vaccination technology 63 Days from SARS -CoV-2 genetic decoding to first human vaccine test injection Pandemic causes rapid exposure of treatment groupsMessenger RNA Vaccines 8 Pfizer -Biontech mRNA Vaccine Ultracold storage -80C: 6 months Refrigerator storage: 5 days Room Temperature: 6 Hours 44k Study Participants, Diverse background Zero safety concerns 95% Effective Both Antibody and T Cell Immunity Possibly 30M Doses by end of 2020 9 Pfizer / Biontech 10 1US data: HIV Surveillance Report, 2017 (most recent available) Vol. 29, Table 26 http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/surveillanc e/resources/reports/index.htmModerna mRNA Vaccine Normal Freezer storage: 6 months Refrigerator storage: 7 days (Maybe 30 days) Once opened: 6 Hours 30k Study Participants, Diverse background Zero safety concerns Greater than 94% Effective Both Antibody and T Cell Immunity Possibly 20M Doses by end of 2020 11 Vaccine Supplies Included? For centrally distributed vaccines, each kit will contain supplies to administer 100 doses of vaccine, including: Needles: 25G 1 -1.5 Inch 105 per kit Syringes: 1 to 3 mL 105 per kit Alcohol Prep Pads 210 per kit 4 Surgical Masks per kit 2 Face Shields per kit Gloves? 12 Astra Zeneca AZD1222 Vaccine: Chimpanzee Adenovirus Unable to replicate Genetically modified to carry the COVID -19 Spike Protein Early Results show both Antibody and T -Cell Immune Response May be ready for EUA early 2021 13 Johnson and Johnson Ad26 Single Shot Vaccine: Adenovirus Vector similar to AZ Unable to replicate Genetically modified to carry the COVID -19 Spike Protein Early Results show both Antibody and T -Cell Immune Response Plan to study 60,000 adults 18 years old and older May be ready for EUA early 2021 14 protein manmade nanoparticle vaccine No virus, no viral nuclear material, just purified viral spike protein Early studies showed both antibody and T cell immunity Phase 3 results won't be ready till 2021 Normal Refrigerator Storage 15 Two Shots -Same Flavor Most vaccine candidates require a 2 - shot series Second shot must be from same manufacturer Only J and J is single shot candidate16 Potential EMS Vaccination Strategies Drive Through and walk -up Sites Need a separate supervised waiting lot / area for 15 -minute post shot evaluation17 Mobile Vaccination Teams Can bring care to populations with limited access to healthcare system18 Long Term Care Facilities Mobile EMS Vaccination Teams can augment efforts to provide care to LTC's19 Rural Hub and spoke model Share resources among hospital and EMS agencies to expand capability for both 20 Hospital vaccination force multiplier Free up nurses for more critical care roles Expand capacity of Hospital Vaccination Program Can be used as part of Rural Spoke and Hub system21 What steps for EMS to take now Paramedics can provide immunizations per FL Statute 401.272 Contact your local County DOH EMS MD sign MOU with DOH Train Medics: CDC Videos Checklist of training and keep in records Develop Closed or Open POD "}
