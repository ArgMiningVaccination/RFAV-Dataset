We conducted a randomized, controlled, double-blind crossover trial with long-term follow-up to evaluatethe effectiveness of hyperbaric oxygen for refractory radiation proctitis. Methods and Materials: Patients with refractory radiation proctitis were randomized to hyperbaric oxygen at 2.0 atmospheres absolute (Group 1) or air at 1.1 atmospheres absolute (Group 2). The sham patients were subse- quently crossed to Group 1. All patients were re-evaluated by an investigator who was unaware of the treatmentallocation at 3 and 6 months and Years 1-5. The primary outcome measures were the late effects normal tissue- subjective, objective, management, analytic (SOMA-LENT) score and standardized clinical assessment. The secondary outcome was the change in quality of life. Results: Of 226 patients assessed, 150 were entered in the study and 120 were evaluable. After the initial allocation,the mean SOMA-LENT score improved in both groups. For Group 1, the mean was lower ( p= 0.0150) and the amount of improvement nearly twice as great (5.00 vs. 2.61, p= 0.0019). Similarly, Group 1 had a greater portion of responders per clinical assessment than did Group 2 (88.9% vs. 62.5%, respectively; p= 0.0009). Signicance improved when the data were analyzed from an intention to treat perspective ( p= 0.0006). Group 1 had a better result in the quality of life bowel bother subscale. These differences were abolished after the crossover. Conclusion: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy signicantly improved the healing responses in patients with refractoryradiation proctitis, generating an absolute risk reduction of 32% (number needed to treat of 3) between the groupsafter the initial allocation. Other medical management requirements were discontinued, and advanced interven- tions were largely avoided. Enhanced bowel-specic quality of life resulted. /C2112008 Elsevier Inc.

During the past decade, signicant develop- ments in the delivery of radiotherapy have improved the efcacy and tolerance (1). Despite such advances, adverse effects continue to complicate its use (2, 3) . These effects are commonly categorized as either acute effects, representing those that occur during or soon after radiotherapy completion, or late effects that manifest many months to several yearslater. Acute toxicity is usually mild, frequently self-limiting, and often responds to brief interruptions in radiotherapy (3-5) . Severe acute effects can lead to later excluded ones from ''consequential'' effects (6). Late toxicity is largely a function of the total radiation dose and fraction size and tends to be dose limiting in curative settings (7, 8) . The resulting injuries are frequently refractory to a wide range of therapeutic inter-ventions, can proceed to surgical removal of damaged organs, and are the cause of some mortality (2, 3, 9) . Late radiation proctitis is a particularly difcult condition to treat and for patients to live with (10-13) . The reported incidence varies from 4% to 22% (5, 14) , yet because of a fre- quent lack of recognition and insufcient long-term follow- up, its true incidence is unknown (14, 15) . No recommended standard treatment exists, and current management is oftenunsatisfactory (11, 16) . This shortcoming is readily apparent given the large number of medical and surgical therapies in common use ( Table 1 ). Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy has been used in the treatment of pelvic radiation injuries for several decades (Table 2 ) and has been reported to be benecial (16-18) .I thas not, however, been studied in a sufciently rigorous man- ner to determine its precise therapeutic effect. We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind trial with crossover and long-term follow-up to evaluate the effect ofHBO therapy for patients whose radiation proctitis had proven refractory to other interventions. METHODS AND MATERIALS Patients Patients from the Instituto Nacional de Cancerologica, Mexico City, Mexico, the University of Pretoria Medical Centre, Pretoria, Republic of South Africa, Department of Underwater and Hyper- baric Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine,Istanbul, Turkey, Wesley Medical Centre, Brisbane, Australia, and the Royal Hobart Hospital, Tasmania, Australia were enrolled in the trial. Each participating center's institutional review boardapproved the study protocol. Referring physicians agreed to partic- ipate as blinded assessors. The trial registration numbers were NCT00134628 and ISRCTN85456814. Patients were eligible for enrollment if they had undergone pelvic radiotherapy and had subsequently developed evidence of rectal late radiation tissue injury. The diagnosis had to have been present for $3 months and to not have responded sufciently to other therapies. Eligibility screening conrmed the absence of unacceptable patient- specic risks to HBO therapy. All patients or their surrogate provided written informed consent before enrollment. On patient en-rollment, the best supportive care was maintained. Before beginning treatment, patients were evaluated with the late effects normal tissue-subjective, objective, management, analytic(SOMA-LENT) scale, an anatomic-specic morbidity scoring sys-tem(19). It provides an ascending order of severity of radiation- induced complications. It is particularly well suited to multicenter trials, because of its standardized application, reproducibility, andaccuracy. A standardized clinical assessment was also included with both screening tools conducted by a physician unaware of the allocation. Patients also completed the Expanded ProstateCancer Index Composite (20) quality of life (QOL) instrument at this time and at every other follow-up stage. Randomization Biostatisticians at the University of South Carolina generated the randomization sequence, which was uploaded into, and concealed within, the study database software. The patients were randomly as- signed (1:1) to receive HBO or normobaric air, using a ''blocking''process. The block size was four and was equally stratied with two of each treatment options (A or B). The randomization sequence became available to the unblinded local principal investigator onlyon irretrievable entry of each patient's demographic information, medical history, and clinical characteristics. Group 1 (active treat- ment) was randomized to receive 2.0 atmospheres absolute (ATA)oxygen. Group 2 (sham) patients were randomized to receive 1.1ATA air. Treatment procedure Group 1 was treated with 100% oxygen at 2.0 ATA for 90 min, once daily, ve times weekly. Group 2 were treated with 21% oxygen (normal air) at 1.1 ATA, once daily, ve times weekly. For patient blinding purposes, Group 2 patients underwent a briefcompression to 1.34 ATA at the beginning of each treatment. Thechamber was then slowly decompressed from 1.34 to 1.1 ATA.Table 1. Late radiation proctitis treatment options (in neodymium:yttrium-aluminium-garnet (laser) (Nd:Y 3Al5O12).Hyperbaric oxygen treatment of radiation proctitis dR. E. C LARKE et al. 135Group 2 patients remained for the sum of the time taken to treat the Group 1 patients. Reassessment, after 30 treatment sessions, was undertaken by the referring physician, who remained unaware of the allocation. Ten additional treatment sessions were provided toselected patients, depending on the individualized responses.Patients repeated their QOL survey and were screened to determine the effectiveness of the blinding process. Unblinding took place at this point. Those who had been allocated to Group 1 were entered into follow-up, with repeat evaluations scheduled at intervals of 3 and 6 months and Years 1-5. For Group 2, all but 3 accepted crossoverto the active treatment arm. Data collection at inclusion Once a patient was enrolled, their local principal investigator collected the following data: age and gender; comprehensive medi- cal history; current medications and any history of tobacco use; cancer-related history, including tumor type, location, stage, andtreatment; and late radiation proctitis signs and symptoms, including treatment sessions to date. Statistical analysis The primary outcome was a change in the SOMA-LENT ( Fig. 1 ) score, a numeric variable measured at all periods. Four other numeric values were derived from a QOL survey completed by patients inconjunction with their clinical evaluations. From this survey, using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Bowel Domain, the Bowel Function and Bowel Bother subscales were obtained.Also obtained were the physical and mental results using the SF-12 General Health Function Survey. The SOMA-LENT score was analyzed using a repeated measures model containing patienttype, period, their interaction, and six covariates: gender, tobaccouse, external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy, intervalbetween radiotherapy and symptoms, interval between symptoms and treatment, and country of residence. A sixth, ordinal categorical outcome, was the clinical evaluation measured at all periods, except at initialization. The evaluationsmade immediately after completion of the initial treatment allocationand crossover were coded as healed, signicant improvement, mod- est improvement, or no improvement. For the remaining periods, they were coded as healed, improved, unchanged, or recurrence.For analysis purposes, these evaluations were dichotomized. After the initial treatment allocation and crossover, healed, signicant improvement, and modest improvement were collapsed into onecategory and no improvement and recurrence into the other. For the follow-up evaluations, healed and improved were collapsed into one category and no improvement and recurrence into the other.The outcomes were compared for the two patient types usingFisher's exact test and logistic regression analysis containing the same variables as the repeated measures model for SOMA-LENT. Additionally, a Jonckheere-Terpstra test for trend was used withthe original calculations. RESULTS A total of 226 patients were assessed for eligibility. Of these 226 patients, 76 were excluded and 150 enrolled. Of the 150 patients, 120 completed the protocol ( Fig. 2 ). At 1 year, 5 patients (4%) had died and 9 (8%) had been lost to follow-up. Descriptive statistics Data were available for 120 patients. The minimal follow- up period for all patients was 1 year (average, 2.09). Of the 120 patients, 106 (88.33%) were women, and 101 (84.17%)Table 2.

Radiation Oncology dBiology dPhysics Volume 72, Number 1, 2008reported never having smoked. Because of the small number of current ( n= 8) and former ( n= smokers, the tobacco var- iable was dichotomized into ever/never. Of the 120 patients, 11 (9.17%) were from Australia, 85 (70.83%) from Mexico,and 12 (10.00%) from both South Africa and Turkey. The baseline comparisons of the covariates for the two groups re- sulted in no signicant differences, indicating that the random-ization process had worked well. The patient demographics and clinical characteristics are detailed in Table 3 (appears on- line only at www.redjournal.org ). The mean SOMA-LENT values for the two patient types at each period are displayed inFig. 3 . The mean SOMA-LENT score decreased consider- ably between the initial value and completion of HBO therapy in Group 1, with a much smaller change in Group 2. For the latter group, however, a substantial decrease occurred aftercrossover, when they received HBO therapy. Numeric outcomes SOMA-LENT score. Adjusting for covariates, a signicant (p< 0.0001) decrease occurred in Group 1 of5.00 3.96-6.03), as well as a signicant 0.0001) decrease in Group 2 of 2.61 (95% condence interval, 1.51-3.70) after completion of the initial allocation. The decrease was greater in Group 1 than inGroup 2 ( p= 0.0019). At initialization, no the two groups ( p= 0.5597). However, after the initial allocation, Group 1 had signicantly ( p= 0.0150) lower average scores than Group 2, with an estimated differ- ence of 1.93 (95% condence interval, 0.38-3.48). After completion of the crossover, no differences were detected (p= 0.6594). The mean scores remained relatively stable through 1 year and showed a trend to additional and sustainedimprovement through Year 5. Clinical evaluation. The frequencies for clinical evalua- tions are given in Table 4 . The most notable result was after completion of the initial allocation, at which 56 (88.9%) of the 63 patients in Group 1 were assessed to have either healedor had some improvement, and 35 (62.5%) of the 56 patients in Group 2 were assessed to have had at least some improve- ment. Fisher's exact test ( p= 0.0009) and logistic regression Fig. 1.

C LARKE et al. 137analysis ( p= 0.0011) both indicated that Group 1 had a sig- nicantly greater proportion of healing/improvement at that time. For logistic regression analysis, the corresponding odds ratio was 5.93 (95% condence interval 2.04-17.24).From this, we estimated that Group 1 was about six times more likely to have an evaluation that indicated at least some type of improvement than was Group 2. Furthermore, the Jonckheere-Terpstra test for trend was signicant ( p= 0.0008), indicating that better outcomes were more common in Group1. On the basis of the clinical evaluation outcomes, an abso- lute risk reduction of 0.32 (32%) was generated, resulting in a number needed to treat of 3. From an intention to treat perspective, we considered what would have happened if (1)all those for whom we had no results had had improvement, (2)all those for whom we had no results had not had improvement, and (3)for each patient type, one-half of those for whom we had no results had improvement and one-half had not. In all cases, the results still indicated that Group 1 had a signicantly greaterproportion of improvement than did p= 0.0007, and p= 0.0036, respectively). Quality life. Marked improvement was noted in the bowel-specic QOL assessment for Group 1 after treatment but not for Group 2 (14% for Bowel Bother and 9% for Bowel Function vs. 5% and 6%, respectively). After cross- over, Group 2 showed notable improvement, with an increase to 13.6 for bowel bother and 10% for bowel function. Bothgroups showed additional improvement at 1 year. For the bowel bother subscale, a signicant improvement was seen between initialization and randomization in Group 1 (esti-mated change, 14.14; p= 0.0007, adjusting for covariates), but not in Group 2 (estimated change, 5.75; p= 0.1521). However, Group 2 experienced a signicant improvementafter crossover (estimated change, 14.27; p= 0.0002). The scores for both groups were stable or tended to improve further throughout follow-up. Similar trends were seen in the bowel function subscale. No differences were observed in the general well-being assessment.CONSORT Statement Assessed for eligibility (n= 226) Excluded (n= 76) Not meeting inclusion criteria (n= 34) Refused to participate (n= 13) Other reasons (n=29) Allocated to Group 1 (n= 75) Received allocated intervention (n= 64) Did not receive allocated intervention (n= 11) Reasons: 1 pt dropped out; socioeconomic reasons 4 pts underwent definitive surgery 2 pts lost before starting the study 1 pt suffered cerebrovascular incident 1 pt developed obstructive jaundice1 pt had lung metastasis 1 pt refused to start treatmentsAllocated to Group 2 (n= 75) Received allocated intervention (n= 56) Did not receive allocated intervention (n= 19) Reasons: 2 pts dropped out; socioeconomic reasons 6 pts underwent definitive surgery 6 pts lost before starting the study 3 pts had tumoral activity/recurrence 1 pt left the study due to continuous bleeding1 pt left the study due to extremely ill healthEnrollment = 150 1 year follow up (n = 105)120 pts completed randomization 3 month follow up (n = 103) 6 month follow up (n = 103) 2 year follow up (n = 61) 3 year follow up (n = 38) 4 year follow up (n = 29) 5 year follow up (n = 14) Fig. 2.

Radiation Oncology dBiology dPhysics Volume 72, Number 1, 2008Patient beliefs Of the 120 patients, 72 (33 in Group 1 and 39 in Group 2) were surveyed to determine which randomization allocation they had received. In Group 1, 20 said ''HBO,'' 1 said''sham,'' and 12 ''could not say.'' In Group 2, these numbers were 23, 2, and 14. A chi-square test detected no relationship (p= 0.9058) between the patient opinions and what they had actually received. When patients who ''could not say'' were ignored, a Kappa statistic was p= 0.0299, indicating essen- tially no agreement beyond chance. Harms Consistent with hyperbaric practice, ear pain/ear discom- fort (ear barotrauma) was the most common complaint. Ear barotrauma represents the clinical manifestation of an imbal- ance of pressure between the external and middle ear spaces.It is usually limited to the tympanic membrane, occasionally involves the middle ear, and only rarely involves the inner ear. Nineteen patients (15.8%) complained of ear pain ordiscomfort. The otologic examination was unremarkable in 11, 7 had tympanic membrane changes consistent with baro- trauma, and 1 had both tympanic membrane injury and mid- dle ear effusion. Decongestants were effective in 8 patients, 7 underwent ventilation tube placement, and 4 did not requiretreatment. One patient (0.8%) complained of sinus baro- trauma and was successfully treated with decongestants. Four patients (3.3%) experienced transient myopia. This is a poorly understood process and although thought to repre- sent an oxidative stress-induced temporary alteration in the shape of the lens (21), its exact mechanism remains obscure. Two patients (1.7%) complained of connement anxiety. One was treated with reassurance alone; the other required mild sedation. No cases of acute central nervous system ox- ygen toxicity occurred. None of these harms compromiseda patient's participation in the study, and all patients com- pleted their prescribed treatment course. DISCUSSION Radiation proctitis is a common unfortunate complication of pelvic radiotherapy (22). Its reported incidence ranges from 4% to 22% (5, 7, 14) and can reach 36% after combina- tion external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy (23). More severe forms, some of which are life-threatening, have been reported to range from 4.3% to 22% (14, 24) with resulting mortality rates of 2-8% (3, 7, 24) . Most late cases occur within 3 years of radiotherapy com- pletion, although latencies in excess of 10 years are not uncommon (14, 22) . The natural history of late radiation proctitis is unpredictable. Minor symptoms can resolve eitherspontaneously (4)or with conservative management (2, 25) . Other seemingly minor symptoms will prove refractory to standard care, resulting in disease progression despiteincreasingly aggressive interventions (24), and new forms of this complication can evolve (22). Minor complaints of pain and bleeding, therefore, cannot be characterized as harmless manifestations. Serious manifestations can necessi- tate high-risk surgery; high risk because tissues within the op-erative site might have been rendered hypoxic and poorly able to support oxygen-dependent wound repair. Ultimately, and having survived cancer, some patients will die of thesecomplications (3, 7, 24) . The clinical presentation can involve any combination of tenesmus, urgency, diarrhea, constipation, sphincter dys-function, mucoid or bloody discharge per rectum, frank bleed- ing, and ulceration, which can be localized, diffuse, or full thickness. The mucosa can appear granular, friable, edema- tous, and (Group 2)HBO only 1) * * * p=.0019 (61)3 year f/u (38) Fig. 3.

C LARKE et al. 139vasculature. Pain is common, ranging from occasional and minimal to refractory and excruciating. The histologic ndings can include microvascular compro- mise, endothelial of brin plugs (26). Submucosal brosis and obliteration of small blood vessels is additional evidence of late radiation injury. This process is usually progressive and irreversible. Com- puted tomography can demonstrate wall thickening, edema, ulcers, stricture, and stula (27). The medical treatment is not well dened and, in the absence of recommendations, management is often unsatis- factory (3, 8, 12, 22) . One should do everything possible to avoid disease progression, however, because abdominopelvicoperations (unavailable in the presence of perforation, obstruction, and stula) within or through irradiated tissues are fraught with complications (8, 28) . High failure rates with conventional treatment led to the use of HBO therapy. Its benecial effect, involving mandi- bular osteoradionecrosis, was rst reported in 1973 (29). Resulting pathologic evidence of a progressive andobliterative endarteritis in mandibular osteoradionecrosis contrasted sharply with earlier assumptions of an osteomye- litic-like process (30). The nding that HBO therapy induced angiogenesis, suggested a disease-modifying mechanism, incontrast to more conventional medical and surgical therapies directed at relief of symptoms (16, 17) . Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was rst reported to have efcacy in the treatment of late radiation proctitis in 1990 (31). Since then, numerous studies have been published (Table 2 ). In most instances, they represented small series or single case reports, did not use a specied toxicity scale, and lacked sufcient follow-up. However, the results from this accumulated work do suggest that HBO therapy is likely to be benecial (16, 18) . We used SOMA-LENT scoring as a primary outcome measure. This numeric evaluation of radiation morbidity is simple, widely applicable, reproducible, and provides an ascending order of severity (19). Given that several different physicians would evaluate outcomes in this multicenter study, such uniform scoring was considered essential. The radiation proctitis SOMA-LENT process scores symptomson a severity scale of 1-4 for each of ve possible symptoms and three related objective clinical signs. Six management options, scored in increasing complexity, represent the nal scoring element. The analytic measures used during the diag- nostic workup can be recorded but are not scored. Often, the outcome assessment is a function of clinical impression alone. This, however, opens evaluations to differ- ences in interpretation and has the potential for bias. We elec-ted to include this approach as a second primary outcome measure. Perhaps not surprisingly, the resulting percentage of clinical assessments determined as healed was lowerthan those reported in several previous studies. The specic- ity of the SOMA-LENT scale is such that an excellent healing response does not always result in a score of 0 (healed). A nal response score of 2-3 might reflect a patient who, on presentation had a score of 15 for ulceration, intense pain,and persistent bleeding, required treatment with narcotics, occasional transfusions, and steroids, and whose post-treat- ment status became one of diet modication, twice-dailystool frequency, and an occasional non-narcotic analgesic. The clinical impression of this case would be one of ''healed'' by many. In the present trial, however, the clinicalassessor also conducted each SOMA-LENT analysis. Recog- nizing that the score was not 0, the assessor might have been inclined to categorize the clinical outcome as something less than healed ( e.g., signicantly improved). The effect of HBO therapy, scored through the SOMA- LENT process, throughout the 5-year study period is shown inFig. 3 . Although the number of patients at Years 2-5 was 58%, 36%, 27%, and 13% of those at Year 1, respectively,a clear trend was seen toward continued and enduring healing. A patient's perception of how effective a particular treat- ment is now represents one important element of the modernapplication of evidence-based medicine (32). The QOL effect of eliminating pain, minimizing hemorrhage, and normaliz- ing stool frequency is obviously important. This effect wasTable 4.

In Group 2, bowel bother continued to improve, and bowl function stabi-lized at its 1 year value throughout the remainder of the study (Fig. 4 ). One nal observation of some importance was an associa- tion between failure to respond and a nding of local recur- rence or residual 6 month 1 year 5 year 4 year 3 year 2 yearSham to HBO (Group 2)HBO only 6 month 1 year 5 year 4 year 3 year 2 year Initial Post-rand.Sham to HBO (Group 2)HBO only (Group 1)a Mean 'Bowel Bother' Quality of Life Scores b Mean 'Bowel Function' Quality of Life Scores Fig. 4.

The SOMA-LENT scores in these patients had either remained elevated or improved, only to acutely deteriorate,by an average of 9 points (range, 4-17), by the time the recur- rence was diagnosed. In our study, approximately 45% of those patients without a treatment response were diagnosed with local recurrence. This nding argues for a measured approach to hyperbaric dosing. Ordering an initial hyperbaric course of more than40 sessions is inadvisable. If little or no subsequent improve- ment occurs, workup for cancer recurrence should occur be- fore any further hyperbaric treatments. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was well tolerated and its safety prole proved encouraging. These ndings are consis-tent with standard practice, with hyperbaric medicine consid- ered low risk. Predictably, no cases of oxygen toxicity developed. This was one of our study's safety goals, withthe resulting treatment pressure selection of 2.0 ATA. A patient's perception of how well, or otherwise, a specic therapy effects their daily living and overall QOL has only re-cently been recognized as an important outcome measure (32). In our study, patients considered HBO therapy to have an important positive effect on their QOL when mea- sured against their primary complaint. When numerous therapeutic options exist for a given con- dition, responsible resource expenditure assumes increasing importance. Although hyperbaric medicine's costs are not in- signicant, its employment has resulted in an overall loweringof a patient's total healthcare nancial burden (33, 34) . Much of this cost reduction is achieved by avoiding repeated hospi-talizations and surgeries, because greater disease resolution rates are effected. Such savings support a preference for dis- ease-modifying interventions rather than those directed at relief of symptoms. The immediate and enduring effect ofHBO therapy on the resolution or reduction in the degree of radiation proctitis would be expected to have a corresponding positive effect on the overall cost of care. Although we did notincorporate an economic analysis in this trial, several assump- tions can be made. First, because disease progression is not uncommon (2, 9) , avoiding it would be expected to result in a corresponding decrease in the healthcare costs necessary to manage advancing degrees of morbidity and the costs asso- ciated with management failure. Second, a reduction in dis- ease severity, or its resolution, likewise would reduce the subsequent costs. Using the example of the mean improve-ment in SOMA-LENT change at 1 year in our trial, an index patient's requirements would change from repeated rectal examinations, regularly administered narcotics, multipledaily antidiarrheal agents and steroid enemas to occasional antidiarrheal agents, diet modication, and perhaps a stool softener. The nancial implications related to this change inmedical management are readily calculable. CONCLUSION The results of our study have shown that the provision of HBO therapy for patients with chronic refractory radiation proctitis resulted in signicantly improved and enduringhealing responses and enhanced QOL. Our results support the role of HBO therapy for soft-tissue radionecrosis. REFERENCES 1. Duenas-Gonzalez A, Cetina L, Mariscal I, et al. Modern man- agement of locally advanced cervical carcinoma.
