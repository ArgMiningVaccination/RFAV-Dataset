I studied geomorphology, and my senior thesis was creating a scientific formula for calculating slope failure in the Santa Monica mountains. Upon graduation, I decided I had enough of city life. I moved to Montana and spent several years immersed in nature, as well as living in several other Rocky Mountain states to find my tribe and my home. While basking in nature in a quaint ghost town on the edge of a gold mine, I decided it was time to buy my land and create a self-sufficient homestead, which was a dream I had since I was 17. At that time I had envisioned living in a community growing food and living a life in balance with nature. I felt like the only way to do so was to move back to Los Angeles where I could get a good job and save up the resources to acquire a property. This is exactly what I did, after a brief stint in Las Vegas, the very antithesis of my calling. However southern Nevada is blessed with scenic nature, wildlife, amazing trails, and hot springs just on the other side of the Arizona border on the Colorado River. All of which helped to stoke the passion I had for the life I had envisioned. Upon moving back to California, I spent many years navigating corporate America before my spiritual awakening in the mid-2000s. Being a Geography student, I had access to the Atlas G.I.S. computer software that was coming online at the time. I spent many hours working in the computer lab. It was during this time I became fascinated by computers. Little did I know it planted seeds for my entrepreneurial spirit. From an early age, I loved to work for myself. I mowed lawns, looked after people's homes while they were on vacation, and even went door-to-door selling chocolate bars. These experiences shaped the way I view the world and gave me a strong independent identity, which helped shape the man I am today. I am a serial entrepreneur and am passionate about creating products and services that solve difficult issues and revolutionize industries. I've played the role of consultant, systems administrator, and network engineer, primarily in the financial sector. I also helped connect the infrastructure for internet access in high-rise buildings in Los Angeles and Orange Counties while still in my twenties. I learned on the job and was mostly self-taught from sheer curiosity. One of my biggest passions is teaching people the \"art of fruitful living\" or living a purposeful abundant life through sharing our gifts and abilities with the world. I am also well-versed in the healing arts and have helped many people find alternative strategies for issues mainstream medicine writes off as incurable. I began my journey into the healing arts by researching my health-related issues, as all the doctors could offer was pharmaceuticals and surgery. I knew there had to be another way. My search for remedies brought me to a substance called Ormus. Which changed my life forever. Ormus is not a medicine, but rather a subtle energy that according to some was the same as \"Chi\" in Traditional Chinese philosophy, or \"prana\" in the Ayurvedic tradition. I also learned about a farmer named David Hudson who discovered an anomalous white powder while preparing the ground for planting cotton. Before Facebook, there were Yahoo groups, and I found one such group whose topic of interest was Ormus. It was such a relief to find a community that had like-minded interests, and alternative viewpoints. I ended up soaking up the knowledge and became a speaker at all the conferences and events. During this time a remarkable, and generous man named Dennis William Hauck gave several of us access to the International Alchemy conference at the Los Angeles Convention Center where I learned about traditional alchemy and I found a school that offered instruction. I resonated with this historic craft straight away, which has culminated in a lifetime of study of this esoteric subject. I had the great fortune of studying traditional Alchemy or \"ParaChemistry\" (a reference to Paracelsus) with two of Dr. Riedel's students, Karl Lee and Robert Bartlett. Dr Riedel, also known as Frater Albertus, wrote several books on the topic and had a school called Paracelsus College, a laboratory called Paralab, as well as an apothecary in the 1970s. He was originally set up at AMORC in San Jose and represented a long German Rosicrucian lineage that dates back to the time of the alchemist Paracelsus in the 1500s. This ancient lineage teaches people how to tap into the mystical nature of our reality, and gives them the spiritual tools for self-actualization and personal development. I felt a deep connection to Dr. Riedel's story and felt called to support and continue the work he began so many years ago. I am one of very few practising this traditional art, whose comprehensive system is documented at the temple of Karnak in Egypt. I am passionate about my craft and serve as an educator, healer, researcher, and facilitator. In addition to teaching and demonstrating the practical application of these ancient technologies, my focus is on the health of people, and the health of the soil, which are not surprisingly both related to microbiology. I learned the importance of bacteria, fungi, and enzymes from Doug Beitler who was a dear friend and business partner. He was a true genius that could transform any landscape. He worked on some of the most difficult and cutting-edge projects, like growing food in the desert of Dubai. I honour his legacy and work with bioremediation, which lives on through me to this day. Aligned Purpose: After a string of disappointments, I had no other choice but to look inward. It was uncomfortable. I had always distracted myself with what modern society had to offer. All these distressing feelings I stuffed down over the years were coming to the surface. As a teenager, I struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts. I historically numbed these feelings with food, recreational drugs, and alcohol. I knew deep down these dependencies were not sustainable and I recognized there had to be a better way. Decades passed until I hit rock bottom. After which I spent years in the alchemical vessel learning about who I am and taking inventory of what I did and did not want to be a part of my identity, through a process of \"know thyself\" as the ancient Delphi Temple so famously inscribed. I discovered our eternal nature or essence that manifests in the physical as a consubstantial relationship between spirit, soul, and body. I felt called to apply these universal truths that are common throughout history as well as documented by early Greek metaphysicians in philosophies like Neoplatonism. After receiving such benefit from this insight I decided to transmit the knowledge to others. I assist people in becoming the best versions of themselves through honest introspection and by sincerely seeking truth. This process unlocks our human potential through self-realization and self-actualization. For the last 11 years, my focus of study and research has centred around subtle energies and metaphysics. These concepts can be seen in traditional Chinese, Ayurveda, and Western hermetic Alchemical lineages. I assist people to heal in a spiritual sense that culminates with up-levelling their body temple. I incorporate breathwork, self-actualization practices, exercise, minerals like shilajit, alchemical tinctures, traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic herbs, and a raw enzymatic, mineral-rich, plant-based diet. I teach people practical ways of incorporating the ancient alchemical technology of transformation into our daily lives. I also created several products for the health of people and plants that demonstrate the efficacy of some of the more exotic subtle energetic materials. The product offerings for human health are traditionally crafted spagyric tinctures and elixirs derived from plants, minerals, and metals. For plants, I offer a natural OMRI-compliant soil amendment which acts as a growth stimulator. I also offer classes and workshops on how to make these products and occasionally go on tour. You can find some of my offerings here: https://www.plantastichealth.com I also study aether physics, and the profound work of Nikola Tesla, and C.P. Steinmetz. I theorize this may have been the basis for the lost ancient technology of Atlantis. Elements of which can also be found in neo-platonic philosophy, and the Pali Canon. (Credit to Ken Wheeler for enlightening everyone about these concepts whose YouTube channel can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/@kathodosdotcom) The Aether is the same thing as \"the one thing\" from the ancient Emerald Tablets which is an enigmatic alchemical riddle on the true nature of reality for those initiated into the mysteries. Alchemy is a sacred science of the soul, a philosophy of nature, and a comprehensive system for health, that continues unabated to this day My mission in this regard is to provide access to the knowledge of this ancient wellness system, and the process of transfiguration, also known as liberation ontology or transmigration of the soul. I coach people into vibrant health through a two-step protocol: - Step 1 holistic wellness via hydration, breath, exercise, and proper elimination with raw living nutrition. - Step 2 Increase Ojas through substances derived from traditional Alchemy. Ojas is a substance found in every tissue in the human body to some varying degree. It is normally derived from the digestive process. Ojas means strength in the body. According to the Ayurvedic tradition, it is the purest substance in the universe. It is omnipresent, has purity in thought, positive feelings, and better immunity, and is one of the most important elements for maintaining and sustaining life.

These experiences enable people to awaken to their power by cultivating awareness, thereby steering the ship, or taking control of their body, mind and spirit. It is a process of refinement, self-realization and self-mastery, which includes all aspects of our lives. I integrate this content into workshops, festivals, retreats, elixir bars, ecstatic dance, as well other transformative experiences. I also curate a pop-up tonic & elixir bar that is an outreach to the ecstatic dance community and festival scene. It is the official invite into the mysteries and all things magical and mystical on this journey of self-actualization, and truth. I am an agriculture consultant and bio-remediation specialist who works with regenerative agriculture practices and specific biologicals for remediation to provide farmers and Agriculturists with the best tools for the incredibly important work they do feeding the world. I am constantly researching new methods to create healthy soils with seawater derivatives like Ormus which was popularized by Barry Carter, as well as elements of Korean Natural Farming, and traditional techniques like the terra preta that can be found in the Amazon. One of my other passions is rare fruit, and in the past have served on the board of California Rare Fruit Growers Orange county chapter. You can learn more about them here: https://crfg.org/ I love the concept of suburban fruit orchards or \"edible landscapes\" and their related infrastructure. I converted my suburban lot into a fruit tree oasis, and also led the effort for Leadership Orange's Pitcher Park renovation, with the project appearing on an episode of Huell Howser's Road Trip on PBS. You can watch here: https://youtu.be/yGlt6yviLt8?t=2037 It is my intention with this retreat to provide you with the tools necessary for living a satisfying purpose-driven life for whatever is in your heart by tapping into your gifts and providing a map of how and where to begin the hero's journey.

Thank You Amrita!!Starting from \u20ac2,354 - 24 Day 200 Hour Vinyasa Flow TTC in Goa, IndiaGoa, India4.6999999999999998 reviews I qualified as a yoga instructor 2 years ago with different school in Thailand and had an amazing experience. I've never had an intention to teach yoga, I just wanted to educate myself about yoga, learn the right way of doing asanas, get inspired and meet likeminded people. This year I've decided to do it again to refresh my memory, get back on track and to get new experience from different yoga school. Unfortunately I wasn't as lucky this time as the training with Nisarga and particularly with Hari the founder was not very good. I was drawn to Nisarga by its good marketing and professionally done website which promised me an extraordinary experience in my yoga journey. After just a couple of days of yoga practice and theory lessons I realised what I had signed up to . I had to withdraw myself from training as Hari's lessons and instructions were poor and unclear. He was completely inadequate. The quality of yoga and teaching were appalling. I'd like to pinpoint other faults, these include Hari's poor listening skills, lack of experience teaching yoga, disrespect, unpunctuality and his complete lack of teaching skills. There are lots of lies on website regarding his yoga background. There are also misleading information about some western female teacher and other teachers who we never met as all the training was delivered by Hari and his assistant, Ankit. I lost lots of money paying for this training, accommodation and the flight so consider that I was cheated and robbed. The man who is responsible for this is director of Nisarga Hari , who is a complete faker. Response from Nisarga: Dear Elena, We regret that you felt disappointed with our training. However, it's our understanding that we definitely do not deserve this highly critical review. Let us explain. The course was of 22-day duration and you left after completing only one and a half days. In such a short time of the introductory phase, you did not get even a glimpse of the course, and you made up your mind against us. The Yogic and universal wisdom says that if you want to learn, you need to become a student first and be ready to accept and not to expect. However, you already had certain expectations from the course, based on your prior experience with Yoga Teaching. Its good that you wanted to deepen your knowledge despite being already a qualified Yoga instructor, however, you came with an expectation, rather than acceptance. When you go with pre-defined expectations, your mind is bound to conflict with what is offered to you, because every teacher has his own style, his strong points, and weak points. Let us give you an example. As you are a massage therapist, let's assume you offer one hour massage. Now, imagine a customer comes to you and wants to gain the whole experience of massage in a quick massage of only one and a half minutes. Do you think, in such a short span of time, he will get a true insight into the quality of massage? We should understand that every process has a simple beginning, then a detailed procedure followed by a final ending. You stayed with us only for one and a half days, instead of 22 days. It takes 3-4 days to adjust to a new atmosphere, interact with the group and understand the group's energy. You did not go through that transition phase. As you already have teacher training experience, however, other students were beginners, the teacher has to satisfy students of all levels. Possibly, you should have gone for an advanced teacher training course, a 300-hour course. You also mentioned about lies on our website. We are doing authentic work and we do not need the support of fake experiences for promoting our work. Its an open world, the teachers keep on changing places, so, you might not find the same teachers who worked with us in the past. Also, we keep on shifting the teachers in our 3 different locations, India, Thailand, and Bali. However, we always ensure that our teachers are well qualified, authentic, dedicated and experienced. Also, as per our standard policy, we do not entertain refunds, however, we refunded you the amount you deserve. We have shared what we feel about your review. We certainly do not agree with it.\"Starting from \u20ac1,050 - 30 Day De-Addiction & Weight Loss Yoga Retreat in Himalaya, IndiaDharamshala, Himachal Pradesh, India4.11 reviews This was my very first yoga retreat, Location is very good in the mountains of Himachal with snow visible around, Tarun sir is very good at coaching Yoga, Overall it was the best time spent during my yoga retreat, Tarun sir & his wife were always calm & smile on face while serving food & services, they made it in a way to make me feel like I'm in my own house.
