And programs that claim to help you do just that through a \"detox\" or \"cleansing\" regimen remain popular, despite a marked lack of evidence that they actually work. \"The term 'detox' is chicer than ' [Brigitte Zeitlin, RD](https://bznutritionny.com/meet-brigitte-zeitlin/), owner of BZ Nutrition in New York City. \"It kind of implies a shorter-term solution, and quick results.\" Most plans are grounded in the idea that flushing toxins out of your system, often through a liquid-only diet with plenty of water, and giving your digestive system a break from its regular role can bring about miraculous results, from weight loss to more energy to glowing skin. The only problem, experts say: There is zero evidence to support any of that. What Are Detoxes and Cleanses, and How Did They Get So Popular? The modern detox movement grew out of largely naturopathic origins. After all, until the last decade or so, detoxing was medical jargon for treating serious conditions, such as alcohol poisoning or kidney failure. But in homeopathic circles, the idea of purifying the body and flushing out toxins took root and grew alongside the movement to \"eat clean.\" Most cleanses claim that unspecified toxins \u2014 from nonorganic foods, environmental pollution, and other chemical contaminants \u2014 are wreaking havoc on our bodies, taxing our digestive systems, and leading to weight gain and serious ailments. They promise to cure these ills by a designated period of fasting or restricting solid foods or certain kinds of foods (alcohol, sugar, [gluten](/gluten/guide/), or dairy), often supplementing juices or other drinks as a source of vitamins and minimal calories. Drinking lots of water is also a key component in many popular cleanses and detoxes. The terms \"detox\" and \"cleanse\" are mostly used interchangeably, and most plans fall into one of three major categories: those that replace solid food with liquid sustenance (juices, smoothies, or soups, sometimes with herbal supplements thrown in); those that claim to support your body's natural detoxification systems by supplying nutrients that boost liver and kidney function; and those that focus on cleansing your [digestive system](//www.everydayhealth.com/digestive-health/tips-for-better-digestive-health/) from the opposite end, the colon. What Scientific Research and Experts Say About These Diet Programs Nutrition experts don't buy into the idea that we need any additional help eliminating toxic substances. \"Our bodies naturally detox themselves every single day,\" says [Keri Gans, RDN](https://kerigansny.com/about/), owner of Keri Gans Nutrition in New York City and author of The Small Change Diet. \"That's why we have a liver and kidneys.\" In other words, every time you pee, poop, or sweat your butt off at the gym, you're getting rid of waste products that could otherwise harm your body. Not to mention, no randomized controlled trials \u2014 the gold standard for scientific research \u2014 have ever found that giving your gastrointestinal (GI) system a break from digesting food is beneficial in any way. Gans believes that one of the reasons detoxes and cleanses may have gained so much traction is they do help people feel better initially, particularly if they were eating a diet rich in processed or packaged foods to begin with. \"More energy is one of the big claims these diets make,\" she says, \"and if you've been eating a traditional Westernized diet, one with lots of sugar and processed food, then cutting all that out will make you feel less lethargic \u2014 at first.\" But after two or three days, she says, surviving on so few calories and little to no protein or healthy fat takes a toll, and people complain of fatigue. Maybe the best thing that can be said about cleanses is they're a good psychological tool for helping to cut back or eliminate unhealthy components of your diet, like [sugar](//www.everydayhealth.com/pictures/high-sugar-foods-youre-probably-eating-every-day/) or alcohol. \"Don't think of it as a long-term plan,\" says Zeitlin. \"If you're dead set on doing a cleanse, keep it short, like maybe two to three days before your best friend's wedding or another big event, and be aware of the risks. Yes, you're going to lose weight quickly because you're restricting calories. But as soon as you go back to eating normally, you will gain it all back \u2014 and possibly more.\" Still interested in checking out a cleanse? We broke down the three major categories and had experts weigh in with specifics on each \u2014 read on to learn more. What Experts Think About Liquid Cleanses for Weight Loss There was a time when juice was considered a kids' drink \u2014 and not a very healthy one, at that. That was before companies like [Pressed](https://pressed.com/) made cold-pressed a household term. On a juice cleanse, only the extract squeezed from fruits and vegetables is consumed for anywhere from one day to two weeks. Many come prepackaged and delivered to your doorstep, sold by companies that claim that juice provides all the nutrition you need while keeping your digestive system from being taxed. While one study found that fresh juices did contain even higher amounts of the immune-boosting antioxidant [vitamin C](/diet-nutrition/vitamin-c/) than blended drinks made with the whole fruits, in most other nutritional categories, juices fall short. ( [1](https://pdf.medrang.co.kr/paper/pdf/PNF/2014/019/PNF019-02-07.pdf)) \"A lot of times, juices will propose to have a lot of vitamins or minerals in them,\" says Gans. \"But it's not enough to sustain an individual long term. Most of them lack in protein, [fiber](//www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/fiber-benefits-food-sources-supplements-side-effects/), fat, and calories.\" Those are all nutrients that trigger satiety, and therefore help prevent overeating and weight gain. \"It is extremely difficult for the average person to meet his or her nutritional needs in less than 1,200 calories a day,\" Gans continues. \"Most juice cleanses are 800 calories or fewer.\" Additionally, even juices without added sugar tend to be high on the glycemic index, which means your blood glucose levels will spike and then fall dramatically after consuming them, particularly without other food in your stomach to blunt this effect. That can lead to hunger and fatigue. Also, says Gans, \"If you're on them too long, you'll be missing out on important nutrients, which can put you at risk for malnutrition. Smoothie- or soup-based cleanses, which often incorporate more protein and fiber from whole blended fruits, nuts or nut butter, or protein powder, are a somewhat better option than juice only, but again, Gans says, they're not \"a sustainable way to eat for any length of time.\" Other popular liquid cleanses use brewed tea, [apple cider vinegar](/diet-nutrition/diet/apple-cider-vinegar-nutrition-facts-health-benefits-risks-more/), or lemon water as their main supposed detoxifying ingredient. And while some research has linked those foods to potential health benefits, none is a magic bullet on its own. ( [2](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/bbb/73/8/73_90231/_pdf)) In fact, pros say, there's only one liquid you really need to flush toxins out of your system: water. What About Liver Cleanses? Is This a Legitimate Way to Lose Weight? A newer and more encouraging trend in detoxing is the movement toward foods that support the body's natural defenses against harmful substances. As previously mentioned, science suggests benefits of things such as apple cider vinegar, [green tea](//www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/green-tea-nutrition-health-benefits-side-effects/), and lemon water. Some detox programs focus on incorporating these ingredients to boost liver and kidney function and improve the removal of toxic substances. While there is no hard scientific data to back up those claims, there's plenty of research on certain foods that may promote liver health and can be added to a healthy diet without risk. \"A quality, plant-based diet will always help promote your body's natural detox system,\" says [Ashley Koff, RD](https://thebetternutritionprogram.com/about/), founder Better Nutrition Program. \"Some of my detoxifying faves are whole grains \u2014 that's right, you don't have to be gluten-free to detox! \u2014 peanuts, seeds like hemp, sesame, and sunflower, [avocado](//www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/avocados-health-benefits-nutrition-facts-weight-loss-info-more/), [banana](//www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/bananas-nutrition-facts-health-benefits-recipes-risks/), spinach, and all greens.\" Your body also needs certain nutrients from foods to eliminate toxic chemicals, Koff says, including those found in broccoli, sesame seeds, seaweed, shallots, leeks, [garlic](/drugs/garlic) and are have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiseptic properties that might help to enhance your body's detoxification organs\" \u2014 aka your liver and kidneys \u2014 says [Bonnie Taub-Dix, RDN](https://bonnietaubdix.com/about/), author of Read It Before You Eat It. Some of these foods include [turmeric](//www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/turmeric-curcumin-benefits-side-effects-types-more/), parsley, fish, and garlic, Taub-Dix says. But while the jury's still out on exactly how much of them we need to eat in order to reap those benefits, she stresses that the key is consuming a variety of these foods on a daily basis, not just seeking out detox foods following an indulgent holiday party. \"If eating these foods makes you feel 'cleansed,' then they may be providing a benefit in helping you to make other good choices, too,\" she says. But one thing to keep in mind: These foods don't have to be consumed in traditional \"cleanse\" style to have their intended effect. Anyone can add them to their current diet. Again, don't expect a cure-all. What Research Suggests About the Benefits and Risks of Colon Cleanses Some detoxes target the other end of your digestive tract with products and supplements that claim to cleanse the colon by promoting bowel movements. They often identify \"waste buildup\" as a problem, though there's no evidence to suggest this is true. In fact, research has suggested the opposite, including one study that found colon cleansing could actually have detrimental health effects. ( [3](https://e-lactancia.org/media/papers/ColonLimpieza-FamPrac2011.pdf)) \"These products usually contain [laxative](/laxatives/guide/) ingredients, including [senna](/drugs/senokot), which sometimes is habit forming,\" says [Lisa Jones, RD](https://lisajoneslive.com/), who has a private practice in Brookhaven, Pennsylvania. \"Overuse can harm the colon and permanently change the digestive tract.\" Documented risks can include nausea, diarrhea, [dehydration](/news/unusual-signs-of-dehydration/), [constipation](/constipation/guide/), and even kidney and liver failure. Perhaps more significant, constantly flushing out the colon can remove the healthy bacteria that thrive there. Recent research has linked the bacteria in your GI tract to a whole host of health benefits. \"Our body has an immune system, and the majority is in our guts,\" says Zeitlin. It's definitely best to avoid colon cleansing. The Takeaway: Should You Try a Detox or Cleanse to Lose Weight? It's possible to do a cleanse safely if you follow the guidelines recommended by experts \u2014 but keep in mind that a few days of bottled beverages isn't going to magically cure your health issues or make you 10 pounds lighter. First, pick a reasonable timeframe for your cleanse \u2014 no more than three days. Make sure you're hydrating properly throughout the duration of it, and eat if you feel faint or [nauseous](/nausea/guide/). Beware any plan that restricts major food groups or promotes a singular food. It's a good idea to get your physician's approval as well, says Jones. A healthier way to think about resetting yourself \u2014 regardless of your motivation \u2014 is to lose the restrictive mindset and instead focus on foods you can add to your diet for their nutritional benefits, says Zeitlin. Incorporating fresh veggies like [broccoli](//www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/broccoli-nutrition-health-benefits-how-prepare-it-more/) and spinach into your diet has proven benefits to help your body run properly \u2014 including ridding itself of waste products.
