Timing of routine immunisations and subsequent hay fever risk Abstract Background: Suggestions that immunisation influences allergic disease risk, either positively (pertussis) or negatively (BCG) are of concern for vaccination policy. Aims: To determine whether DTP, MMR, and BCG vaccination in infancy influenced hay fever risk. Methods: Case-control study of 7098 hay fever cases and controls, within two primary care databases. One control per case was matched for practice, age, and sex. Odds ratios (OR) were derived using conditional logistic regression. Results: Compared to those completing in month 5 (base group) (39.3%), DTP unvaccinated children (4.3%) had a similar risk of hay fever (OR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.23). However, those completing after 12 months (4.2%) had a reduced risk (OR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.76) compared to the base group. Compared to those vaccinated in month 14 (base group) (29.5%), MMR unvaccinated children (2.3%) had an OR of 0.79 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.08). Completion of MMR after two years was associated with reduced hay fever risk (OR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.80) compared to the base group. The effects of late immunisation with DTP and MMR were independent. Those vaccinated with BCG by age 2 (2.4%) had an odds ratio of 1.28 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.70). Adjustment for consulting behaviour, social factors, or sibship size did not alter these associations. Conclusions: Immunisation against DTP or MMR does not increase the risk of hay fever. The lower confidence limit for BCG vaccination contradicts the hypothesised protective effect. The reduced risk of hay fever among children immunised late may be explained by a third factor causing both postponement and reduced risk such as intercurrent febrile illnesses Link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15908618 Citation: Bremner, S.

Effects of Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis or Tetanus Vaccination on Allergies and Allergy-Related Respiratory Symptoms Among Children and Adolescents in the United States Abstract Background: Findings from animal and human studies confirm that diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis (DTP) and tetanus vaccinations induce allergic responses; associations between childhood vaccinations and subsequent allergies have been reported recently. Objective: The association of DTP or tetanus vaccination with allergies and allergy-related respiratory symptoms among children and adolescents in the United States was assessed. Methods: Data were used from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey on infants aged 2 months through adolescents aged 16 years. DTP or tetanus vaccination, lifetime allergy history, and allergy symptoms in the past 12 months were based on parental or guardian recall. Logistic regression modeling was performed to estimate the effects of DTP or tetanus vaccination on each allergy. Results: The odds of having a history of asthma was twice as great among vaccinated subjects than among unvaccinated subjects (adjusted odds ratio, 2.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.59 to 6.74). The odds of having had any allergy-related respiratory symptom in the past 12 months was 63% greater among vaccinated subjects than unvaccinated subjects (adjusted odds ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.05 to 2.54). The associations between vaccination and subsequent allergies and symptoms were greatest among children aged 5 through 10 years. Conclusions: DTP or tetanus vaccination appears to increase the risk of allergies and related respiratory symptoms in children and adolescents. Although it is unlikely that these results are entirely because of any sources of bias, the small number of unvaccinated subjects and the study design limit our ability to make firm causal inferences about the true magnitude of effect.

Delay in diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus vaccination is associated with a reduced risk of childhood asthma Abstract \"Background: Early childhood immunizations have been viewed as promoters of asthma development by stimulating a TH2-type immune response or decreasing microbial pressure, which shifts the balance between TH1 and TH2 immunity. Objective: Differing time schedules for childhood immunizations may explain the discrepant findings of an association with asthma reported in observational studies. This research was undertaken to determine whether timing of diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus (DPT) immunization has an effect on the development of childhood asthma by age 7 years. Methods: This was a retrospective longitudinal study of a cohort of children born in Manitoba in 1995. The complete immunization and health care records of cohort children from birth until age 7 years were available for analysis. The adjusted odds ratio for asthma at age 7 years according to timing of DPT immunization was computed from multivariable logistic regression. Results: Among 11, 531 children who received at least 4 doses of DPT, the risk of asthma was reduced to \u00bd in children whose first dose of DPT was delayed by more than 2 months. The likelihood of asthma in children with delays in all 3 doses was 0.39 (95% CI, 0.18-0.86).

Chickenpox in childhood is associated decreased atopic disorders, IgE, sensitization, varicella zoster infection (WTVZV) up to 8 yr of age has been shown to protect against atopic dermatitis (AD) and asthma. We sought to determine whether WTVZV in childhood protects against atopic disorders, allergic sensitization or decreases serum Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, practice-based study of outpatient pediatric practices in NY. One hundred children with WTVZV up to 8 yr of age and 323 children who received varicella vaccine (VV) were randomly selected. Results: WTVZV up to 8 yr of age is associated with decreased odds of subsequent asthma (exact logistic regression; OR = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.03-0.57, p = 0.003), allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (OR = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.05-0.49, p = 0.0003), and AD (OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.33-0.96, p = 0.02), but not food allergies (p = 0.78); decreased total serum IgE levels signifi- cant at all time intervals after WTVZV (10) compared with VV (p = 0.003-0.03). WTVZV was associated with decreased allergic sensitization (logistic regression, OR = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.03-0.38, p = 0.0004). WTVZV is also associated with persistently decreased numbers of peripheral blood lymphocytes (p < 0.0001) for up to 12 yr (p = 0.0003-0.047), monocytes (p = 0.002) for up to 16 yr (p < 0.001) and basophils at ages 4-6, 10-12, and 14-16 (p < 0.03).

Atopy in children of families with an anthroposophic lifestyle. Abstract Background Increased prevalence of atopic disorders in children may be associated with changes in types of childhood infections, vaccination programmes, and intestinal microflora. People who follow an anthroposophic way of life use antibiotics restrictively, have few vaccinations, and their diet usually contains live lactobacilli, which may affect the intestinal microflora. We aimed to study the prevalence of atopy in children from anthroposophic families and the influence of an anthroposophic lifestyle on atopy prevalence. Methods In a cross-sectional study, 295 children aged 5-13 years at two anthroposophic (Steiner) schools near Stockholm, Sweden, were compared with 380 children of the same age at two neighbouring schools in terms of history of atopic and infectious diseases, use of antibiotics and vaccinations, and social and environmental variables. Skin-prick tests were done for 13 common allergens, and we took blood samples from children and their parents for analysis of allergen-specific serum IgE-antibodies. Findings At the Steiner schools, 52% of the children had had antibiotics in the past, compared with 90% in the control schools. 18% and 93% of children, respectively, had had combined immunisation against measles, mumps, and rubella, and 61% of the children at the Steiner schools had had measles. Fermented vegetables, containing live lactobacilli, were consumed by 63% of the children at Steiner schools, compared with 4\u00b75% at the control schools. Skin-prick tests and blood tests showed that the children from Steiner schools had lower prevalence of atopy than controls (odds ratio 0\u00b762 [95% CI 0\u00b743-0\u00b791]). There was an inverse relation between the number of characteristic features of an anthroposophic lifestyle and risk of atopy (p for trend=0\u00b701).

In a previous Swedish study, Steiner school children (who often have an anthroposophic lifestyle) showed a reduced risk of atopy, but specific protective factors could not be identified. Objective: To investigate factors that may contribute to the lower risk of allergy among Steiner school children.
