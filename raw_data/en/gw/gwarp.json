While all headaches have a commona lity, pain in the head, the various dimensions of the pai n, and the associated suffering and disability vary. Over the last century, there has been increasing knowledge about the physiology of headaches, with different classifications. However, these explanat ions often fall short and are constantly being modified. For example, for many years, it was thought that migraine was caused by problems with the blood vessels in the brain; however that has been disproven and now it is believed to be due to problems with a certain region of the brain itself, similar to the mechanism of epilepsy. While conventional medications can bring on effective relief, they often have significant limitations and associated toxicity. The holistic approach to headache is the last resort for some; for others the first; and often can find and remedy root causes. There are several dimensions of headache that need to be specified in order to establish a diagnosis and monitor response to treatment. The first dimension is the intensity of the pain. This is usually quantified on a pain scale of 0 to 100. The next dimension is the degree of suffering\u2014i.e. how disabling the pain is. While pain is the sensory experience, the suffering is the emotional and functional consequence of the pain. Some pains are very intense, such as childbirth, but because the context is positive (i.e. time-limited, associated with the delivery of a child and the end of the discomfort of pregnancy), the suffering is usually moderate. One sibling hitting another can cause little real pain but lots of suffering, especially when perceived as being unfair or abusive. The third dimension is the newness of the pain\u2014i.e . is it a new pain or a recurrent pain. A new moderate pain may have more significance than a severe recurrent pain that already has been medically evaluated. The fourth dimension is the frequency of the pain\u2014how often it occurs. The fifth is the duration of the pain, whe n it comes, as well as overall temporal pattern. The sixth is the variability of the pain\u2014how much it varies in the t iming, location, and other qualities. The seventh is exac erbating factors\u2014what makes it worse. The eighth is relievi ng factors\u2014what makes it better and how much. The nin th is associated factors, such as a specific environment or food. Logging these dimensions on a weekly and monthly basis sometimes reveals a pattern. Often there is more than one pattern or pain that may have not been apparent prior to tracking. Based on these nine dimensions, as well as other historical information, laboratory studies and phys ical exam, a physician will classify a headache into one of several types. A main diagnostic sub typing is whet her the headache is secondary (caused by something else) or primary (no cause found). While occasionally a rev ersible cause is identified, such as Lyme disease, a cause usually is not found and treatment is based on \"management\" of symptoms. Certain patterns of headache, such as migraine, will guide treatment, such as the use of specific types of medications. Other times, the classification doesn't help much (see prior article entitled \"Fallacy of Diagnosis\"). . Holistic Evaluation In holistic medicine there is a separation of \"triggers\" from the headache itself. Very often the headache is perceived as being random, or has some variability that is not understood. However, any variability is a clue, and is monitored until a pattern, or a series of patterns emerges. Often the headache is multi-factorial, like a web, with not a single factor, but a constellation of factors that determine the onset, intensity, duration and response. Most patients, with the help of a practitioner, can identify such factors and patterns. The holistic evaluation of headache is extensive. Food and sleep diaries, relationships, job, environment, and many other factors are explored in detail. Exploration of history often goes back to childhood and to the family lineage. It is practical to think of the triggers/causes of headache in three interactive areas. The first is nutritional deficiency. Most of the population is deficient in magnesium and vitamin D. Other common deficiencies include vitam in B12, omega-3 fatty acids (fish oils) and sleep. An y of these deficiencies, and others, can be a trigger or cause of headaches. The next region of the interactive web is toxiciti es. The most common are lead, mercury, yeast toxicity, toxicity from foods and environment, and allergies to food a nd environment. The main difference between toxicity and allergy is that in toxicity, the magnitude of the p roblem is proportional to the amount of toxin. In allergy, t here can be a reaction to a single molecule of a substance; wit h a very different biochemical process than with toxins. The third region of the causal web is stress. It is helpful to think of stress as of two types: physiol ogical and psycho-spiritual. The physiological type has been already 7/10/10-1 head_aa.doc Headaches M. Cheikin MD Page 2 discussed and consists of deficiency and toxicity. The psycho-spiritual type is related to life stress. T his can include relationships, health of self and family, e conomic and social/community (including wars, hurricanes an d oil spills). Stress causes a host of physiological ch anges to the hormonal, neurotransmitter and immune systems that can easily trigger or perpetuate headaches. Many people who have had prior treatment failures have multiple deficiencies, toxins and allergies, a nd stressors. Each synergizes with the other. Many o f the biochemical, metabolic and physiological tests nece ssary to identify factors are \"covered\" by health insurance; some are not. The most important \"alternative\" tests are fo r heavy metal toxicity, yeast and parasites, hormonal imbal ance and in some cases food allergy. The cost of these test s is often recouped with reduction of medications, physician v isits, productivity and quality of life. Holistic Treatment Improving headaches at a root-cause level requires a multi-dimensional approach. Often there are import ant changes in lifestyle, which includes improved sleep hygiene (more consistent and quality sleep), regular stress reduction with a classic (not gym) yoga class, gentle walks, and other restorative activities. There needs to be a balanc e between work and play. These are not optional in most case s where a patient is seeking optimal results. Lifestyle changes also often include changes in nutrition, with the reduction of pro-inflammatory, highly processed conventional foods. At the least, all ar tificial sugars, MSG, high-fructose corn syrup and food dyes should be removed. Alcohol and caffeine should be reduced, or temporarily eliminated. Conventional h ighly- pesticide laden produce, such as apples, peaches, c elery, etc (see references) must be completely eliminated. Elimination of dairy, other animal products, gluten , soy, or corn in some cases can enable a dramatic reduction in frequency and intensity of headaches. Sometime, mor e formal and multi-phase elimination and detoxificati on programs are required. When lab tests demonstrate specific deficiencies o r toxicities appropriate supplementation, detoxificat ion, and treatment of offending organisms are important. He adaches often respond to supplementation with magnesium, vi tamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin D, vitamin B12, and fish o ils. Traditional herbals such as feverfew and butterbur are worthy of trial. Repeat testing is important to me asure the magnitude and rate of response to interventions, si nce simply taking supplements or \"doing a detox\" for a few months may not solve some underlying deficiencies o r toxicities. Often there are surprises. For example , after clearing a parasite, a bacterial imbalance might oc cur. Or after detoxification of lead, mercury begins to cle ar. Some people hold energetic traces of past physical injuries, emotional traumas, and sometimes more obs cure familial \"karmic\" traces in their bodies, which can include the muscles, joints, acupuncture meridians or yogic chakras. Working in the psycho-spiritual-energetic plane, though esoteric, may be essential for continued hea ling in such a situation. This plane can be approached by yoga practice, acupuncture, EMDR, Reiki, and other mind- body- energy techniques. An organized multi-dimensional approach using the best of conventional and holistic medicine can ofte n improve the quality of life for those who suffer fr om headaches, even if present for decades.
