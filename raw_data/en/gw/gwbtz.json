Whether you want your special day to be intimate with a couple of witnesses or a large formal affair, I want to work with you to create a ceremony that reflects your love story. To bring to fruition the heart words and the sacred space you imagined when you and your beloved decided you wanted to spend the rest of your lives together. We will work together on all the elements of the ceremony from writing personalized vows, if you choose, to integrating any unity rituals to reflect your belief systems be they secular or religious. Pregnancy Blessing/ Baby Blessing Ceremony- Bringing life forth is such a special time in people's lives. It inspires excitement,fear, profound happiness, and the mystery of the unknown. Hosting a Pregnancy Blessing for someone close to you is an incredible experience. This can be an alternative or addition to a baby shower, which typically focuses on things for the baby, whereas the Pregnancy Blessing focuses on the emotional and spiritual needs of the beloved carrying life inside of them. The Pregnancy Blessing encourages those closest to surround the parent to be, creating a circle of loving energy they will keep throughout the rest of their pregnancy and into the birth experience.This is also a wonderful way to support a parent who will be adopting her child or has a surrogate by being held in and supported on their journey to parenthood. An intimate setting is created where rituals like burning blessing herbs, candles, incense, and essential oils will leave physical lasting memories of the event. During the ceremony you will be guided to create a sacred art piece steeped in the blessings to help bring that energy to the birthing place or the baby's room. Mother Blessing and Baby Blessing ceremony can include the honoring of not only the mother, but also the father or the two mamas and two papas of same sex families and any single parent. You can choose to have a Baby Blessing with or without your partner present. It is also important to know that Baby Blessings can be for any family having their first child or eighth; through pregnancy, surrogacy or adoption. This experience is inclusive of people from every faith, spiritual background and wisdom tradition. Coming of Age Ceremony- A coming of age ceremony is a time to celebrate transition from childhood to young adulthood. Some families may choose to have a small ceremony to honor a young girls first moon cycle, a transition to the teen years, or as an alternative to a Quincea\u00f1ero or Sweet 16. It can be a small indoor or outdoor ceremony or it can be the beginning part to a larger celebration. This is a very special time in a young person's life to receive the love, support, and wisdom from their family and community. To pass down lessons, stories, family heirlooms, and stories to prepare them for the next life stage. It is also important to include the young person in the planning process, this allows them to express what they need from their community, that their special day is representative of who they are, but also think about how they want others to see them.This experience is inclusive of people from every faith, spiritual background, and wisdom tradition. Healing Rituals Ancestral Healing Ceremony- (This ceremony can be offered individually or as a group) In a 3 part ritual we will work together in the tradition of the Q'ero lineage of Peru to clear the imprint of heavy ancestral energies from our maternal and paternal lineages. In this ceremony we offer prayers on behalf of the highest good of ourselves and our ancestors, we set the intention to heal disempowerment, physical or sexual abuse, addictions, generational trauma, disease, etc. We work on behalf of families through the DNA of the participant with the intention of bringing healing to the 7 Generations before them and breaking karmic cycles that will impact the 7 generations after. Despacho Ceremony- (This ceremony can be offered individually or as a group) This ceremony is perfect for honoring transitions such as birthdays, weddings, memorials. This is also as an intentional offering to bring things into Ayni, in right relationship or balance, to restore the flow of reciprocity with the natural world. A despacho is similar to a mandala in that it holds symbolic elements and the prayers of everyone participating. As the different elements are added it raises the vibration of the space and becomes a living prayer to bring healing. After ceremony is closed, the despacho bundle is offered to the fire, earth, or water. Altar and community painting from a coming of age ceremony for a 13 year old girl.
