A Declaration Panoply of Pandemic and Pathology Posits Edited segment from the [weekly live General Assembly](https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/multimedia/general-assembly-meeting-november-1-2021/) on November 1, 2021 Transcript [00:00:00] [00:00:30] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: I'd like to introduce Dr. Ryan Cole. Thank you so much for being here. We're all honored to have you here today. Thank you. [00:00:38] Dr. Ryan Cole, MD: Alright, thank you, Dr. Hibberd, it's a pleasure to see you again. And it's an honor to be here with so many esteemed colleagues from around the world. [00:00:45] I recognize many of you, Dr. Malone. We both just got back from Alaska where we had a very good conference up there and helped hopefully shift the tides of the pandemic. So good to see you. I see Dr. Kory looking forward to speaking with him next weekend at another [00:01:00] conference. So it's an honor to be here with all of you. [00:01:02] Hi Jules, I see you down there too. So many friends here, so thank you for the opportunity to share today. I'll try to share my screen. [00:01:09] Okay. So I'm going to be quick here. [00:01:12] I know we've got only a few minutes. Basically I want to share a couple of pathology concepts and share a concept for those of you who aren't aware, I want to share a declaration. [00:01:22] This is what I like to start with. \"If everybody is thinking alike, then somebody isn't thinking.\" Famous words of general George S. Patton. [00:01:29] And I think we've experienced this year. The concept that we must all think alike and there must be consensus in everything and that's not science and that's not medicine. [00:01:38] The global COVID summit. I know many of us have heard Dr. Malone read this from Rome. Those of you who haven't signed onto the declaration doctorsandscientistsdeclaration.org, I would invite everybody to do so. [00:01:50] We have an update for it that addresses children and the vaccines addresses natural immunity and addresses Covid [00:02:00] recovered as well as early treatments and interventions. So I'm not going to read through all that in the interest of time. [00:02:05] What we're experiencing this year, and we all know this, we're in a war of words. It's not a world war. It's a word war, disinformation, misinformation, consensus guidelines, propaganda, conspiracy, anti-this, anti-that. Really, what we're trying to do is we want collegiality, dialogue and share information. I think back to Galileo, he says, \"The earth is not the center of the universe.\" [00:02:27] And what was the response,\"Imprison him!\"? I think a lot of us are experiencing that very same thing this year. And it's not that we are right or wrong, or our colleagues are right or wrong. But the ability to question is what's extremely lacking. If we base everything we do on emotion and belief then we become blinded over time. [00:02:44] And then, we're experiencing this pandemic of fear. What we need is data. We need truth. We need hope, optimism, love, joy dialogue, and we need to listen to each other again. So I, I hope at least we by sharing information, we can prompt that thinking. This really [00:03:00] struck me when we were at a conference recently in Maui, Dr. [00:03:02] Malone and I Dr. Urso is crossing the street to the park and this little girl, I think basically spoke for the world with her sign. And it struck my heart and I hope this is what we can help overcome. [00:03:15] This virus here in the states. It's not a political issue. It's not blue, a virus, isn't blue. [00:03:20] It's not red, it's not purple. It's a humanitarian issue. And that's really the heart of what we need to get back to is the humanitarian aspect of what we're doing. We're experiencing a medical tyranny agency capture here on this side of the pond. Our journals have been hijacked. You've seen the false articles in some of our most esteemed journals this year. [00:03:40] Our public health has not been a public health agency, rather decree agencies. And we must return to science and trust in public health. What have we gotten wrong this year? That there's no outpatient treatment for SARS. It's a lie that masks have stopped the spread. They don't, that school should be closed. [00:03:56] Vaccines will stop the spread. They haven't. Lockdowns work. They don't. [00:04:00] Everyone is at equal risk. This one size fits all, the governments are a three-year-old with a hammer. Everything's a hammer and everything's a nail. That's not true. This is a stratified virus to age groups. We all know that. We need to return trust in public health. [00:04:14] We haven't had public health messaging. What about our vitamin D deficiency pandemic around the world? I was just up in Alaska, so I threw that slide in. Every Alaskan is now immune suppressed for the rest of their fall and winter. Most of us in Northern climates are, if we don't supplement. [00:04:29] We have an obesity pandemic worldwide. We have really bad problem with metabolic disease worldwide, especially in some of the Western countries. We're sleep deprived. Your immune system is critically controlled by your sleep. We don't exercise. We don't move enough. You could run outside and most of these Northern tiered countries right now for the next four to five months naked, and you're going to, you're going to synthesize zero vitamin D. [00:04:51] So those who don't supplement and focus on some of these simple things, you're going to be immune suppressed for the winter. [00:04:57] We have this false dichotomy in our world right now that [00:05:00] there are two groups, vaccinated, unvaccinated. Absolute false dichotomy. There's a wonderful golden ticket Willy Wonka group. And that's the COVID recovered, who have a broad, long lasting, durable immunity. There's three things. And now I'm going to go into lab mode here. Three things that we can really look to in terms of who has a poor outcome with COVID. And these are three lab tests every single hospitalized patient should get. [00:05:25] And that's what your vitamin D level? There's a fantastic study recently that showed a high percentage of individuals hospitalized have an anti interferon Type 1 antibody. You need Type 1 interferon to fight off any infection, especially viral infections. And as we get older, that percentage of individuals up to 20% can have a self antibody attacking their own interferon response. [00:05:49] And we already know that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks our interferon response and drops our interferon levels. And that's a critical thing to measure because we can predict who the highest risk [00:06:00] hospitalized individuals can be and be more aggressive in their treatment. And one thing we've ignored in science so much this year is there's a good percentage of individuals in our society who are immunoglobulin A deficient. And IgA deficiency leads to much worse outcomes in respiratory viruses. [00:06:17] Obviously we're onto the Delta variant. Delta spreads faster, more transmissible symptoms start sooner. And here's why if we look at the mutations, there's mutations in the receptor binding domain, so it binds more easily, not only do the proteins and the docking shapes affect how readily it binds to our receptors, but it also changes the electrostatic charge, which is interesting. [00:06:41] And this is fascinating. People wonder why is Delta worse? Why does it spread faster? The mutation near the Furin cleavage site now with the legacy variants, the alpha variant, about 10% of bound cell could enter or of bound virus could enter our cells. With the Delta variant about 75% of bound virus can enter our cells. [00:06:58] So when we see these whopping [00:07:00] viral loads early, this mechanistically explains why and why we've had to increase the doses on certain medications that are efficacious. We've had to use higher doses to displace receptor sites and whatnot. So that's an important, just little tidbit on Delta. Now we're moving on to Delta plus, Delta 4 plus 20 plus, et cetera. [00:07:19] These mutations are affecting what we see now. As a pathologist, those of you who don't know me, I'm a Mayo clinic trained anatomic clinical pathologist. I was the chief surgical path fellow there at Mayo. I've done about 500,000 patient diagnostics biopsies in my career. I've done about 150,000 COVID tests in my lab this year. [00:07:40] And so one question I do have as a pathologist is if we're going to learn science, we need to study the mechanisms. And I know the group in Germany has done, a small case series, Dr. Peter Schirmacher of Heidelberg did a good series of 40. I have a couple of stacks of patients right here on my back desk that are [00:08:00] finally getting sent from around the country. But much to the reticence of my colleagues in pathology. I had a doctor in Ohio. The family requested an autopsy. They did the autopsy. I just needed some tissues, so I can stain for spike, protein and virus. He said you have to fly here and cut the tissue yourself. That's your research project. I'm not going to help you. So again, there's the lack of collegiality and the lack of willingness to find science and find answers. [00:08:25] And it's incredibly frustrating here in the states. There's a, an absolute paucity of reporting of post-mortem be it in autopsies. We don't have the funding to do it. We have to private fund it. No funding from the NIH. So little funding from the NIH is going into the post examination of both death from the disease. [00:08:44] You can't find... one cannot find that for which they do not look. So in basic science, we need to do these things. There needs to be funding from our agencies. I don't think that's happening anytime soon. Same thing. The post vaccine deaths- are they truly post vaccine deaths, has the [00:09:00] patient acquired COVID post vaccine? Because after your shot, and this is an immunologic message that we're not giving to the public, we're getting this public message of get your shot in the middle of a widespread, fast spreading virus. [00:09:11] And you're literally an immunologic sitting duck in that period of time. And as your broad natural non-specific antibodies drop, you're trying to ramp up a spike response, wrong spike to the wrong virus now. And you're literally a sitting duck to become infected for several weeks on end. So a lot of the post vaccine deaths could indeed be post viral deaths. [00:09:36] And so we, we need the tissue. So if you have colleagues around the world that are willing to share post vaccine deaths, we're staining for spike, we're staining for nucleocapsid, we're staining for virus. And so we're looking into that. I know many of you have seen the Sulk study where we know that the spike protein is doing damage. [00:09:53] The one on the right there, it's blown apart endothelial cells. The one on the left is nice, smooth vascular cells. The [00:10:00] spike protein itself is the toxin! On the right dark is all inflammatory cells. I get to look at these cool pictures under the scope all day long. These beautiful colors and patterns on the left is good lung, right, is bad lung, all inflammation. [00:10:14] These are the patterns we're seeing on the left. You see all those blue dots within the pink. This is cardiac tissue down below. You see as blue coming in after inflammation in the heart, you get scarring. Scarring does not turn back into myocytes. And these are the concerns we have, from the laboratory and the autopsy setting. [00:10:32] We're seeing in the few that we do have these chronic damage defects, same thing in the liver. We know the nanoparticles go to the ovary. I liked my comment from my colleague, Dr. Urso. He likes to say the nanoparticles are like garlic. They go everywhere. So they're depositing and concentrating in specific areas in the body. [00:10:51] We hear the post exposure, post shot menstrual problems from around the world. Obviously we don't have enough data on pregnancy yet. These are being pushed [00:11:00] forward. I'm hearing reports from colleagues around the world. Oncologists. Now this is anecdotal. I just got three labs together. So we're going to have about 150,000 specimens between our three databases to review, to look at uptick. [00:11:13] We're concerned about cancer upticks, post shot and post post COVID, but certainly post vaccination. And this is highly concerning oncologists are looking at cancers. They've been able to manage for, their 20, 30 year career. They know the course of the disease, and they're seeing these take off like wildfire due to immune dysregulation. [00:11:31] And that's highly concerning. Let's see, I froze here. [00:11:35] We know the VAERS reports from the US I've seen the yellow card system in the UK. I've seen European data. We know how tragically high the adverse events are. We need to be looking at these in the lab. Here in the US it's just mind boggling that we're still pushing forward with the wrong shot for the wrong variant of the virus. [00:11:56] At this point, we don't have a public health message. If you're COVID recovered, we should [00:12:00] be screening. We know the data from Dr. Rao, Dr. Camera, Dr. Duteous and a couple others that if you've had COVID and you get the shot, you're actually at higher risk for adverse reactions. From the UK, we know that if you've got the shots and then got COVID, you have a more narrow immune response, you don't develop the antibodies like you should to the nucleocapsid protein. [00:12:20] So you end up with a more narrow response. You don't get that broad immune response. And now are those individuals susceptible to the variants? We see immune modulations, post shot. This is very concerning that we're modifying the innate immune response, which is our T-cells macrophages dendritic cells, or reprogramming those such that we don't have as strong of an innate response. We're dropping certain critical pattern recognition receptors toll-like receptors 3, 4, 7, 8, 3, and 4 are responsible for training cells to keep cancers and check 7 and 8 are responsible for keeping our T-cells trained to keep [00:13:00] viruses in check. [00:13:00] So we're seeing big outbreaks, post vaccination and post COVID in some of herpes family viruses. And in the lab, we're seeing this at rates we've never seen before and it's concerning, and we're also seeing it women's cancers of the cervix as well. HPV increases, et cetera. This original antigenic sin, if we're exposed to that spike first, be it through vaccine, it's a folly that we're endeavoring in. And it's very concerning. [00:13:30] Reactivation of viruses post Moderna. Here's the one I'm worried about. p53 is the guardian of the genome as a receptor and p53 dysregulation leads to tumor pathways. [00:13:41] The S2 subunit binds to p53 also to BRCA in In Silico studies, and this could explain activation of cancers faster in addition to the toll-like receptors. IL-6 pathways increased inflammation, leads to increased cancer, JAK pathway, STAT pathways, all these nerdy things we studied in [00:14:00] the lab. [00:14:00] These are all highly concerning. And here's something we should be looking at as well, pre and post shot labs. I know a lot of people are being mandated into getting a shot. They have no choice. It's their livelihood. It's their lives. It's their freedom. It's very unfortunate. [00:14:14] From a medical legal point of view here in the United States, I've been recommending: okay. If your employer is going to mandate you get a shot, check your clotting factor, your D-dimer check a sedimentation rate, check a C-reactive protein, check your Troponin. See if your heart is normal going into it, do just a general blood count, electrolyte count, liver count. And then after your shot. Now you can document to your employer if you've been injured by the shots. [00:14:40] And then the employer in many settings here in the US could and should be liable if you've been injured by those shots. Where'd the flu go real quick. Viruses compete with each other. This is a new area of science over the last decade. And they have secret social lives. Actually in the lab, we study them individually, but they actually compete with each other and they send [00:15:00] little peptide signals. [00:15:01] There's their social life. You've got all your little different viruses is hanging out together, but they send peptide signals. So a lot of the, more, oh, it's a conspiracy. The flu was really here. Yeah. The flu was here, but at a much lower rate, viruses will send signals to turn other viruses off. [00:15:17] What about antibody dependent enhancement? Are we seeing it? Some papers say we're seeing the early signs of it, and this is highly concerning as well. Especially as people get the shots wrong shot for the wrong protein. Doesn't prevent disease. Doesn't present, prevent acquisition, doesn't prevent transmission. [00:15:35] We know that the vaccinated are carrying equal or higher loads of virus. Now we have these illegal things happening in the workplace where if you haven't gotten the shot, you have to get a weekly test. Whereas we know that the vaccinated can be carrying equal viral loads. So it's a separate but equal argument here under our civil rights act in the US. [00:15:54] Again, ADE. What about the COVID recovered? Why in the world [00:16:00] are we not recognizing it? There are countless studies. Now, if you go to the Brownstone Institute, they have 96 of them printed and listed. We need to be pounding this to our health officials or politicians. It's it. It doesn't make any sense as to why we're not recognizing it. [00:16:15] You have broad immunity to 28 proteins, not just the 29th, the spike, your body remembers all of that. You form a full, broad T-cell response. We know in SARS-CoV-1 18 years later, those individuals still have T-cell memory to SARS-CoV-1. There's no reason that shouldn't happen here since it's 78% homologous to SARS-CoV-1. Dr. Risch and Battacharya. I love their comment: to vaccinate the Covid-recovered is scientifically incoherent. Absolutely true. [00:16:42] We don't vaccinate. If you've had chicken pox, you don't get a chicken pox vaccine. If grandma had the measles 80 years ago, she still has a broad, natural immunity to the measles. This is one point I want to hit again, immunoglobulin A, your tears, your boogers, your mucus in your throat. [00:16:58] Now some people are IgA [00:17:00] deficient. We should test for that, but those who are COVID recovered form a nice IgA antibody and your cells can produce 10,000 antibodies a minute in your mucosal, secretions. The vaccinated don't have this at high levels. The COVID recovered do. That's why the COVID recovered should be the freest members of society. [00:17:21] No mask, go about your life normally. If you get a little virus in, your binding it quickly. The vaccinated don't have the benefit of the IgA response from a muscular vaccination. And this is very, again, anti-science what we're doing from public health measures and we're ignoring basic laboratory science and medicine. [00:17:42] Bicycle. Think of the virus as a bicycle; front tire is your spike, the rest of the bike is the rest of the virus. You get a shot, you get a antibody response to the front tire. You get a natural infection and recovery. You have memory to that lovely basket, the handlebars, the frame, the seat, the post, the cranks, the [00:18:00] chain, the back tire, the fenders, everything. [00:18:03] Now the bike gets into a crash; a la Delta. Now you have a Delta bicycle. It's bent, it's mutated. Those who have vaccine don't bind much of that tire anymore. In fact, they bind and don't neutralize it, but those who are recovered, remember the rest of the bicycle. It's broad. It doesn't matter if that spike mutates a little bit. [00:18:20] If you've had a natural infection, your body remembers the rest of it and your body has a good broad antibody response, but more importantly, your innate T-cell response. Again, vaccine for Delta mandates, good grief! It doesn't prevent disease. Doesn't prevent acquisition, doesn't prevent transmission, doesn't prevent disease, doesn't prevent death. [00:18:40] And so to mandate something for which it's not even designed, it doesn't make any sense from a point of logic, from a point of science, from a point of ethics, from a point of morality. [00:18:51] Early treatments are for everybody. The vaccinated and the unvaccinated, we see all the breakthrough cases and in the UK, you're ahead of us. [00:19:00] In Israel they're ahead of us, in Iceland they're ahead of us. You're seeing the breakthrough sooner than we are. We're starting to see it here. And the narrative is going to crumble because people are finally going to recognize what we're doing with trying to make a vaccine a therapy. And technically it is a therapy by definition, but they changed definitions. [00:19:20] Really we need to focus on early treatment because that's what's going to save the lives and we need to get that message out that the treatments are for the vaccinated and the unvaccinated. It's for everybody. We still have no early outpatient treatment recommendations in the United States. [00:19:35] Therapeutic nihilism. We know the protocols from around the world AAPS, FLCCC, Truth for Health Foundation, the early protocols save lives of all the patients I've treated around 400 now, zero have gone to the hospital. Zero have died. Zero. And I have plenty of colleagues that can share that same story. [00:19:56] Tale of two countries. We look at a developing nation like India. What did [00:20:00] they do? They had the will to early treat for pennies on the dollar compared to what we're doing in the West. You look at Uttar Pradesh. They're down to 20 cases a day they're done. They let it burn through. They were willing to treat. [00:20:12] It was about humanity. It was about their people and citizens. Now in Delhi, 88% of women and 85% of men are seropositive. What are we doing here in the US and other parts of the world, well we all know what's going on? Anyway, treat early. Don't wait. Delta, all the variants are clotting diseases. [00:20:30] Don't forget, this is an inflammatory clotting disease. You can take my ivermectin away. You can take hydroxychloroquine away, I can still treat inflammation and clotting. If you do it at the right doses and at the right time. I'm not going to go through all the therapies. I know many of you are very familiar with that, but we should be willing to use them. [00:20:47] And it doesn't take all of them. It takes five or six to them, and it takes seven or eight, but it takes getting it onboard early because Delta spreads like a wild fire. And so will Delta plus don't forget your Vitamin D, the [00:21:00] higher your D, the lower your risk for acquiring disease in your severity of disease. Study out of the UK recently, this one's out of Quest Diagnostics, 191,000 patients. We know some basic immunologic modulators, Vitamin D isn't a vitamin, it's a pro hormone. Controls and directly indirectly 2000 genes in your body, accounts for about 5% of the protein production in your body, if you have it in appropriate amounts. We know the comorbidities. [00:21:23] We need to give that public health message to change those. Don't forget your diet. Don't eat processed foods. Don't eat junk, don't eat sugar. If I want to make you D deficient, I give a lab rat high fructose corn syrup, and I can make them D deficient period. Don't drink the sodas. Don't drink the junk. We can control our lives, sleep. Misinformation, disinformation. [00:21:42] We need to stand up for each other, which I know we're doing. And I'm grateful for this group for doing what you're doing. And I talked fast and hopefully I can answer some questions later. So thank you so much. [00:21:53] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Thank you so much, Ryan. Thank you so much for such an eloquent, informative, [00:22:00] logically thought provoking talk. [00:22:02] I really appreciate it. We all really appreciate it. And this will most definitely help all of us bring these messages forward in a clear unthreatening way. Really thank you so much. And your slides, you'll find if we keep them at the World Council for Health and distribute them to whoever would like them because... [00:22:21] Dr. Ryan Cole, MD: You bet. Absolutely. Absolutely. Thank you. [00:22:24] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Can I ask you a question quickly and then we'll go onto the questions everybody's been [inaudible]. We hear this wonderful news like in India and other countries where they've got the early treatments going and their numbers are going down. However, when I'm talking with the doctors and people in the ground there, the vaccines are getting pushed in all of these countries. [00:22:46] So it sounds like and I know a lot of people go Hey, where do I go? Kind of thing or whatever, what they're looking for, a place, a haven where things are looking good. But I'm not seeing that anywhere. [00:22:55] Dr. Ryan Cole, MD: I'm highly concerned. Cause like when Uttar Pradesh went through their [00:23:00] wave and then they treated early and had a high level of success, their vaccine uptake at that time was only about 5 to 6%. [00:23:07] Now, if you go through and vaccinate, those who are recovered, you're going to modulate that immune response. And I wish I had more time, but high zone tolerance, if you give somebody peanut allergy shots over time, eventually the body and the T-cells say, Hey I don't want to see that antigen anymore. [00:23:25] And they start forgetting it. If we keep pushing this booster concept to those who are COVID recovered, those have already had a shot. Eventually you're fatiguing the T-cell response and the T-cell memory to where the T cells just don't want to respond to any SARS-CoV-2 variant down the road. And in any population where we've gotten to 25% vaccination, the new variant steps in, so it's highly concerning nationally, internationally. [00:23:52] What we're doing still trying to say that a vaccine is a therapeutic way to approach a [00:24:00] virus. And I have PhD work in immunology as well. It's scientifically incoherent what we're doing. Whereas the early treatments cover all the variants because of their mechanisms of action. And I could do an hour on each drug, but I won't. [00:24:13] So that's a great question and why they're doing that it makes no sense whatsoever. They should celebrate their COVID recovered, broad, natural. [00:24:20] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Thank you now over to Shabnam and Tracy to bring forward any Q&A, or the questions for Dr. Ryan to answer. [00:24:29] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Thanks, Jennifer. We've got three. This one is from Brett Weinstein. Do we know if early treatment ever interferes with the development of natural immunity, Ryan? [00:24:39] Dr. Ryan Cole, MD: That's a great question, Brett. Thank you for that. The short answer is no. And the reason being by the time you're symptomatic, your immune system has already been exposed to the whole panoply of antigens. [00:24:53] And if you treat early, you may, what we know from Dr. Schwartz's study in Israel, that you do cut viral shedding [00:25:00] time and viral load in half, but you still have enough virus present for long enough to stimulate the entire immune cascade and immune reaction, CD4 cells talking to the plasma cells, forming the antibody. [00:25:12] So that's a great question. And in my experience and measurements in the laboratory between mild, moderate, and severe cases, people, no matter what still form that immune response. [00:25:24] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Thanks, Ryan. There's one, that's one more of a comment than a question, but it's an interesting one from [inaudible] that the Australian data doesn't support that Delta is more infectious or more deadly. Cases per hundred tests from CFR haven't been higher, talks about what's happened in Australia and Victoria, specifically. [00:25:42] Your thoughts on that, because it seems to be a debate about whether Delta is more infectious [inaudible]? [00:25:46] Dr. Ryan Cole, MD: That's a, an excellent point and a great question, because if you look at many countries that went through Delta, their death rate was much lower between seven to 20 times lower than some of the earlier variants. [00:25:57] It is more transmissible just based [00:26:00] on the mutations that are present. But when we look at the data from many countries around the world, it seems to be less deadly. Now what's fascinating in the United States is we're still having a fair amount of death. We're still using the renal drug [inaudible] remdesivir that interestingly, pulmonary disease that has all these kidney symptoms, meanwhile, other countries aren't having kidney disease that aren't using Remdesivir so it makes you scratch your head. [00:26:26] We're using a toxic drug here in the United States. I think we're seeing a worse outcome. We're metabolically sicker than many nations comparatively. And the other interesting thing too, in certain nations in the Asian nations, about 90% of the population is O blood type, which in some studies tends to have a better outcome. So that's a great question. I don't think from my world perspective, no [inaudible] Delta [inaudible] deadly. [00:26:49] From the US perspective. I just don't think we're doing things properly here. It may be a little bit lower than earlier waves, statistically, I'm not sure. [00:26:59] Dr. PIerre Kory: Hey, it's [00:27:00] Pierre Kory can I just add one thing to that question of whether it's deadly or not, I'm just going to speak on a clinical level as an ICU doctor. There is a fundamental difference between Alpha and Delta in the ICU, and that I can speak without any hesitation, any qualification or any confusion. [00:27:19] When patients got to me in Alpha in the ICU, which is advanced disease, advanced pulmonary inflammatory phase, we could turn them around to some extent. When they get to me in Delta, just like Ryan just said, which is in the US undertreated, which is a tiny dose of steroid and toxic Remdesivir, it's the rare patient that we can turn around in the short term. [00:27:43] Some of them will hang on land on a tracheostomy, go to a vent facility and survive over months. But this disease is far more resistant to treatment in the ICU. So again, that's a narrow view of this disease, but Delta is completely different than the other variants. [00:28:00] If they're untreated or undertreated and they land in an ICU, this is a different disease. [00:28:04] And I have to tell you, this is uniformly seen by everybody in the FLCCC in the ICU. I hopefully that's helpful. I know it's scary. It just emphasizes early treatment matters. And just like Ryan said, higher doses oftentimes in Delta. And so again, I don't know about the epidemiology everywhere, but this is a different disease than alpha for sure. [00:28:24] Dr. Ryan Cole, MD: And that's a great, that's a great point here. And that goes to where that mutation is in the amount of virus that does enter the cell from that pathophysiologic point of view. So thank you, Pierre. [00:28:36] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Professor Cahill had her hand up? But I think she's typed it. How can we boost natural immunity, supplement with vitamin D and what else? Especially the elderly and those at risk. I think that'll be the last one for now. [00:28:48] Dr. Ryan Cole, MD: Okay. Yeah. And that's a great question. So optimizing immune health. Obviously. Let that food be thy medicine, let thy medicine be thy food. [00:28:57] We, as we, as a world, tend to [00:29:00] be very metabolically unwell, yes, about 70% of individuals in the world are vitamin D deficient. If you're going to take vitamin D your best co-factor to make vitamin D work and move vitamin D from your adipose tissue into circulation is to take magnesium. In the United States, 70 to 80% of people and especially the elderly are magnesium deficient in addition to vitamin D deficient. So goes your vitamin D level, you drop your cancer rates, your depression rates, your all cause mortality rates, your cardiac death rates, the higher you get to that 50 or above nanograms per milliliter range. [00:29:32] Vitamin C. A lot of people are zinc deficient. You don't need to take a lot of zinc because you'll become copper deficient. Body movement getting outdoors, the concept of Japanese forest bathing, walking out in nature, actually, because you're exposed to pollens and other pathogens stimulate your natural killer cell T cell response. Hot cold therapy is fascinating in terms of training your natural killer cells. [00:29:55] Sleep makes your immune cells stickier to talk to each other. There's so many things one [00:30:00] can do. That's the tip of the iceberg avoiding excess alcohol, avoiding THC, THC suppresses your natural killer cells, CBD doesn't. Just many things. I have an entire other lecture on that, but those are just some of the basic things one can do. [00:30:13] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Thank you. There's about six questions in the Q&A, and Dr. Tracy Chandler has donated a little bit of time to use so here's another one. Did the Delta patients have the vaccine status revealed, were they unvaxxed, partially vaxxed, fully vaxxed? That's from Dr. Killian. [00:30:29] Dr. Ryan Cole, MD: See, that's an important thing. [00:30:30] Data collection wise, we have, again, it's a false, another false dichotomy. We have vaccines on vaccine in the hospital. No, we have post one vaccine, post two vaccine. I know in the UK, they're much better about tracking whether you've had one shot, two shots, or you've completed your full course. [00:30:49] Now, the problem is that with the Delta at the base, the inter-modal domain of the spike, now we have anywhere from six to 20 binding non neutralizing antibodies. [00:31:00] They're not doing their job and those binding antibodies - Dr. Yon describes this really well -Lee Meng; you have a dog. Your dog is your protector. You have either a really good dog. He's your friend barks at the door. Does what he's supposed to. [00:31:13] You have your dumb, lazy dog that sits on the floor. These your antibodies protecting your house. And then you have eventually these bad dogs that bite you. And that's what these binding antibodies are. They're now biting you. Because, and then they may even go and open the door and let intruders in, or let that in. [00:31:32] It's a bad scenario. If you form bad antibodies. A good antibody is forever, like in measles or chicken pox, a bad antibodies forever. And so with Delta since it's not the same virus and not the same formulation as the lock and key mechanism, it's one of our legacy variant viruses that isn't even circling circulating in humanity anymore. [00:31:54] So these hospitalized patients with Delta who may have had a shot are actually potentially worse [00:32:00] off than if they hadn't had a shot at all in terms of immune suppression. And that can be one thing that we need to be looking at. Did you get one shot? You need to be even more aggressive with those patients. [00:32:10] Did they get the second shot, but still haven't built up their full response. They're not going to anyway, from a mechanistic point of view, these are essentially at par with zero now, in terms of the \u2014 [00:32:21] I hear all the time, \" At least they decrease hospitalization and death.\" I'm not so sure about that anymore because all the data that have been submitted to the agencies for authorizations and whatnot is legacy data. [00:32:34] And so I don't know if I answered the full question, but Delta is a different beast to Dr. Kory's point. I concur with his assessment and he's seeing it. And if you wait, it's too late. [00:32:44] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Thanks very much Ryan, and I think we'll have to leave it there, but there's some questions for you in the chat. Thank you so much. [00:32:50] Dr. Ryan Cole, MD: Thank you. [00:32:51] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: We could talk on and on with you, Ryan. This is so fascinating and certainly this whole conundrum about vaccinated and unvaccinated and how [00:33:00] the hospitals consider you unvaccinated even for several weeks after your second vaccine. So the data is very skewed, unfortunately, so it doesn't help anybody. [00:33:10] Yes. Thank you very much. And moving on now, we have Tracy Chandler from New Zealand. She is a member of our steering committee, and she's going to speak with us about a new form of grief and how to heal and introducing the colleagues support committee. Tracy, please come forward and talk with us this is interesting. [00:33:32] Dr. Tracy Chandler: Hi, Jennifer and everyone. Thank you. I did say in the chat that I'm happy to give my time to Ryan because I think it was an incredible talk. Particularly loved the bike analogy and forest bathing. That was one of my tips. So you've given part of my talk. Thank you. So anyway I did say I'm happy to donate my time. [00:33:51] If there was more questions Shabnam wants to offer? There are q uestions. Thanks, Tracy, Ryan. Is that okay? [00:33:58] Dr. Ryan Cole, MD: I'm game. I [00:34:00] hope I know the answer. I'll try. Thank you, Dr. Chandler. [00:34:03] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Awesome. Thank you so much. All right, so let's look at some really excellent questions, right? [00:34:09] Marsha asked everyone, if there is a test to prove cross immunity, what is a legal evaluation of [inaudible] in different countries? I'm not sure I understand that question, Marsha if you can just clarify that one. Then Fernando Valeria from Honduras. Thanks for the presentation. Do you know if the vaccines are developed using other proteins of SARS-CoV-2 or an attenuated form of the virus? [00:34:31] Dr. Ryan Cole, MD: That's a great question. There are other vaccines under development. If we had just targeted the receptor binding domain, instead of the entire spike, we wouldn't have to worry as much about antibody dependent enhancement because it's narrow. And then you would have had an antibody that bound to nothing. [00:34:46] Still the concern that maybe it could buy into some human tissues, but it would have been much less concerning down the road. There are many vaccines in development. If you target the spike you are targeting and making a toxin. And if we [00:35:00] look at the traditional vaccines from SARS-CoV-1, those were traditional vaccines. [00:35:04] Those were a protein. Those were a part of the virus. The problem with antibody dependent enhancement is the mutation in the coronavirus family. It always mutationally drifts over time. That's why we saw enhancement reactions in the animal models. So the challenge of trying to target say the nucleocapsid or the envelope in the membrane is obviously they're buried more within the ball of the virus and it's harder for the immune system necessarily to bind and neutralize those. [00:35:32] I know there are vaccine technologies that are looking at doing those areas. The important thing is your T-cell memory is strongest to the nucleocapsid interestingly. So they're under development. We did something quickly. [00:35:47] We thought we were doing the right thing. If we looked at history, we could have known and should have known we weren't with the spike. So that's a tough question. [00:35:55] Children and vaccines, it's insanity, what the world is doing. Children [00:36:00] survived this virus at 100%, their risk- it's a risk benefit ratio. They only have the opportunity for harm, not benefit. The death rate in children is one per million, and most of those deaths Dr. Makary out of Hopkins, went back and looked. And there was one child out of 550 plus deaths in the US that died purely of COVID. They all had severe underlying conditions. To introduce the wrong spike protein shot into their body with no long-term known reproductive health risks. [00:36:38] No long-term cancer risks. And yes, I'm seeing an uptick through my microscope every day. No longterm auto-immune risks. Fascinating that our FDA just approved a new anti-clotting agent for children. Very fascinating. There, there is no benefit for a disease and you can early treat children with these [00:37:00] medications. Helped a friend recently dose her little boy, he was better in 24 hours. [00:37:06] Their immune systems are different than ours. They have two to three times the natural killer cell activity that an adult does. They have two to three times the granzyme activity, the little hand grenades that those cells throw into infected cells. It makes no sense to put our children's future at risk with no long-term outcome safety known. [00:37:26] We haven't advanced the clock and we can't advance the clock, but we can look into the crystal ball through history and know that this is a horrible idea for children. [00:37:36] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Absolutely. And I want to say your point about the clotting medicines is so interesting because there's a sudden big push for MRNA cancer jabs from about June this year, very interesting. All right, a question from Fariah Hassen from South Africa, is the increase in COVID disease not really as a result of immune suppression rather than directly due to SARS-CoV-2 virus itself. [00:37:58] Dr. Ryan Cole, MD: I think it's a fertile ground [00:38:00] hypothesis. How predisposed or how immune suppressed is the population through which it's spreading. [00:38:05] Why have certain nations done better, better than others? Now this is another fascinating scientific tidbit; it's biologically and ethnically different in different populations. Some populations have higher concentrations of TM, PRSs, two receptors and ACE2 receptors in their mucosa. Now children pre puberty, pre pubertal children have lower levels of those. [00:38:28] Hence they tend to acquire less virus. This is another reason children do well. But many nations, you can obviously buy some of the early treatment medications over the counter. That's one reason they do better to certain populations just aren't as genetically and protein receptor susceptible to the virus as other populations in other parts of the world. [00:38:48] And then there goes to that point that was brought up in the question. We have an immune status in many nations where we're in poor health. Based on decades of [00:39:00] healthcare policy, food policy decisions we've made. And we're literally a target for this virus because of those underlying choices we made over time. [00:39:10] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Thanks, Brian. Judy's got an interesting one; when you say, Judy Stinson, and when you say that post vaccine death could be post viral death and we should be doing autopsies. Do you mean that these maybe COVID recovered or may be dying from the shot? [00:39:23] Dr. Ryan Cole, MD: Not Covid recovered from the shot, generally, it's individuals that choose to get the shot, say the viral naive individual gets the shot and then acquires COVID in that window after their first or second shot. [00:39:37] I don't know of many re acquisitions of virus in the COVID recovered. And I do like to quote Peter McCollough on that, where he says, look, if we were having a lot of breakthrough cases of COVID and the COVID recovered, we would see thousands of reports in the medical literature and we plain and simple aren't seeing that. And to his point in the medical literature, you really can't find an individual or many cases [00:40:00] where an individual has had the virus it's been sequenced has had it a second time and it's been sequenced. There are anecdotal cases. There are certainly false positives, especially in the laboratories that run their cycle thresholds too high. [00:40:11] And you get a false positive. You may have had a different illness and not COVID. And if you don't have a proven immunity then it may not be documentable. And an important point if you'll allow me to bring it up, people panic about their antibody levels. If you had an antibody response to every pathogen you're exposed to every day, you would look like the swollen stay puffed marshmallow man of lymph nodes and your blood would sludge. Your antibody levels have to go down over time. Your immune memory cells stay present and active, especially if your vitamin D levels are high in your lymph nodes in your bone marrow, same with your T cells. So people panic over their antibody levels dropping. The bottom range of that threshold that we have on antibodies was set too high because we set it in the middle of a pandemic. [00:40:58] If we had two to three years to [00:41:00] normalize that lower level in the laboratory of the antibody detection should be much lower than it is now. So just another aside there. [00:41:07] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Thank you. This one is connected to both Merrick and Sheena asking about is protein transmission from vaccinated to unvaccinated. Merrick; is it true that the transmission exists and Sheena, is there such a thing as vaccine shedding? If so, how long does it last? [00:41:23] Dr. Ryan Cole, MD: That's a great question. Now, this also depends on the fertile ground of the individual. Some people are more deficient in MRNAs and some people their again, it goes to the individual. [00:41:35] If we look at the Ogata study from Harvard, we know that spike was being produced in circulating in all parts of the body for at least two weeks. We know from the journal of immunology last week that we can detect spike in exosomes for up to four months. We know from the work of Dr. Bruce Patterson, that in some COVID recovered patients, he can still detect by mass spec circulating spike 15 months. We know from studies in the subway and the sweat of individuals [00:42:00] that were COVID infected in Wuhan, the spike could be detected in their sweat. [00:42:05] So yes, spike can be shed. Now, if it's an exome circulating for four months, the question becomes, are you still producing the DNA modality shots tend to produce spike for longer than the MRNA shots. [00:42:20] Now, the question becomes; can you be breathing out enough exosomal spike to actually induce a response or reaction in another individual? There's no good scientific study that proves it. But we have plenty of anecdotal data of people that are experiencing that. [00:42:35] So something is happening. If you look at page 67 of Pfizer's application, we know that in that study, it clearly says don't be in contact with a pregnant woman. Don't be in a room with a pregnant women. Woman don't have intercourse for four weeks, et cetera, et cetera. And we know of the self spreading vaccines that have already been developed. So it's an excellent scientific question. There's a lot of things we're trying to do to prove it. We know that not [00:43:00] only is it a scientific possibility, but based on what we're seeing it as a probability, and there's a few more things we need to do. And I would like to see many of us come together and have two or three papers in the laboratory. We're going to be able to show it. I have several endometrial tissue set aside because I've seen an increase in endometrial cancers and hyperplasias and whatnot. [00:43:20] So many of those are coming to me. I want to prove that whether or not they're spike there or not. So that's a great question. Short answer is I think so, but to a small degree, I'm not sure it's enough to induce some of the massive changes people are experiencing. I think a lot more of that is lipid nanoparticle and allergies, to some of the lipid nanoparticles that deposit in the ovary. [00:43:39] Then you get a hormonal response and then just like women in a dorm in college, then I think you'd get a pheromonal response. So I'm hypothesizing that a bunch of the menstrual changes may be more likely to be a pheremonal response being in proximity to someone who's immune stimulated against their own ovary. [00:43:56] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Dr. Vince wants to know how do we protect our bodies from the [00:44:00] spike protein from the jab? [00:44:02] Dr. Ryan Cole, MD: From the jab itself? Don't get the jab. [00:44:05] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: About as simple as that, Jen, I think you're going to have to tell me when we can call it. One more by Fahrie Hassan; there's evidence now that vaccine immunity may be destroying natural antibody production, any comments? [00:44:17] Dr. Ryan Cole, MD: Absolutely. And that's some of the UK data and the N protein antibodies, the nuclear capsid protein, which is very concerning. The other interesting point to bring up is as we age our thymus gland regresses, and it gets smaller and our naive T cells are much fewer that we can train. Now there's an injection called Thymosin Alpha 1. You can basically make it, and interestingly this year, of course, the FDA disallowed the production thereof in the United States. Another fascinating thing. [00:44:47] But the older we get, if your T-cell lines are damaged to regenerate, those T-cell lines is difficult to do. We're lucky in the children that they're still resilient and have the ability to train [00:45:00] their naive T cells over time. [00:45:02] So not only are we losing antibody response and damaging and narrowing the antibody response if one's had COVID and they get the shot, you are narrowing your antibody response. That's not scientifically coherent. If you get the shots and get COVID, we know statistically, and by data that now you have a narrow response as well. [00:45:23] The best thing we can do is if you get COVID get treated and to Dr. Weinstein's question earlier, yes. You still make an antibody response. You still make a T cell response because you had enough virus for those first couple of days before you're symptomatic that your body's already training to do that process. [00:45:40] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Thanks, Diane. I think we leave it there. I'm just gonna paste a couple of questions that I've noticed along the way, if could chat with them. I think it's brilliant. Thank you so much for those very insightful responses. And for your patience and for spending time with us. [00:45:54] Dr. Ryan Cole, MD: Thank you so much. [00:45:56] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Thank you. Thank you. And just back to briefly, I'm going to [00:46:00] just mention something of interest to everybody is in Canada, they now have advertisements about how to identify stroke symptoms in children. [00:46:09] And they've started opening up stroke clinics in the hospitals as if it's just a natural phenomenon that's taking place. Thank you, Dr. Cole. Amazing. Amazing. [00:46:20] Thank you so much. Very interesting and motivational in terms of just the clarity that you deliver your information. It's so good for all of us to incorporate and take "}
