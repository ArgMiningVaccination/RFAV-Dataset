One of our goals is to increase resilience and be sustainable in today's economy while still offering highest quality patient-centered care, research and education programs. To achieve this, we are changing the way we do things and embracing a long-held dream of weaving Integrative Medicine into the fiber of other medical departments. Since collaborations are very important for sustainability and resilience - \"no man is an island\" - that is where we began. Working with Radiation-Oncology and the Maryland Proton Treatment Center, we have made great strides already. Our collaborative efforts consist of successful government-funded grants, \"Integrative Wellness\" patient care services, and the Applied Integrative Medicine Program that educated several key personnel. We are currently in collaborative explorations with other departments who have similar goals, including Palliative Care, Psychiatry, and Orthopedics who want to add our integrative therapies to the services they currently offer. Our grant collaborations and trainings, in combination with increased patient care opportunities, will create resilience, sustainability and patient satisfaction, and we look forward to putting these joint ventures in to play. As grant funding across the nation is becoming more difficult to obtain, especially from NIH, our small team of researchers was able to increase our total NIH awards over last year and overall grant funding. Grantsmanship is a key part of our sustainability. We responded to a wider variety of \"requests for funding\" and were awarded most of them. Forty peer-reviewed articles written by our team were published in scholarly journals and two book chapters were published in academic texts. Our small team gave over 100 presentations and we were the \"host site\" for an international academic conference, at which many of our accomplishments and achievements were displayed. Our financially self-sustaining educational program trains health care professionals and select community members to be yoga teachers and has become so successful that we added advanced yoga teacher training modules this year. We were among a select few who were invited to offer a yoga therapy pilot program specifically for licensed healthcare providers, which we anticipate will launch in the fall of 2019. Our Cochrane informatics program, funded by NIH for over 20 years and recently received another 5-year award, is expanding its reach to include knowledge translation for patients as well as clinicians and researchers, including plans for social media strategies and web-based application resources. All said, sustainability and resilience are deeply etched into our DNA and we will be using all the tools in the toolbox to exceed expectations and thrive. To your good health, Brian Berman, MD Who We Are The Center for Integrative Medicine (CIM) at the University of Maryland School of Medicine was the first academic integrative medicine center in the US. With a track record of over $70 million in grant funding, more than 750 peer-reviewed publications and abstracts, and collaborators in more than 120 different countries, CIM continues to be a leading international center for research, patient care, education and training in integrative medicine. Mission Emphasizing an approach to healing that values mind, body, and spirit, the Center is committed to evaluating the scientific foundation of complementary medicine, educating health professionals, and the public about integrative medicine and integrating evidence-based complementary therapies into clinical care to help people achieve and maintain optimal health and well-being. BRIAN BERMAN Director, Center for Integrative Medicine Resilience is all about being able to overcome the unexpected. Sustainability is about survival. The goal of resilience is to thrive. - Jamais Cascio One of Foreign Policy magazine's \"Top 100 Global Thinkers\"FROM THE DIRECTOR02 | ANNUAL REPORT FY201805 | ANNUAL REPORT FY2018 We are improving the nutrition of people across the lifespan - from pre-schoolers and K12 students to teachers and veterans. We are rigorously testing the effectiveness of dietary supplements for a variety of conditions including immune function, overall wellness, and type 2 diabetes. We are studying acupuncture for pain in the veteran population and testing how to give mental health professionals tools to understand the diverse spiritual needs of their patients. We are improving the evidence base for integrative medicine through the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field. We teach senior medical students about integrative medicine and self-care during our transformational 120-hour elective. We offer a self-care Healing Pathways course to nurses, other healthcare providers and selected community members so that they can integrate wellness into their life and their work. We teach healthcare professionals and approved community members to become certified yoga instructors, encouraging them to bring yoga to their patients and the community. We offer week-long self-care retreats to cancer patients and their families to improve their health and wellness as they battle their disease. We collaborate with highly respected leaders in scholarship and research through strategic partnerships with organizations such as The Institute for Integrative Health, USDA, Under Armour, Duke University, and the National Institutes of Health, as well as experts from over 100 countries around the world and throughout the University of Maryland. We disseminate scientific findings through peer-reviewed publications, including 40 papers this past year in leading medical journals, and presented more than 100 posters and lectures at local, national and international venues. Dr. Brian Berman was awarded the 2018 Bravewell Distinguished Service Award by the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine at their member's dinner in May 2018. We are involved in the community, including American Pain Society Task Force, NFL Players Pain Advisory Board, McCormick Science Institute Advisory Board, Maryland Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Gilcrest Hospice Care Advisory Committee, and more. We offer relaxation techniques, massage, aromatherapy, Reiki, acupuncture and other therapies to both patients and healthcare providers throughout the entire Medical Center and Shock Trauma to help with stress, pain and anxiety. We offer skilled services in our outpatient clinical practice, including acupuncture, psychotherapy and yoga therapy. We provide \"Integrative Wellness\" services to patients, families and staff at the Maryland Proton Treatment Center and are working to create similar programs in other departments. We participate with 20 other integrative medicine clinics in a practice-based research network to capture patient self-reported data, which preliminarily indicates that our outpatient care center significantly improves patients' pain, anxiety, depression and fatigue.

We teach our students that self-care is as important as caring for others in order to create a healthier world. We reach out into the community and beyond to make an impact and influence the field of integrative medicine and health. We are making a difference in the lives of thousands of people of all ages by using a multifaceted toolbox of therapies to encourage healing. 04 | ANNUAL REPORT FY2018RESEARCH | Advancing the Science of Integrative Medicine and Health 07 | ANNUAL REPORT FY2018 Since 1991, the Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine has been a worldwide leader in conducting rigorous research to determine the efficacy and effectiveness of integrative medical therapies and healthy lifestyle practices. As the evidence base supporting these therapies and lifestyle practices that our international cadre of collaborators has worked to produce has continued to grow, our research portfolio has adopted a concerted focus on researching integrative medicine and health in real-world settings to solve real-world problems. Our research in FY2018 involved people across the lifespan from pre-school and school-aged children to older adults. We are investigating ways to fight obesity, utilize nutrition to prevent and reverse chronic disease, and explore how integrative therapies can help in recovery and pain relief. Additionally, we are analyzing and disseminating the vast complementary medicine research from the entire world, making it accessible for decision-makers and patients through our National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded Cochrane CAM Field project. We also had 40 scientific articles about our work published in peer-reviewed journals this year! Elizabeth Parker, PhD, RD led a Mid-Atlantic Obesity Research Center-funded pilot and feasibility study to assess health-related behaviors and leadership practices among teachers. She recently presented preliminary results at the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Food and Nutrition Conference Expo, which examined health behaviors such as diet quality and body mass index, classroom practices (e.g. rewarding with food; punishment by withholding recess; role modeling healthy diet habits) and self-efficacy regarding classroom instruction focused on diet/physical activity among teachers in six urban schools participating in a childhood obesity prevention intervention. Results of this study indicated that teachers with healthier dietary quality have more healthy classroom practices and are more comfortable teaching nutrition and physical activity to students. The manuscript is currently in development. Dr. Elizabeth Parker is funded by the VA Maryland Health Care System to provide nutrition and weight loss counseling to older overweight and obese veterans enrolled in a clinical trial studying the effects of a multimodal exercise program on functional outcomes. The multimodal exercise program emphasizes improving balance and side-to-side movement, and building strength in the legs and core, through a variety of specially designed exercises. Participating on an NIH-funded pilot study with Avelino Verceles, PhD from the Department of Medicine, Dr. Parker collaborated to assess the effects of exercise, protein and electric stimulation on older, critically ill patient outcomes. As part of the study, patients were randomized to receive Intensive Care Unit usual care as the control group or an intervention which combined exercise, protein supplementation, and neuromuscular stimulation. The manuscript focused on the primary outcomes of this study is currently under development.WELLNESS IN SCHOOLS EXERCISE AND NUTRITION FOR OLDER ADULTS In a collaboration with Erin Hager, PhD in the Department of Pediatrics, Dr. Parker also investigated disparities in teacher and student school wellness leadership practices. Supported by funding from the University of Maryland Program in Health Disparities and Population Health, this was the first large, population-based study to examine implementation of classroom-level nutrition and physical activity best practices. Disparities in administrator-reported classroom practices exist in schools with the largest proportions of low-income students. The manuscript focused on these results is currently in development. The USDA AFRI Childhood Obesity Grant funded another joint project between Drs. Hager and Parker that studied approaches to enhance wellness policy implementation in schools. In order to promote healthy behaviors and prevent obesity, the schools were offered training and technical assistance for teachers and student wellness champions as well as technical support for wellness policy implementation. Dr. Parker serves as a co-investigator for this ongoing study and is also a co-author on the protocol paper which was recently published in Contemporary Clinical Trials.An obesity prevention program for preschoolers is being offered in local childcare centers as a collaboration between Dr. Parker and Maureen Black, PhD in the Department of Pediatrics. This project was funded by the National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases and will conclude in 2020. Dr. Parker serves as a co-investigator for this ongoing study. With funding from the JS Plank & DM DiCarlo Family Foundation, Chris D'Adamo, PhD and collaborators from The Institute for Integrative Health completed an outcomes evaluation of a teacher wellness program at Francis S. Key High School. This study analyzed an on-site fitness facility and wellness program for teachers at this public school in Baltimore using mixed methods outcomes, including wearable fitness devices. A manuscript focused on these results is currently in development. 06 | ANNUAL REPORT FY2018In a collaborative project with Deborah Stein, MD, MPH of R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center, the Department of Defense funded a study in which we aim to discover whether patients with spinal cord injury have increased functional recovery when treated with acupuncture. Our researchers, including Co-Principal Investigator Brian Jackson, LAc and Co-Investigator E. Blaine Guelde, CRNP, will look at long-term pain scores, self-reported pain interference, overall quality of life measurements, self-reported well-being and resilience and functional recovery in patients who receive acupuncture beginning in the acute care stages and will compare data to a control group. This study will wrap up in 2021.NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS FOR WELLNESS NUTRITION FOR OBESITY AND CANCERUSING MINDFUL BREATHING TO REDUCE IMPULSIVITY PAIN RESEARCH IN THE LAB SPIRITUALITY AND MENTAL HEALTHACUPUNCTURE FOR SPINAL CORD INJURIES Chris D'Adamo, PhD recently published the results of a clinical trial that demonstrated the efficacy of a low-dose iron nutritional supplement in resolving iron deficiency in premenopausal women. In addition to the efficacy, the clinical trial revealed that this commercially-available and food-based dietary supplement (MegaFood\u00ae Blood Builder\u00ae) was associated with none of the gastrointestinal complications or other adverse events that frequently interfere with compliance with higher-dose iron supplements. Dr. D'Adamo and his research team are recruiting participants for a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of a commercially-available herbal supplement (Designs for Health GlucoSupreme TM Herbal) in improving markers of glucose control among prediabetic adults. Dr. D'Adamo and his team are also recruiting for a randomized, placebo- controlled trial of another commercially-available dietary supplement (Nutramax Laboratories, Inc. Avmacol Immune\u00ae) for detoxification and immune function among a sample of healthy adults. Chris D'Adamo, PhD is collaborating with Adeel Kaiser, MD from the Department of Radiation Oncology and the Maryland Proton Treatment Center to investigate the effects of a ketogenic diet for overweight and obese men undergoing treatment for prostate cancer. This study, funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health - Nutrition Obesity Research Center, has been demonstrating feasibility and efficacy of this increasingly popular dietary approach. In a collaboration with University of Maryland College Park, Kevin Chen, PhD, MPH led an effort to teach college students mindfulness skills to reduce the impulsivity that often leads to substance abuse. This NIH-funded study has concluded, and data is being analyzed. In an NIH-funded pre-clinical trial, our basic science researcher Ruixin Zhang, PhD found that social support positively influences the affective components of pain. In another NIH-funded trial, he teamed up with Jin Ro, PhD in the School of Dentistry's Neural and Pain Sciences Lab to investigate age-related changes and how they affect the opioid receptors. This trial wraps up in 2019 and we look forward this data providing some additional answers to help fight the opioid crisis. In collaboration with Kenneth Pargament, PhD at Duke University, Michelle Pearce, PhD is helping to develop and empirically test an online training program that aims to give mental health professionals a knowledge-base in spirituality and spiritual-based concepts to better meet the needs of their clients. This project, funded by the John Templeton Foundation, will wrap up at the end of 2019. 09 | ANNUAL REPORT FY201808 | ANNUAL REPORT FY2018 11 | ANNUAL REPORT FY2018The Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field (CAM Field), part of the international non-profit Cochrane collaboration, is dedicated to improving the evidence base for complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine by supporting the production and dissemination of high-quality systematic reviews on CAM topics. The CAM Field is supported by the NIH, National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. Under the leadership of Dr. Brian Berman, this program has been continuously funded since 1996. In FY2018, we published an update of the 2010 Cochrane review of acupuncture for hip osteoarthritis, which reported that the evidence base for this intervention remains equivocal. We have now embarked on an update of the Cochrane review of acupuncture for knee osteoarthritis, a topic which has a more extensive evidence base, and the results of this update are expected in FY2019-20. Our Field faculty published an overview of the Cochrane systematic review evidence to date for probiotics and gastrointestinal conditions to provide guidance for the clinical use of probiotics and identify gaps in the current research. Our Field also supported the publication of 3 summaries and 2 clinician commentaries on CAM-related Cochrane reviews, including reviews on acupuncture, herbal medicine, yoga and music therapy. Additionally, we recently successfully competed for renewed NIH funding of the CAM Field through FY 2023. Our proposal placed CAM Field activities within a knowledge-to-action framework incorporating structured stakeholder engagement to identify priority review topics, engagement of partners in the production of reviews and related methodological products, and development of pathways to translate evidence into actionable formats suitable for a range of audiences. Our initial area of investigation will be the use of complementary therapies for chronic non-cancer pain. The results of our initial prioritization of review topics and an associated publication is expected in 2019. IMPROVING THE EVIDENCE BASE FOR INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE CAM Field specialized register of trials recordsCAM-related Cochrane Reviews 81K 782 CAM-related Cochrane Protocols 239AS OF THE END OF FY2018 PATIENT CARE | Healing Across the Continuum Integrative Medicine combines the best of evidence-based complementary therapies with conventional medical care. For example, integrative therapies give physicians more tools to decrease opioid use/abuse/ death. As experts in pain management, our team participates on opioid crisis committees at the local and national levels looking for ways to beat the addiction and save more lives while still curbing pain. Several of our team members serve on local and national boards seeking to end opioid abuse and help patients with pain management without the use of pharmaceuticals. We are using these findings and other skills in all our patient care practices. OUTPATIENT CARE Our services included: Acupuncture and Psychotherapy We cared for patients at: University of Maryland Rehabilitation & Orthopaedic Institute (2nd Floor) and University of Maryland Immediate Care (acupuncture only) Patients cared for: 753 unique patients seen resulting in 3,860 encounters To support sustainability and resilience, a major goal this year was to decrease financial deficit in the outpatient clinical practice, CIM phased out all outpatient services other than acupuncture and psychotherapy from the UMROI location. As a result, the operating loss was reduced by an additional 68.9%. However, acupuncture and psychotherapy services volume were maintained at relatively constant levels. Due to the current insurance-based model, we will be making additional changes in FY2019. Through our work with the PRIMIER practice-based research network, which consists of 22 collaborators, we have collected self-reported data using the National Institutes of Health-developed and validated PROMIS measures. Participation continued in FY2018, data collection is still underway, concluding in late 2018.10 | ANNUAL REPORT FY201813 | ANNUAL REPORT FY2018INPATIENT CARE Our services include: Our team was both popular and efficient, but the insurance- based financial model is not conducive for sustainability of this kind of work. We are in the process of changing the way we practice to be more fiscally responsible while still offering gold-standard patient-centered care.

COLLABORATIVE CARE FUTURE PLANS Consultations with Naturopathic Doctor or Integrative Nurse Practitioner Yoga Therapy Meditation Nutritional Counseling Therapeutic/Oncology Massage Acupuncture Weekly Self-Care Education Classes We cared for patients at: Maryland Proton Treatment Center Patients cared for: 1,134 individual sessions from January 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018 The \"Integrative Wellness Team,\" a contract services arrangement, was set up as a service differentiator at the Maryland Proton Treatment Center but has also proven to be a \"life-changer\" for many patients and their families. Many of the services can also be used by family members and staff, including the self-care sessions classes. Read about Nisa Phelps, one of our patients on the MPTC website: http:/ /www.mdproton.com/Meet-Our-Patients/Nisa-Breast-Patient.Our services include: In an effort to offer highest quality patient-centered care while being fiscally responsible, we are in the midst of collaborative explorations with departments who have similar goals. In addition to the survivorship program at Greenbaum Cancer Center, we have been in discussions with leaders of the Palliative Care, Orthopedics, Psychiatry, and Anesthesiology departments in an effort to include integrative therapies to the services already offered by these departments. We anticipate that a model like MPTC will not only expand the scope of services these strong departments offer but will also meet the deeper needs of their patients. Our collaborations and trainings, in combination with increased service agreements, will create resilience, sustainability and patient satisfaction, and we look forward to putting these joint ventures in to play. 12 | ANNUAL REPORT FY2018Baltimore was the \"host site\" for the International Congress on Integrative Medicine and Health from May 8 - 11, 2018. Ten of our team members and an additional eight colleagues and students presented a total of 18 posters and live workshops at this event. In addition, team members presented over 100 posters, presentations, and/or workshops in local, national and international forums. INTERNATIONAL OUTREACH AND PRESENTATIONSPROFESSIONAL EDUCATION AND/OR TRAINING COURSES Our first Applied Integrative Medicine Training Program for Health Care Professionals was a 9-month course that gave health professionals hands-on experience and intimate knowledge of Integrative Medicine and how to bring it into their practices. We had 10 participants who gave all positive feedback. We plan to add online modules for our next session. The Healing Pathways program, offered in the spring, teaches self- care and mind-body skills to nurses and other individuals. Fourteen participants grew with us and many are continuing on to our 200-hour Yoga Teacher Training. Our 200-hour Yoga Teacher Training program taught 24 students to be yoga teachers and Reiki Masters. This is one of our most successful trainings and uses the healthcare experience of our program leaders as a differentiator from standard programs. Advanced Yoga Teacher Training Modules, which educates experienced yoga teachers on special populations, included Yoga for Business, Yoga for Kids, and Prenatal Yoga modules. These were very popular and many more are planned for the upcoming year. We co-sponsored Integrative Ayurveda Training again this year, which is both online and offers a live workshop in the fall. This training now offers specialized sessions for health care providers separate from health educators and health-conscious community members.EDUCATION | Teaching Healthcare Professionals and the Community Educating healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, chiropractors, massage therapists, yoga teachers, and more, is an important step toward creating a culture of health and wellness. Our education program touched many lives this year. Our two one-month intensive medical student electives in Integrative Medicine teach evidence-informed whole patient care. Our students learn to create integrative treatment plans to help their patients manage pain, anxiety, insomnia, depression, end of life concerns and more. Concepts of wellness, health promotion and disease prevention are woven throughout the course. Most importantly, they develop the skills to create high quality integrative medicine patient treatment plans that they can immediately implement in their own practices. We believe that doctors need to attend to their own wellness in order to effectively shepherd others to health. That's why we have our students actively practice their newly learned wellness skills - on themselves! We are very pleased to report that our integrative medicine elective improves medical student self-care. INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE IN MEDICAL SCHOOLS In addition, we offered \"Nutrition and Popular Diets\" to all second-year medical students in Foundations of Disease. Additional lectures were presented to Epidemiology & Public Health students, Department of Endocrinology, School of Physical Therapy, University of Maryland College Park in Nutritional Epidemiology, and others. In partnership with UMB's Wellness Hub, CIM faculty gave workshops on \"Writing for Wellness.\" Our team presented many lectures for the UMB Human Resources Office's \"Launch Your Life\" program, including several nutrition topics, yoga and Pilates classes. 15 | ANNUAL REPORT FY201814 | ANNUAL REPORT FY201807 | ANNUAL REPORT FY2018For the community, we offered a spring session of Self-Healing Retreat for Patients with Cancer or Chronic Illness and Their Families, which received all positive reviews from the 8 participants. This unique week-long retreat gives participants self-care skills that allow for better recovery. We also participated in the School of Medicine's Mini-Med School that offers underserved children in the Baltimore area the opportunity to learn about wellness and healthy lifestyles. Our team members continued to be sought-after experts for many health care and integrative medicine topics. In FY2018, they were featured more than 20 times in print, radio and online media outlets. (See full list in Appendix.)COMMUNITY EDUCATION FUTURE PLANS In addition to continuing to offer our Healing Pathways, Yoga Teacher Continuing Education, and our 200-hour Yoga Teacher Training programs, we are very excited to announce that we are now an Approved Professional Development Program Provider for the International Association of Yoga Therapists. Beginning in 2019, we will be expanding our programming to include continuing education credit for Certified Yoga Therapists. Our first two courses will start in the spring and include Yoga for Stroke and Yoga Therapy in Integrative Cancer Care. We will offer additional courses in the future.In the fall of 2019, we will also be offering a 300-hour pilot program for licensed health care providers who want to learn about yoga therapy and how to integrate the modalities into their health care practices.
