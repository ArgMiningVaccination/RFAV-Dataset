INTEREST OF AMICI1 The American Cancer Society, American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association, and its division, the American Stroke Association, American Lung Association, Crohn's & Colitis Foundation, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Epilepsy Foundation, Global Healthy Living Foundation, Hemophilia Federation of America, Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, March of Dimes, National Allianc e on Mental Illness, National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, National Hemophilia Foundation, National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and The Kennedy Forum (collectively, \"Amici \") represent millions of patients and consumers across the country facing serio us, acute, chronic health conditions. As organizations that fight to prevent, treat, and cure some of the most deadly diseases, Amici and the millions of Americans they represent would be among those hit hardest if the lower court's invalidation of the AC A is allowed to stand\u2014 particularly because many of the individuals Amici represent have preexisting conditions and depend directly on the protections provided by the ACA. 1 In accordance with Fed. R. App. P. 29(a)(2), Amici received consent to file this brief from counsel for each of the parties . Per Fed. R. App. P. 29(a)(4)(E), Amici certify that this brief was authored in whole by counsel for Amici and that no part of the brief was authored by any attorney for a party. No party, nor any other person or entity, made any mone tary contribution to the preparation or submission of this Case: 19-10011 Document: 00514896778 Page: 12 Date Filed: 04/01/2019 2 Because extensive scientific research establishes a strong link between lack of healt h insurance and poorer medical outcomes, Amici advocate for affordable, adequate, and accessible health insurance that is easy to understand.2 Many Amici were actively involved in Congress's enactment of the ACA in 2010 and opposed repeal efforts in subse quent years. Amici are uniquely able to assist the Court in understanding why the Act is crucial to millions of patients, survivors, and their families. In this brief, Amici demonstrate how the ACA, and health insurance generally, are critical in addres sing and defeating the diseases that Amici 's constituents fight every day. If the lower court's extraordinary decision to invalidate the ACA is allowed to stand, the forthcoming disruption to the status quo\u2014a status quo in place and preserved by Congress \u2014will substantially harm disease sufferers and the public interest.3 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT All Americans use or will use health-care services, and the lifetime risk that individual Americans will acquire one of the diseases or conditions that Amici represen t is high. Moreover, the costs of treating such serious conditions are often 2 Consensus Health Care Reform Principles , AM. CANCER SOC'Y CANCER ACTION NETWORK ET AL., http://www.heart.org/idc/groups/heart - public/@wcm/@adv/documents/downloadable/ucm_492352.pdf (last visited Mar. 31, 2019). 3 Additional information about each of the individual Amici and the specific interests and constituents they serve is included in the Addendum filed 3 staggering and beyond the financial means of most individuals and families. The question is not whether individual Americans will incur health care expenses but how those expenses will be financed. Without the health care provided by the ACA, access to vital health -care services and the quality of health outcomes diminishes, making it more difficult to manage the myriad of chronic diseases that Amici help Americans fight every day. Not many Americans have the means to pay for adequate treatment of these diseases without insurance coverage \u2014for most Americans, insurance is a not a luxury, but a prerequisite to obtaining treatment. Not only are the financial burdens of medical care staggering to uninsured Americans, but uninsured status comes with a tragic consequence: many individuals choose to forgo screening and treatment rather than taking on the financial burden of paying out- of-pocket. Without early detection, serious disease s become more difficult and costly to treat and have poorer medical outcomes. Congress is aware of this reality \u2014it reviewed the scientific data when it passed the ACA in 2010. During 2017, amidst public outcry to protect the Act and data tying lack of aff ordable health insurance to more costly and longer -term treatment, Congress chose not to repeal the ACA despite lengthy consideration and debate.4 4 The Better Care Reconciliation Act failed 43 -57 in the Senate. The Better Care Reconciliation Act 4 Congress's choice to preserve the ACA was a decision that has proven critical to preserving insurance cover age for many Americans, including those living with chronic diseases: ACA repeal would have resulted in 17 million Americans losing their insurance in 2018, with the total reaching 27 million by 2020. C ONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE , H.R. 1628, Obamacare -congress -2017 -2018/costestimate/52939- hr1628amendment.pdf. Indeed, members of Congress on both sides of the aisle were emphatic that critical protections not be repealed without a replacement that would ensure patients had access to care. See 163 CONG. REC. S4227, S4227 -96 07-26-pt1-PgS4227 -9.pdf. And with good reason \u2014as the data illustrates, the ACA has resulted in greatly improved access to affordable medical care for Americans dealing with chronic illnesses. The lower court's ruling does precisely what Congress considered and chose not to do. Congress expressly rejected a \"re peal-without -replace\" scenario that would have left millions of Americans without adequate coverage \u2014a policy decision properly in the province of the legislature, not the court. See King v. Burwell , 135 S. Ct. 2480, 2496 (2015) (stating that the power to make the laws rests with Congress, and because Congress passed the ACA to improve the Date Filed: 04/01/2019 5 insurance market, courts must interpret the Act consistent with that goal). By invalidating the ACA over Congress's clear intent to the contrary, the lower court' s decision will have life -altering implications for patients with chronic diseases. ARGUMENT I. AFFORDABLE, ACCESSIBLE HEALTH CARE IS ESSENTIAL IN MANAGING CHRONIC DISEASES \"Everyone will eventually need health care at a time and to an extent they cannot predict.\" Nat'l Fed'n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius (\" NFIB\"), 567 U.S. 519 (2012). There is also a pervasive need for health care in connection with the most serious diseases\u2014 diseases that are the focus of Amici 's efforts: An estimated 1.7 million Americans will be diagnosed with cancer in 2019, and more than 15.5 million Americans with a history of cancer were alive on January 1, 2016. Approximately four out of ten men and n early four out of ten women in the U.S. will develop cancer in their lifetime. Cancer Facts and Figures 2019, AM.

Without affordable, accessible health insurance, patients and their families must bear t he burden of substantial health-care costs and later -stage diagnoses, as well as risk being denied the life - saving care they need. Good health and the chance for positive outcomes when dealing with illness should not be dependent upon a person's ability to pay for care. Patients with early -stage cancer should not forego potentially life -saving chemotherapy treatments because they cannot afford them. Americans with diabetes should not Case: 19-10011 Document: 00514896778 Page: 18 Date Filed: 04/01/2019 8 be forced to delay costly treatment or ration their life -saving insulin for so long that they lose a limb due to amputation. Americans experiencing heart -attack symptoms should not be reluctant to call 9 -1-1 and lose access to quick diagnosis and treatment in a hospital out of concern that they cannot afford an emergency - depa rtment bill. Parents should not be forced to take children to the emergency department because they could not afford asthma medication that would have prevented an exacerbation. Patients with MS should not be financially unable to continue treatment, as lack of treatment increases the frequency and severity of relapses and disability and reduces years of survival. Americans are forced to make these financially motivated choices when insurance is unavailable, yet these choices can mean the difference betw een life and death. Congress passed the ACA to improve Americans' access to health care. As nonpartisan organizations dedicated to studying and preventing the devastating impact of these diseases, Amici know firsthand that access to affordable, basic, preventive health care and life -saving treatments are fundamental to successful health outcomes. II. THE ACA HAS IMPROVED ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE, REDUCING FINANCIAL BURDENS AND IMPROVING MEDICAL OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS WITH LIFE - THREATENING AND CHRONIC DISEASES Since its enactment, the ACA has been successful in reducing: (i) the financial burden of necessary medical expenses; (ii) the uninsured rates among Case: and (iii) the demonstrable gap between household income and insurance coverage. Congr ess's enactment of the ACA was spurred by the failures of our health-care system and the high costs of health insurance: these well- known failures hurt both the nation's economic well- being and the health and well -being of individual Americans. See 42 U.S .C. \u00a7 18091(2)(E) (explaining that the nation's economy \"loses up to $207,000,000,000 a year because of the poorer health and shorter lifespan of the uninsured.\"). Prior to Congressional enactment of the ACA, the mere prospect of the exorbitant cost of fi ghting chronic diseases frequently caused uninsured Americans to delay or forgo necessary screening and treatment at the expense of their well- being. Improving access to health care by making coverage more affordable was a primary reason why Congress passed the ACA. NFIB , 567 U.S. at 538 (\"The Act aims to increase the number of Americans covered by health insurance and decrease the cost of health care.\") And the ACA has proven to be up to the challenge: the Act has made significant progress in reducing the problems faced by Americans dealing with chronic diseases. A. The financial burden accompanying necessary medical care for uninsured Americans fighting chronic disease is staggering. Prior to the enactment of the ACA, uninsured Americans with chronic diseases were often unable to receive necessary treatment or went into crushing debt to obtain medical care.

Himmelstein et al., Medical Bankruptcy in the United States, 2007: Results of a National Study , 122 A M. J. MED. 741, 745 (2009). Among families with high levels of medical debt resulting in bankruptcy, those who suffered a stroke averaged out- of-pocket medical costs of $23,380, and those with heart disea se averaged medical costs of $21,955. Id. Prior to the ACA, approximately 7.3 million (or 15 percent of) adults who reported having CVD were uninsured, and nearly one of four cardiovascular disease patients and one of three stroke patients had gone witho ut coverage at some point since their diagnosis\u2014 more than half cited cost as the reason they lacked coverage. See FACTS: Breaking Down the Barriers: The Uninsured with Heart Disease and Stroke , AM.

The cost of disease - modifying treatment is extremely high, averaging $81,731 per MS patient per year in 2017. Daniel M. Hartung, Economics and Cost -Effectiveness of Multiple Sclerosis Therapies in the USA, 14:4 N EUROTHERAPEUTICS 1018 (2017). Diabetes poses a substantial financial burden on the 30 million people who live with the disease. People with diagnosed diabetes incur average medical expenditures of $16,750 per year. Weny a Yang, Economic Costs of Diabetes in the U.S. in 2017, 41 DIABETES CARE 917 (2018). And, for millions of people with diabetes, including all people with type 1 diabetes, access to insulin is a matter of life and death. Yet, the cost of insulin nearly tr ipled between 2002 and 2013. William T. Cefalu et al., Insulin Access and Affordability Working Group: Conclusions and Recommendations , 41 DIABETES CARE 1301 (2018). For the one -in-twenty -six Americans who develop epilepsy in their lifetimes, the annual cost of epilepsy -specific health care can approach $20,000. Charles U. Begley & Tracy L. Durgin, The Direct Cost of Epilepsy to the United States: A Systematic Review of the Estimates, 56 EPILEPSY BEHAV . 1376 (2015), https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/epi.13084. When Americans with epilepsy cannot get the correct treatment, it places a high financial strain on the system: epilepsy -related medical costs associated with uncontrolled epilepsy are two to ten times higher than costs associated w ith controlled epilepsy. Id. Case: 19-10011 Document: 00514896778 Page: 22 Date Filed: 04/01/2019 12 Likewise, in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, corticosteroid - sparing therapy (such as biologics) has proven necessary in order to optimize long- term health outcomes for patients and maximize their quality of life. The cost of this treatment, however, is around $36,051 per year. Helen Yu et al., Market Share and Costs of Biologic Therapies for Inflammatory Bowel Disease in the United States , 47 ALIMENTARY PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS 364 (2018). For patients with hemophilia, the cost of routine treatment is enormous: depending on the severity of the disease, treatment for hemophilia can approach $60,000 per month. Joanne Volk, Affordable Care Act's Ban on Lifetime Limits Has Ended Martin Addie's Coverage Circus, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY HEALTH POLICY INSTITUTE , patients averages $156,000 in the year following diagnosis, with the cost of treatment for certain blood-cancer subtypes averaging as high as $800,000 in the first year. Gabriela Dieguez et al., The Cost Burden of Blood Cancer Care , MILLIMAN RESEARCH REPORT (Oct. 2018) https://www.ll s.org/sites/default/files/Milliman%20study%20cost%20burden%20o f%20blood%20cancer%20care.pdf. The data above represents a microcosm of the financial burden that uninsured Americans seeking treatment for chronic conditions often face. Case: 19-10011 Document: 00514896778 more worr isome is the fact that without insurance, many patients are unwilling to incur these costs, putting their well- being\u2014 and often, their lives\u2014at risk. B. Prior to Congressional enactment of the ACA, uninsured Americans often delayed treatment due to the costs o f medical care. Prior to the ACA, uninsured Americans often chose to delay or forgo treatment altogether \u2014shortening their own lives or worsening their conditions \u2014 rather than incur the financial strain associated with receiving care. Even without the obvio us, negative medical consequences of forgoing treatment, uninsured Americans fighting chronic conditions without financial reserves were often at risk of exacerbating their poor -health outcomes due to their financial condition alone.5 Lack of preventive c are and delayed treatment result in uninsured patients with poorer health outcomes who require more costly, long- term, and invasive treatment than individuals with insurance. See, e.g. , NFIB , 567 U.S. at 594 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (\"When sickness fina lly drives the uninsured to seek care, once treatable conditions have escalated into grave health problems, requiring more costly and extensive intervention.\"). 5 In interviews with lung and colorectal cancer patients, 33 to 40 percent of the patients reported having limited financial reserves: these patients also reported s ignificantly increased pain, greater symptom burden, and poorer quality of life. Christopher S. Lathan et al., Association of Financial Strain With Symptom Burden and Quality of Life for Patients With Lung or Colorectal Cancer , 34 Prior to the enactment of the ACA, 34 percent of individuals under age 65 who had cancer or a history of cancer reported delaying care in the preceding twelve months because of cost. A National Poll: Facing Cancer in the Health Care System , AM. CANCER SOC'Y CANCER ACTION NETWORK (2010), at 17, https://www.acscan.org/sites/default/files/National%20Documents/ACS_CAN_Pol ling_Report_7.27.10.pdf. More specifically, 29 percent delayed needed health care, 19 percent delayed getting a recommended cancer test or treatment, and 22 percent delayed a routine cancer check -up. Id. at 18. Being uninsured affec ts health outcomes for cancer patients at every step of treatment: patients delay preventive screenings due to cost; the cancer is not discovered until it has developed to an advanced stage as a result; or those individuals who actually receive treatment are subject to more invasive and aggressive medical interventions. In a study that included nearly 850,000 patients with malignant tumors, uninsured patients were more than four times as likely to be diagnosed with advanced -stage breast cancer and 1.4 ti mes more likely to be diagnosed with colorectal cancer. In all cases, the five -year survival rate for patients with advanced cancer was significantly smaller than that of patients with less advanced cancer. Elizabeth M. Ward et al., The Association of Insurance and Stage at Case: 19-10011 Document: 00514896778 Page: 25 Date Filed: 04/01/2019 15 Diagnosis Among Patients Aged 55 to 74 Years in the National Cancer Database , 16 CANCER J. 614, 619 (2010). Similarly, a 2014 study showed that adolescents and young adults without insurance are at higher risk of advanced stage cance r diagnosis. See Anthony Robbins et al., Insurance Status and Distant -Stage Disease at Diagnosis Among Adolescent and Young Adult Patients with Cancer Aged 15 to 39 Years: National Cancer Data Base, 2004 Through 2010 , 120 C ANCER 1212 (2014). Uninsured females aged 15 to 39 were nearly twice as likely as those with private insurance to be diagnosed with cancer that has metastasized; uninsured males in that age group were 1.5 times as likely as those with private insurance to be diagnosed with metastatic ca ncer. Id. at 1214. A patient's inability to get screenings and treatment comes at a cost. Strikingly, the five -year l ung cancer survival rate is only five percent for those diagnosed at a late stage after the tumor has spread, but increases to 56 perce nt for those diagnosed at an early stage before the tumor has spread. See SEER Cancer Statistics Review 1975- 2015 , NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE , SURVEILLANCE , AND END RESULTS PROGRAM , https://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_20 15/browse_csr.php?section SEL=15&pageSEL=sect_15_table.12.html. Furthermore, a 2009 Harvard Medical School study found approximately 45,000 deaths annually could be attributed to lack of health insurance among Case: 19-10011 Document: 00514896778 Page: 26 Date Filed: 04/01/2019 16 working -age Americans. These uninsured Americans had a 40 percent higher risk of death than their privately insured counterparts. Andrew P. Wilper et al., Health Insurance and Mortality in US Adults , 99 A M. J. PUB. HEALTH 2289, 2292 (2009). Not having access to insurance is associated with mortality despite advances in medical therapeutics. See id. at 2294. With respect to heart disease, an American Heart Association survey found that more than half of the cardiovascular patients responding reported difficulty paying for medical care. A M. HEART ASS'N, Affordable Access to Health Care , supra . Consequently, 46 percent of chronically ill patients said they had delayed getting needed medical care, 28 percent who took regular medication had not filled a prescription, and nearly 30 percent had delayed a screening test prior to diagnosis. Id. Fewer than half of uninsured adults had their cholesterol checked within the recommended timeframe. Sara R. Collins et al., Insuring the Future: Current T rends in Health Coverage and the Effects of Implementing the Affordable Care Act: Findings from the Commonwealth Fund Biennial Health Insurance Survey, 2012 , THE COMMONWEALTH FUND (2013), a heart attack, uninsured patients are more likely to delay seeking medical care because of the financial implications.

AM. MED. ASS'N 1392, 1395 -99 (2010). MS patients are no different. A 2007 survey concluded that 27.4 percent had postponed seeking needed health care because of the expense, and 22.3 percent delayed filling prescriptions, skipped doses of medications, or split pills because of costs. L.I.

Similarly, 36 percent indicated spending less on basic needs such as food or heat to pay for their MS -related expens es. Id. at 544. Stopping treatment\u2014which can occur when financial pressures mount\u2014 has been shown to have a negative impact on MS patients, including an increase in the frequency and severity of relapses or worsening symptoms. Bruce Cohen et al., MS Therapy Adherence & Relapse Risk, 80:7 NEUROLOGY (2013), http://n.neurology.org/conten t/80/7_Supplement/P01.193. Without health insurance to defray the costs of MS treatment, most patients living with the disease are not able to access their prescribed medici nes, therapies, supportive services and equipment. Uninsured individuals with diabetes show the same patterns. \"Among persons aged 18 to 64 with diabetes mellitus, those who had no health insurance Case: 19-10011 Document: 00514896778 Page: 28 Date Filed: 04/01/2019 18 during the preceding year were six times as likely to for go needed medical care as those who were continuously insured.\" J.B.

Flavin et al., Health Insurance and the Development of Diabetic Complications , 102 S. MED. J. 805, 807 (2009). Lack of health insur ance also delays diagnosis and treatment, increasing the risks of complications. Diabetes went undiagnosed in 42.2 percent of individuals without health insurance, compared to 25.9 percent of those with insurance. Xuanping Zhang et al., The Missed Patien t with Diabetes: How Access to Health Care Affects the Detection of Diabetes, 31 DIABETES CARE 1748, 1749 04/01/2019 19 Similarly, the cost of insulin has caused patients with diabetes to ration insulin or skip doses because they simply cannot afford it, even though this practice can lead to serious and even deadly complications. Cefalu et al., supra , at 1306. Patients may need several vials of insulin a month. With the list price of a single vial of insulin over $300, lack of insurance for a person with dia betes can be devastating. Sarah J. Tribble, Several Probes Target Insulin Drug Pricing, KAISER HEALTH NEWS (Oct. 28, 2017), https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health - ommunity, 66.3 percent of surveyed patients reported health- care related financial worry prior to 2014, and 25.4 percent of patients reported delaying medical care with cost concerns cited as a major factor.

Case: 19-10011 Document: 00514896778 Page: 31 Date Filed: 04/01/2019 21 Prior to the enactment of the ACA, uninsured Americans w ere left with an impossible choice \u2014place themselves and their families in financial peril or forgo getting the treatment they needed. Congress passed the ACA to eliminate this untenable choice, and the ACA has largely risen to the occasion. C. Congress's enactment and preservation of the ACA has significantly reduced Americans' financial burden and allowed Americans who need treatment the most to receive it. Since Congress enacted the ACA, the Act has significantly improved circumstances for individuals with chronic diseases. Uninsured rates among nonelderly adults decreased by 6.3 percent between the fourth quarter of 2013 and the fourth quarter of 2016. Benjamin D. Sommers et al., Early Changes in Health Insurance Coverage under the Trump Administration, 3 78 NEW ENG. J. MED. 1061 (2018), https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29539288. The data is even more striking when factoring in household income. The gap in insurance coverage between households with an annual income below $25,000 and those above $75,00 0 fell from 31 percent to 17 percent (a relative reduction of 46 percent) in Medicaid expansion states, and from 36 percent to 28 percent in non-expansion states. Kevin Griffith et al., The Affordable Care Act Reduced Socioeconomic Disparities In Health C are Access , The ACA has had a direct benefit on Americans living with chronic conditions including arthritis, migraine, cardiovascular disease, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, and osteoporosis. Over 606,277 adults aged 18 to 64 suffering from these chronic con ditions received increased coverage and medical access due to the ACA. Hugo Torres et al., Coverage and Access for Americans with Chronic Disease under the Affordable Care Act: A Quasi-Experimental Study , 166 ANNALS studies conducted from 1999 through 2012 confirm that individuals with Medicaid coverage were more likely than uninsured individuals to have at least one outpatient physician visit annually.

A survey of the impact of Medicaid expansion\u2014which compared Kentucky and Arkansas with Texas, a non -expansion state \u2014also showed that gaining coverage under the ACA was associated with a $337 re duction in annual out- of- pocket spending and a 25 percent increase in blood glucose screening.

Similarly, the ACA's coverage expansion for dependent children up to age 26 has: (i) increased the insurance -coverage rate among that population; (ii) had a positive effect on initiation and completion of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination; (i ii) resulted in more early diagnosis and receipt of fertility - sparing treatments for cervical cancer; and (iv) increased early -stage diagnosis for cancer among young adults 19 to 25 years old.

The proportion of cancer survivors reporting delayed or forgone care and inability to afford health care services also significantly decreased after the AC A was passed from 2010 to 2016. Ryan D. Nipp et al., Patterns in Health Care Access and Affordability among Cancer Survivors During Implementation of the Affordable Care Act , JAMA ONCOLOGY (Mar. 29, 2018).

This improvement resulted in 5.5 million women being able to access health care to \"help them get healthy before they got pregnant, and to protect their health during and after pregnancy and childbirth.\" Id. The proportion of young women who reported delaying or forgoing care due to cost concerns dropped by 3.4 percentage points.

Congress's policy -based decision to pass and preserve the ACA has resulted in both the reduction of financial burdens on Americans and the improvement of medical outcomes for patients with chronic diseases. III. THE LOWER COURT'S DECISION TO INVALIDATE THE ACA IGNORES CONGRESS'S POLICY -BASED DECISION TO PRESERVE THE ACA BECAUSE THE ACA HAS IMPROVED ACCESS TO MUCH -NEEDED, AFFORDABLE INSURANCE Congress's conscious choice to preserve the ACA after lengthy debate was meant to ensure that the significant progress made in reducing the medical and financial problems faced by individuals with chronic diseases was not lost. If the ACA were eliminated in its entirety, the number of uninsured Americans would increase by 19.9 million or 65 percent. Linda J. Blumberg et al., State -by-State Estimates of the Coverage and Funding Consequences of Full Repeal of the ACA, URBAN INSTITUTE : HEALTH POLICY CENTER 2 (Mar. 2019), https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/100000/repeal_of_the_ aca_by_state.pdf (reflecting data collected in 2019) ; see also CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE , supra (contemplating that 17 million Americans would lose their insurance in 2018 if the ACA were repealed, without the benefit of 2019 data) 19-10011 Document: 00514896778 Page: 37 Date Filed: 04/01/2019 27 Congress was explicitly unwilling to leave millions without coverage in a \"repeal -without -replace\" scenario. See 163 CONG. -9.pdf. By invalidating the ACA in its entirety, the lower court substituted its own judgment for Congress's policy -based decision, threatening the significant progress the ACA has made in getting patients the medical care they need. In enacting the ACA, Congress was made aware of \u2014and relied on\u2014data establishing that people have poorer health outcomes and require more costly, long-term treatment without affordable health insurance. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18091(2 )(E) (\"The economy loses up to $207,000,000,000 a year because of the poorer health and shorter lifespan of the uninsured. By significantly reducing the number of the uninsured, the requirement, together with the other provisions of this Act, will significantly reduce this economic cost.\"). The Supreme Court has recognized that the broad policy goals of the Act were \"to increase the number of Americans covered by health insurance and decrease the cost of health care.\" NFIB , 567 U.S. at 519. In King v. Burwell, the Court emphasized that such policy goals are the province of the legislature, not the courts. 135 S. Ct. at 2496. And, as discussed above and recognized by the Supreme Court, individuals without health insurance are less likely to receive Case: 19-10011 Document: 00514896778 Page: 38 Date Filed: 04/01/2019 28 preventive treatment or early detection screenings and are more likely to delay treatment. See, e.g. , NFIB , 567 U.S. at 594 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (\"Because those without insurance generally lack access to preventative care, they do not receive treatment for conditions \u2014like hypertension and diabetes\u2014that can be successfully and affordably treated if diagnosed early on.\") (citing Institute of Medicine, INSURING AMERICA 'S HEALTH , PRINCIPLES AND RECOMMENDATIONS 43 (2004), https://www.nap.edu/catalog/10874/in suring-americas -health -principles - and-recommendations). Congress passed the ACA to address the known failures of the health- insurance market and the tragic consequences those failures have on patients and their families. By making health insurance available to all eligible individuals regardless of financial status, the ACA helps protect patients from the negative financial and medical outcomes of being uninsured or underinsured. Congress decided that preserving the ACA was the best way to continue impr oving access to much -needed, affordable insurance \u2014a worthy policy goal that falls squarely on Congress. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, Amici respectfully request that the Court reverse the lower court's ruling. Congress, in repealing only one, discrete provision of the ACA, did not repeal the whole Act or its important provisions designed to provide Case: 19-10011 Document: 00514896778 Page: 39 Date Filed: 04/01/2019 29 access to health care. On the contrary, the ACA has operated, and should continue to operate, to help patients and survivors of chronic disease \u2014exactl y as Congress intended. Respectfully submitted, /s/ Beth W.
