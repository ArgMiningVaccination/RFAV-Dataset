The Parasite Candida Cleanse targets parasites and yeast in the body, while the Tummy Teatox focuses on cleansing the entire digestive system. Our Full-Body Detox opens up the seven elimination pathways to remove accumulated waste from the body that makes us toxic. This toxicity primarily comes from unhealthy foods and undigested food sitting in our gut that makes us have fatigue, brain fog, digestive issues, sleep issues, and more. A Full-Body Detox is like an oil change and tune-up but for the human body! Supplies Needed: two 32-ounce jars, a tablespoon, and natural spring water. Instructions: You will receive two different herbal blends with your 14-Day Detox. A Parasite Candida Cleanse and Tummy Teatox blend. On a daily basis, you will be adding two FLAT tablespoons of the Parasite Candida Cleanse herbal blend in one jar, and two FLAT tablespoons of the Tummy Teatox blend in a SEPARATE jar. Bring 64 ounces of water to a boil then pour 32 ounces into the Parasite Candida Jar and 32 ounces of water into the Tummy Teatox jar then seal the lid. Allow the herbs to steep overnight or for at least 6 hours. Begin drinking either herbal mix (your choice) the first thing every morning. Try to finish both teas by 5:00 PM or at least 3-4 hours before bedtime to avoid late-night bathroom trips. Do not eat while drinking the herbal infusions. Wait at least thirty minutes after drinking the herbal infusion on an empty stomach to begin eating or wait a least an hour after you finish eating to begin drinking again. DO NOT mix the herbal infusions together (Do NOT add anything to them). Wait at least an hour between drinking the herbal infusions. During the 14-Days you will be eating a Plant-based Vegan diet. So no meat, fish, dairy (cheese, milk, yogurt, etc), or eggs. This could include smoothies, green juices, fruits, veggie plates, salads, wraps, etc. Parasite Candida Ingredients: flower, Neem leaf, Oregano Slippery Elm bark.
