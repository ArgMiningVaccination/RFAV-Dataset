American Association of Poison Control Centers, Washington, DC Background. The American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC; http://www.aapcc .org) maintains the national database of information logged by the country's 61 Poison Con- trol Centers (PCCs). Ca se records in this da tabase are from self- reported calls: they reflect only information provided when the public or healthcare professionals report an actual or potential exposure to a substance (e.g., an ingestion, inhalation, or topical exposure.), or request informatio n/educational materials. Expo- sures do not necessarily represen t a poisoning or overdose. The AAPCC is not able to completely verify the accuracy of every report made to member centers. Additional exposures may go unreported to PCCs, and data referenced from the AAPCC should not be construed to repr esent the complete incidence of national exposures to any substa nce(s). U.S. Poison Centers make possible the compilation and reporting of this report through their staffs' meticulous documentation of each case using stan- dardized definitions and compatible computer systems.

The AAPCC compiles the informationreported by the regional PCCs into its national database. These data are used to identify hazar ds early, focus prevention educa- tion, guide clinical re search, direct traini ng, chemi- cal/bioterrorism incidents. AAPCC data have promptedproduct reformulations, repack aging, recalls, and bans; are used to support regulatory actions; and contribute to post-mar-keting surveillance on newly released drugs and products. From its inception in 1983, the AAPCC's number of poi- sonings and exposures reported by the country's PCCs hasgrown dramatically, with increases in the number of participat- ing poison centers, population served by those centers, and reported human exposures (Table 1A) (1-22). Database Fluidity Information in the AAPCC's database is dynamic, with fol- low-up calls and updated inform ation allowing for changes in coding of some cases over time. The information reported inthis article reflects only th ose cases classified as: TABLE 1A Growth of the AAPCC Toxic Exposure Surveillance System (TESS\u00ae) database YearNo. of participating centersPopulation served (in millions)Human exposures reportedExposures per thousand population 1983 16 43.1 251,012 5.8 1984 47 99.8 730,224 7.31985 56 113.6 900,513 7.9 1986 57 132.1 Human exposures to substances as reported to U.S. Poison Control Centers (PCCs) and transmitted to the AAPCC national database 1983- 2005. Each case record represents a closed case where a caller repor ted an actual or su spected exposure to a substance. Duplica te cases reported to more than one PCC are not counted.2005 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE AAPCC NATIONAL DATABASE 805 exposure calls (non-administrative, non-information calls; the caller was concerne d about an exposure to a substance) having occurred in humans (no animal species) where the call status has been deemed closed (the PCC has determined no further information is avail-able or no further follow-up/recommendations will bemade). Most calls are closed within the first fewhours; some calls about patients admitted to hospitalsremain open for weeks or months depending on theparticulars of a case. Database Record Count - Ex posures Reported in Humans The cumulative AAPCC database now contains over 49 million case records of which 41.08 million represent humanexposure cases. This report includes 2,424,180 human expo-sure cases reported to all 61 participating PCCs during 2005. While an additional 2,093 calls were classified as open at the time of preparation of this report, all prior Annual DataReports have looked only at closed human exposure calls andfor appropriate comp arison this report does the same. Trends in Reported Poisonings/Exposures The data do not directly identify a trend in the overall inci- dence of poisonings in the Unit ed States because the percent- age of actual exposures and poisonings reported to PCCs isunknown (Fig. 1). Although this report focuses on the human exposure cases reported to Poison Control Centers in 2005, the database alsocontains data on animal exposure s (Table 1B), human confirmednonexposures (7,983), animal confirmed nonexposures (375), and information calls (1,400,904) (Table 1C). An additional 4,688 duplicate reports (reported to more than 1 participating poison center) were excluded. This total of3,825,084 exposure cases and information calls reported to PCCs in 2005 does not reflect the full extent of poison centereffort, such as prevention and education. In addition, 3,976, 586 million follow-up calls were placed by PCCs in 2005 to provide further patient guidance, confirmcompliance with recommendatio ns, and gather final outcome data. Follow-ups were done in 44.9% of human exposurecases. One follow-up call was made in 22.2% of human expo-sure cases, and multiple follow-up calls (range 2-125) wereplaced in 21.8% of cases. Information (Non-exposure) Calls to Poison Centers Data from 1,400,904 information calls reported to PCCs in 2005 was transmitted to the AAPCC database, including376,040 calls coded in optional reporting categories such asadministrative, immediate referral, and prevention/safety/edu-cation (Table 1B). Information calls are not required to berecorded by PCCs and may be reported inconsistently. Overall,the volume of information calls handled by U.S. PCCsincreased 9.5% from 2004 to 2005. The most frequent information call was for drug identifica- tion, comprising of 848,082 calls to PCCs during the year. Ofthese, 129,825 (15.3%) could not be identified over the tele-phone. Of the drug identificatio n calls, 78.2% were received from the public, 8.6% from health professionals, and 12.4%from law enforcement. Forty-nine percent of drug identification FIG. 1.

LAI ET AL. requests involved drugs sometimes involved in abuse; how- ever, these cases were categori zed based on the abuse poten- tial, generally without knowledge of whether abuse wasactually intended. Drug information calls (176,782 calls) comprised 12.6% of all information calls. Of these, 19 .2% were questions about drug- drug interactions, 15.7% were qu estions about therapeutic use and indications, and 10.6% were questions about adverse effects. Environmental inquiries comprised 2.4% of all information calls.Of these environmental inquiries, 20.2% related to cleanup ofmercury thermometers and 13.0% involved pesticides. Poison information comprised 7.0% of information calls, with 12.3% of these information calls involving foodpoisoning or food preparation practices and 9.4% involvingplant toxicity. CHARACTERIZATION OF PA RTICIPATING POISON CONTROL CENTERS 2005 All 61 participating centers submitted data to the AAPCC for all of 2005. Fifty-six centers (92%) were fully certified bythe AAPCC at the end of 2005. The annual human exposure case volume by center ranged from 11,478 to 113,740 (mean 40,852) for centers. The entirepopulation of the 50 states, the District of Columbia and PuertoRico (296.4 million people (23)) was served by PCCs in 2005. The average number of human poison exposure consulta- tions handled per day by all U.S. poison centers was 6,642.Higher volumes were observed in the warmer months, with amean of 6,965 consultations per day in June compared with6,015 per day in December. On average, ignoring time of day and seasonal fluctuations, U.S. PCCs received one call con- cerning a suspected or actual human poisoning/exposure every 13 seconds.Due to variations in poison center penetrance (number of calls made to a PCC per 1,000 popul ation served), it is difficult to extrapolate the number of actual poisonings occurring annu- ally in the United States using AAPCC data alone. Using U.S.census data, the number of human exposure cases reported toany poison center per 1,000 population was calculated bycaller state. The minimum penetr ance of calls from a state per 1,000 population was 3.4. The maximum number of calls froma state per 1,000 population was 24.3. Mean penetrance acrossstates, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico was 8.7 and the median was 8.3. If all centers had reached the penetrancelevel of 24.3 reported exposur es in humans per 1,000 popula- tion as reported for 1 state, 7.2 million exposures in humanswould have been reported to PCCs in 2005. Using the averagepenetrance of 8.7 calls per 1,000 population, 2.6 million callswould have been reported. Management of Calls - Specialized Poison Emergency Providers Calls received at U.S. PCCs are managed by healthcare pro- fessionals who have received addi tional training in managing poisoning emergencies. Poison Center operation as well asclinical education an d instruction are directed by Managing Directors (most are PharmDs an d RNs with American Board of Applied Toxicology (ABAT) bo ard certificatio n). Medical direction is provided by Medical Directors who are board certi- fied medical toxicologists (MD or DO). At some poison cen-ters, the Managing and Medical Di rector positions are held by the same person. Specialists in Poison Information (SPIs) are primarily PharmDs, RNs and RPhs. They work under the supervision ofa Certified Specialist in Poison Information (CSPI). SPIs mustlog a minimum of 2,000 calls at a poison control center to become eligible to take the cer tifying exam for specialists in poison information. Poison Information Providers (P IPs) are allied healthcare professionals-in-training. They handle information-type andnon-medical (non-hospital) calls and work under the supervi-sion of at least one Certified Specialist in Poison Information(CSPI). Non-medical calls are those which do not requiremanagement recommendations to another allied healthcare professional. U.S. PCCs employ the full-time equivalent of 75 PIPs and 635 SPIs (of whom more than 75% are CSPIs) (24). REVIEW OF 2005 HUMAN EXPOSURE DATA No changes to the data collect ion format were implemented in 2005. Prior revisions had occurred in 1984, 1985, 1993,2000, 2001, and 2002. Data reported after January 1, 2000,allow an unlimited number of subs tances for each case, a factor that should be considered when comparing substance data with prior years.TABLE 1B Non-human exposures by animal type Animal 0.3Sheep goat 93 0.1 Aquatic 35 0.0 Cow 33 0.0Other 400 0.3Total 131,336 1.0 Number of non-human exposures recorded by U.S. Poison Control Centers in 2005.

LAI ET AL. Exposure Site Of the 2,424,180 human exposures reported in 2005, 92.7% occurred at a residence (Table 2). Expo sures occurred in the workplace in 2.1% of ca ses, schools (1.4%), health care facilities (0.3%), and restaurants or food services (0.3%). Poi- son center peak call volumes were from 4 to 11 p.m.,although call frequency remained consistently high between 8 a.m. and midnight, with 89.7% of calls logged during this16-hour period. Age and Gender Distribution The age and gender distribution of human poison exposure victims is outlined in Table 3. Children younger than threeyears were involved in 38.1% of cases, and 50.9% occurred inchildren younger than six years. A male predominance is foundamong recorded cases involving children younger than 13years, but this gender distribution is reversed in teenagers andadults, with women comprising the majority of reported poisonexposure victims. Exposures in Pregnancy Of all poison exposures captured, 8,636 occurred in preg- nant women. Of those with known pregnancy duration, expo-sures reported in patients reported as being pregnant, 32%occurred in the first trimester, 33% in the second trimester,and 26% in the third trimester. In 8.2% of cases (199,127cases), multiple patients were implicated in the poison expo-sure episode (i.e., cases were coded as being related to another case, as in siblings sharing a household product, or multiple patients inhaling vapors at a hazardous materialspill).Fatalities (Tables 4 and 21) Fatalities differed from the total exposure data set in several ways. Table 4 presents the age and sex distribution for the 1,261 reported fatalities. Although children younger than six years were involved in the majority ofpoisoning reports, they compri sed just 1.9% (24) of the recorded and verified fatalities. Fifty-six percent of poi-soning fatalities occurred in 20- to 49-year-old individu-als. Table 21 is a log of each of the 1,261 fatalities reported to PCCs. A single substance was implicated in 91.3% of reported human exposures, and 8.7% of patients were exposed to two ormore drugs or products (Table 5). In contrast, 640 (50.8%) offatal case reports noted exposure to two or more drugs orproducts. Chronicity The overwhelming majority of human exposures were acute (91.5%), compared to just 51.0 % of reported poisoning-related fatalities (643 of 1,261). Chro nic exposures comprised 1.9% of all poison exposure reports, and acute-on-chronic exposurescomprised 5.8% (chronic exposures were defined as continu-ous or repeated exposures o ccurring over a period exceeding eight hours). Reason for Exposure Specialists in Poison Informat ion (ISPIs) coded the reasons for exposure reported by callers to PCCs according to the fol-lowing definitions: Unintentional general: All Environmental: Any passive, nonoccupational expo-sure that results from contamination of air, water, orsoil. Environmental exposures are usually caused bymanmade contaminants. Occupational: An exposure that occurs as a directresult of the person being on the job or in the work-place. Therapeutic error: An unin tentional deviation from a proper therapeutic regimen that results in the wrong dose, incorrect route of administration, administrationto the wrong person, or administration of the wrongsubstance. Only exposures to medications or productsused as medications are included. Drug interactions resulting from unintentional administration of drugsor foods which are known to interact are alsoincluded. Unintentional misuse: Unintentional improper orincorrect use of a nonpharmaceutical substance. Unin-tentional misuse differs from intentional misuse inthat the exposure was unplanned or not foreseen bythe patient.TABLE 2 Site of call and site of ex posure, human exposure cases Site of caller (%) Site of exposure (%) Residence Own 75.12 89.65Other 2.34 3.08 Health care facility area 0.37 1.14Restaurant/food service0.03 0.33 Other 5.15 0.94 Unknown 0.32 1.09 Percentages of caller site and e xposure site in ca lls regarding expo- sures in humans as made to U.S. Poison Control Centers in 2005.809TABLE 3 Age and gender distribution of human exposure cases Age (y)Male Female Unknown Gender Total Cumulative total No.% of age group total No.% of age group total No.% of age group total No.% of total exposures No. Age and gender distribution of human exposure cases reported to U.

Food poisoning: Suspected or confirmed food poison-ing; ingestion of food cont aminated with microorgan- isms is included. Unintentional unknown: An exposure determined tobe unintentional, but the exact reason is unknown.Suspected suicidal: An exposure resulting from theinappropriate use of a substance for reasons that aresuspected to be self-destructive or manipulative. Intentional misuse: An exposure resulting from theintentional improper or incorrect use of a substancefor reasons other than the pursuit of a psychotropic oreuphoric effect. Intentional abuse: An exposure resulting from theintentional improper or incorrect use of a substancewhere the victim was likely attempting to achieve aeuphoric or psychotropic effect. All recreational useof substances for any effect is included. Intentional unknown: An exposure that is determinedto be intentional, but the specific motive is unknown. Contaminant/tampering: The patient is an uninten-tional victim of a substan ce that has been adulterated (either maliciously or unintentionally) by the intro-duction of an undesirable substance. Malicious: This category is us ed to capture patients who are victims of another person's intent to harm them. Withdrawal: Effect related to decline in blood concen- tration of a pharmaceutical or other substance after dis-continuing therapeutic use or abuse of that substance.

Included are cases with an unwanted effect because of an allergic, hypersensitive, or idiosyncratic responseto the active ingredients, inactive ingredients, or excipients. Concomitant use of a contraindicated medication or food is excluded and coded instead as atherapeutic error. The vast majority (83.8%) of poison exposures were unin- tentional; suicidal intent was pr esent in 8.1% of cases (Table 6A). Therapeutic errors accounted for 9.9% of exposures(241,033 cases), with unintentional nonpharmaceutical prod-uct misuse comprising another 4.2% of exposures. The types of therapeutic errors observed in each age group are delin-eated in Table 6B. Thirty-two percent of therapeutic errorsinvolved double-dosing. Dispensing cup errors were seen in5,466 cases, 10-fold dosing errors in 1,369 cases, iatrogenicor dispensing errors in 5,022 cases, and errors resulting fromexposure to multiple products with common ingredients in7,081 cases. Unintentional poisonings outnumbered intentional poison- ings in all age groups (Table 7). In contrast, of the 1,261human poisoning fatalities re ported, 89.6% of adolescent deaths and 76.6% of adult deaths (older than 19 years) were intentional (Table 8). Route of Exposure Ingestion was the route of exposure in 76.7% of cases (Table 9), followed in frequency by dermal, inhalation, andocular routes. For the 1,261 and parenteral were the pred ominant exposure routes. Clinical Effects The AAPCC database allows for the coding of up to 131 clinical effects (signs, symptoms , or laboratory abnormalities) per case. Clinical effects were coded in 882,083 (36.4%) ofcases (18.9% had 1 effect, 9.6% had 2 effects, 4.9% had 3 effects, 1.8% had 4 effects, 0. 6% had 5 effects, and 0.6% had >5 effects coded). Of 1,641,600 total clinical effects coded,80.2% were deemed related to the exposure(s), 8.9% were con- sidered not related, and 10.9% were coded as unknown ifrelated. Case Management Site The majority of cases reported to PCCs were managed in a non-health care facility (75.5%), usually at the site of expo- sure, the patient's own residence (Table 10). This includes the 2.0% of cases that were referr ed to a health care facility but refused to go. Treatment in a h ealth care facility was rendered in 22.8% of cases. The percentage of patients tr eated in a health care facility varied considerably with age. Only 10.5% of children youngerthan six years and only 13.5% of children between six and 12years were managed in a health care facility, compared with 48.5% of teenagers (13-19 years) and 37.1% of adults (age>19years). Of cases managed in a health care facility, 51.4% were treated and released without admission, 14.5% were admitted for critical care, and 8.0% were admitted for noncritical care. Where treatment was provided in a health care facility, 37.2% of the patients were referred by the PCC, and 62.8%were already in or en route to the health care facility when the poison center was contacted.TABLE 6A Reason for human exposure cases Reason No. % Human exposures Unintentional exposure as reported in cases involving humans.

Table 11 displays the medical outcome of the human poison exposure cases distributed by ag e, showing a greater rate of severe outcomes in the older age groups. Table 12 comparesmedical outcome and reason for exposure and shows a greaterfrequency of serious outcomes in intentional exposures. Table 13 demonstrates an increasing dura tion of the clinical effects observed with more severe outcomes. Medical outcome categories were as follows: No effect: The patient did not develop any signs orsymptoms as a result of the exposure. Minor effect: The patient developed some signs orsymptoms as a result of the exposure, but they wereminimally bothersome and generally resolved rapidly with no residual disability or disfigurement. A minoreffect is often limited to the skin or mucus membranes(e.g., gastrointestinal hypotension, and transientcough). Moderate effect: The patient exhibited signs or symp-toms as a result of the exposure that were more pro-nounced, more prolonged, or more systemic in naturethan minor symptoms. Usually, some form of treat-ment is indicated. Symptoms were not life-threaten- ing, and the patient had no residual disability orTABLE 6B Scenarios for therapeutic errors No. of cases<6y (Row %)6-12 y (Row %)13-19 y (Row %)>19 y (Row %)Unknown (Row %) Inadvertently took/given medication twice 77,882 25.0 12.5 5.6 56.5 0.4 Other incorrect dose 34,892 38.2 12.4 7.3 41.8 0.3Wrong medication taken/given 31,634 6.6 62.5 0.4Inadvertently 23,715 21.8 19.2 7.3 51.5 0.2Medication doses given/taken too close together 19,977 25.2 10.7 7.0 56.9 0.3Other/unknown therapeutic error 14,368 24.4 11.1 7.4 56.2 0.9Confused units of measure 10,277 59.5 15.7 5.8 18.9 0.2Incorrect dosing route 10,238 12.7 5.3 3.5 77.6 0.9More than one product containing same ingredient 7,081 33.5 15.1 38.9 0.3Incorrect 17.4 4.3 5.1 professional/iatrogenic error 5,022 6.1 50.3 1.4Incorrect formulation or concentration dispensed 1,830 44.5 16.0 6.1 32.8 0.5 10-Fold dosing error 1,369 66.0 5.0 2.5 25.9 0.6Drug interaction 1,241 7.4 7.3 74.1 0.6Exposure through breast milk 191 92.7 0.0 0.5 6.3 0.5 399,030 human exposure cases reported to U.S. Poison Control Centers in 2005 included sc enario coding.

Death: The patient died as a result of the exposure oras a direct complication of the exposure. Only thosedeaths that were probably or undoubtedly related tothe exposure are coded here. Not followed, judged as nontoxic exposure: No fol-low-up calls were made to determine the outcome ofthe exposure because the substance implicated wasnontoxic, the amount implicated was insignificant, orthe route of exposure was unlikely to result in aclinical effect.Not followed, minimal clinical effects possible: No fol- low-up calls were made to determine the patient's out-come because the ex posure was likely to result in only minimal toxicity of a trivial nature (the patient wasexpected to experi ence no more than a minor effect). Unable to follow, judged as a potentially toxic expo- sure: The patient was lost to follow-up, refused fol-low-up, or was not followed, but the exposure wassignificant and may have resulted in a moderate,major, or fatal outcome. Unrelated effect: The exposure was probably not responsi- ble for the effect. Confirmed nonexposure: This outcome option was coded to designate cases where there was reliable and objective evi-dence that an exposure initially believed to have occurred actu- ally never occurred (e.g., all miss ing pills are later located). All cases coded as confirmed nonex posure are excluded from this report.

LAI ET AL. must be interpreted as minimu m frequencies because of the limitations of telephone data gathering. Table 16 demonstrates the con tinuing decline in the use of ipecac-induced emesis in the treatment of poisoning. Ipecac was administered in only 3,027 (0.12%) human poison expo-sures in 2005. A 35.6% decrease in ipecac syrup use in 2005 compared with 2004 was observed , likely as a result of ipecac use guidelines issued in late 2003. At that time, a joint Guide-lines Consensus Panel formed by the American Association of Poison Control Centers, Ameri can College of Medical Toxi- cology, and American Academy of Clinical Toxicology issued a guideline which concluded that the circumstances in which ipecac syrup is the appropriate or desired method of gastric decontamination are ra re (25). In a separate report, the Ameri- can Academy of Pediatrics concluded not only that ipecac should no longer be used routinely as a home treatment strat-egy, but also recommended di sposal of ipecac currently in homes (26). Table 17A presents the most common substance categories involved in human exposures, listed by frequency of exposure.Tables 17B and 17C present similar data for children andadults, respectively, and show the considerable differencesbetween pediatric and adult poison exposures. Table 18 lists the substance categories associated with reported deaths; analgesics and sedative/hypnotics/antipsy-chotics lead this list. Although analgesics are the most fre-quently involved substance category for both deaths andnonlethal human exposures, there is otherwise little correlationbetween the frequency of exposures to a substance and thenumber of deaths. Note that Table 18 accounts for all sub-stances to which a patient has reportedly been exposed (i.e., apatient exposed to an analgesic may have also been exposed to another category of product). Table 19 shows little variation over the past two decades in the percentage of cases reported to the AAPCC's national data-base that are fatal poisonings, and in the percentage of reportedfatalities as a result of suicide. A breakdown of plant exposuresis provided for those most co mmonly implicated (Table 20). Fatalities (Table 21 and Appendix B) U.S. PCCs recorded 1,589 ca lls where the medical outcome was death and there appeared to be a correlation between thereported substance(s) to which a patient was exposed and thefatality. Three-hundred twenty-eight cases were eventuallydetermined to to be either unrelated to a poison exposure orcoded incorrectly as a death (including 16 fatalities reported toone poison center which were unable to be verified). A caselog summary of these 1,261 fatal human exposures is presentedin Table 21. Each fatality case is abstracted by the reporting poison center and verified for accu racy as much as possible. After extensive review by both local/regional PCC staff and AAPCC reviewers, exposures determ ined to be either \"proba- bly\" or \"undoubtedly\" responsible for the fatality were countedand included in Table 21. Narrative abstracts of selected interesting or unusual cases (including most incidents with multiple fatalities), and pediatriccases in which the patient is less than six years of age (excludingcarbon monoxide cases) are included in Appendix B.TABLE 9 Distribution of route of exposure for human exposure cases and 1,261 fatalities RouteIn all exposure casesIn fatal exposure cases No. No. % Ingestion 1,020 0.1Bites 3.2 0.5 0.3Aspiration 1,672 0.1 36 2.5Rectal 1 0.1Total 2,547,394 100.0 1,460 100.0 Multiple routes of exposure were observed in many poison expo- sure victims.

In addi-tion, Table 21 identifies those cases reported indirectly to thepoison center (81, or 6.4% of 1,261 cases), and those cases in which a prehospital cardiac and/or respiratory arrest occurred(626, or 49.6% of cases). Deaths are categorized in Ta ble 21 according to the agent deemed most responsible for th e death, by agreement of the medical director of the reporti ng center and at least two addi- tional toxicologist reviewers. A single agent was reported asthe probable cause in 621 (4 9.6%) deaths. Additional agents implicated (up to a maximum of 3 total agents) are listed belowthe primary agent. Cases in whic h more than th ree agents wereinvolved are also identified, but agents beyond the first three are not listed in Table 21. Characteristics of 1,261 Fatalities The age distribution of reported fatalities is similar to that in past years, with the overwhel ming majority of fatal cases occurring in adults age > 19 years (91%). Pediatric Fatalities - Age Less than 6 Years There were 24 fatalities report ed in children younger than six years, similar to numbers reported over the last decade (Table 19). These pediatric cases represented 1.9% of total reported fatalities, similar to percentages reported over most ofthe last six years. The percentage of pediatric fatalities related to total pediatric calls was 0.0 03%. By comparison, 1.2% of all adult exposures reported record ed death as the medical out- come. Of the reported deaths in children younger than six yearsof age, 16 were known to be unintentional (Table 8). Twodeaths in children yo unger than six years of age were coded as resulting from malicious intent. Of the 14 medication-associ-ated deaths, one was from a nonprescription medication and 13were associated with prescripti on medications (often not the child's prescription). Of the prescription medications, five con-tained opioids, including three from methadone. While thisnumber is less than the nine reported last year, it still representsa worrisome increase in opioid-related deaths in this age range compared to earlier years. There were three fatalities related tohousehold products, a decrease from previous years. Pediatric Fatalities - Ages 6-12 Years In the age range 6 to 12 years, there were 12 reported fatali- ties, of which 9 were from carbon monoxide exposures. Adolescent Fatalities - Ages 13-19 Years In the age range 13 to 19 years, there were 77 reported fatal- ities, slightly higher than the mean of 71 deaths in this agegroup reported annually since 1999, but lower than the 90reported in 2004. Looking at the reasons for the adolescentfatalities, 39.0% were presumed suicides, and 36.4% werecaused by intentional abuse. These numbers are similar to those in most recent years excep t for 2003 when abuse was the most common reason. As in past years, only a small number (4/ 77 (5.2%)) of adolescent fatalities were coded as being unin-tentional; two cases were due to carbon monoxide. All Fatalities - All Ages The most common classes of substances involved across all fatalities were analgesics, sedative/hypnotics/antipsychotics,antidepressants and stimulants/s treet drugs (Table 18). This relative order is similar to that seen in recent years.TABLE 13 Duration of clinical effects by medical outcome Duration of effectMinor effectModerate effectMajor effect Col% Col % Col % < = 2 hours 38.3 6.0 1.9 > 2 hours, < = 8 hours25.5 21.3 6.1 > 8 hours, < = 24 hours17.2 31.3 26.4 > 24 hours, < = 3 days5.2 17.8 32.1 > 3 days, < = 1 week1.6 6.4 16.2 > 1 week, < = 1 month0.5 1.7 5.3 >1 month 0.2 0.4 1.0 Anticipated permanent0.2 0.3 2.5 Unknown 11.3 14.7 8.5 TABLE 14 Decontamination and ther apeutic interventions Therapy No. of patients % Decontamination only 1,168,877 48.2 Observation only 324,696 13.4No therapy provided 237,975 9.8Decontamination and other therapy 153,641 6.3Other therapy only (no decontamination)156,835 6.5 Unknown if therapy was provided/ patient refused382,156 15.8 Total 2,424,180 100.0818 M.W.

Forty-eight were as sociated with ace- taminophen as a single agent, 47 with acetaminophen plusone or two other drugs, an d 92 with an acetaminophen combination product (oft en acetaminophen plus an opioid). There were 20 fatalities where aspirin as a single agent was felt to be responsible. Ni ne acute cases recorded salicy- late concentrations measured >100 mg/dL. Most of these cases did not undergo dialysis within a useful time frame.These data suggest that more aggressive and earlier use of dialysis may be indicated in the treatment of large salicylateingestions. Sixty-nine deaths were attributed to methadone (versus 76 cases in 2004) and 31 were attributed to oxycodone (versus 31cases in 2004). Long-acting opio id preparations (controlled release or transdermal) other th an methadone were felt to be the primary responsible agent in 32 deaths in 2005.The second most common cla ss of drugs associated with fatalities as the primary agent wa s stimulants and street drugs (148). Cocaine was noted as th e primary agent in 76 cases. There was a marked jump in cases where heroin was coded asthe primary agent, with 38 deaths in 2005 compared to 22deaths in 2004 and 23 deaths in 2003. Twenty-six deaths werethought primarily related to methamphetamine use (comparedto 26 cases in 2004). For the fi rst time in three years (since 2002), gamma-hydroxybutyrate was listed as the likely causeof a poisoning fatality. Antidepressants were the third most common class of drugs reported. When coded as the primary agent, theyaccount for 128 deaths, similar to other recent years. Bupro-pion (35 deaths) surpassed amit riptyline (21 deaths) as the single most commonly recorded antidepressant associated with fatalities. The fourth most co mmon class of drugs associated with fatalities as the primary agen t was cardiovascular agents, accounting for 120 deaths. The tw o most common drugs in this class were verapamil and diltiazem, accounting for 30 and 23deaths, respectively. Long-actin g preparations accounted for 33 of the deaths in this class.TABLE 15 (Continued) Therapy <6 y 6-12 y 13-19 y >19 y Unknown Total Fomepizole 97 17 79 1,012 1 1,206 Antivenom (Fab) 74 100 116 846 4 1,140Atropine 83 20 59 861 2 1,025Glucagon 18 8 42 876 0 944Insulin 3 4 39 774 1 821Phytonadione 51 5 70 524 1 651Fab fragments 21 26 22 514 1 584Folate 13 0 31 538 0 582Pyridoxine 17 12 68 307 1 405Ethanol 22 4 32 320 0 378Antivenom (excluding Fab) 40 38 28 227 0 333Succimer 130 9 6 80 2 227Octreotide 33 4 22 144 0 203Physostigmine 6 3 52 121 0 182EDTA 70 7 0 21 1 99Methylene blue 14 1 6 75 0 96Pralidoxime (2-PAM) 15 1 2 71 0 89Deferoxamine 28 0 23 31 0 82Dimercaprol (BAL) 28 2 1 29 1 61Sodium thiosulfate 2 2 2 47 2 55Sodium nitrite 0 0 6 24 2 32Penicillamine 1 0 1 8 0 10Amyl nitrite 1 0 2 5 0 8820 M.W. LAI ET AL. The fifth most common class of drugs as the primary agent associated with deaths were the sedative hypnotics/antipsy-chotics. These drugs were report ed as an agent of exposure 415 times, with 76 cases listing a sedative/hypnotic/antipsychoticas the primary agent. As in r ecent years past, alprazolam and quetiapine are the most common drugs involved, most typi-cally in combination with other drugs. The vast majority (75.4%) of reported fatalities in 2005, as in past years, were the result of intentional actions. The per-centage of fatalities attributable to other reasons remained littlechanged from previous years (Table 8). A disturbing numberof deaths continue to occur b ecause of therapeutic errors; the 61 cases reported in 2005 are more than the numbers in the three previous years (41 cases in 2004, 48 cases in 2003, and54 in 2002). Adverse drug reactions were also reported as con- tributing to 28 deaths. The 10 occupational-related deaths in 2005 were similar to 2004, but fewer than in any year since 1999 (11 cases in 2004).As in the previous 3 years, there were no reported fatalitiesfrom product tampering.Demographic Data Tables 22A and 22B provide summary demographic data on patient age, reason for exposure, medical outcome,and use of a health care f acility for all 2,424,166 expo- sures, presented by substance categories. Table 22Afocuses on nonpharmaceuticals; Table 22B presents drug/ pharmaceuticals. and 22B, 48.9% were nonpharmaceuticals, and51.1% were pharmaceuticals. The reason for the exposure was intentional for 29.2% of pharmaceutical substances impli cated, compared with 5.6% of nonpharmaceutical substances. Correspondingly, treatment ina health care facility was provided in a higher percentage ofexposures to pharmaceutical s ubstances (41.4%), compared with nonpharmaceutical substan ces (18.5%). Pharmaceutical exposures also had more severe outcomes. Of substancesimplicated in fatal cases, 84.8 % were pharmaceuticals, com- pared with 51.0% of substances reported in nonfatal cases. Similarly, 85.9% of substances implicated in major outcomeswere pharmaceuticals.TABLE 16 Decontamination trends YearHuman exposures reportedIpecac administered (% of all exposures)Activated charcoal administered (% of all exposures)% of exposures involving children <6 yIpecac administered (% of child exposures)Activated charcoal administered (% of child exposures) 1985 886,389 132,947 (15.0) 41,063 (4.6) ANNUAL REPORT OF THE AAPCC NATIONAL DATABASE 821 Surveillance In 2005, real-time monitoring of cases submitted to the AAPCC's national database was expanded to include new sur-veillance case definitions, and enhanced toxicosurveillance at the regional PCC level. Monitoring results were reviewed dailyby a team of five medical and clinical toxicologists working across four time zones. The core approach included monitoring of increased PCCcase activity, increased reportin g of clinical effects as compared to a three y ear baseline, and cases that met surveillance case definitions as described in the 2003 AAPCCAnnual Report. Sixty of 61 U.S. PCCs continue to submit data to the AAPCC's database in almost real time, with most centers sub-mitting cases every 4 to 10 minu tes. When outliers are identi- fied, surveillance query results are automatically sent for analysis to toxicologists at the AAPCC. When reports of potential public health importance are detected, additionalinformation is obtained via e-mail or phone from reporting PCCs. Public health issues are brought to the attention of theNational Center for Environmental Health/Agency for ToxicSubstances Disease Registry at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Affected state or local health departments are also alerted. Data on clinical effect anamolies are provided daily to 43 individual poison centers, covering all, or parts of, 39 states. Ina few cases, results are also sent directly to state or local health departments. In most states, results are interpreted by PCCstaffbefore the results are communica ted to the appropriate health authorities. Individual PCCs have developed surveillance case defini- tions, and new monitors identify cases that meet these defini- tions. Current surveillance definitions identify cases that haveclinical effects suggestive of nerve agents, cyanide, and dermal), irritant gases,TABLE 17A Substances most frequently involved in human exposures Substance No. %* Analgesics 283,253 11.7 1.9Anticonvulsants 39,638 1.6 Despite a high frequency of involve ment, these substances are not necessarily the most toxic, but rather may be the most readily avail- able. *Percentages are based on the total number of human exposures (2,424,180) rather than the total number of substances.TABLE 17B Substances most frequently in volved in pediatric exposures (children younger than 6 years) Substance No. %* Cosmetics/personal care products 165,329 high frequency of invol vement, these substances are not necessarily the most toxic, but rather may be the most readily available. *Percentages are based on the tota l number of exposures in chil- dren younger than 6 years (1,233,695) rather than the total number of substances.822 M.W.

These monitors have been implemented in response to public health issues or concerns, and are run daily at 1- to 12-hour intervals. Ca ses coded as specific substances, for example, arsenic, ricin, carbon monoxide, and food poison-ing/food products, are also m onitored. Surveillance processes and anamoly definitions continue to be developed, refined, andevaluated. Most notably in 2005, information collected by U.S. PCCs in Gulf Coast states was used to provide post-hurricane situation awareness on substances of inte rest following Hurricanes Kat- rina (August 2005) and Rita (September 2005). Daily reportswere generated and ev aluated by toxicologists at the AAPCC and Centers for Diseas e Control (CDC) in order to identify and target where to deploy additional personnel, educational materi-als and public service announce ments. Substances of interest included carbon monoxide, snake envenomations, reports of sus-pected food poisoning and water contamination, and gasoline(hydrocarbon) ingestion which may correlate with gas siphon- ing. This reporting system has remained in place since 2005 andcontinues to be used for hurricane season 2006. Database Enhancements In 2005, the AAPCC embarked on one of its largest and most important projects since its founding in 1958: devel-opment of new database softwa re and migration to web-host- ing of the information curren tly stored in the AAPCC's national poisoning and exposure database. Since 1993, thedatabase has been used to answer many toxiclogy related ques-tions from individual poison centers, academic researchers, public health personnel, and co rporate research and develop- ment teams. The new new web-based software for querying, reporting and surveillance applicati on will allow the AAPCC, itsTABLE 17C Substances most frequently involved in adult No. 1.4 Despite a high frequency of involvement, these substances are not necessarily the most toxic, but rather may be the most readily available. *Percentages are based on the to tal number of exposures in adults older than 19 years (847,483) rather th an the total number of substances.TABLE 18 Categories associated with larg est number of reported deaths SubstanceNo. of cases with substance% of exposures 696 0.246 0.284Antidepressants 131 79 0.199Antihistamines 78 0.103Fumes/gases/vapors 0.197Muscle 0.310Hormones hormone antagonists 57 0.113Chemicals 55 0.119Unknown drug 50 0.287Cleaning substances (household) 36 0.016Gastrointestinal preparations 29 0.059Pesticides 23 0.023Automotive/aircraft/boat products 22 0.147Antimicrobials 20 0.030Miscellaneous drugs 19 0.084Cold and cough preparations 18 0.016Diuretics 17 0.173Hydrocarbons 13 0.024Anticoagulants 12 0.219 Substance categories associated wi th deaths reported by 60 of 61 U.S. Poison Control Centers (PCCs).

APPENDIX A AAPCC's 2005 fatality verification process involved the preparation and review of abstracts on 1,589 fatalitiesreported to poison centers, 328 of which were eventuallydetermined to be either unre lated to a poison exposure or coded incorrectly as a death. The review process requires thededication and commitment of hundreds of poison centerstaff members; more than could possibly be listed here. Thefollowing fatality abstract authors were identified by theirpoison centers as having made a major contribution to thiseffort. These individuals are acknowledged for their commit-ment to toxicosurveillance through the careful verificationand preparation of clinical abstracts of poisoning cases. With-out the dedicated contributions of these individuals, thisreport would not be possible. The contributing authors and reviewers in calendar year 2005 are: Aaron, Cynthia Abbott-Teter, Cynthia L.Akhtar, JawaidAlbertson, Sean REPORT OF AAPCC 919 A. K. Mary APPENDIX B Abstracts of select cases from 1,261 human fatalities thought to be related to a poisoning exposure as reported to U.S. PoisonControl Centers in 2005. Drug and chemical concentrationsprovided in these abstracts were measured in blood, serum orplasma unless otherwise indicated. Case 35. A 51-year-old man was arrested for driving \"under the influence\" and inde cent exposure and jailed. He reported that he had ingested antifreeze (ethylene glycol).The patient became short of breath and obtunded while injail. Upon arrival in the ED, the patient was comatose andbeing bag ventilated. His vital signs were: heart rate, 90beats/min; blood pressure, 70/50 mm HG; temperature, 94.5\u00b0F rectally. He was intubated. An initial arterial pH was 6.7. The patient received warm intravenous fluids, sodium bicar-bonate, and calcium gluconate. His blood pressure rose to105/50 mm Hg. His initial laboratory values were: followinghemodialysis; however his neurologic status never improvedand life support was withdrawn. Case 53. An 18-month-old boy ingested two button cell disc batteries that he found in the trash. He vomited for one day, buthis symptoms were attributed to a respiratory illness in thefamily who were unaware of the battery ingestion. When hewas seen in the ED for persistent symptoms, an x-ray showedone battery in the esophagus and one battery in the stomach.After a delay of several hours, the child was transferred toanother hospital where both batt eries were removed. The child was admitted for four days and a barium swallow done duringthe admission showed no perforation but an undefined esoph-ageal deviation. On discharge the child had a fever and wassent home on an antibiotic an d medication for acid reflux. On the fourth home day the child woke cyanotic. On readmissionhe had a high white blood cell count and was in shock. He diedlater that day. The death certifi cate listed the cause of death as aortoesophageal corrosive ulcer. Case 54. A 55-year-old man was bitten on the hand by an Eastern diamondback rattlesnake ( Crotalus adamanteus ). He immediately began experiencing shortness of breath. Hisson described his father having trouble breathing and unable to talk. Upon presentation in the ED he was hypotensive,diaphoretic, and had ectopy on his monitor. The swellingwas onto his forearm. He was given 4 vials of antivenom(Crotalidae polyvalent immune Fab), as well as amiodarone,with reported clinical improvement. Laboratory valueswere: PT, 17 sec; INR, 1.7; an d platelet count, 109, 000 / L At followup, approximately 27 hours after presentation, 16vials of antivenom had been given. Laboratory values at thattime showed a PT of 20 sec with an INR of 2, and a fibrino-gen level of 195 mg/dL. On the 6th hospitalized day, heshowed signs of recurrent coag ulopathy with the following laboratory values: platelet count, 93,000 / L; fibrinogen, < 35 mg/dL; and PT and PTT both > 150 sec. It was unclearwhether blood products or additional antivenom were given.He was transferred back to the ICU, but later that day hedeveloped neurological deficits and subsequently becameunresponsive. A head CT showed a hemorrhage. He died the following day. Case 55. A 25-year-old man reportedly told his family that he had been bitten by a rattlesnake ( Crotalus horridus horri- dus). He was being driven to a ru ral hospital when the car had a flat tire. The patient reporte dly became unconscious and was taken on to the hospital by a passing motorist. By the time hegot to the ED he was dead. An autopsy revealed an apparent bite mark on the back of the ri ght hand, associated with hemor- rhagic necrosis of the underlying soft tissue. A heart blood eth-anol level was 290 mg/dL. It was the opinion of the pathologistthat the probable cause of death was a snake bite. Case 56. The poison center was informed about a 44-year- old man who was stung on the temple by an unknownhymenoptera. He reportedly wait ed several hours to seek med- ical attention. He was eventu ally declared brain dead. The medical examiner confirmed that death was due to an anaphy- lactic reaction to the sting. Case 57. A 32-year-old man presented in the ED following a rattlesnake bite. He reportedly ha d a respiratory arrest about 10 minutes after the bite and arrived in the ED 10 minutes later. Inthe ED his pupils were fixed and dilated. Antivenom wasadministered after initial fluid resuscitative measures weretaken. Oxygen saturation returned to 98% and blood pressurestabilized. He was transferred to a tertiary-care facility where his PT and PTT were slightly prolonged and his platelet count was 120,000/ L. Additional antivenom was administered. His neurologic status throughout hospitalization suggested anoxicbrain injury, confirmed by head CT and EEG. The patient died on the 4th hospital day, apparently of anoxic brain injury fol-lowing an anaphylactic reaction to a snakebite. Further history revealed that he had been bitten several times in the past.920 M.W. LAI ET AL. Case 60. A 44-year-old man saw a 4-foot long snake (pre- sumed Crotaline) and chased it into a wooded ravine in anattempt to catch it. His body was found two days later. Autopsyexamination showed four puncture marks on the first dorsalweb space of his right hand with swelling, discoloration, andcellular/tissue lysis of the su rrounding muscle and tissue. Marked edema of the larynx, epiglottis, and surrounding upperairway tissues was noted as well. A blood ethanol level was120 mg/dL. Case 62. A 19-year-old woman with a history of depression was found slumped over a bathtub after a suspected ammoniaand bleach ingestion, followed by aspiration. EMS performed cardioversion and endotracheal intubation prior to arrival in theED. A urine drug screen was negative for drugs of abuse. Thepatient was supported on the ventilator and high dose vasopres-sors, but remained hemodynamically unstable and unrespon-sive. She suffered a cardiac arrest on hospital day 2 and did notrespond to resuscitation attempts. Case 63. A 23-year-old college stud ent dropped out of class, acquired some sodium cyanide, e-mailed a suicide note to a relative, mixed the cyanide with a liquid and drank it. He wasfound dead three days later, shortly after the e-mail messagewas read. The postmortem blood cyanide level was reported as>10 g/mL. Case 66. A 55-year-old man ingested a white powdery sub- stance while being arrested. He stated that it was potassium cyanide and that he was going to die. He was transported to asmall rural hospital, where he pr esented in respiratory distress 15 minutes after ingestion. He had palpable pulses but nodetectable blood pressure. He was intubated, started on vaso-pressors and given sodium bicarbonate. He then went into PEAand CPR was started. The hospita l did not have a cyanide anti- dote kit in stock. They had called a flight evacuation servicewhich arrived with a cyanide antidote kit 45 minutes post-ingestion. Aggressive supportive care and the delayed cyanideantidote were unsuccessful and th e patient was declared dead. Case 85. A 24-year-old man was found unresponsive after reportedly ingesting 6 ounces of an embalming fluid contain-ing formaldehyde and methanol. In the ED the patient wasasystolic and could not be resu scitated. Postmortem examina- tion revealed complete tissue fixation of the upper gastrointes-tinal tract up to the pylorus a nd mesenteric areas adjacent to stomach. Postmortem methanol levels were 43 mg/dL in theblood and 36 mg/dL in vitreous fluid. Case 87. A 58-year-old man with a past history of morbid obesity and extensive coronary ar tery disease presented in the ED after unintentionally ingesting a mouthful of a \"truckcleaner\" inappropriatel y stored in a drinking water bottle. Hydrofluoric acid ingestion wa s suspected. He presented with extensive retching and intense burning in his throat, chest, andabdomen. Initial calcium was 9.0 mg/dL. About 2 hours laterhe went into torsade de pointes followed by ventricular fibrilla-tion. Calcium was then 5.2 mg/dL. Calcium and magnesiumwere administered and he was defibrillated. He did not respondand died approximately 4.5 hours later. Postmortem examina- tion revealed that this combination product contained unknownconcentrations of hydrofluoric, sulfuric, and phosphoric acidsin a container labeled as a commercial brand of drinking water.No gross evidence of acid-relate d injury to the gastric mucosa was present. However, micr oscopic examination revealed patchy mucosal erosions and areas of hemorrhage in the stom-ach. Case 88. Fifteen people became ill after coming to work at a plant that stores cylinders of methyl bromide gas. The employ-ees were all attending a meeting when they developed vomit-ing, diarrhea, and eye irritation. All were seen at an ED and fourteen of the fifteen were discharged. All of the employees had methyl bromide present in blood samples taken in the ED.One adult with a history of unspecified underlying medicalconditions came to work 2.5 hours before the meeting and wasalready feeling ill at the time the meeting started. About 30 minutes later, he became paralyzed although he remainedawake and alert. On arrival in th e ED, he had a seizure that was controlled with medication. He was admitted to the hospitaland died about 10 hours later. Later on the day of the meeting,the canisters of methyl bromide stored at the plant were exam- ined and three of them were found empty or partially empty.No air levels of bromine were measurable. A water cooler that pulls air into the inverted contai ner as water is used was in the area of the meeting and was used to make coffee about an hour before the meeting, pulling room air into the inverted large bot-tle. The bottle was sealed and tested, and the air in the bottlewas found to contain methyl bromide. The fatality wasbelieved to have been caused by a combination of effects fromthe methyl bromide and the man's underlying medical condi-tion(s). Case 97. An 83-year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease ingested an estimated 8 ounces of a liquid dishwashing deter- gent (anionic/nonionic). She was lavaged and given intrave-nous fluids in the ED. The patient aspirated and, within 4-5hours of ingestion, was intubated and transferred to the ICU forrespiratory failure. The patient experienced renal failure, ele- vated liver enzymes, and at least one seizure. The patient con-tinued to require ventilatory support and dopamine. She had acardiac arrest approximately 16 hours after exposure and couldnot be resuscitated. Case 98. An 85-year-old man with a medical history of \"confusion\" reportedly ingested 400 mL of a liquid dishwash-ing detergent (anionic/nonionic). The patient developed pro-fuse watery diarrhea with hourly stools. Initial laboratoryvalues were normal. Over the next 24 hours he reportedly hadapproximately 10 liters of stool. He also apparently developeda bowel obstruction with vomiting of fecal-like material. Inspite of fluid replacement and s upportive care the patient died about 30 hours after presentation. Case 111. A 90-year-old woman with a history of dementia was witnessed to drink a few sw allows of a cleaner containing pine oil/isopropyl alcohol cleaner, thinking it was Gatorade.2005 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE AAPCC NATIONAL DATABASE 921 She began vomiting. EMS was called. She became asystolic en route to the hospital. In the ED she underwent a prolongedresuscitation. Supportive care wa s withdrawn later that day by the family and she died. Case 112. A 102-year-old woman with do not resuscitate orders presented to an ED smelling of a pine oil/isopropyl alco-hol cleaning product, which she had reportedly ingested. Shewas responsive only to pain. Her vital signs were: heart rate, 84beats/min; blood pressure, 110/54 mm Hg; pulse oximetry, 100% on 2L of oxygen. Her initial chest x-ray was clear. Seventeen hours after her exposure she wa s awake and alert with stable vital signs and scattered rhonchi on her pulmonary examina-tion. Her respiratory status continued to decline and she dieddue to respiratory failure at 37 hours after her exposure. Case 117. A 48-year-old man presented in the ED after unintentionally ingesting a wheel cleaner containing hydroflu-oric acid. The wheel cleaner ha d been placed in a drink con- tainer. Presenting symptoms included vomiting, drooling andpharnygeal erythema. The intubated, sedated andreceived intravenous calcium, magnesium, sodium bicarbon- ate, and fluids. Laboratory valu es approximately 2 hours post ingestion included: potassium, 3.1mEq/L; calcium, 6.3 mg/dL;magnesium, 1.6 mg/dL; hemoglobin, 4 (decreased initial 14.4 g/dL); pH, 7.24; and creatinine, 1.3 mg/dL. Despite supportive care, the patient developed refractoryhypotension and then cardiac arrest approximately 5 hours after the ingestio n. Resuscitation was unsuccessful. Case 123. A 26-year-old woman was found in Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA) with a bottle of holding tank sealerand deodorant, approximately half of which was gone. Unfor-tunately, during the course of case management, the exact identity of what the patient ingested was unclear. The bottle from which the chemical was inge sted was lost within the hos- pital. She was treated with s upportive care and 4-methylpyra- zole because of the possibility that the product containedmethanol. The patient remained acidotic and developed a coag- ulopathy and bleeding diathesis. Less than 24 hours into thehospitalization, she coded and co uld not be resuscitated. The pathologist determined that the product the patient ingestedwas 10-15% methanol and 20-25% formaldehyde. Case 124. A 27-year-old man presented in the ED with altered mental status. The patie nt was intubated and sedated. Initial vital signs were: blood pressure, of 100% t X-ray and CT of the head were all normal. The patient was started on 3% saline. Thehistory obtained from the patient's sister was that he was arecent immigrant from El Salvador who was apparentlyhealthy until three weeks prior when the patient went to see a\"Curandera\" for abdominal pain. He was given \"Aceite de Resina\" and one week later was given \"Te de Medianoche.\"One week later, the patient was seen by a primary care physi- cian and was prescribed trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The\"Aceite de Resina\" container had been disposed of but the\"Te de Medianoche\" container had been brought in and - Satureja and Melisa - Citronella mexicana after the admission Mentha pulegium was iden-tified as pennyroyal. The patient was started on N-acetylcys- teine. Liver enzymes returned to normal within four days of admission. The patient remained comatose on pressors andsedation. Two weeks into his c ourse he developed bilateral pneumothoraces requiring chest tube placement. By threeweeks after admission the patient was unresponsive to anystimuli. An EEG showed minimal brain activity. Twenty-ninedays after admission the patient was removed from life support and died. Case 125. An 82-year-old man with dementia developed slurred speech and weakness. Four days prior the patient had eaten home-canned food of unknown shelf life. The followingday, the patient's speech was sl urred. The patient ultimately was taken to the ED where he had minimal movement and wasintubated. He was able to wiggle fingers and toes. By hospitalday 1, he was only able to wiggle his toes and by the end of thenight, the patient was completely paralyzed. On hospital day 4he had a negative spinal tap and there was concern for botu-lism. Botulinum immune globulin was sent from the CDC andtesting was started for botulism. By hospital day 6, thepatient's respiratory rate had increased. On Hospital Day 13,testing came back positive for botulism type B. The patient didreceive botulinum immune glob ulin. The patient started to improve and then decompensate d again and ultimately died. Case 126. A 67-year-old woman was admitted to the hospi- tal with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and right upper quadrantpain. The patient also had jaundice and hemolysis. Blood cul-tures grew a heavy growth of Clostridium perfringens the dayafter the patient died. Cases 127, 142, and 147. A 3-year-old girl died of carbon monoxide poisoning. A family member committed suicide byrunning his automobile in an attached garage, killing otherfamily members. Cases 129, 130, 139, and 140. A family of four, including two 8-year-old children, was found dead in a bedroom. Theyhad been dead for several days. The father had sealed the fam-ily in the bedroom and started ch arcoal fires while they slept. He left a suicide note. The ambient carbon monoxide level was71 ppm. Case 131. An 11-year-old boy was found unresponsive and apneic in an idling automobile that was covered in 2 feet of snow from a recent blizzard. He was last seen 3 hours earlier. He was transported to the nearest ED by EMS, but had a car-diac arrest en route. Carbon monoxide was suspected and a922 M.W. LAI ET AL. carboxyhemoglobin level drawn upon ED arrival was 54%. CPR was unsuccessful and the patient died. Case 186. A 28-year-old train engi neer presented to an ED following a train wreck where a chlorine tank car ruptured, releasing a cloud of chlorine gas into the environment. The patient inhaled the chlorine and presented to the hospital in res-piratory distress. He was intuba ted but, despite aggressive pul- monary care, the patient's respiratory status worsened and hedied. Case 188. A 57-year-old man with a history of chronic depression and multiple suicide attempts was found uncon-scious by his sister with a bag over his head attached to ahelium cylinder. A book on \"methods of suicide\" was lyingbeside him. Upon EMS arrival, the patient was in full cardiop-ulmonary arrest. The patient responded to CPR and was admit-ted to the ICU. Eighteen hour s after presentation the family decided to withdraw support, he was declared brain dead and became an organ donor. Cases 189 and 190. Two men, aged 41 and 56 years, were found unconscious in an underground sewer. They were suc-cessfully resuscitated by EMS, admitted to the ICU and treated with hyperbaric oxygen. Initial carboxyhemoglobin and methe-moglobin levels were both <1%. Neither patient regained con-sciousness and both were declared dead within 24 hours ofadmission. The cause of death was thought to be hydrogen sul-fide. Cases 192, 193, and 194. Three workers on a cruise ship entered a room to clean up a sewage leak. All three were laterfound in cardiopulmonary arrest and pronounced dead prior tohospital transport. The toxin was subsequently identified ashydrogen sulfide through environmental monitoring by a haz-ardous materials team. Nineteen other persons were exposedbut survived. Case 198. A 37-year-old man was found dead with a respi- rator mask connected to tank of chlorofluorocarbon over hisface. The man worked for a HVAC company and had easyaccess to the chlorofluorocarbon. Death was ruled an accident by the coroner. Case 203. A 15-month-old girl was found in the garage by her father vomiting and in respiratory distress. EMS was calledand found the child vomiting, blue and with the odor of gaso-line. The child was intubated and transported to the ED. Thechild's condition rapidly worsen ed, with evidence on sequen- tial chest X-rays of worsening bilateral infiltrates. Prior to atransport flight to a tertiary healthcare facility , the child suf- fered a cardiopulmonary arrest an d could not be resuscitated. Case 205. A 61-year-old man was brought to the hospital with burns over approximately 20% of his body. There wereconflicting stories as to the cause. It was thought that he hadfallen asleep in front of a kero sene stove, but after he had been in the hospital 2 days he passed some kerosene-like fluid fromhis rectum and it was suggested that he might have ingestedkerosene and self-inflicted the burn. He had multiple complica- tions including renal failure and pneumonia with ARDS,requiring intubation and assisted ventilation. He died one week after admission. Case 206. A 2-year-old boy ingested an unknown amount of cigarette lighter fluid (naptha) with resultant cough. When the poison center was contacted the child was enroute to the hospi- tal and receiving CPR. An x-ray in the ED showed completeopacification of both lungs. The child died shortly after arriv-ing in the ED. Case 207. A 56-year-old previously healthy man picked and ate mushrooms. Approximately 8 hours later he devel-oped nausea, abdominal cramps, vomiting and diarrhea.Over the next several hours he became progressively worseand finally presented to the ED approximately 19 hours postingestion. He was treated with IV fluids. Laboratory investi-gation at that time revealed AST 39 U/L, ALT 59 U/L, INR0.94, BUN 22 mg/dL, and serum creatinine 1.0 mg/dL. Apreliminary description of the mushrooms could not rule outAmanita species so multi-dose activated charcoal was rec-ommended while awaiting definitive identification. By thefollowing morning AST was 20 1 U/L, ALT 243 U/L and the mushroom was identified as Amanita bisporigera . N-acetyl- cysteine, high dose penicillin, ascorbic acid, and cimetidinewere recommended as further therapies that might poten-tially decrease toxicity. Despite this treatment he developedfulminant hepatic failure and renal failure. He was trans-ferred to a transplant center for possible liver transplanta-tion. He remained encephalopathic, coagulopathic, andanuric and developed atrial fibrillation and hypotension. Hedied 4 days post ingestion. Case 208. A 56-year-old Laotian man picked wild mush- rooms in the forest and cooked them for himself the day prior to admission. He presented to an urgent care center with nau- sea, vomiting and diarrhea. He received metoclopromide and promethazine in addition to IV fluids. Laboratory measures ofhepatic and renal function were normal but he was admitted tothe hospital. The mushroom was identified as an Amanita bisp- origera on the basis of questioning of the patient by a mycolo- gist. On the second day his liver enzymes were mildlyelevated. The patient and his family declined to be listed for an urgent liver transplant. Laboratory values on day 3 were: INR,5; AST, 6262 U/L; ALT, 4770 U/L; ammonia, 92 mol/L; and pH, 7.45. The patient remain ed awake and alert but com- plained of generalized abdominal pain. By hospital day 6 thepatient was delirious. By day 7 the patient was comatose andwas intubated. His liver enzymes began to decline but his INRand bilirubin were rising. The patient started to regain con-sciousness on hospital day 13 but his bilirubin continued torise, peaking at 28.4 mg/dL on day 15. The patient was extu-bated and gradually became more responsive, asking for food.He was discharged from the hospital after 21 days with a fol-low-up visit scheduled for the toxicology clinic in about 3weeks. He did not come to that appointment and two days laterwas readmitted to the hospital with the diagnosis of ongoingliver failure and sepsis. The patient died from sepsis (E. coli in2005 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE AAPCC NATIONAL DATABASE 923 femoral catheter and mold in sputum) about two months after his initial ingestion. Case 210. A 15-year-old girl ingested approximately 5 pel- lets (by patient history) of aluminum phosphide in a stated sui-cide attempt. It is unclear how the patient obtained thisproduct. She presented in the ED approximately 45 minutes post ingestion with confusion, bradycardia, diap horesis, cyano- intubated, given activated charcoal and then lavaged. Approxi-mately 2 hours post ingestio n she became hypotensive and vasopressors were started. Th e patient then developed PEA, was coded and died. Case 211. A 20-year-old man was traveling inside a rice- filled railcar for 6 hours. The patient developed severe respira-tory distress within hours of leaving the railcar, which hadbeen fumigated with aluminum phosphide tablets. He wasawake, hypotensive, hypothermic, acidemic upon arrival ED. The patient was intubated, started on vasopressors andtransferred to the ICU. He developed worsening pulmonaryedema and renal failure and r eceived emergent hemodialysis. An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 10%. The patient suffered two episodes of cardiac arrest roughly 16hours from admission, the second from which he could not beresuscitated. Autopsy revealed pulmonary congestion, but oth-erwise normal organs on gross inspection. The cause of deathwas judged to be sudden cardiac arrest due to phosphine expo-sure. Case 212. A local newspaper reported the death of an 81- year-old woman who died one day following exposure to phos-phine gas. A phosphide pesticide was apparently added to herapartment building's water softener brine tank. Several otherresidents also became ill. A follow-up newspaper article reported the conviction, with a 20 -year prison sentence, of the assailant who pleaded guilty to first degree manslaughter. Case 213. A 37-year-old woman was in a building that was being fumigated with sulfuryl fluoride. She stated that shewoke up and escaped the building. She was transported to alocal ED, where she was hypoten sive breaths/min). She given intravenous fluids and 2 ampules of calcium glucon-ate with an improvement in her blood pressure. She was com-plaining of cough, nausea, and eye irritation. Her initial EKG showed a prolonged QTc. Ninety minutes after presentation, she developed torsades de pointes, followed by ventricularfibrillation and finally suffered an asystolic arrest. During the unsuccessful resuscitation atte mpt, she received 6 ampules of calcium chloride, 4 grams of magnesium sulfate, and 4ampules of sodium bicarbonate. Her serum calcium at the timeof presentation was 5.3 mEq/L, while her serum potassium justprior to her death was 4.5 mEq/L. Case 214. A 40-year-old man presented with complaints of blurred vision, sore throat, vomiting, abdominal pain, andlightheadedness. He reported that he had ingested half a bottleof diquat dibromide 48 hours earlier. Neither the volume norconcentration of the diquat ingested was known, as he did not bring the bottle with him. He was admitted to the ICU wherepertinent laboratory values we re: BUN, 68 mg/dL; creatinine, 7.9 mg/dL; white cell count, 25,000/ L; ALT, 304 U/L; and AST, 558 U/L. He had a nasopharyngeal scope done on day 1,which revealed the presence of posterior pharyngeal, uvular, and epiglottic mucosal injury. That night he developed anuriaand severe agitation, which wa s treated with benzodiazepines and haloperidol. A head CT was normal. He was intubated onday 2 and hemodialysis was started due to his renal failure. N-acetylcysteine was administered orally. He underwent endos- copy later that day which revealed esophagitis with no ulcer-ation. He was continued on hemodialysis. By the evening ofday 2 he developed tachycardia and hypertension, with concernfor possible sedative hypnotic or ethanol withdrawal. He thenbecame bradycardic and his neur ologic exam deteriorated with evidence of herniation, confirmed by head CT. The familywithdrew support on day 3 and he died. Case 215. A 45-year-old woman ingested 10 ounces of a glyphosate herbicide in a suicide attempt. She developed someabdominal pain, hematemesis, and diarrhea. Two days after theingestion she informed her boyfriend and was brought to theED, where she was found to be in acute renal failure. Initial examination revealed a blood pressure of 182/82 mm Hg, heartrate of 117 beats/min, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She wasalert, had constricted pupils, and her skin appeared flushed.Initial laboratory data included: BUN, 63 mg/dL; levels were not detectable. She was admitted and initiallytreated with IV fluids. The next day her respiratory status dete-riorated and a chest X-ray showed possible ARDS. She wastransferred to the ICU, intubated endotracheally, and sedated.She was also noted to have a di ffuse erythematous facial and neck rash. Hemodialysis was st arted. On the fourth hospital day she remained deeply comatose. A head CT showed exten-sive, diffuse injury to the brain and midbrain, and a pontinehemorrhage. She remained unresponsive and life support mea-sures were withdrawn after 8 days. Case 216. A 69-year-old man was found sitting in a car, alert and oriented. He reportedly had ingested 240 mL of gly-phosate concentrate an hour earlier. He developed vomitingand respiratory distress. The patient was transported to the EDwhere he rapidly deteriorated with an increased respiratory rate, hypersalivation, and an a ltered level of consciousness. He was admitted to the ICU where he was hypertensive (210/125mm Hg). Over the course of two hours, the patient developedhypothermic (93.5 \u00b0F), tachypnea, acidosis, anurea, sodium bicarbonate, hemodialysis, andvasopressors to maintain his blood pressure. The patient dieddue to severe metabolic acidosis, acute lung injury, and pulmo-nary aspiration. The medical ex aminer classified the death as suicide by acute glyphosate poisoning.924 M.W. LAI ET AL. Case 219. A 62-year-old man presented in the ED unrespon- sive after reportedly ingesting unknown amounts of paraquat,\"some sort of organophosphate\" and ethanol in a suicideattempt. In the ED he was hypertensive (320/120 mm Hg) andtachycardic (120-120 beats/min). He was intubated. Due to thehistory of paraquat ingestion, at tempts were made to keep the Sa02 around 85-90%. His initial laboratory values showed aci-dosis (pH, 7.0) and hypokalemic (2.4 mEq/L). Liver functiontests, as well as acetaminophen and salicylate levels, werereported to be normal. An ethanol level was 59 mg/dL. Addi-tional history indicat ed that he had had blue-green emesis. A continuous infusion of sodium bicarbonate was started. Afterstabilization, he was transferred to another HCF. Laboratoryassessment showed persistent acidosis and hypokalemia, aswell as a acid level of 15.1 mg/dL. Six hours later thepatient was still acidotic, and was also hypotensive and tachy-cardic. Hemodialysis was initiated that afternoon. The familythen made him a do not resuscitate and he died later that day. Aparaquat level, performed on an antemortem serum specimen,was elevated at 51 g/mL. Case 221. A 38-year-old man was seen to drink from a cup reportedly containing aldicarb on a farm where he wasemployed. EMS was called, but the patient fled. He was chasedfor some distance across the farm before he was discoveredlying unresponsive in a field. When EMS arrived he was unre-sponsive and they admi nistered activated ch arcoal in the field. A helicopter arrived to transport him to a tertiary care facility.He had vomited and aspirated charcoal and was nasally intu-bated. On arrival in the ED he was vomiting and had lacrima-tion, miosis, diaphoresis, sali vation and a GCS of staff was suctioning 10-15 mL of charcoal-containing liq-uid out of his lungs every five minutes. His initial heart ratewas 40 beats/min, but increased to 120 beats/min with theadministration of atropine. Infusions of atropine and prali-doxime were started and the patient was admitted to the ICU.Shortly after transfer to the IC U, the patient had a seizure and lorazepam was administered. The patient was noted to be tachycardic and hypertensive at th is time. Over the next several hours the patient continued to have seizure activity, requiringlorazepam. The seizure activity subsided and no further sei- zures were reported during the hospital course. The morningafter admission the patient was febrile to 102 \u00b0F. Antibioticswere started for aspiration pneumonia. On day 2 the atropineinfusion rate was reduced (2 mg/hr to 0.75 mg/hr) and thepralidoxime was stopped. On day 3 his atropine was discontin-ued. The patient self-extubated that day also but had to be re-intubated due to respiratory depression. His temperature was103 \u00b0F despite external coo ling measures. The patient was reportedly hypertensive requiri ng a diltiazem infusion. Due to hyperglycemia the patient was placed on an insulin drip. It wasunknown if the patient had pre-existing hypertension or diabe-tes. His white blood cell count was 9,000/ L with no left shift. He was having adequate urine output. That night the patientbecame hypotensive an d required vasopressors. Over the nexttwo days the patient showed no improvement and continued with tachycardia, fever and agitation.. The patient died on hos-pital day 5. Case 222. An 18-month-old girl was taken to the local ED by her parents after an apparent ingestion of an insecticide con-taining allethrin and piperonyl butoxide in 99% mineral spirits.In the ED she was lethargic and vomiting. Emergency inter-ventions included intubation as well as pralidoxime and atro-pine because of copious secret ions. During the resuscitation it became clear that the patient had developed aspiration pneu- monia. The child was transferred to a tertiary care PICU where she died a short time later. Th e cause of death was ruled hydro- carbon aspiration, possibly enhanced by pyrethrin toxicity. Case 225. A 44-year-old man was brought into a local ED in full cardio-pulmonary arrest. He had been spraying malathionaround his yard for approximately one week prior to this event.The previous day the patient had attempted to clean up amalathion spill in his enclosed garage. He became symptom-atic that day and was seen at another ED, but removed himself against medical advice from that facility. Shortly after return- ing home he began to complain of dyspnea, abdominal pain,excessive salivation, and blurry vision. He then arrested. In theED he was intubated and placed on the ventilator . Atropine and pralidoxime were initiated immediately. He became hypoten-sive and had seizure activity. De spite aggressive medical treat- ments, including the use of be nzodiazepines and vasopressors, his condition deteriorated and he died 3 days later. Case 226. A 23-year-old student intentionally ingested an insecticide containing 48.6% sodium sulfur arsenate. He rap-idly experienced multiple episodes of emesis and then lost con- sciousness. Four hours later paramedics were summoned andthe patient was transported to the hospital. Upon arrival in theED the patient was tachycardic with a systolic blood pressurebelow 90 mm Hg. Pressors had little effect on his systolicblood pressure. He was given a pproximately 10 liters of fluids which raised his blood pressure. BAL in oil was given IM. Anabdominal x-ray revealed an ileus. A haze of arsenic could beseen in the stomach, but no arsenic was seen in the colon.Ultrasound of the kidney showed significant changes. BUNwas 28 mg/dL and creatinine was 4.2 Calcium magnesium given.He experienced respiratory di fficulty and was intubated but quickly developed pulmonary edema. Despite aggressive treat-ment the patient had a cardiac arrest and died 5.5 hours afterpresentation in the ED. A pre-mo rtem serum arsenic level was 65 g/mL. At autopsy the cause of death was ruled to be sui- cide with arsenic. Case 227. A 22-year-old woman who lived on a hog farm reportedly felt well all day but felt warm in the evening. Shetook a bath, vomited, became inc ontinent of stool, seized, and became unresponsive. En route to the hospital, the patientdeveloped asystolic cardiac arre st. After a prolonged but suc- cessful resuscitation, the patient was hypothermic (temperature2005 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE AAPCC NATIONAL DATABASE 925 \u00b0F), but subsequently b ecame hyperthermic (tempera- ture,104 \u00b0F). She was acidotic (pH, 6.4). Reportedly, she had achemical odor and profound di arrhea. Wheezing, bradycardia, lacrimation, hypersaliv ation, and fasciculations were not noted. Her pupils were fixed and dilated, and she appeared to havesuffered a profound hypoxic brain injury. The patient wasadmitted to ICU and treated with phenytoin and supportivecare. Her pseudocholinesterase level was undetecTable (<0.2,U/mL) She suffered a second cardiac arrest and died approxi-mately 20 hours after hospital presentation. A criminal investi-gation and autopsy were performed. Toxicology studieseventually reported showing the organophosphate terbufos. Case 230. A 21-year-old man was transferred from an out- side ED to an inpatient psychiatric hospital after being peti-tioned by his family and social worker. According to the EMS report, the patient was at home stating that he had taken rat poi-son. According to a signed petition, the patient had ingested a\"rat poison\" to \"kill the rat that was in his stool.\" There was no specific identification of a rode nticide and the family reported that there were none in the ho me. There was no family witness to the alleged ingestion. The patient's mother had reported fre-quent auditory and visual hallucinations at home. He presentedwith a change in mental status and mild bradycardia. His coag- ulation profile was normal. The original urine drug screen at the time of admission to the ED was positive for barbiturates. A quantitative analysis was not performed at that time. Thefamily was not aware of any barbiturate or other medicationuse by the patient. The patien t became progressively catatonic with no evidence of muscle rigi dity. He was treated with halo- peridol 5 mg twice daily while at the inpatient psychiatric facil-ity. His condition continued to decline and he wassubsequently transferred to a tertiary care center for further evaluation 2 days after his presentation. A CT of the brainrevealed marked cerebral edem a. The patient was intubated and admitted to the ICU for further evaluation. Serum phe- nobarbital level was < 1.1 g/ml. A comprehensive urine drug screen revealed the presence of promethazine. His coagulation profile remained normal. Laboratory studies revealed: whiteblood 24,000 / L; creatinine, 2.5 mg/dL; CK, 61 U/L; and a normal lumbar puncture. The patient continued todecline. Subsequent brain CT imaging revealed worsened cere- bral edema and herniation. Life support was withdrawn and thepatient died.. At aut opsy, the patient had mild brain swelling without evidence of disease or infection. Microsopic evalua- tion confirmed severe acute lobar pneumonia, and vacuoliza-tion of the white matter of the brain. Tissue toxicology of thebrain and liver detected demethylated bromethalin. The coro-ner was able to interview the family and to confirm that bro-methalin (eight baits) had been ingested. Case 231. A 4-year-old girl was discovered to have hepatic failure and was referred for a possible liver transplant. She wasdiagnosed with viral hepatitis and a transplant was denied. Shethen developed respiratory problems and was admitted to thePICU where she received bilatera l chest tubes for pleural effu-sions. Her younger brother was also admitted at this time with hepatic failure. It was later discovered that the grandmotherhad been giving them both a homemade herbal tea for feverand constipation. The family br ought a sample of the plant used in the tea and it was identified by two botanists as Senecio longilobus , which contains pyrrolizidine biopsy of the patient's brother consistent with exposure to pyrrolizidine alklaloids. Aliver biopsy was never performed on the patient due to her anti-coagulated state, but her clini cal picture of hepatitis and pul- monary toxicity is well documented with exposure topyrrolizidine alkaloids. The pa tient stabilized for a number of weeks but eventually succumbed to irreversible pulmonary dis- ease. The postmortem opinion was that the patient died frompyrrolizidine alkaloid ingestion. It is unknown if the grand-mother mistook this plant for a nontoxic one. Case 294. A 21-year-old man presen ted in the ED after an admitted ingestion of a \"bottle of aspirin, two tablets of clon-azepam and alcohol\" in a suicid e attempt. Activated charcoal was given on presentation. On the initial toxicology screen hisblood alcohol level was 48 mg/dL, salicylate, 4.2 mg/dL andacetaminophen, 405 g/mL. His 4-hour acetaminophen level was 1062 g/mL. At this time his vital signs were stable. At 17 hours post-ingestion he was awake and alert. He had receivedand tolerated a PO loading dose and subsequent PO doses ofN-acetylcysteine. An acetaminophen level was 900 g/mL. At 22 hours post-ingestion the patient was intubated due to clini-cal deterioration. His condition seemed to worsen after intuba-tion. His pH was 7.1 and a sodium bicarbonate drip wasstarted. At 25 hours post-inge stion he suffered a cardiac arrest but was successfully resuscitated. Following the arrest therewas difficulty maintaining a good perfusing pressure and hewas placed on dopamine and nor epinephrine. He apparently suffered further cardiac rhythm and/or blood pressure prob-lems and required multiple resuscitation efforts. At 31 hourspost-ingestion the patient developed bradycardia and a fallingblood pressure despite support. He then became asystolic and could not be resuscitated. Case 348. A 37-year-old woman was brought to the ED after being found unconscious by her boyfriend, who had received in the mail a suicide letter from her dated the daybefore. A note saying \"DNR\" was found pinned to the patient.Three empty bottles of acetaminophen with diphenhydramine,along with bottles of clonazepam and ziprasidone were next to her. She had vomited. In the ED she was intubated, lavagedand given activated charcoal. Vital signs were: blood pressure,102/46 mm Hg; heart rate, 96 beats/min. A urine toxicologyscreen was positive for benzodiazepines and marijuana. Anacetaminophen level was 155 g/mL with an ALT of 107 U/L and AST of 88 U/L. She was started on N-acetylcysteine. A repeat acetaminophen level, 4 hours after the first, was 426 g/ mL, and a third level, 6 hours after the second, was 390 g/mL. The following day the ALT was 241 U/L and the AST was 138 U/L. A repeat acetaminophen level, now 18 hours after presentation,926 M.W. LAI ET AL. was 697 g/mL. Pupils were now fixed and dilated and the patient suffered a terminal card iac arrest 36 hours after presen- tation. An autopsy was remarkable for the finding of acute cen- trilobular necrosis on liver pathology, and for a jugular venousblood acetaminophen level of 899 g/mL and diphenhy- dramine level of 9.2 g/mL. Case 365. A 51-year-old man presented to a rural hospital with some mild drowsiness and a history of taking about 110tablets of a pain medication containing hydrocodone (5 mg)and acetaminophen (500 mg) abou t 5 hours earlier. His urine drug screen was only positive for opiates and an initial ace- taminophen level was 343 mcg/mL. The patient was given aloading dose of N-acetylcystei ne. Liver function tests were: AST, U/L; ALT, 276 U/L; total bilirubin, 2.7 mg/dL. Onthe morning of the next day his blood glucose was 30 mg/dL,which normalized after a snack. The following day the patient got out of bed in the early morn ing and, according to the nurse, probably began hemorrhaging in ternally. He became unrespon- sive, cyanotic and bradycardic. Cardioversion and resuscitation efforts failed and the patient died. Case 428. A 30-year-old man was transferred from one HCF to another, with a preliminary diagnosis of pulmonary embo-lism. In the report from the refe rring HCF, the receiving physi- cian noted that the salicylate level was 125 mg/dL. Clinically,the patient was described as having altered mental status andtachypneic. Enroute to the seco nd HCF, the patient had a car- diac arrest and was unsuccessfully resuscitated. Case 434. A 49-year-old woman was brought to an acute care hospital from a psychiatric hospital because of worsening mental status and low oxygen saturation. She had been sent tothe psychiatric facility for altered mental status from an acutemedical facility earlier in the day, having had a negative urinedrug screen. The patient was found to have ARDS and elevatedliver enzymes (ALT, 300 U/L and AST, 940 U/L), in additionto altered mental status. She was intubated and ventilated. Asalicylate level of 123 mg/dL was obtained, along with an ace- taminophen level of zero. The patient died 3 hours after pre-sentation. An autopsy ascribed cause of death to respiratory failure and salicylate toxicity. Case 443. An 89-year-old man reportedly ingested about 30 aspirin tablets. In the ED the patient complained of difficultyswallowing and was unable to to lerate activated charcoal. A salicylate level, approximately 2.5 hours after the ingestion,was 20 mg/dL. He refused an NG tube. His electrolytes werenormal, but an x-ray suggested an esophageal obstruction. Arepeat salicylate level 2 hours later was 23.7 mg/dL. Endos-copy in the ED showed an esophageal obstruction by pills. Hewas admitted to the ICU for ev entual surgery for the obstruc- tion. However, the patient refused all interventions after admis-sion and made himself a do not resuscitate. He refused surgeryand developed an esophageal perforation and died about 36hours after admission. Case 477. A 41-year-old woman was found dead by her family. She had 11 fentanyl patches on her skin.Case 498. A 49-year-old woman died in the hospital while being treated with meperidine via a PCA pump. The patient's postmortem meperidine level was 2.5 g/mL. Case 500. A 5-year-old Mexican boy was transferred to a U.S. hospital for possible bone marrow and liver transplants.He had been treated with metamizol for fever and had devel-oped agranulocytosis (300/ L), thrombocytopenia (34,000/ L) and liver failure (bilirubin, 31 mg/dL). Initially the patient wasawake and talking without distress and with stable vital signs.He deteriorated over the next 3 days becoming more agitated and progressing to fulminant liver failure and complete aplasticanemia. Hepatitis C core antigen was found to be positive butno explanation for the patient's aplastic anemia was found onbone marrow biopsy. The transplant teams felt that the pres-ence of both liver failure and bone marrow suppression elimi-nated the possibility of either a liver or bone marrowtransplant. On hospital day four the patient became hypoten- sive and required ventilatory s upport for respiratory distress. He died 11 days after admissio n despite plasmaphoresis, dialy- sis, and supportive care. Case 501. A local newspaper reported the death of a 2- month-old girl who was found in cardiac arrest by the police.The child had a history of neonatal withdrawal syndrome fromcocaine and opiates. The Medical examiner reported the pres- ence of methadone on autopsy a nd declared the cause of death methadone intoxication. Case 502. The local newspaper reported the death of a 15- month-old boy who reportedly ingested methadone from hissippy cup. Methadone was prescr ibed to the mother. He was found unresponsive and apneic 2 hours later and was pro-nounced dead in the ED. Analysis of peripheral blood atautopsy revealed 0.3 g/mL of methadone. The manner of death was homicide and murder charges have been filed. Case 503. A 6-year-old boy was brought to the ED after having been found in cardiopulmonary arrest at home. Intuba-tion and CPR were performed enro ute. It was thought that the patient may have been given clonazepam by his developmen-tally delayed sister. On arrival in the ED the patient was defib-rillated for ventricular fibrilla tion and regained a sinus heart rate. His initial blood glucose was 498 mg/dL with a pH of 6.9 and base deficit of 20 mEq/L. A urine drug screen was nega-tive and a head CT scan showed global cerebral edema. Thepatient was transferred to the ICU where his blood glucose was80 mg/dL, his pupils were fixed and dilated and he vasopressors. A basal ganglia infarcts and diffuse edema. The child then developed a pulmonary hemorrhage and was hypercapnic,despite adequate vent ilation. Several hour s later, he became bradycardic and developed pulsel ess electrical activity, requir- ing chest compressions. Several hours after that the patientbecame bradycardic, developed ventricular tachycardia and could not be resuscitated. Postmortem blood showed a metha-done level of 0.07 g/mL. It is suspected that he accidentally took another family member's medication.2005 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE AAPCC NATIONAL DATABASE 927 Case 570. A 21-month-old boy became cyanotic during sleep. By-stander CPR was begun and he was transported tothe ED by ambulance. There was no history of exposure todrugs. The only drug known to be in the home was metformin.He presented with lethargy, cyanosis, and miosis. He was intu-bated. Blood pressure and heart rate were normal. A toxicologyscreen was positive for opiates only. Initial arterial blood gasresults showed a pH of 7.23 with a pCO2 of 53 mm Hg. Hewas transferred to a pediatri c specialty hospital, where he developed hypotension requiring vasopressors. Administrationof naloxone resulted in decer ebrate posturing. Approximately 36 hours after admission he was pronounced brain dead. Theinitial serum morphine concentr ation was greater than 5,000 ng/mL. Case 578. A 59-year-old woman with history of chronic pain had an implantable intr athecal morphine pump. During refilling of the pump the patient experienced severe hyperten-sion and headache. She soon became hypotensive andremained hypotensive despite fluids and vasopressors. Shedied the next It is thoug ht that the morphine was acciden- tally injected directly into the CSF, rather than into the pump's reservoir. A CSF morphine le vel was approximately 0.4 mg/ mL. Case 607. A 3-year-old girl was found unresponsive in the morning, after having gone to bed at about midnight. Thepatient was visiting in her grandmother's home. When para-medics arrived, the patient was found in respiratory arrest with a heart rate of about 130 beats/min. In the ED she was intu-bated. Her examination was consistent with severe anoxicbrain injury. She died later that day. A toxicology screen waspositive for opioids and at autopsy a free blood oxycodonelevel was 280 ng/mL. Case 652. An 11-year-old boy with muscular dystrophy was undergoing bilateral Achilles tendon of 40 cc of 0.25% plain bupivacaine was applied to control pain. An undetermined amount of time later,while still in surgery, he had a sudden drop in his blood pres-sure, heart rate and oxygen saturation. Hypotension respondedto vasopressors. Shortly after, his blood pressure dropped againand he again became bradycar dic, requiring chest compres- sions. An echocardiogram showed poor cardiac output. It wasthought by the surgeon that he might have an undocumentedcardiomyopathy secondary to his muscular dystrophy. Resusci-tation was unsuccessfully continued for 2 hours, after which hewas pronounced dead. No autopsy was done. Case 653. A 22-year-old woman with a history of an adrenal disorder and hirsutism was found in a motor vehicle unrespon-sive and seizing. The patient had applied lidocaine cream from her toes to the waist and wr apped herself in cellophane as instructed by her physician prior to LASIK hair removal. Dur-ing transport by EMS, she had a respiratory arrest. Initialexamination found lidocaine cr eam covering her bilaterallower extremities and an elevated temperature. The patient was hospitalized but died a week la ter after herniating. Postmortem evaluation revealed anoxic injury to th e brain. A lidocaine blood level drawn approximately 48 hours after presentation to the ED was 7.9 g/mL. Case 654. An adult woman was found unresponsive and in cardiac arrest with 10 lidocaine dermal patches on her skin.Resuscitation efforts were unsuccessful. Case 666. A 59-year-old woman was admitted following an overdose of oxcarbazepine 30 mi nutes prior to presentation. At presentation she was lethargic without any hemodynamicabnormality. She was given activ ated charcoal and admitted to the ICU. She progressively de teriorated and became obtunded, requiring intubation and mechanically ventilation. There wasevidence of aspiration. She developed seizures, which initiallyimproved with phenytoin and la ter with lorazep am and propo- fol. She remained obtunded an d suddenly had a cardiac arrest and could not be resuscitated. Case 667. A 32-year-old woman presented to the emergency room following ingestion of an unknown amount of oxcarba-zepine and levetiracetam. She was intubated for respiratory and CNS depression and activated charcoal and cathartic were administered. Her urine drug screen was negative, as were sali-cylate and acetaminophen levels. Her heart rate fluctuated from She comba tive. On follow-up, she had been extubated and was alert, oriented, and cooperative. How-ever, on subsequent follow-up, she had had an episode inwhich she began gritting her teeth, pulling her clothes off, andtrying to get out of bed. She was disoriented, asked her ownname, and began calling out numbers. This lasted about 5-10minutes, after which she agai n became alert and oriented. At the next follow-up, two days after admission, she had died. Case 670. A 27-year-old man was found unconscious in a hotel room with 2 bottles of valproic acid. In the ICU he wascomatose. Vital signs were: heart rate, 150 beats/min (in atrialfibrillation); and systolic blood pressure, 80 mm acid level,1,984 g/mL; and He givenintensive supportive care, including pressors. He remainedhypotensive despite pressors, antibiotics, and volume support.His valproic acid level peaked at 3,465 g/ml, the day after admission. Acute renal failure and acute pancreatitis ensued. His acidosis remained intractable and the patient died 4 daysafter original presentation. Case 748. A 56-year-old woman, with a remote history of Hodgkin's disease, was admitted with a presumed toxic hepati- tis. She had been started on delayed-release duloxetine fordepression about 3 months earlier. Her initial dose had been 30mg/day but this had been increased to 60 mg/day about 6weeks before admission. Testi ng at admission ruled out ace- taminophen, ethanol, and viral causes of hepatitis. During twoweeks of hospitalization, her transaminases rose to 2,000-3,000 U/L, bilirubin to 23 mg/dL, and INR to 2.8. She was then928 M.W. LAI ET AL. transferred to a tertiary care institution for possible liver trans- plant. However, her mental stat us declined rapidly at the time of transfer, requiring intubati on and ventilation. She never improved and died 12 days after transfer without transplant. Case 765. A 59-year-old woman on dialysis for renal failure was admitted to the hospital fo r a revascularization procedure because of a clotted fistula. She presented the admitting physi- cian a written list of medicatio ns, and verbally confirmed that she took nortriptyline 400 mg at bedtime. This amount wasordered by the admitting physician, dispensed by the pharmacy(8 \u00d7 50 mg) and administered by the nursing staff, who ques- tioned the patient specifically about the dose. The patientunderwent clot revision surgery on hospital day 3. Nortrip-tyline was not reordered postoperatively. On hospital day 5 thepatient fell in her hospital room and fractured her hip, which was surgically repaired the following day. Postoperatively thepatient's nortriptyline, at the initial dose (400 mg at bedtime),was reordered. On hospital day 6 the patient was noted to bedrowsy and a serum nortriptyline concentration was sent, butthe medication was not discontinued. On hospital day 8 thepatient was transferred to the ICU for increasing agitation and \"cardiac symptoms.\" Her vital signs included a systolic bloodpressure of 130 mm Hg with a heart rate of 102 beats/min. Atthat time her BUN was 70 mg/dL and her creatinine was 9.2mg/dL. After transfer to the ICU, the nortriptyline level, sentnearly two days earlier, was reported as 1,405 ng/mL, prompt-ing a call to the poison center. The poison center recommended obtaining an ECG and administering hypertonic sodium bicar-bonate, if appropriate. Ninety mi nutes later, her heart rate was 150 beats/min with a QRS duration of 218 msec. There was noresponse to a bolus of 150 mL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate.The patient died three hours later. Case 769. An incarcerated 20-year -old man was brought to the prison clinic after an overdose of what he said was a \"cup\"of haloperidol pills, 100 tablets of unknown strength nortrip-tyline and 30 unknown strength aspirin tablets. The prisonclinic attempted to perform lavage and give charcoal, but thepatient refused. He told the clinic staff that he wanted to besent straight to the psychiatry unit as they have turkey onThanksgiving and the prison does not. At that time, his bloodpressure was 120/80 mm Hg with a heart rate of 132 beats/min.The patient was transferred to th e ED where he arrived in full cardiopulmonary arrest and could not be resuscitated. Case 820. A 39-year-old woman pres ented in a clinic with symptoms of generalized weakness. She had been treated at the clinic for at least three days for nausea and right upper quad-rant discomfort. The patient was referred to the ED where lab-oratory studies showed her to be in hepatic failure. She hadbeen treated with isoniazid for a positive tuberculin test with- out evidence of active tuberculosis, and this was felt to be thecause of her liver failure. A urine drug screen was negative andher acetaminophen level was less than 2.0 g/mL. The patient was followed for five days in the ICU before being transferredto a liver transplant center with deteriorating liver function.The patient became increasingly encephalopathic with increas- ing intracranial pressures. She also became more coagulopathic and began to go into renal fail ure. A liver became available and she was transplanted, although she experienced increasedintracranial pressure during th e surgery. A head CT revealed brain stem herniation and she died. Case 827. A 14-year-old boy had been treated with stavu- dine, lamivudine, zidovudine and fosamprenavir since 2 yearsof age for vertically acquired HIV. He presented with com- plaints of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain 2 weeks before the poison center was contacted. His work-up included CT imaging which was negative and a lactate level of 19 mg/dL. The patient received intrav enous fluids and his lactate decreased to 3 mg/dL but then the lactate began doubling every few days until it got to the level of 33 mg/dL. The poison cen-ter was contacted and recommended stopping all of his medi-cations and to consider the diagnosis of NALA (NRTIAssociated Lactic Acidosis). He developed renal failure requir- ing dialysis, thrombocytopenia, and DIC. He died the day thepoison center was contacted. All cultures were negative and noautopsy was done. Case 829. An 89-year-old woman was dispensed a prescrip- tion of the incorrect medication two weeks prior to admission.It was intended that she receive meclizine, but she was given methotrexate (2.5 mg three times daily). She arrived in the EDhypotensive with pancytopenia and black tarry stools. Labora-tory evaluation revealed: white blood cells, 0.0 / L; platelets, 1,000/ L; hemoglobin, 10 g/dL; potassium, 2.5 86 creatinine, 1.6 mg/dL; AST, 49 U/L; and ALT, 81U/L She was treated with platel ets, a dopamine infusion, G- CSF, bicarbonate, red cells, and leucovorin. A methotrexateserum level, drawn at admission, was reported on the third hos-pital day as 0.04 mol/L, which is below the concentration which requires treatment with leucovorin. The bicarbonate wasdiscontinued along with the leucovorin and the intestinalbleeding improved. However, it was believed that the patienthad developed sepsis. Both her blood pressure and respiratory status deteriorated and she died. Case 850. Two-year-old paternal twins ingested an unknown quantity of clonidine tablets of unknown strength.There were 5 tablets remaining in a 60 tablet bottle. In the EDboth children were resuscitated and were intubated and receiv- ing vasopressors. The girl appear ed to have aspirated prior to intubation. Over the next 6 hours the boy improved dramati-cally, was taken off pressors, th en extubated a few hours later. The girl initially appeared to improve, then developed verylabile blood pressure, requiring continued vasopressors. Shewas also noted to have worsening respiratory status and pulmo-nary edema. She then began to have decreased urinary outputwith worsening acidosis, requiring a bicarbonate infusion. Hercondition continued to deteriorate over the next 24 hours andshe died approximately 48 hours after admission. Case 874. A 42-year-old woman was admitted to the ICU for a spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage. The time between2005 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE AAPCC NATIONAL DATABASE 929 the incident and her discover y was uncertain. She was intu- bated in the ED because of hyp oxia and presumed aspiration. The patient developed several episodes of supraventriculartachycardia with hypotension unresponsive to adenosine. Adiltiazem infusion (1 25 mg/250 mL solution) was ordered to infuse at 5 mg/hour. Phenylephrine had also been ordered toinfuse at 180 g/min. The nurse admini stered the diltiazem at the rate set for the phenylephrin e. The patient received approx- imately 100 mL of th e diltiazem solution, for a total dose of 75 mg in 20 minutes, before the error was discovered. The phe-nylephrine was not administered. The patient developed signif-icant cardiovascular collapse resulting in asystole and death. Case 914. A 2-year-old boy was found by his mother with her bottle of sustained release nifedipine (90 mg) tablets. Thechild was asymptomatic and by history could have ingested upto five tablets. On arrival in the ED he was given 20 g of acti-vated charcoal and an IV was started. Vital signs were all unre-markable, as were initial laboratory values except forpotassium of 2.8 mEq/L and a glucose of 253 mg/dL. He wastransferred to the PICU of a te rtiary care hospital. On admis- saturation 97-100% on room air. Heremained clinically stable with a resting tachycardia, normalelectrolytes and hyperglycemia. The following morning his heart rate was 170 beats/min; and blood pressure, 93/41 mmHg. His serum glucose was 201 mg/dL and his potassium hadcorrected to 4.2 mEq/L. That afternoon the patient suddenlyhad a decreased heart rate from the 150's to the 120's. He then quickly developed bradycardia to the 50's and rapidly deterio-rated into ventricular fibrillation. Cardiopulmonary resuscita-tion was started. EKG showed asystole. Aggressiveresuscitation, including pacing, was unsuccessful. He neverregained any organized cardiac activity and was pronounceddead. An autopsy was performed. A liver nifedipine level was1.1 mg/kg. Case 915. A 64-year-old man, with a history of hyperten- sion, took an unknown amount of his sustained release nife-dipine in a suicide attempt. He presented in the EDcomplaining of dizziness with a blood pressure of 72/54 mmHg and \"sinus arrhythmias, PACs and PVCs\" on EKG. He wasgiven 1 liter of normal saline, resulting in a systolic blood pres-sure in the 90's mm Hg. Two hours later, after a second liter ofIV fluids, his systolic blood pressure was 90-100 mm Hg.Twelve hours later, after calci um gluconate, he was awake and alert, with a systolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg, and a heartrate of 108 beats/min. Seven hour s later his blood pressure was 105/66 mm Hg with a heart rate of 114 beats/min and unifocalPVCs on EKG. His potassium was 3.7 mmol/L, for which hereceived 20 mEq of potassium chloride. His BUN and creati- nine were 40 mg/dL and 3.0 mg/dL, respectively. He was thentransferred to a medical / psyc hiatric unit. It was learned on follow-up the next day that he had experienced a cardiac arrest the evening of his transfer, and could not be resuscitated.Case 956. A 13-year-old girl presented with mild hepatic encephalopathy. was 74.6 g/mL. The patient's medical history included a remote renal transplant, forwhich she was medicated with mycophenylate and tacrolimus, and a recent URI for which she had been taking two differentacetaminophen-containing pro ducts (acetaminophen/pseu- doephedrine and acetaminophen) for the prior 5 days. She alsohad a history of CMV infection with periodic interval treat-ment, with the last episode being several months prior. It wasestimated that she had been receiving 6-7 g of acetami-nophen per day. The patient was begun on oral N-acetylcys- teine and then switched to the IV preparation. She was placedon the national transplant list. Over the next 24 hours, thepatient had progressive encephalopathy, declining renal func-tion and output, and died before liver transplant could beaccomplished. Case 958. An 8-year-old girl with cerebral palsy was found dead in bed. Postmortem toxico logy tests showed a blood chlo- rpheniramine concentration of 0.388 g/mL and an ethanol level of 68 mg/dL. Medications available to her included an allergy syrup containing chlorpheniramine (2 mg/5 ml), phe-nylephrine (10 mg/5 ml), and methscopolamine mg/5ml) and sodium valproate syrup. Further history revealed thatthe child had been brought home from the ED the night before,where she had been seen for a respiratory illness, and put tobed. She was found dead 7 hours later. An investigation contin-ues. Case 960. The poison center was called by the prosecutor's office about a 2-month-old child originally thought to have suf-focated, but who was found to have a pseudoephedrine level of3.4 g/mL in a postmortem blood sample. Further history showed that the child had supp osedly received a dose of an infant decongestant/antihistamine product containing pseu-doephedrine and dextromethorphan, as well as a dose of asenna containing laxative, before being put to bed. The childwas found dead the next morn ing. The mother was taking ephedrine in order to stay awake during the day and had had 5positive hair samples for meth amphetamine. The inquest stated that the child's death was a homicide caused by pseudoephe-drine toxicity. Case 961. A 61-year-old man receive d 140 mL of a contrast agent containing iopromide for an elective abdominal CT scan.Within 2 minutes of the IV administration, he felt hot. Withinanother minute, he became unresp onsive and asystolic. was unsuc- cessful. Case 963. A 40-year-old woman, with a history of morbid obesity, gastric bypass and depression, ingested ferrous sulfate(iron) tablets (300 mg) in a suicide attempt. The time of inges-tion was unknown. She presented in the ED with confusion,hematemesis and bloody diarrhea. She was hypotensive and930 M.W. LAI ET AL. had an elevated glucose and white blood cell count. She was intubated and ventilated. Gastric lavage was attempted, butonly fresh blood was recovered. She was immediately startedon deferoxamine, but continued to have hematemesis andbloody diarrhea. A serum iron level was 16,289 TIBC of 8,078 g/dL, PT of >200 sec, PTT of 200 and hematocrit of 24%. She cont inued on deferoxamine therapy and also received vitamin K, fr esh frozen plasma, packed red blood cells and bicarbonate. She was started on vasopressorsand large volumes of fluids for hypotension. Emergency gas-trectomy was contemplat ed, but in view of her prior surgeries was deferred. Deferoxamine wa s discontinued after 18 hours when her serum iron level reached 304 g/dL. Her renal func- tion worsened and she died 30 hours after initial presentation. Case 964. A 5-year-old boy was given 3 tablespoons of bak- ing soda (sodium bicarbonate) to induce vomiting after he toldhis mother he had a sore throat and had a lozenge stuck in histhroat. He vomited but complained of abdominal pain after thebicarbonate. He was taken to the ED where he was describedas sedated. An ABG showed a pH of 7.53. Serum sodium was168 mEq/L. and a total CO2 was 38 mmol/L. Vital signs werenormal except for a mild tac hycardia. Recommendations were made to give free water and/or dialyze the patient immediately. He never received dialysis and it is not clear what fluids were given. The patient was transferre d to another hospital where a venous pH was 7.34 with a serum sodium of 159 mEq/L. Thefollowing day the patient was reported to be unresponsive withfixed and dilated pupils. His serum sodium was 163 mEq/Land he was thought to have diabetes insipidus and to have her-niated. He was declared brain dead the following day after a flat line EEG and a cerebral blood flow study showing no flow. Case 967. A 41-year-old man had been injecting 1 mL of dinoprost, a veterinary prostaglandin analog, daily for threeweeks, presumably as a body building agent. The patient apparently developed nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea the nightbefore he presented. He presented in the ED with a markedlyelevated CK level and fever to 108 \u00b0F. He was dialyzed, butdeveloped tetany, seized and arrested. Attempts to resuscitatehim failed. Case 970. An 81-year-old woman presented in the ED with a decreased level of consciousne ss and a blood sugar of 14 mg/ dL. The patient was given IV fluids and her blood glucose roseto 137 mg/dL. Upon investigation, it was discovered that thepatient had a prescription inadvertently filled with glyburide, amedicine not prescribed for her. She had been taking this med-ication twice a day for four days. The patient during this timewas also not eating well. She was admitted to the ICU whereher blood glucoses ranged from 109-153 mg/dL over the nexttwo days. She also developed massive diarrhea and pneumoniaand died on day 4 of her ICU stay. Case 971. A 29-year-old woman, 5 months pregnant, was found by EMS unresponsive and was intubated for airway sup-port. Her family reported finding her unresponsive 4 hoursprior to calling EMS. She was hemodynamically stable butwithout purposeful movements. A blood glucose level was reported as 20 mg/dL. Her urine drug screen was positive forcyclic antidepressants, but she did not have access to them and her ECG was normal. ED staff later learned that she had inten-tionally injected herself with 200 units of her own regular insu-lin while the family watched. Her head CT was normal, but herEEG was abnormal with \"general ized slowing.\" She developed rhabdomyolysis and renal failure. The fetus was aborted andthe patient subsequently died on hospital day 18. Case 974. A 40-year-old man ingested 130-170 tablets of metformin in a suicide attempt after a fight with his wife.When EMS brought him to the ED two hours after the inges-tion, he was alert and stable but drowsy. The ED physiciannoted 15 minutes later that the patient had become disoriented,uncooperative, diaphoretic and unsteady. An hour later, thepatient was lavaged without pill fragments. He was also givenactivated charcoal with a cath artic, but vomited part of the dose. Initial laboratory values were unremarkable except for a glucose of 318 mg/dL and a bicarbonate of 18 mEq/L. Afteradmission to the ICU, the patien t's mental status deteriorated further. His heart rate ranged from 30-90 beats/min. Labora-tory values, done 11 hours after the initial set, included a creat-inine of 4 mg/dL. About 14 hours after admission, whilespeaking to a nurse, he abrupt ly became apneic, hypotensive, and asystolic. He was intubate d and CPR restored a pulse and blood pressure. Laboratory values during the code showed a:pH of 6.9 with a glucose of 32 mg/dL and a bicarbonate of 5mEq/L. Urine output decreased significantly and sustained low efficiency dialysis (SLED) was begun for severe lactic acidosis(lactic acid, 25 mg/dL). Pressors were also begun for hypoten-sion. Despite multiple doses of sodium bicarbonate and 12hours of SLED, he did not improve. Approximately 15 minutesafter SLED was discontinued, he experienced a recurrent car- diopulmonary arrest and could not be resuscitated. Case 983. A 51-year-old woman presented in the ED after ingesting haloperidol, risperidone and benztropine three hoursearlier. On initial presentation, she was awake and alert with the following vital signs: blood pressure, 140/60 mm Hg; heartrate, 106 beats/min; temperature, 98 \u00b0F; and respiratory rate,20 breaths/min. In the ED she received IV fluids, orogastric lavage, and activated charcoal with sorbitol. Her ECG wasreported normal. Serum acet aminophen con centration was 278 g/mL. An oral lo ading dose of N-acetylcysteine was given before the poison center was contacted. IV N-acetylcys-teine was recommended as the patient was becoming lethargic. On follow up it was learned th at the patient had been given activated charcoal with sorbitol every four hours, for a total of 11 doses. She had also been gi ven 6 doses of oral N-acetylcys- teine by NG tube. The treating physician noted that her abdo-men had become increasingly distended over the course of theday and she had had no bowel movements. She had been giventwo sodium phosphate enemas with little effect. The patientwas also noted to be increasingly tachycardic and hypertensive.She was treated with 3 liters of intravenous fluids with no2005 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE AAPCC NATIONAL DATABASE 931 resultant improvement in her heart rate. Her ECG showed a sinus tachycardia. The treating physician gave captopril andmetoprolol for her blood pressure. The patient's blood pressuretransiently improved, however, sh e remained tachycardic. The patient's mental and respirator y status deteriorated and she required intubation. On follow-up, the patient's systolic bloodpressure had decreased to 100 mm Hg. While suctioning thestomach, approximately 1 liter of activated charcoal was removed. An abdominal CT scan noted paralytic ileus and noperforation. Chest x-ray was read as ARDS. The patient wasplaced on a norepinephrine drip for a blood pressure of 90/40 mm Hg with heart rate of 136 beats/min. Despite maximal sup-port, the patient died 3 days after presentation. Case 984. A 5-year-old autistic boy went into cardiac arrest following chelation therapy with calcium disodium EDTA in a physician office. During the pr ocedure the mother noted that the child was limp. CPR was initiated and the child transportedto the ED, where one or two IV bolus doses of calcium chlo- ride were administered. After calcium chloride administration a blood level of calcium was 6.9 mg/dL. The child could be notresuscitated and was declared dead. Case 985. A 45-year-old woman presented in the ED with abdominal pain. She was observed overnight but developedbright red blood per rectum prior to her planned discharge. Shewas admitted but later decompensated and was transferred tothe ICU. There she had a PEA arrest and was resuscitated. Sherequired vasopressors, antibiotics, and bicarbonate themucosa, consistent with ischemic colitis. Surgery was con-sulted. Due to her deteriorating condition, including DIC,aggressive treatment was withheld and she was given comfortmeasures only. She died later th at day. Further review of her medical history revealed that she had juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and migraines. Her medication list included codeine,NSAIDS, and three triptan drugs (eletriptan, frovatriptan andalmotriptan), all prescribed in th e last 5 weeks, by three differ- ent prescribers. Case 987. A 49-year-old woman with a history of depres- sion was suspected of having ingested sumatriptan and bupro-pion 5 hours previously in a suicidal attempt. She was broughtto the ED by her husband. In the ED she was lethargic, tachy- cardic, tachypneic, vomiting and had pin point pupils. Salicy-late, acetaminophen and ethano l analyses were negative. Naloxone was administered without any response. Shereceived activated charcoal an d was admitted to the ICU. Five hours later she was comatose , bradycardic and had unequal pupils. She was intubated and ventilated. A head CT scanshowed extensive bilateral thalamic infarctions. She developedfever, hypertension, and tachy cardia. She was declared dead and became an organ donor. Case 988. A 3-year-old girl with a history of severe non- ambulatory cerebral palsy arrived to the ED with a core tempof 107.6 \u00b0F, tachycardic and tachypneic. For the previous 2weeks, the patient had suffered from an upper respiratoryinfection with mild fevers. Medications included lansoprazole, acetaminophen, laxatives, mul ti-vitamins, and mEq/L; potas-sium, 3.9 mEq/L; and CK, 12,000 U/L. The patient died in theED. It was felt by the ED physician and the poison center thatdeath was most likely due to a faulty baclofen pump and baclofen withdrawal. A baclofen level was requested but never received. Case 1,010. A 12-month-old girl is thought to have ingested an unknown amount of tizanidine, hydrocodone with mirtazapine, while at child was reportedly a \"crack baby.\" When EMSarrived the child was comatose with periods of apnea. Duringtransport the child experienced a seizure and full cardiopulmo- nary arrest. Resuscitation efforts by EMS and the ED staffwere unsuccessful. An autopsy was done but postmortem toxi-cology analyses we re not available to the poison center. Case 1,026. A 2-month-old boy was prescribed chloral hydrate (unknown dose) for colic. The mother gave the child 4doses over an unknown amount of time. The child fell asleep and was later found not breathing. Resuscitation efforts wereunsuccessful. Case 1,034. A 5-year-old boy was found unresponsive at home and transported by EMS to the ED where he was intu- bated. Evidence of vomitus in the airway suggested anoxicinjury. He was tachycardiac and showed some anticholinergic effects. Blood glucose of 32 mg/dL was corrected without effect. Naloxone was given with no response. The mothereventually thought that 3 clo zapine and 1 thioridazine were missing, but acetaminop hen/hydrocodone and sertraline were also present in the home. The pa tient had not been seen for 15- 30 min before the incident. Questionable seizure activity wasseen in the emergency departme nt and treated with midazolam. He remained completely unresponsive on the ventilator. Ahead CT showed global anoxic injury. A urine drug screen and serum acetaminophen and salicylate levels were all negative. An EEG showed seizure activity and he was loaded with phe-nobarbital, phenytoin and placed on a pentobarbital infusion. Dopamine and epinephrine were needed to maintain a systolicblood pressure at 100 mm Hg. On the third hospital day thepentobarbital, epinephrine and dopamine were weaned off. His neurologic status never improved and a brain flow study onday 9 showing no perfusion. An EEG on day 10 showed noactivity. On day 11 he was pronounced dead. Case 1,052. A 15-year-old girl pres ented in the ED claiming to have ingested 2 quetiapine tablets of unknown strength. Herinitial heart rate was 150 beats/ min, but decreased to 115 beats/ min during her ED stay. She was transferred to an inpatientpsychiatry unit. No ECG was obtained. She was observed for 6 hours. She was returned to the ED within six hours with fixed and dilated pupils and seizing. CPR was unsuccessful. The poi- son center was informed a bout the case at this time. Case 1,094. A 54-year-old-man with no known past medical history was found in cardiac arrest. The patient reportedly932 M.W. LAI ET AL. inhaled a product containing butyl nitrite, cyclohexyl nitrite and isobutyl nitrite prior to arrest. Attempts by EMS and EDstaff to resuscitate him were unsuccessful. Autopsy revealed significant atherosclerotic coronary artery disease with chronic ischemic cardiac changes which lik ely contributed to his death. Case 1,103. A 25-year-old man, during the course of an arrest, claimed to swallow a qu antity of drugs, suspected of being cocaine. During his arrest, he was subdued with a stungun. Approximately 45 minutes later, he experienced seizures and a cardiac arrest while in custody. Medics were called andhe was intubated, CPR was performed and he was transportedto the ED, where he was pronou nced dead. Postmortem toxi- cology showed a cocaine blood with a benzoylecgonine level of 9.338 g/mL. THC was also present. Gastric contents showed a cocaine level of 3,522 g/mL. Case 1,163. A 31-year-old woman presented in the ED after taking an unknown amount of ephedrine and ephedra. She hadseizures en route to the hospital. In the ED she was comatoseand her pupils were dilated. Initial vital signs were: tempera-ture, 108 \u00b0F; blood pressure, 50/palpable mm Hg; and 160 beats/min. She receive d fluid resuscitation and cool- ing procedures with normalizat ion of her temperature and blood pressure. About 12 hours after admission to the ICU, shebecame hypotensive, requiring multiple vasopressors, anddeveloped DIC. She became anur ic and received hemodialysis. She died approximately 24 hours after admission from intracta- ble hypotension and DIC. An aut opsy revealed pill fragments in the stomach and cerebral a nd pulmonary edema. A postmor- tem ephedrine level was 1.2 g/mL. Case 1,208. A 25-year-old woman with no known medical history, except recreational use of methamphetamine, was found by her father unresponsive. He called EMS after observ-ing her for 5 hours, hoping she would awaken on her own.EMS intubated her on arrival and transported her to the EDwhere her vital signs were: rect al temperature, 103.1 \u00b0F; blood pressure, 98/71 mm Hg; heart rate, 178 beats /min; and respira-tory rate, 12 breaths/min while maintained on a ventilator. Thepatient had constant twitching on the right side, and would flexthe left side only with significant pain stimulus. Her pupilswere 4mm and reactive or the ri ght, and 3mm an d non-reactive on the left. She received IV fl uids and intravenous boluses of lorazepam for tachycar dia hyperthermia. A CT scan of the head revealed dulling of the gr ey-white margin in the right hemisphere. An MRI the followi ng morning revealed occlu- sion of the right carotid artery resulting in wide-spreadischemic injury to the right cerebral hemisphere. The patient was declared brain-dead and withdrawn from life support 2days after presentation.Case 1,225. A 24-year-old man was brought to the ED following a seizure witnessed by his mother. He had beenincreasingly lethargic over the previous 24-48 hours. Para-medics transporting the patient told ED staff that they sus- pected an overdose, and that there had been access toaripiprazole, trazodone, lithiu m and sertraline. The patient was also a poly-drug abuser who was said to favor heroin,cocaine, methamphetamine, mu shrooms and marijuana. In the ED vital signs were: temperature, 108 \u00b0F; heart rate, 150beats/min; and blood pressure, 70/30 mm Hg. He progres-sively experienced more and more profound shock and diedless than 2 hours after arrival. An autopsy ascribed death to\"hypertrophic heart disease\" , and included methamphet- amine intake as a \"condition contributing but not related tothe immediate cause of death\". The autopsy report makes nomention of trazodone or aripiprazole, but documented druglevels (heart) 0.38 g/mL. The poison center feels that the patient died of drug induced hyperthermia,possibly the serotonin syndrome. Case 1,235. A 54-year-old woman was found at home unre- sponsive and in cardiac arrest by EMS. She had reportedlybeen drinking an iodine-c ontaining antiseptic, bleach (hypochlorite) and fabric softener throughout the previous dayfor unknown reasons. She had a history of \"drinking iodine foryears.\" CPR was begun by EMS and continued in the ED butwithout success. Case 1,236. An 84-year-old woman with a history of schizophrenia, confusion, and hypertension was found by her husband agitated and smelling of wintergreen. Her husbandhad been using oil of wintergreen (methyl salicylate) as a rub.On arrival in the ED she was very agitated and did notrespond to questions. Vital sign s were: heart rate, 120 beats/ min; blood pressure, 160/70 respiratory rate, a severe but compensa ted metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.4. A salicylate level was 124 mg/dL. She was given bicarbonate, charcoal and lorazepam and sent for a CT scan.When she returned to the ED from CT scan she was unre-sponsive and \"mouth breathing with noticible retractions.\" Atthat time her respiratory rate was 44 breaths/min with a bloodpressure of 205/116 mm Hg. She was intubated 4 hours afterarriving in the ED and received a neuro-muscular blocker.Post intubation she became bradycardic. She was given asystolic. Resuscitation efforts were unsuc-cessfull. A postmortem salicylat e level was 94 mg/dL with a methyl "}
