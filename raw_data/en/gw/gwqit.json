FY 2024 funding will support process development and qualification activities to produce the first War Reserve (WR) pit at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 2024 and the Plutonium Modernization activities at the Savannah River Site. Production Modernization also supports qualification of explosive, pyrotechnic, and propellant materials for the NNSA's nuclear security enterprise across five sites; implements the program necessary to produce tritium in support of the nuclear weapons stockpile and other national programs; funds modernization of uranium operations, delivery of canned subassemblies and components needed to maintain the stockpile, as well as support to the U.S. nonproliferation and Naval Reactors; supports the restart and modernization of lapsed depleted uranium (DU) alloying and component manufacturing capabilities for meeting short - and long -term mission requirements; maintains production of the Nation's enriched lithium supply; and provides funding to modernize production of non- nuclear components required for both the active stockpile and warhead modernization programs. Stockpile Research, Technology, and Engineering (SRT&E) The SRT&E portfolio provides the scientific foundation for science -based stockpile decisions and actions, develops the personnel required to support the current and future stockpile, and includes the capabilities, tools, and components needed to support al l missions. Funding requested for FY 2024 supports the continued implementation of the Enhanced Capabilities for Subcritical Experiments (ECSE) and preparations for NNSA's first exascale high -performance computing system. These two capabilities are require d to meet W80 -4 LEP confirmation experiment and reduce uncertainty in the W87 -1 Modification certification. In addition to the procurement and implementation of NNSA's first exascale machine, the funding supports the development and deployment of improved physics and engineering codes needed to support stockpile decisions to operate on this new platform. Funding in this area also supports the development of new materials, technologies, and processes to modernize our nuclear systems and production complex, as well as supporting several experimental testbed capabilities. This is accomplished through warhead component and production technology development and maturation. Academic Programs and Community Support Academic Programs and Community Support e nables robust and diverse science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) research for educational communities through a variety of methods (i.e., grants, fellowships, collaborations, user access). Investments in consortia and centers of excellenc e provide collaborative groups to tackle important questions through multi -disciplinary approaches, and they leverage preeminent scientists in relevant fields. Additionally, NNSA is proposing to establish a Community Capacity Building Program to provide benefits to communities that are affected by activities at NNSA's sites. Infrastructure and Operations (I&O) I&O maintains, operates, and modernizes the NNSA infrastructure in a safe and secure manner to support program execution while seeking to maximize return on investment and reduce enterprise risk. The program plans, prioritizes, and constructs state -of-the-art facilities and infrastructure to support all NNSA programs, except for new complex- construction projects, which are funded by the capability sponsor. The FY 2024 Request provides funding for activities to enable plutonium pit production, expand capacity at the Kansas City National Security Campus (KCNSC), and modernize infrastruc ture throughout the complex. Furthermore, the funding allows NNSA to execute Recapitalization projects to improve the condition and extend the design life of structures, capabilities, and systems to meet program demands; reduce future operating costs by re placing older facilities with new, more efficient facilities; and reduce safety, security, environment, and program risk. Secure Transportation Asset (STA) STA supports safe, secure transport of the Nation's nuclear weapons, weapon components, and special nuclear material throughout the National Security Enterprise (NSE). Nuclear weapon life -extension programs, limited -life component exchanges, surveillance, dismantlement, nonproliferation activities, and experimental programs rely on STA activities to ensure safe, secure, and on- schedule transport. The FY 2024 Request supports modernizing and sustaining STA transportation assets, including life extension of the Safeguards Transporter until it is replaced by the Mobile Guardian Transporter; vehicle sustainm ent; replacement of armored tractors, escort, and support vehicles; upgrades of the Tractor Control Unit to accommodate for communications and security; and continued development and testing of the Mobile Guardian Transporter. The first Mobile Guardian Transporter production unit is planned for completion in FY 2028 and will Budget in Brief FY 2024 Congressional Justification 17 begin a phased in approach to replace the current Safeguard Transporter. Program Direction resources in this account support salaries and expenses for the secure transportation workforce, including Federal Agents. Defense Nuclear Security (DNS) DNS provides protection for NNSA personnel, facilities, nuclear weapons, and materials from a full spectrum of threats, ranging from minor security threats to acts of terrorism, at its national laboratories, production plants, processing facilities, and the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS). Employing more than 1,700 Protective Force officers, DNS secures more than 5,000 buildings and protects more than 57,000 personnel. The FY 2024 Request includes funding to fill positions in key security program areas required to implement a risk -based, lay ered protection strategy at the sites. The Request also supports increased security needs associated with known mission growth in weapons programs across the NSE, including Pit Production at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

As a mission partner, OCIO ensures and enables the availability of a secure infrastructure for mission activities and information sharing for the NNSA and its mission partners. The office manages the IT portfolio, federal IT investments, services, and projects in alignment with the NNSA and the Department of Energy Office of the Chief In formation Officer strategies, as well as other national policy drivers. The FY 2024 Request enables the development and execution of integrated IT initiatives that provide an effective and secure technology infrastructure across the enterprise. Budget in Brief FY 2024 Congressional Justification 18 DEFENSE NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION - NNSA Appropriation Overview The National Nuclear Security Administration's (NNSA) nonproliferation, counterproliferation, and counterterrorism activities are critical to implementing the President's National Security Strategy and demonstrating \"renewed arms control and nonproliferati on leadership.\" NNSA's programs help reduce the dangers posed by nuclear weapons, including by extending the U.S.' defenses against nuclear threats far beyond its borders. These programs help prevent adversaries from acquiring nuclear weapons or weapons -usable materials, technology, and expertise; countering efforts to acquire such weapons or materials; and responding to nuclear or radiological incidents and accidents domestically and abroad. NNSA shares knowledge, accrued through the U.S.' long experience in managing special nuclear materials, with partners around the world to achieve international nonproliferation and nuclear security goals. NNSA uses the unique technical and scientific knowledge that underpins the Stockpile Stewardship Program for a range of nonproliferation missions, from assessing foreign weapons programs and potential terrorist devices to managing the proliferation risks posed by civil nuclear applications. By limiting the number of nuclear- capable states and preventing terrorist access to materials and technology that can threaten the U.S. and allies, NNSA plays a critical role in enhancing global stability and constrains the range of potential threats facing the nation, our allies, and partners. Beginning in FY 2023, this appropriation also began supporting U.S. biodefense and biothreat mitigation strategies and programs through focused investments in the DOE/NNSA complex. This appropriation funds seven programs that, as part of a whole -of-government approach, provide policy and techni cal leadership to prevent or limit the spread of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) -related materials, technology, and expertise; develop technologies to detect nuclear proliferation and steward foundational nonproliferation capabilities; secure or eliminat e inventories of nuclear weapons -related materials and infrastructure; and sustain technically trained emergency management personnel to respond to nuclear and radiological incidents and accidents domestically and abroad. This appropriation also funds the national security R&D program to anticipate and detect threats and broaden DOE's role in national biodefense. DNN's mission is complementary to Defense Programs' Stockpile Stewardship Program at NNSA. Together, the programs form the basis of a strong nuclear defense. DNN's activities are carried out within a dynamic global security environment, as described in NNSA's annual report Prevent, Counter, and Respond -A Strategic Plan to Reduce Global Nuclear Threatsb. This environment is characterized by the persistent threat of state and non -state actors seeking to obtain nuclear and radioactive materials, state actors potentially undermining nonproliferation regimes and arms control agreements to which the U.S. is adherent, as well as instability cau sed by Russia's continued invasion of Ukraine. There is also an increased risk a FY 2022 Enacted amount excludes rescission of $282 million from project 99-D- 143, Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility, SRS. -and-respond 2024 Congressional Justification 19 of the availability of nuclear and radioactive materials as a result of the global expansion of commercial nuclear power and possible spread of fuel cycle technology, increased opportunities for illicit nuclear material trafficking and sophisticated procurement networks, and technology adva nces (including cyber -related tools) that may shorten nuclear weapon development timelines and complicate nuclear safeguards and security missions. Program Highlights Material Management and Minimization (M3) M3 programs reduce and, when possible, elimin ate weapons -usable nuclear material around the world to achieve permanent threat reduction. The FY 2024 Budget Request supports the conversion or shutdown of research reactors and isotope production facilities that use highly enriched uranium (HEU), the co ntinued support of non- HEU -based Molybdenum -99 (Mo -99) production facilities in the U.S., the recovery of limited amounts of high- assay low enriched uranium, the removal and disposal of weapons -usable nuclear material, the removal of plutonium from the sta te of South Carolina and implementation of the dilute and dispose strategy for plutonium disposition, and costs to downblend HEU. Global Material Security (GMS) GMS directly contributes to national security efforts to reduce global nuclear security threats. The FY 2024 Budget Request supports program efforts to prevent terrorists and other actors from obtaining nuclear and radioactive material to use in an improvised nuclear device (IND) or a radiological dispersal device (RDD) by working domestically and with partner countries to improve the security of vulnerable materials and facilities, and to build partners' sustainable capacity to detect, disrupt, and investi gate illicit trafficking of these materials through critical pathways. GMS works with countries in bilateral partnerships and with multilateral partners such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL). As part of an ongoing strategic analysis process, GMS continues to explore and integrate innovative approaches, technologies, and tools to adapt to emerging threats. GMS is supporting its partners in Ukraine in maintaining and, where possible, rebuilding their capabilities to secure nuclear and radioactive facilities and materials and detect smuggling of these materials within Ukraine. GMS supports national security priorities to reduce global nuclear security threats, and is a key com ponent of NNSA's integrated nonproliferation, counterterrorism, and emergency response strategies. Nonproliferation and Arms Control (NPAC) NPAC programs strengthen nonproliferation and arms control regimes through innovative policy development and implem entation to prevent proliferation, ensure peaceful nuclear uses, and enable verifiable nuclear reductions. To advance this mission, NPAC builds the capacity of the IAEA and partner countries to implement international safeguards obligations, builds domestic and international capacity to implement export control obligations, supports the negotiation and implementation of agreements and associated monitoring regimes to verifiably reduce nuclear weapons and nuclear program s, and develops approaches and strategies to address emerging nonproliferation and arms control challenges and opportunities. NPAC provides export control and safeguards training to Ukraine to promote safeguards implementation and strengthen its national e xport control systems to help prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear and WMD -related materials, commodities, and technology. Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Research and Development (DNN R&D) DNN R&D directly contributes to nuclear security as a key component for the innovation of U.S.' technical capabilities to detect nuclear detonations; foreign nuclear weapons programs' activities; and the presence, movement, or diversion of special nuclear materials. The program also sustains and develops foundati onal nonproliferation technical capabilities that ensure the technical agility needed to support a broad spectrum of U.S. nonproliferation missions and anticipate threats. Finally, the program funds capabilities at the National Laboratories that can suppor t time -critical decisions in the event of a nuclear or radiological incident and assist in determining the origin of interdicted materials or nuclear devices. DNN R&D uses the unique facilities and scientific skills of DOE, academia, and industry to perform research, conduct technology demonstrations, develop prototypes, and produce and deliver sensors for integration into operational systems. The FY 2024 Budget Request supports planned R&D activities for early detection of proliferation and supports produc tion of nuclear detonation detection satellite payloads. The FY 2024 Budget Request also supports efforts to sustain and develop foundational nonproliferation technical capabilities by providing targeted, long -term support for enabling infrastructure, science and technology, and an expert workforce. Budget in Brief FY 2024 Congressional Justification 20 NNSA Bioassurance Program The DOE/NNSA Bioassurance Program advances the U.S capability to anticipate, detect, assess, and mitigate emerging biothreats and strengthen biodefense. The program develops core capabilities at the U.S. national laboratories, such as high- performance computin g for accelerated threat assessment and rapid countermeasure design, surveillance and detection capabilities, safeguards and export controls, and forensics to support attribution. The FY 2024 Budget Request further develops the operating capability and coo rdinated DOE program in biosciences, including phased science plan implementation with exploratory research, facility upgrades, and minor equipment purchases. Nonproliferation Construction (supports Material Management and Minimization) Nonproliferation Construction consolidates construction costs for DNN projects. The FY 2024 Budget Request supports the implementation of the dilute and dispose strategy with the continuation of the Surplus Plutonium Disposition (SPD) project, which will add additional glovebox capacity at the Savannah River Site to accelerate plutonium dilution and aid in the removal of plutonium from the state of South Carolina. Nuclear Counterterrorism and Incident Response Program (NCTIR) The NCTIR program sustains the U.S.' nuclear counterterrorism and counterproliferation activities, maintains critical nuclear incident and accident response and technical reachback capabilities, and supports DOE's all-hazards emergency management system. The Counterterrorism and Counterproliferation (CTCP) subprogram provides the nation's technical capability to understand, attribute and defeat nuclear devices, including improvised nuclear devices and lost or stolen foreign nuclear weapons. This knowledge in turn informs U.S. Government policies, regulations, agencies, and key Department of Justice of Defense mission partners on terrorist and proliferant state nuclear threats and related contingency planning. In support of this mission, the FY 2024 Request for NCTIR supports programs to manage and deploy the DOE/NNSA Nuclear Emergency Support Team (NEST), comprised of expert scientific teams, facilities, and equipment to respond rapidly to nuclear or radiolog ical incidents and accidents worldwide; maintain a nuclear forensics capability to attribute the source of nuclear material outside of regulatory control or used in a nuclear attack; and to educate, through training and exercises, domestic and internationa l partners to respond effectively to nuclear or radiological incidents. CTCP also integrates DOE/NNSA policy, planning, and operations on counterproliferation priorities, supporting urgent needs and proactively pursuing opportunities to prevent nuclear thr eats and develop technologies to apply to the counterterrorism and counterproliferation mission. In addition, CTCP helps Ukraine build its nuclear emergency preparedness and response capabilities to enhance its ability to protect itself during disruptions caused by combat operations, including a radiological or nuclear release. Additionally, NCTIR operates the DOE/NNSA's Emergency Operations (EO) subprogram. The EO subprogram provides both the structure and processes to ensure a comprehensive and integrate d approach to all -hazards emergency management. Thus improving readiness and effectiveness of the DOE Emergency Management System and the Nuclear Security Enterprise (NSE) on a programmatic and performance level regardless of the nature of the emergency impacting the DOE/NNSA enterprise or its equities anywhere in the world. This promotes unity of effort and a culture of continuous improvement to safeguard the health and safety of workers and the public, protect the environment, and enhance the resilience of the Department and the Nation. The EO subprogram coordinates plans and procedures for prevention, protection, mitigation, response to, and recovery from, all hazards emergency accidents, incidents, events, and to support operational emergencies. In addition, the FY 2024 Budget Request supports Continuity of Operations, Continuity of Government, and Enduring Constitutional Government programs to advance the National Continuity Policy and ensure the continued performance and delivery of essential lines of business and services under any circumstances. The FY 2024 Budget Request also provides for 24/7/365 Consolidated Em ergency Operations Center communications and coordination support to the DOE/NNSA Emergency Management Enterprise, NSE, and Departmental Senior Leadership.

Program Highlights Carbon Ma nagement Technologies The Office of Carbon Management (OCM) supports R&D aimed at achieving a net-zero carbon economy by focusing on the entire carbon management value chain of capture, removal, conversion, transport, and geologic storage. OCM addresses emissions associated with the power and industrial sectors, as well as the accumulated emissions in the atmosphere, and seeks to permanently store CO 2 in geologic formations and/or convert CO 2 to reduce negative climate impacts. Descriptions of major funding and programmatic changes and highlights within the Carbon Management Technologies program for the FY 2024 Budget Request ar e as follows: Hydrogen with Carbon Management The Hydrogen with Carbon Management subprogram invests in R&D to evaluate carbon -based clean hydrogen (i.e., coupled to CCS) as a fuel and support development of technologies to use clean hydrogen from any source. The subprogram's efforts are an integral part of DOE's recently launched Hydrogen Shot, with a goal of reducing the cost of clean hydrogen to $1/kg within one decade (1-1- 1) while expanding employment of the U.S. energy workforce. Seeking a cost- competitive decarbonized alternative to unabated fossil fuels, the subprogram has an R&D portfolio consisting of a new generation of carbon neutral or net-negative greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions technologies. Gasification, reversible solid oxide fuel cells, technologies in H 2 turbines, and advanced materials, sensors and controls all support this goal. Budget in Brief FY 2024 Congressional Justification 37 The $85 million FY 2024 Budget Request for Hydrogen with Carbon Management will provide research, development, and a platform for developing the advanced systems of the future, while reducing emissions. In FY 2024, the subprogram will not fund R&D specific to traditional fossil power generation, but rather, will narrow the focus to work on hydrogen -fueled turbines, fuel cells, CCS-relevant technologies, and production of clean hydrogen through gasification. Improvements to these technologies are also applicable to other energy systems. These improveme nts to new and existing plants will also make them less carbon intensive and allow these assets to provide continued low-cost baseload power and resilient flexible grid services. This subprogram aligns with the Administration's priority to reduce the environmental impact of the power sector, especially regarding disadvantaged communities. Carbon Transport and Storage The Carbon Transport and Storage (CTS) subprogram is uniquely positioned to support the U.S. as it helps the carbon transport and storage industry achieve the scale necessary to decarbonize the economy while considering associated economic, environmental, and social benefits and impacts. This subprogram is making key investments in advanced technolog y R&D and large -scale transport scenario analysis will facilitate the deployment of commercial -scale storage facilities and regional transport and storage hubs that achieve economies of scale reducing costs and enabling deeper emissions reductions. Critical components that will help cataly ze deployment at-scale include, but are not limited to, strategies to develop the infrastructure for carbon storage, R&D to improve technology performance and reduce costs, educational partnerships to grow the workforce, technology transfer, and technical assistance to stakeholders. The FY 2024 Budget Request provides $110 million for the Carbon Transport and Storage subprogram activities that address the performance challenges of operating and monitoring commercial scale CO 2 storage sites. The activities supported by the Carbon Transport and Storage subprogram will aim to improve storage and operational efficiency, improve understanding of overall costs and advance de-risking strategies to reduce those costs. Achieving each of these elements through site characterization and developing advanced monitoring and modeling tools is critical for enabling a carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCS) in dustry that is safe, economically viable, and environmentally benign. Carbon D ioxide Removal and Carbon Dioxide Conversion The CDR subprogram advances a diverse set of technology pathways in service of facilitating gigatonne -scale removal by mid- century. It emphasizes rigorous analysis of life cycle impacts and consideration of project design to ensure clear benefits to affected communities. The subprogram R&D of CDR technologies, such as direct air capture and direct ocean capture with permanent storage; biomass with carbon removal and storage; and mineralization to remove accumulated emissions from the atmosphere to counterbalance emissions from hard -to-abate sectors to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by mid-century. The Carbon Dioxide Conversion (CDC) subprogram invests in R&D to advance technologies that recycle CO 2 into value -added products, such as building materials, fuels, and chemicals, through mineralization, catalytic conversion, and biological approaches. Through these investments, the CDC subprogram can help the U.S. achieve the goals of a net-zero carbon economy by 2050, while simultaneously developing technologies that help traditional industries build new business models for the future, while creat ing high- wage jobs and reducing GHG and other emissions in communities dependent on and impacted by energy and industrial production. In FY 2024, the Budget Request provides $70 million for CDR and $50 million in the CDC subprograms. CDR funding will support continued activities to advance novel direct air capture and direct ocean capture materials and processes to help optimize and reduce the cost, front- end engineering and design (FEED) studies for biomass with carbon removal and storage, and novel approaches that can leverage industrial waste minerals and naturally occurring minerals to capture atmospheric CO 2. Carbon conversion technologies have the potential to develop additional markets for carbon -b ased products. Areas of research include, but are not limited to, new projects focused on the catalytic conversion of carbon waste streams to higher value products such as fuels, chemicals, polymers, and nutraceuticals; mineralization to building products; generation of solid carbon products; and algal systems designed to integrate captured CO 2. Specific focus on catalysts made from low -cost materials and improved reactor designs will be pursued to lower the energy penalty and capital cost of the conversion process. Point -Source Carbon Capture The Point -Source Carbon Capture R&D subprogram focuses on committed emissions associated with infrastructure that are expected to persist through mid-century. Natural gas power generation and CO 2-emitting industrial sectors, such as cement, steel, pulp and paper, and hydrogen production are particular priorities. The FY 2024 Budget Request provides $144 million in the Point - Source Carbon Capture subprogram for pre- and post -combustion capture R&D on transformational gas separation technologies that can help achieve decarbonization goals. This includes technologies such as non-aqueous solvents, sorbents, membranes, and Budget in Brief FY 2024 Congressional Justification 38 cryogenic processes. R&D activities will investigate approaches that can be flexible in operation and result in higher rates of CO 2 capture. Additionally, the Point- Source Carbon Capture subprogram will leverage its extensive experience on carbon capture technology development for power sector applications to increase focus on hard to decarbonize industrial applications, specifically, cement, steel, pulp and paper, and hydrogen production. in FY 2024, R&D will focus on optimization of technologies for these applications to reduce cost and improve performance. Funding will also maintain progress on R&D to decarbonize power generation. Carbon Management - Policy, Analysis, and Engagement The Office of Carbon Management conducts systems, economic, and environmental analysis that is primarily focused on: cost and performance for carbon management technologies; the role of carbon management in energy markets; life cycle analysis; energy markets assessments; integration of carbon management technologies with the U.S. Power Grid; and effects of carbon management deployment in local communities. A variety of analysis methodologies are used in combination to provide a robust understanding of the cost, performance, and barriers to the deployment of carbon management technologies. Through a system of coordinated efforts and thoughtful engagement with stakeholders, realistic carbon management deployment scenarios can be crafted using market and technology - based information. This subprogram also supports social science and socioeconomic research to understand impacts of carbon management on communities and interagency engagement with key federal partners. Activities will aid in proactive, place -based community engagement and planning that include consideration of CCS and CDR development, in the context of broader energy options, to both ensure that carbon management projects work for communities and to increase siting certainty for future development. The FY 2024 Budget Request for Policy, Analysis, and Engagement is $5 million. Resource Sustainability The Resource Sustainability Office addresses critical issues associated with reducing the environmental impacts of fossil energy production and use. This includes conducting R&D that reduces the environmental impact from the extraction, development, transportation, dis tribution, and storage of fossil fuel and reducing emissions throughout the supply chain. Descriptions of major programmatic changes and highlights within the Resource Sustainability program for the FY 2024 Budget Request, which totals $179 million, are as follows: Advanced Remediation Technologies The Advanced Remediation Technologies program will conduct R&D of novel technologies and approaches to address wellbore integrity, induced seismicity, produced water treatment, and offshore safety and spill prevention. A redesigned field program will focus on conducting research to minimize the environmental impacts associated with unconventional oil and gas production, and exploration of pathways that would result in a positive impact on climate, such as coupling production with CO 2 storage. Methane Mitigation Technologies The Methane Mitigation Technologies program will conduct R&D to advance methane sensor technologies to detect and quantify methane emissions from production fields, pipe lines, infrastructure equipment, storage facilities, and abandoned wells; pipeline materials, pipeline sensors, and pipeline data management and computational tools; and advanced modular natural gas conversion technologies for the purpose of beneficially utilizing otherwise flared or stranded natural gas. The program will collect, analyze, and distribute methane emissions data, information, and knowledge to inform efforts on methane mitigation technology development and support the Environment al Protection Agency's (EPA) Greenhouse Gas Inventory. The program will expand field research on methane measurement technologies and analysis methods for quantifying emissions at basin -level assessments. The program will implement a strategy to reconcile methane emissions estimates from surface -based measurements (bottom -up) and atmospheric measurements (top-down) that will minimize and resolve the difference between these two segments on a large -scale. Natural Gas Decarbonization and Hydrogen Technologies The Natural Gas Decarbonization and Hydrogen Technologies (NGDHT) subprogram will support R&D to advance clean hydrogen production and infrastructure for natural gas decarbonization; hydrogen production from produced water; technologies for enab ling safe and efficient transportation within the U.S. natural gas pipeline system; and fundamental research to enable subsurface hydrogen storage. Programmatic activities will be conducted in support and coordination with the Hydrogen and Carb on Management Division within FECM and with the Hydrogen and the Fuel Cell Technologies Office (HFTO) within the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). Budget in Brief FY 2024 Congressional Justification 39 Mineral Sustainability The Mineral Sustainability Program will advance technologies t o support domesti c supply chai n networks require d for t he economically, environmentally, a nd geopolitically sustainable pr oduction and processing of critical minerals (CM). T his mission will be accomplished by prioritizi ng the us e of unconventional resources s uch as co al waste a nd by- products from industry feedstocks for domestic CM, rare earth elements and carbon ore to products production. The program will also focus on utilizing m aterial s to b e recovered f rom c urrently m ined an d previously mined resources outside o f traditiona l thermal and metallurgical markets that can support high -wage employment and value -added production in communities and regions dependent on traditional mining. Resource Sustainability - Analysis and Engagement Analysis and Engagement will focus on analysis and studies that support the environmentally prudent production, transport storage, and use of domestic fossil fuels with an understandi ng of their role as a strategic asset for the U.S. and its allies for global energy security and provides evidence -based, portfolio-wide analysis for decision -makers.

The program will inform research priorities, engagement with domestic and international governments and organizations, and provide market and industry analysis to inf orm t he Department on fossil energy r esources. Other FECM Program Activities Energy A sset Transformation The Energy Asset Tran sformation program will help leverage and transform d ecommissioned and re tiring energy as sets, including coal power plants, coal mines, an d abandoned oil a nd gas wells, b y repurposing them for clea n energy an d manufacturing. T his is on e of the best w ays to unite i ndustry, e nvironmental and community i nterests i n places w here employment a nd opportunity i s on the decline. Many existing energy assets offer private sector actors a skilled workforce with knowledge of industrial operations; c ommunity relationships; acces s to rail lines, ports, and wat erways; h ighway transportation, transmission and distribution infrastructure; electrical interconnect equipment and direct grid connections; industrial land, facilities; and potentially even site and permitting licenses among, other benefits. As innovativ e clean energy and manufacturing companies fan out across the country, it increasingly makes sense for them to choose to locate in energy communities to leverage existing infrastructure. In some instances, repurposing can ensure th at historic energy communities have a path forward and can benefit from both short -term and permanent employment, opportunities for worker retraining programs, access to local wor k that does not require relocation, and opportunities to wor k in cutting -edge t echnology sectors. Importantly, repurposing al lows communities to become active participan ts in crafting their own economic f uture. The FY 2024 Budge t Reques t of $6 million will support fossil asset transformation efforts across the U.S., through both direct assistance a nd paper case st udies. It will also c ontinue to support place -based interagency ef forts r elated t o energy transition and fossil asset t ransformation, i ncluding b y contributi ng to DOE's f undin g of the Rapi d Response T eams associate d with the Interagenc y Working Grou p on Coal and Power Plant Communities. The pr ogram will f und conce pt development through prizes or a competitive solicitation to repurpose the existing fossil asset, with the inten t of supporting transformation efforts in seeking additional support for FEED studies and other work.

RDS pursues strategic investments in innovative technologies and practices that improve reliability, increase resilience, support vehicle electrification, integrate clean distributed energy resources, and provide consumers with more choices for managing their energy consumption. Cyber Resilient and Secure Utility Communications Networks (SecureNet) develops solutions to strengthen the securi ty and resilience of the electricity delivery system against cyber- related threats through a security -by-design approach for operational data, communications networks, and control systems. Our Nation's energy system is heavily dependent on data communicati ons and cyber -physical controls for operational reliability and resilience. More integration of distributed assets on the grid increases this dependency and presents a broader attack surface forincreasingly sophisticated adversaries to exploit. The progra m's R&D efforts to design security into the future grid is essential to extend the Department's focus beyond today's challenges and ensure the efficient, reliable, and resilient operation of the electric power system in tomorrow's even more complex and dynamic risk landscape. Energy Storage accelerates bi- directional electrical energy storage technologies as a key component of a reliable, resilient, and affordable future -ready grid. OE Storage research, development, demonstration, and deployment efforts accelerate the development of long duration grid storage technologies through increasing amounts of stored energ y a nd operational durations, reducing technology costs, de -risking technologies to ensure safe long -term reliability, developing analytic models to uncover technical and economic benefits, and demonstrating how storage can provid e cl ean and equitable energy access for consumers and communities. Transformer Resilience and Advanced Components (TRAC) develops innovations to carry, control, convert, and condition electricity, equipping the future -ready grid to achieve decarbonization goals while enhancing its reliability and r esilience. The TRAC scope encompasses materials research, exploratory concepts, and modeling and analysis to address the range of challenges associated with transformers and other grid components. Program activities, developed in close coordination wi th industry, aim to fill fundamental R&D gaps and encourage the adoption of new technologie s a nd approaches. A pplied Grid Transformation Solutions (AGTS) addresses the pressing need for rapidly assessing new grid systems and subsystems (including energy storage, transmission, distribution, and power control and conversion hardware an d as sociated software) by testing integrated technology suites in pilot environments prior to the hardware and software being deployed by indu stry in operational environments. These assessments provide utilities with the information they need to quantify and validate functionality, performance, and economic benefits before deploying new technologies.The results of pilot demonstrations will validate the techno -socio -economic performance of the systems and accelerate the adoption of new technology by the industry. Electricity Innovation and Transition (EIT) is a new program in FY 2024 consolidating all OE funding for Small Busines s I nnovation Research, Technology Commercialization Fund, and workforce development activities.

CESER is the designated head Office for DOE's responsibilities as lead agency for Emergen cy Support Function #12 (Energy), or ESF #12, under the National Response Framework. CESER is also the Sector Risk Management Agency (SRMA) for national efforts to enhance preparedness, resiliency, and recovery of the U.S. energy infrastructure. The U.S. energy sector powers and fuels the economy, national security, and the daily lives of Americans. With critical energy infrastructure facing evolving threats and hazards, especially from significant climate -related incidents and rapidly evolving cyber threats, CESER divisions and programs coordinate with electricity and oil and natural gas infrastructure owners and operators; State, Local, Tribal, and Territory (SLTT) governments; and federal agencies to understand and mitigat e risk, develop guidance and tools to mitigate risk and enhance resilience and security, and respond when incidents do occur. CESER leads, coordinates, and provides technical expertise across DOE in implementing its cybersecurity -by-design strategy, in which cybersecurity considerations are incorporated into new clean energy technologies as they are developed by the applied energy offices. Progr am Highlights Preparedness, Policy, and Risk Analysis (PPRA) replaces Information Sharing Partnerships and Exercises and leads identification, analysis, and prioritization of risks to the energy sector from all hazards. PPRA accomplishes this objective by leading CESER's efforts across the risk management framework cycle fro m issue identification, assessment, and mitigation. PPRA also leads CESER's and the Department's security -focused engagement with energy critical infrastructure stakeholders, both in government and the private sector, with the goal of enhancing operational collaboration to reduce and mitigate risks to the sector, including developing policy, exercises, training, and workforce development solutions. This includes overseeing the Energy Government Coordinating Council, whose members include federal agencies and SLTT partners with energy sector security and resilience equities. PPRA will expand, aggregate, and deliver intelligence -informed and actionable data and analysis to SLTT energy and emergency officials and industry via dynamic risk analysis and launch regional ESF #12 training workshops and tabletop exercises for States to enhance preparedness and collaboration, as well as working directly with States to expand their cyber incident response planning. PPRA focuses on developing a shared understanding and prioritization of risks to the sector from all hazards (cyber, physical, and natural) and identifies potential mitigation measures that can be utilized by owners / operators to reduce risk to their assets or systems. PPRA leverages long -term recovery authorities to integrate response and recovery in coordination with CESER's Response and Restoration division and ot her DOE offices as well as support / investment from other agencies (e.g., the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities). PPRA's Defense Critical Electric Infrastructure efforts, as codified in 16 USC 824o-1, will develop executable strategies to strengthen the energy systems that supply critical defense facilities. In addition, on -going training and exercises with the sector participants are developed to test and identify improvements response plans and procedures and identify mitigation gaps that build into requirements for p olicy and tool solutions. As an example, CyberForce Competition will expand its work with universities, colleges, and technical schools across the country to advance cybersecurity in the operational technology and industrial controls systems environment an d train the next generation of energy security cybersecurity experts. Budget in Brief FY 2024 Congressional Justification 49 Risk Management Tools and Technologies (RMT) programs focus on research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) of tools and technologies to address all threats and risks in the U.S. energy sector. RMT develops tools, technologies, and techniques that enable prevention, detection, and real -time sector-wide situational awareness combined with time - sensitive analysis, visualization, and dissemination of actionable threat and vulnerability information in support of key DOE, Federal Government, and energy sector stakeholders. Working closely with the energy sector and our government partners, the Request focuses on enhancing the speed and effectiveness of threat and vulnerability information sharing, including bi- directional machine -to-machine information sharing, and accelerating game -changing tools to mitigate cyber incidents in today's systems and to develop next -generation resilient energy delivery systems while developing analyses to quantify the resulting relative risk reduction. In particular, RMT will lead supply chain security efforts as part of the Energy Cyber Sense program. The program will include expanding initiatives such as the Cyber Testing of Resilient Industrial Control Systems (CyTRICS) program and supply chain security in next generation clean energy systems. RMT will also include RD&D for innovative tools and their transition to commercialization. The programs will lead integration of cybers ecurity into the energy delivery system research, development, demonstrations, and deployment across the DOE enterprise ensuring that emerging tools and technologies used in the U.S. grid of the future are secure and resilient. The Request supports continu ing our efforts in support of tools and capabilities designed specifically to address threats such as extreme weather, physical threats, and electromagnetic pulse (EMP) and geomagnetic disturbance (GMD) ( EMP/GMD) investments. RMT will be focused on address ing wildfire threats through innovative sensor technologies, leveraging unmanned aerial systems, and satellite imagery, in addition to artificial intelligence and machine analytics. Finally, RMT will partner with other parts of DOE to ensure that investments in new technologies are informed by existing and future risks. Res ponse and Restoration (R&R) coordinates a national effort to secure U.S. energy infrastructure against all hazards, reduce impacts from disruptive events, and assist the industry in restoring energy infrastructure. During incidents requiring a coordinated federal response, the R&R program activates the Energy Response Organization to deploy responders and engage with relevant sector and SLTT entities. CESER trains and leads coordination activities among a cadre of volunteer ESF #12 responders across DOE. Catastrophic and incidents in remote locations are managed by the ESF #12 Catastrophic Incident Response Team, a subset of ESF #12 responders. The ESF #12 cadre delivers critical capabilities including energy sector emergency response and recovery; near -real- time situational awareness and information sharing about the status of the energy systems to improve risk management; analysis of evolving threats and haz ards to energy infrastructure; and technical assistance that incorporates exercises in order to strengthen federal, regional, state, local, Tribal, and Territor ial abilities to work together to mitigate the effects of an energy sector emergency. As part of this effort, CESER will continue to develop its Environment for Analysis of Geo -Located Energy Information ( EAGLE -I) situational awareness platform and maintain continuous monitoring of the energy sector. CESER's R&R team will also strengthen its cyber response capabilities to ensure DOE is fully prepared to respond to the growing risks from cyber threats to energy infrastructure from nation - states and cyber -criminal groups, including cyber -attacks that lead to physical or oper ational impacts to energy supply. CESER wil l also work with DOE's Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative, and other agencies to conduct the Energy Threat Anal ysis Center (ETAC) Pilot concept.

Budget in Brief FY 2024 Congressional Justification 63 STATE AND COMMUNITY ENERGY PROGRAMS Appropriation Overview The Office of State and Community Energy Programs (SCEP) within the Office of the Under Secretary for Infrastructure, as authorized by the Department of Energy Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.), i mplements efforts under the Weatherization Assistance Program, State Energy Program, Community Energy Programs (which includes the Local Government Energy Program), and Energy Future Grants. These programs work to i ncrease energy affordability and support states and local communities seeking to update and modernize their energy systems and create economic opportunities in the energy transition, by working with community-level implementation partners and state agencies. SCEP works with state and local organizations to significantly accelerate the deployment of clean energy technologies, catalyze local economic development and create jobs, reduce energy costs, and avoid pollution through place-based s trategies involving a wide range of government, community, business and other stakeholders. SCEP manages activities supporting state and community energy infrastructure, programs, and policies by providing di rect funding as well as technical assistance. SCEP serves as the primary gateway into DOE for states, tribes, and communities interested in greater energy affordability, energy-r elated economic opportunity, security, and resilience, and connects them to programs, funding, and technical assistance opportunities across the DOE. The FY 2024 Request complements the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and Inflation Reducti on Act of 2022 (IRA) investment and provides SCEP with key additional resources and programmatic direction to address high energy prices, reduce costs for families and businesses, and cut pollution through energy efficiency and other clean energy measures. Program Highlights The Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) supports the largest network of residential energy retrofit providers in the country, providing a foundation for the coordination and implementation of home weatherization services funded by other Federal and non- Federal sources. Funds are allocated on a statutory formula basis and awarded to a single agency in each State and Territory that manages the deployment of a FY 2024 Weatherization Assistance Program total includes funding for Weatherization Readiness ($51.8M), Training and Technical Assistance ($10M), and Weatherization Assistance ($375M). b FY 2024 Communities Energy Programs total includes funding for Local Government Energy Program ($65M), Energy Burden Reduction Pilot ($50M ), and Energy Communities IWG ($5M). c Program Direction funds amount is not available because, prior to SCEP, PD funds were distributed to EERE. Congressional Justification 64 services to increase the energy efficiency of homes occupied by low- income households. These agencies, in turn, contract with approximately 700 local service provider organizations to deliver weatherization services to low - income families in every geographic area of the country. WAP is one of the federal government's best tools to reduce energy costs for the American people. The FY 2024 Budget enables DOE to reach at least 46,000 more of the 33 million eligible low- income households that face high energy costs, most of which will not receive assistance even with the continued imp lementation of $3.5 billion in IIJA funding. The State Energy Program (SEP) supports states in updating and modernizi ng energy systems by providing funding for planning, development and implementation of energy policies, plans, and programs to reduce energy costs, enhance economic competitiveness, improve security planning, and improve the environment. SEP provides states with capacity building resources, technical assistance, best-p ractice sharing networks and other assistance to facilitate the implementation of their plans, policies, and programs. Community Energy Programs (CEP) partner with local governments and community organizations to support their priorities for upgrading and modernizing energy systems, taking advantage of economi c opportunities in the energy transition, and addressing energy challenges. CEP includes the Local Government Energy Program, the new Energy Burden Reduction Pilot initiative, and the Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and Economic Revi talization (Energy Communities IWG)a. The Local Government Energy Program provides targeted competitive awards, on-s ite capacity, peer exchanges, and technical assistance to support the development and deployment of transformative clean energy deployment programs of qualifying local governments, with a focus on disadvantaged communities. The Energy Burden Reduction Pilot program is a competitive grant program to pilot approaches to reduce energy costs for at least 3,000 low-i ncome households to less than 5 percent of income while reducing carbon emissions through efficiency retrofits, electrification, and distributed energy resource installation. CEP will work with local entities such as community action agencies, non-profits, state and local governments, and utility partners to leverage the Federal investment for the greatest impact. The Energy Communities IWG is an ongoing interagency effort, led by the National Climate Advisor, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Senior Advisor for Clean Energy Innovation and Implementation and administered by DOE, that works with communities where a high proportion of income and economic activity comes from energy industries affected by the energy transition, particularly those affected by coal and power plant cl osures. The Energy Communities IWG supports economic development efforts, capacity building activities, and the coordination of interagency efforts to deliver Federal resources to support these communities in their transition to more sustainable, resilient, and equitable economies. Energy Future Grants support technical assistance to hel p states and communities address challenges or embrace opportunities in partnership with private sector partners that are difficult to address by individual states or local governments. This program offers technical assistance implementation models to connect states, communities, and their non-government or private-sector partners with world-c lass energy expertise, helping them develop new approaches, establish best practices, or pursue other strategies to address regional challenges and opportunities. Many states and communities la ck resources to evaluate and design approaches to address their unique energy sector challenges. The Energy Future Grants hel p address this gap. Program Direction enables SCEP to maintain and support a world-c lass Federal workforce that ensures programs are adequately staffed to support states and communities to ensure that the clean energy economy benefits the diverse range of American communities. The FY 2024 Budget provides resources for program and project management, oversight activities, contract administration, workforce management, IT support, stakeholder engagement capacity building resources and support, and Headquarters and field site non-laboratory facilities and infrastructure. a Previously funded through the Fossil Energy and Carbon Management account.

EA activities complement, although do not replace, the responsibility of DOE line management for compliance with security and safety requirements to manage the Department's programs effectively. EA reports directly to the Office of the Secretary and is independent of the DOE programs that develop and implement security and saf ety policy and programs and therefore is more able to provide objective and timely information to DOE senior leadership, contractor organizations, and other entities on the methods to appropriately protect national security material and information assets; and whether Departmental operations provide for the safety of its employees and the public. EA activities evaluate the Department's effectiveness in promoting protection strategies that are based on informed risk management decisions. EA is designated to implement statutorily authorized contractor enforcement programs pertaining to classified information security, nuclear safety, and worker safety and health. EA also operates the DOE National Training Center (NTC) in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to enhance the proficiency and competency of the Department's security and safety personnel, and to support DOE workforce development through other programs including safety culture improvement and the Department's Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility (DEIA) Strategic Plan. E A has initiated a program to support Executive Order 14035: Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility in the Federal Work force to create a respectful, inclusive, and safe workplace where employees can thrive, develop their potential, and contribute to the success of their organization that will increase productivity and morale and may reduce employee turnover.

Residual hazards remain at these sites after cleanup is completed due to technical limitations of remedial work. As a result, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) maintains a post -closure obligation to reduce legacy pollution and protect human health and the environment after cleanup is completed. LM fulfills DOE's post -closure obligation by providing long- term stewardship (LTS) of sites that have no continuing mission. In just over five years, LM anticipates adding over 20 new sites to its LTS portfolio. The LM Request provides funding for its core LTS activities including Long -Term Surveillance and Maintenance (LTS&M) at its current sites. Funding also supports determination of the condition, and risk posed by physical, radiological, and chemical hazards at abandoned Defense -Related Uranium Mine (DRUM) sites. Funding further enables the Archiving and Information Management program, assures post-retirement benefits to former contractor workers, and executes the Department's Mineral Leasing Program. Other functions include asset management, furthering the goals of Environmental Justice (EJ) as well as providing education, communication, history and outreach to many affected States, Tribes, and local communities. P rogram Highlights Th e Request supports LM's mission capabilities and its core LTS activities mentioned above. Approximately $72,406,000 will support LTS&M activities, transition activities for over 20 new sites over five years, and the acceleration of ma jor maintenance and repair projects at sites and field offices with natural and climate -change induced degradation. This will also support inventorying, risk screening, and safeguarding of DRUM sites on public, Tribal, and private lands. Lastly, it support s appropriate implementation of mitigating actions at LM sites to enhance climate resilience. I n addition, $11,984,000 will allow LM to strengthen its foundational Environmental Justice program activities, enabling the program to reach a larger number of affected communities. This funding also supports Executive Order 13985, \"Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government,\" and Executive Order 14008, \"Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad.\" Funding will allow for increasing current EJ activities executed by current partners and establishing new EJ activities to be executed by Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) on or near LM sites. Equity and climate resilience are assessed and appropriately implemented for all LM's activities. The remaining $111,912,000 supports legacy benefits for former contractor workers; appropriate implementation of mitigating actions at LM sites to enhance climate resilience; deployment and implementation of enhancements to address the increased number and complexity of Known Exploite d Vulnerabilities; execution of beneficial land reuse activities at DOE properties to revitalize land and assets; extensive community interaction and outreach to support the LTS mission; and the proposed FY 2024 cost -of-living pay increase for civilian emp loyees.

OHA's jurisdiction includes conducting evidentiary hearings to determine an employee's eligibility for a security clearance, deciding Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act appeals, investigating, and conducting hearings on certain contractor whistleblower complaints, and ruling on requests for relief from DOE regulations and orders, such as regulatory relief from the appliance energy efficiency standards. OHA also offers alte rnative dispute resolution services such as mediation for a variety of matters. P rogram Highlights O ver the last ten years, OHA has reduced its case -processing time in all areas of jurisdiction without compromising the high quality of decisions. The Request supports salaries and benefits for 24 FTEs operating in OHA's Personnel Security and Appeals Division, Employee Protection and Exceptions Division, and the Alternative Dispute Resolution Office. Budget in Brief FY 2024 Congressional Justification OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL ($K) Enacted 2024 vs. FY 2023 Enacted $ % Office of Inspector General Office of Inspector General 78,000 86,000 165,161 +79,161 +92.0% Total, Office of Inspector General Appropriation Overview 78,000 86,000 165,161 +79,161 +92.0% Th e Office of the Inspector General (OIG) reviews the integrity, economy, and efficiency of Department of Energy (DOE) programs and operations, including the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The OIG has the authority to inquire into all DOE programs and actions as well as related activities. Audits, inspections, investigations, and other reviews are used to detect and prevent fraud, waste, abuse, and violations of the law. Th e Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 directs the OIG to conduct an annual evaluation of DOE's information security systems. In addition, the OIG is also required to conduct an evaluation of DOE's implementation of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 every two years. The OIG is also charged with reviewing the Department's efforts to eliminate improper payments, in conformance with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019. The OIG routinely conducts reviews of the most significant management challenges facing the Department, to include its Environmental Management program. In addition, the OIG addresses alleged violations of law that impact Department programs, operations, facilities, and personnel. Th e DOE OIG has been historically underfunded. The FY 2024 OIG Request, if granted, would be a significant step in correcting the shortfall, leaving only a $16.8 million shortfall for FY 2024. Com pounding the historic budget shortfall, the DOE OIG was subsequently underfunded in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (CHIPS), and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The DOE OIG underfunding is depicted below: BILLS DOE OIG Percent OIG billion includes $62.5 billion plus 3.2% of $46.6 billion in loan and loan guarantee authorized in IIJA. This 3.2% must be re- visited in the second installment of funding needed for the OIG. 2 The DOE amount of $44 billion includes $35 billion plus 3.2% of $290 billion in loan and loan guarantee authorized in IRA. This 3.2% must be re- visited in the second installment of funding needed for the OIG. As a result, the taxpayer funds recently authorized and/or appropriated by Congress for the U.S. Department of Energy under the IIJA, CHIPS, and IRA are at substantial risk of fraud, waste, and abuse. U nder IIJA, CHIPS, and IRA, Congress authorized and/or appropriated $127.5 billion to DOE and increased DOE's direct loan and loan guarantee authority to $350 billion. However, IIJA, CHIPS, and IRA only appropriated a small amount of the money to the OIG to oversee these funds. DOE has already begun rolling out some of these enhanced programs, and it will continue to receive funding to do so over the next five years. The OIG will need additional funds to perform risk assessments, evaluations, data analytics, audits, inspections, and investigations to conduct appropriate oversi ght of these historic expenditures. 80 Budget in Brief FY 2024 Congressional Justification 81 The Administration has proposed $150 million in additional funding for under -resourced OIGs and has identified the DOE OIG as one of the under -resourced OIGs. The Administration has not yet announced the amount of this funding that might be allocated to the DOE OIG. Over the next few years, the OIG will be requesting additional appropriations to offset the lack of funding provided to the OIG in the IIJA, CHIPS, and IRA Acts. P rogram Highlights Th e OIG will utilize these resources to help detect and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse and to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the Department's programs and operations. The OIG's focus will include: Incurred Cost Audits of Management and Operating (M&O) Contracts. The OIG will continue conducting, independent incurred cost audits of the Department's M&O Contracts, valued at $19 billion per year as of FY 2022. Additionally, the CHIPS Act authorized $50 billion for the Office of Science, for which the OIG will be responsible for conducting independent incurred cost audits of the funds that are distributed to the National Laboratories. A udits. The OIG performs audits on Departmental programs and operations, focused on providing reliable and credib le fi nancial and performance information. The scope of this work is determined through a risk-based approach focused on areas of greatest risk to the Department. Significant increases in the Department's funding correlate to a direc t in crease in the risk of fraud, waste, a nd abuse. Audits provide substantial deterrence and detection capabilities over taxpayer funds and give Departmental management and Congress a well -informed perspective. Data Analytics. The OIG will continue to expand its utilization of data analytics. For example, the newly established programs under IIJA, CHIPS and IRA present an exciting \"ground floor\" opportunity to collect quality data to allow us to identify trends and provide indications of fraud, waste, and abuse related to these expenditures. C ybersecurity Oversight Efforts. The OIG is responsible for the audit and evaluation of the Department's unclassified systems. The Department has experien ced substantial problems with cybersecurity. As the Department's expenditures increase under IIJA, CHIPS and IRA, it will become increasingly important to secure these systems from vulnerabilitie s th at could result in the loss of billions of dollars' worth of innovative or sensitive technologies developed using taxpayer dollars. Inspections, Intelligence/Counterintelligence Oversight, and Special Projects. The OIG's inspection teams will continue focusing on intelligence and counterintelligence oversight and will continue conducting timely and objective inspections of t he programs and performance of the Department. The OIG's inspection teams are currently preparing to conduct the first round o f inspections in order to begin evaluating the Department's internal controls developed to protect the expenditures under IIJA, CHIPs Act and IRA. Additionally, these teams will continue to address allegations received through the OIG's Hotline, and whistleblower complaints, which have increased dramatically in recent years. I nvestigations. In recent years, the OIG has experienced a 36 percent increase in the number of criminal investigations and a s ubstantial increase in the dollar value of contractor fraud cases, resulting in additional work by the Office of Investigations. The increased level of information sharing and collaboration within the Department and among other federal agencies, the OIGs increased use of data analytics, and the OIGs performance of incurred cost audits have further increased Investigations workload. Additionally, the OIG will continue to utilize Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys to support the DOJ's prosecution of c riminal matters and work with the Department's suspension and debarment officials with respect to administrative remedies. M andatory Disclosure Rule. The Mandatory Disclosure Rule (MDR) is a significant element of the contract integrity framework. The MDR mandates that the contractors establish an employee concerns program and disclose potential fraud to t he OIG. OIG inspections revealed significant deficiencies in MDR reporting. Therefore, the OIG is developing a comprehensive and modernized approach to MDR reporting. The new reporting format will allow for more complete and expedited reporting, which will increase the volume of OIG investigations, inspections, and audits. Facilities/Technology. The OIG will continue its efforts to open offices in strategic locations and acquire a sensitive compartmented information facility. Additionally, the OIG will be addressing IT solutions to the problem of the OIG operati ng on a m ultitude of networks, which results in delays, missed communications, and a loss of productivity in the performance of d aily OIG operations.Budget in Brief FY 2024 Congressional Justification 82 NNSA Modernization Efforts. NNSA has undertaken a modernization effort that involves major projects such as the weapons complex transformation.

FERC also reviews proposals to build interstate natural gas pipelines, natural gas storage projects, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, and FERC licenses non- Federal hydropower projects. The Commission assists consumers in obtaining reliable, safe, secure, and economically efficient energy services at a reasonable cost through appropriate regulatory and market means, and collaborative efforts. Congress assigned these responsibilities to FERC in various laws including the Federal Power Act, the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act, the Natural Gas Act, the Natural Gas Policy Act, and the Interstate Commerce Act. More recently, as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Congress gave FERC additional responsibilities to protect the reliability and cybersecurity of the Bulk -Power System through the establishment and enforcement of mandatory reliability standards, as well as additional authority to enforce FERC regulatory requirements through the imposition of civil penalties and other means. Regulated entities pay fees and charges sufficient to recover the Commission's full cost of operations. The FY 2024 Request for the Commission is $520 million and 1,566 full-time equivalents (FTEs). The Commission's Request supports an increase of 58 FTEs. The FTE request will center on enhancing FERC's mission by focusing on strategic opportunities to augment capacity and build new capabilities across all Commission program offices. The additional resources will allow the Commission's program offices to undertake forward -looking strategic studies and expand external engagement efforts with a wide range of stakeholders. In addition, targeted FTE investments will enhance the Commission's advisory services, strengthen organizational capabilities, streamline processes, and minimize inefficiencies to address the Commission's evolving mission requirements. The FTE increase will also continue to directly staff the Office of Public Participation established in FY 2021. The Re quest also supports continued funding for program contracts associated with hydropower and natural gas infrastructure, including environmental reviews, public participation and outreach, stakeholder engagement, construction oversight, and expert witness contractor assistance. Pro gram Highlights Ensure Just and Reasonable Rates, Terms, and Conditions The nation's security and economic prosperity depend on maintaining economically efficient, safe, reliable, and secure energy services at a reasonable cost for consumers. FERC's regulations and orders ensure just and reasonable rates, terms, and conditions for jurisdictional services. a FY2022 and FY2023 amounts are estimated and are not included in their respective enacted appropriations Budget in Brief Budget in Brief FY 2024 Congressional Justification 86 In carrying out its regulatory role, FERC uses a range of ratemaking activities as well as market oversight and enforcement. FERC's ratemaking activities leverage both regulatory and market means, and invol ve the issuance of orders and the establishment of rules and policies. FERC's enforcement activities include both increasing compliance and detecting and deterring market manipulation. T hrough these efforts, FERC ensures that consumers have access to the energy services they need and that service providers are reasonably compensated. Ensure Safe, Reliable, and Secure Infrastructure Infrastructure for which FERC approval is required includes interstate natural gas pipelines and storage projects, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) facilities, and non-Federal hydropower projects. In addition, the Commission has authority to site electric transmission facilities in certain circumstances. Ensuring the development of safe, reliable, and secure infrastructure that is in the public interest and that provides energy for consumers at a reasonable cost is a significant, multifaceted challenge. FERC's regulatory role in reviewing proposed infrastructure projects involves balancing the benefits of a proposed project against its potential adverse impacts, including environmental concerns as well as impacts to landowners and communities. Additionall y, FERC considers the minimization of risks to the public in the operation of the infrastructure project. To promote safe, reliable, and secure infrastructure, FERC ensures the sustainability and safety of non -Federal hydropower projects and LNG facilities throughout their entire life cycle; oversees the development and review of, as well as compliance with, mandatory reliability and security standards for the Bulk -Power System; and helps to secure the Bulk - Power System from cyber and physical attacks. The Commission also protects FERC -jurisdictional energy infrastructure through collaboration and sharing of best practices. P rovide Mission Support Through Organizational Excellence The public interest is best served when the Commission operates in an efficient, responsive, and transparent manner.
