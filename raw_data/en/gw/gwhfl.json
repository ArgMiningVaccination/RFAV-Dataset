In the present study, we evaluate the activity of nine anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonalantibodies (mAbs), previously isolated from convalescent donors infected with the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain, against the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Deltaand Omicron. By testing an array of mutated spike receptor binding domain (RBD) proteins,cell-expressed spike proteins from VOCs, and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs aspseudoviruses, or as the authentic viruses in culture, we show that mAbs directed against theACE2 binding site (ACE2bs) are more sensitive to viral evolution compared to anti-RBD non-ACE2bs mAbs, two of which retain their potency against all VOCs tested.

In view of the unexpectedly fast rates of viral evolution, it is important to estimate the degree to which neu- tralizing antibodies elicited naturally following infection with the original wild type strain (Wuhan-Hu-1), are cross reactive with circulating, present and future, VOCs. This is particularly relevant considering recent reports that vaccination provides considerably less protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants than against the original strain 1-3. The SARS-CoV-2 antibody response has been pro led at the sequence, structural, and mechanistic level by cloning and char- acterizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from donors4-9. with the emergence of variants, many of these mAbs, some of which have been approved for treatment of COVID-19 patients10-12, have become ineffective13-15, while others retain activity16. This indicates that some antibodies elicited by infection are more variation-sensitive than others, and that antibody breadth of speci city, and not only potency, should be considered. A ner resolution investigation of the mechanistic and functional basis of SARS-CoV-2 antibody neutralization is therefore needed to predict the effect viral modi cations will have on antibody activity, and to estimate the degree of protection from SARS-CoV-2 reinfection and break- through infection. Moreover, studying the molecular recognition of naturally elicited neutralizing antibodies in the context of heterologous viruses can reveal sites with a lower tendency to variation. We have previously identi ed a panel of neutralizing SARS- CoV-2 antibodies derived from two COVID-19 survivors who were infected in Israel in March 2020, likely with the Wuhan-Hu- 1 strain9. while the activity of another two (TAU-1115 and TAU-2220) was less potent. All the mAbs, except one, bindsoluble receptor binding domain (RBD) and spike with high afnity. The exception, TAU-2212, which is one of the most potent neutralizing mAbs, binds an unknown conformational surface, and binding can only be detected when the spike protein is expressed on viral particles or cells. While exhibiting neu- tralizing activity against the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain, the cross- reactivity of these mAbs with SARS-CoV-2 VOCs is unknown. The present study was designed to investigate the breadth of specicity and structural basis of the neutralizing activity of our previously isolated mAbs, in the context of the emerging variants Alpha (B.1.1.7) 17, Beta (B.1.351)18, Gamma (P.1 or B.1.1.28.1)19, Delta (B.1.617.2)20,21and Omicron (B.1.1.529)22. The results indicate that the most potent mAbs in our panel are pre- dominantly directed against the ACE2 binding site (ACE2bs) supersite and are also the ones most sensitive to viral diversi - cation. To understand the basis of neutralization and escape at the atomic level, we used cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM) and X-ray crystallography to determine structures of the two mAbs: TAU-2303 and TAU-2212. The results indicate that the interac- tion of TAU-2303 Fab and SARS-CoV-2 RBD resembles that the ACE2 receptor with RBD in the \"up\"RBD conformation. In contrast, mAb TAU-2212 exhibits an unusual recognition flex- ibility type of binding involving ve different possible con- formations, with 1 -3 Fabs binding to one spike trimer, or cross- linking adjacent trimers by forming both intra- and inter-spike contacts, and favoring RBD in the \"down \"position. Our study provides important mechanistic and structural insights about neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs by natural antibodies,together with molecular modeling predictions of mAb interac- tions with the Omicron variant. Results Antibodies binding at the ACE2bs are more sensitive to viral mutations . The results of our previous study indicated that mAbs TAU-1145, -2189, -2230, and -2303 compete with ACE2, and are therefore de n e da sA C E 2 b sm A b s ,w h i l em A b sT A U - 1109, -1115, -2220, -2310 do not compete with ACE2, and are therefore de ned as non-ACE2bs9. The last neutralizing mAb, TAU-2212, does not bind soluble SARS-CoV-2 antigens (RBD or spike) by ELISA and recognizes an unknown epitope9.T o examine the recognition of the RBDs from SARS-CoV-2 VOCs by our previously isolated mAbs, we generated soluble RBD proteins containing the mutations identi ed in the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron strains (Supplementary Table 1) a n dt e s t e dt h eb i n d i n gb yt h ee i g h tm A b st h a to r i g i n a l l y exhibited strong binding to the wild type strain RBD9.W i t ht h e exception of Alpha, we observed a reduction in binding ef - c i e n c yo ft h eA C E 2 b sm A b st oa l lt h eV O C s( F i g . 1aa n d Supplementary Fig. 1). This was most signi cant for Beta, Delta and Omicron RBDs but was also present, albeit to a lesser extent, for the Gamma variant. Amongst the ACE2bs mAbs, only TAU-2303 maintained its original activity against the Delta strain. TAU-2212 does no t bind soluble RBD and could not be evaluated using this assay9. To investigate the individual contribution of each mutation, we generated RBDs harboring single or double amino acid substitutions corresponding to variants Beta, Gamma and Delta. Of the eight single-mutated RBDs tested, both the L452R (present in the Delta VOC23)a n d E484K (present in both the Beta and Gamma VOCs24)s u b - stitutions had a major impact on antibody binding (Fig. 1b, d and Supplementary Fig. 1). Other single substitutions, however, had no effect on mAb binding. Furthermore, RBDs containing single mutations N439K25, Y453F26,27and A475V28,w h i c h have been reported in some circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains, were bound by all mAbs as strongly as the original wild type RBD. Interestingly, the binding of mAb TAU-2303 to the double mutant K417N/N501Y was reduced although each of the two single mutants separately had no effect (Fig. 1c, d and Supplementary Fig. 1). Overall, we conclude that ACE2bs mAbs are more sensitive to mutations in the RBDs than non-ACE2bs mAbs. Mutations outside the RBD may also affect the activity of RBD- binding mAbs by altering the conformational organization of the trimer29. Therefore, we next expressed the full-length spike protein of wild type, Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants (Supple-mentary Table 1) on Expi293F cells, and assayed the ability of each mAb to inhibit binding of soluble human ACE2 (hACE2) by flow cytometry. The Gamma full-length spike protein was not produced since the RBD of this variant exhibited similar activity to the Beta RBD. As expected, most of the ACE2bs mAbs effectively inhibited the ACE2:spike wild type and ACE2:spike Alpha interactions, but not those between the ACE2:spike Beta and ACE2:spike Delta. The mAb TAU-2212, which can be tested in this assay, demonstrated 25 -40% ACE2:spike inhibition when tested against the wild type, Alpha and Delta strains, but had no activity against Beta (Fig. 2a, b and Supplementary Fig. 2). In fact, none of the ACE2bs mAbs retained their original potency against the Beta variant, and, in accordance with the ELISA data, only mAb TAU- 2303 retained its full activity against the Delta variant. As expected, no effect was observed for mAbs TAU-1109, -2310, -1115 and -2220, as the neutralization does not act through receptor blocking.ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-022-03739-5 2 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | (2022) | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-022-03739-5 (x103)b 5 0 5 10K417T 0 5 10K417N/N501Y 5 10K417N/E484K 0 5 10TAU-2303TAU-2230TAU-2189TAU-1145TAU-2310TAU-2220TAU-1115TAU-1109Non- ACE2bs ACE2bsAUC (x103)a 0 5 10 0 5 10 0 5 10TAU-2303TAU-2230TAU-2189TAU-1145TAU-2310TAU-2220TAU-1115TAU-1109Non- ACE2bs ACE2bsWild type 0 5 10Beta TAU-1109 rainHigh binding Medium binding Low bindingNon- ACE2bs ACE2bsY453F the RBD of wild type and SARS-CoV-2 VOCs by ELISA.

We employed a pseudo-viral neutralization assay and infection of Vero-TMPRSS2 cells with authentic SARS-CoV-2 to test the activity of the nine mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 wild type and VOCs (Fig. 3). In accordance with the ELISA and flow cytometry results, the Alpha VOC behaved similarly to the wild type strain, while the Beta and Omicron variants were the most resistant, followed by Gamma and Delta. In agreement with the ELISA andflow cytometry results, mAb TAU-2303 was the only ACE2bs mAb that was able to neutralize the Delta VOC, with improved potency compared to the wild type strain (Fig. 3a). The ACE2bs mAbs TAU-1109 all tested VOCs, with TAU-2310 exhibiting improved activity against the Delta variant compared to the wild type (Fig. 3a, b). These results indicate a crucial support role for non- ACE2bs mAbs in the presence of viral mutations that prevent neutralization by ACE2bs mAbs.

Structural basis of neutralization of the ACE2bs mAb TAU- 2303 . Viral evolution appears to be primarily focused on the ACE2bs supersite, consistent with the overall superoir potency of receptor blocking mAbs to inhibit SARS-CoV-2. We decided to focus on mAb TAU-2303, which is the only ACE2bs mAb that is active against the Delta VOC, and mAb TAU-2212 that blocks receptor binding through recognition of a conformational surface, and further investigate the structural basis of neutralization for these two mAbs. We rst determined the cryoEM structure of the fragment of antigen-binding (Fab) of TAU-2303 (Fab2303) in complex with the ecto SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer, a resolution of 4.5 \u00c5 (Fig. 4a). The cryoEM structure revealed that one Fab2303 molecule binds one spike trimer on the protruding \"up\" facing RBD. Therefore, mAb TAU-2303 can be categorized as a CoV2130-type mAb, that belongs to Class 1 RBD binding mAbs, and binds only one RBD subunit amongst the three available subunits of the trimer (Fig. 4a). We also crystallized Fab2303 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 RBD and analyzed the structure at a resolution of 2.42 \u00c5 (Fig. 4b Table 1). The results from both the crystal and cryoEM structures indicated that Fab2303-RBD complex has a large buried surface of 1185 \u00c52, with the major- ity of the contact surface (64%) derived from the heavy chain of Fab2303, and only 36% from the light chain. A total of 29 RBD residues in the crystal structure have direct close contacts with Fab2303 (Supplementary Table 2). Consistent with the contact surface analysis, 19 of these residues are from the heavy chain(HC), while 10 are from the light chain (LC) of TAU-2303. The contact residues mediate the formation of 23 hydrogen bonds (Supplementary Table 2). These include ve hydrogen 2.7 \u00c5 (Supplementary Table 2). Inaccordance with the biochemistry and contacts between Fab2303 and RBD, are also involved in binding the ACE2 receptor, thus conrming that TAU-2303 neutralizes the virus by blocking receptor binding (Figs. 1-3,4b and Supplementary Figs. 1,2). The angle of approach through which Fab2303 binds RBD is 25\u00b0 relative to that of ACE2 (Fig. 4b). Further comparisons revealed that the binding mode of mAb TAU-2303 is similar to that of other Class 1 neutralizing antibodies that target RBD (Supple- mentary Fig. 3a, b) 30-32. The ELISA results indicated a reduction in TAU-2303 binding to RBD with the double mutations K417N/N501Y, but not to K417T/N501Y, or any of the single mutations K417N, K417T, or N501Y (Fig. 1and Supplementary Fig. 1). This agrees with the crystal structure ndings that residues K417 and N501 are both in direct contact with TAU-2303. Position 417 is particularly critical for TAU-2303 recognition, as Fab2303-HC-Y52OHforms hydro- gen bonds both with the main chain atom N and the side chain atom NH of RBD-K417 (Fig. 4c, d and Supplementary Table 2). Modeling revealed that when lysine in position 417 is replaced with threonine, both the main chain and side chain hydrogen bonds could be retained (Fig. 4d). Moreover, it becomes possible to establish a new hydrogen bond between the OH atom of the threonine and the OH atom Fab2303-HC-Y33, thus decreasing the total binding energy calculated with PISA33from -9.7 kJ/mol to -9.9 kJ/mol. In contrast, replacing lysine in position 417 by asparagine, increases the length of the hydrogen bonds betweenthe side chain polar atoms ND2H or OD1 with Fab2303-HC-Y33 and Fab2303-HC-Y52, which decreases the favorability of the interaction, as indicated by the increase of the calculated binding energy from -9.7 kJ/mol to -9.5 kJ/mol (Fig. 4d). The asparagine in position 501 has a relatively large number of contacts with Fab2303. The N501 side chain forms two hydrogen bonds with main chain and side chain atoms of Fab2303-LC-S30 (Fig. 4c). While these hydrogen bonds would be completely disrupted by replacing asparagine with tyrosine, our modeling data suggest that new Van der Waals interactions could be formed with tyrosine in this position (Fig. 4d). Since these proposed Van der Waals interactions would not be able to fully compensate for the lost hydrogen bonds, mutant N501Y is predicted to have a slightly lower binding af nity to Fab2303, as is con rmed by by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) (Supplementary Fig. 3c, d). Interestingly, although glutamate in position 484 was shown to be central to viral escape from neutralizing antibodies34-36, our structural analysis indicates that E484 does not make direct interactions with Fab2303. This point was resolved by further examination of the RBD and Fab2303 interface, which revealed that E484 interacts with Fab2303-HC- Y102 through a water molecule (Fig. 4d). The observation that solvent-mediated interactions are usually weaker than direct contacts, is consistent with the results of our functional studies that, in contrast to the other ACE2bs mAbs, the single E484K mutation had no signi cant impact on TAU-2303 binding (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The mutations T487K and L452R of RBD Delta are located outside the binding epitope of Fab2303, which, thus explains how TAU-2303 can still bind with high afnity and neutralize the Delta VOC (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 3c, d). The structure and modeling data explains why TAU- 2303 can bind equally well to an RBD molecule with a single mutation, such as K417N, E484K, and N501Y, but not to an RBD mutant with all three mutations, with the greater cumulative loss of binding energy. Our structural data combining the biochem- istry and neutralization results, suggest that the combination of RBD mutations may play a key role in conferring SARS-CoV-2resistance. Signi cantly, the Omicron variant, has mutations in seven residues within the binding epitope of Fab2303, including four key contacting residues K417, Q493, Q498, and Y505, providing the structural explanation to the lack of neutralization of Omicron by TAU-2303 (Figs. 3and4e). conformational . TAU-2212 is one of the most potent mAbs in our panel, and while not being able to bind soluble RBD by ELISA, it inhibits ACE2 binding as measured by flow cytometry, suggesting that receptor binding is blocked through a different mechanism to that employed by TAU-2303. To investigate the neutralization mechanism of TAU-2212, we prepared Fab2212 by cleaving and the crystal was diffracted to 2.7 \u00c5. Data analysis revealed that the crystal belongs to the space group P6 5with cell dimensions a=75.98 \u00c5, b=75.98 \u00c5, and c =348.14 \u00c5 (Table 1), and with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The structure was deter- mined by molecular replacement and was re ned to a nal R/ Rfree of 0.202/0.246. The nal model of Fab2212 contains 419 residues, while residues 141 -151 and 197 -204 of the heavy chain are not visible in the map (Fig. 5a). No signi cant differences were observed between the two molecules in the asymmetric unit (a calculated R.M.S.D. of 0.77 \u00c5 between the aligned C alphaatoms, Supplementary Fig. 4). Fab2212 is not able to form a stable complex with the prefusion stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike ecto- domain (Supplementary Fig. with spike trimer on the cell surface9. With the supposition that TAU-2212 binds aARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-022-03739-5 6 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | (2022) conformation of the prefusion spike trimer that is not stable when coated on ELISA plates, we used TAU-2212-protein A coated beads to pull down spike trimers, which were then subjected to cryoEM structural analysis. CryoEM 3-dimensional (3D) classi cation of the particles revealed that TAU-2212 binds the spike trimer in ve and 39788 particles, respectively (Supple- mentary Fig. 6 and Table 2). In all ve conformations, only the Fab portion of mAb TAU-2212 is visible, while the highly flexible Fc region is not seen in the reconstructed maps. Conformations 1, 3 and 4 are composed of two, three and three bound Fabs, respectively, with all the RBDs in the \"down | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-022-03739-5 | www.nature.com/commsbio 7contrast, conformation 2 has Fab per trimer, with one RBD in the \"up\"conguration, while the other RBDs that are bound by the Fab appear in the \"down \"conguration. Conformation 5 has two head-to-head spike proteins, which are crosslinked by three mAbs (Fig. 5b, c). We determined the structures of all ve conformations to resolutions of 4.7 \u00c5, 7.3 \u00c5, 6.4 \u00c5, 3.3 \u00c5 and 9.4 \u00c5 (6.1 \u00c5 for the split single spike with three Fabs), respectively (Fig. 5b, c, Table 2 and Supplementary Figs. 6,7). For conformation 4, where the resolution permits ab initio model building and re nement (Supplementary Fig. 8), an atom model of the complexes was built with the crystal structure of Fab2212 and the cryoEM structure of the spike trimer (PDB: 6XEY) as references (Table 2). Since the resolution of the maps of conformations 1 -3 and 5, is too low for ab initio model building, atom models of the complexes were built by tting the crystal structure of Fab2212 and the cryoEM structure of the S trimer into cryoEM maps.Conformation 4 of the TAU-2212:spike complex has all the RBDs in the \"down \"position with three TAU-2212 moieties binding near the junctions between the RBDs. Each Fab2212 binds and crosslinks two adjacent \"down \"RBDs (RBD1 and 2) with a surface of 823 \u00c52on RBD1 and 298 \u00c52on RBD2 (Fig. 5b). Comparing the structures of the TAU-2212-bound and free spikes revealed that TAU-2212 binding induces conforma- tional changes in the RBDs, producing an anti-clockwise rotation of 4.1\u00b0 towards the symmetry axis, and resulting in a more compact RBD head structure after TAU-2212 binding (Supple- mentary Fig. 9a). The conformational changes in the RBDs bring residues at the interfaces closer and may increase the Van der Waals interactions between the RBDs. However, no additional contacts are observed between the \"down \"RBDs. In addition, the RBD loops 454 -462 and 468 -489 that are disordered in free spikes are well ordered in the complex structure by forming three hydrogen bonds with the bound TAU-2212 (Supplementary Fig. 9b and Supplementary Table 3). These loops are also ordered and visible upon ACE2 binding. These data suggest that TAU- 2212 acts by binding and stabilizing the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer in a \"down \"orientation and prevents conformational change to \"up\"RBD which is required for spike:ACE2 interactions. Most of the epitope recognized by mAb TAU-2212 is on one of the two RBDs (RBD1), and the interactions are predominantly through the heavy chain, especially the CDR3 loop of the heavy chain (HCDR3), which is embedded within the interface of two RBDs. Two CDR loops of the light chain interact directly with two residues on RBD1 (485 -486), including the hydrogen bond formed between the N atom of F486 RBD1 and the OH group of Fab2212-HC-Y93 (Fig. 5d). Overall, the interactions between the HCDR loops and RBD1 and RBD2 involve 57 residues, and 13 pairs of hydrogen bonds (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Table 3). These interactions include two hydrogen bonds formed by the OE2 group of E484 RBD1, with the OH group of Fab2212-HC-Y33, and the ND2 group of Fab2212-HC-N52. The length of the hydrogen bond between the OE2 group of E484 RBD1 and the OH group of Fab2212-HC-Y33 is 2.2 \u00c5, suggesting that this hydrogen bond could be the main interaction at the contact interface. The E484K mutation completely disrupts the hydrogen bonds between the antibody and the RBD (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Fig. 5b), providing a structural explanation for the complete resistance of the Beta and Gamma VOCs to TAU-2212. Similarly, both the E484A and Q493R mutations present in the Omicron variant, are considered likely to disrupt the key hydrogen bonds and are therefore expected to affect TAU-2212 binding and reduce neutralization capacity (Fig. 5f). Substitution S373P that is present in the new Omicron variant, also lies within the TAU- 2212 interface. To test the effect of S373P mutation on TAU-2212Fig. 4 Structural analysis of Fab2303 in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer and RBD. a Ribbon structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer complex with TAU-2303 Fab (Fab2303).

The results showed that the S373mediated hydrogen bond did not affect the binding of TAU-2212 (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Next, we performed a pull down experiment to test the interaction between mutant S373P and TAU-2212 (Supplementary Fig. 5c).The results showed that TAU-2212 can still bind spike with the S373P mutation, which further supports that both the hydrogen bond and Van Der Waals force mediated by S373 side chain do not play a major role in TAU-2212 binding spike. Taking the effect of all the mutations together, it is therefore not surprising that TAU-2212 does not neutralize Omicron. a E484Y33N52d 5:789 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-022-03739-5 | www.nature.com/commsbio 9Given the flexibility and dynamics of the interaction between TAU-2212 and the spike trimer, we examined binding of the Fab2212 variable regions to the adjacent RBDs in conformations 1-5. We noticed that the densities of bound Fabs2212 were considerably weaker in conformation 2 than in the other conformations, indicating that the \"one up \"-\"two down \" conguration may not be favorable for TAU-2212 binding(Fig. 5c). This possibility was also suggested by the pull-down results. To obtain the TAU-2212: spike complex, we applied more spike and a large portion of the spike protein was in the flowthrough which is likely to be in the RBD \"up\"conformations. Structural analysis of the bound Fabs indicated that the constant regions of the three bound Fabs in conformation 4 (three Fabs binding three \"down \"RBDs), are positioned at a small bendingFig. 5 Structural analysis of TAU-2212 in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer. a Ribbon diagram showing the crystal structure of Fab2212.

In addition, the three molecules are well separated (Fig. 5c) and the distances between the two C254s that form a disul de bond and crosslink loops of the bound Fabs is ~21 \u00c5 (Supplementary Fig. 10), suggesting that the three bound Fabs belong to three different mAbs, rather than one mAb binding the trimer with both arms. The constant and variable domains of the bound Fabs in conformation 5 assume similar conformations as these in conformation 4, suggesting that the bound Fabs in conformation 5 belong to three different mAbs. In contrast to conformation 4, only two Fabs are present per trimer in conformation 1. The constant regions of the two bound Fabs in conformation 1 have a large bending angle (29.6\u00b0) and are joined at the distal end. In addition, the two C254s that crosslink loops of the bound Fabs have a reasonable distance of 4 \u00c5 (Supple- mentary Fig. 10), suggesting that in this case, the two bound Fabs belong to the same mAb (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 10). Notably, conformation 3 has the three bound Fabs in two distinct conformations. Two of the Fabs have similar bending angle as that observed in conformation 1, whereas one of the Fabs has similar bending angle as that observed in conformation 5, indicating that the binding of TAU-2212 in conformation 3 is in a mixed mode with two mAbs. Among these, one mAb contributes two Fabs, while one mAb provide only one Fab (Fig. 5c). Structural analysis of the head-to-head spikes in conforma- tion 5 reveal three mAbs that crosslink two spikes, with the two Fabs of each mAb in two linearly aligned 180\u00b0 opposite positions (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 10c). As a result, the constant region of the bound Fab in conformation 5 has the smallest bending angle and is almost in a plane with the variable region. Given that most particles are in conformation 4, and no spike trimers were observed with all \"down \"RBDs and a single bound TAU-2212, we can deduce that binding of a single TAU- 2212 mAb to the down RBD trime rt r i g g e r sac o n f o r m a t i o n a l change that promotes additional Fab binding. With the binding of the rst Fab, the second Fab of the bound mAb will be prone to binding the neighboring epitope. However, binding of boththe Fabs in one mAb will cause bending in the bound Fabs as shown in conformation 2, which will reduce the stability of the interaction. Thus, the bindin gm o d ei nc o n f o r m a t i o n1c o u l d soon be replaced by the binding mode in conformation 4, whereas conformation 3 is likely an intermediate state between conformations 1 and 4. Taken together, mAb TAU-2212 adopts a unique binding mode to the spike. mAb TAU-2212 recognizes adjacent RBDs in a \"down \"conformation and crosslinks two spikes facing each other. However, a single Fab2212 barely binds the spike trimer, which is spike linkage. Our result indicate that natural IgG can also crosslink spike and promote virus particle does39, although the RBD conformation and epitopes are different in these complexes. Discussion Despite the relatively stable genome of SARS-CoV-240, the con- tinuing spread of the global pandemic has been accompanied by the emergence of new variants with improved transmissibility and mutations that contribute to immune evasion25,41-44. With enhanced af nity for human cells and alterations made to vul- nerable residues within the spike, these new variants can jeo- pardize both mAb therapies and vaccines. The Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron VOCs are of particular interest as they completely replaced the original Wuhan-Hu-1 strain insubsequent \"waves \"of the pandemic. The rst part of our study assessed the binding inhibition and neutralization of nine anti- bodies, previously isolated from Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals9. Consistent with other reports45,46, we show that ACE2bs mAbs are more affected by viral mutations than mAbs that bind to regions outside the ACE2bs. While these are generally less potent against the original infecting virus, non- ACE2bs mAbs appear to have broader activity against emerging variants. In the second part of our study, we investigated the mechanism of neutralization of two neutralizing receptor-blocking mAbs, TAU-2303 and TAU-2212, at the atomic level. The atomic structure of Fab2303:RBD con rmed that TAU-2303 binds a surface that is also bound by the ACE2 receptor, as we observed by functional assays. In contrast to other ACE2bs mAbs in our study, TAU-2303 remained active against the Delta VOC, likely due to the comparable modes of binding of ACE2 and TAU-2303 with respect to both epitope and angle of approach to the RBD. However, like the majority of mAbs that block receptor binding, TAU-2303 was less effective against the Beta and completely ineffective against Omicron variant. We next examined the aty- pical mAb, TAU-2212, which exhibits an unusual recognition flexibility type of binding involving ve different conformations. TAU-2212 binds and crosslinks \"down \"RBDs by displaying exceptional conformational flexibility. According to the tted structure of each conformation, the interfaces between the RBD and the variable region of the bound Fab2212 are consistent. We considered that the binding surface remains the same among the ve conformations. The observation that TAU-2212 binds the spike complex in ve different conformations suggests a flexibility of neutralization that is also achieved by stabilization of the spike trimer. The existence of a large number of TAU-2212 with head-to-head spikes suggests that TAU-2212 can potently crosslink and aggregate viral particles and thereby reduce the number of effective viral particles in the lung. Furthermore, the binding mode in conformations 1, 3, 4 or 5 would block any \"up\"conformation of the RBDs, thus, blocking receptor binding. In these ways, TAU-2212 exhibits ACE2bs-like properties while utilizing a distinct mechanism of action. Alternative strategies that broaden neutralization capacity can be deduced from the previously reported antibodies S2M11 and C144 which crosslink two \"down \"RBDs and have a similar mode of binding to that of TAU-2212 (Supplementary Fig. 11). However, unlike TAU-2212, both S2M11 and C144 can bind the spike trimer with the Fab alone. Out of the three antibodies, S2M11 has the largest binding interface, while the binding interfaces of TAU-2212 and C144 are smaller and more similar (Supplementary Fig. 11). Like TAU- 2212, S2M11 mAb promotes a compact RBD head, whereas C144 binding promotes the opposite effect by forcing the RBD head into an open conformation (Supplementary Fig. 11b). The larger binding interface of S2M11 encompasses E484 and L452 residues, and therefore is expected to lose ef cacy against the Beta, Gamma and Delta variants, whereas TAU-2212 effectively neutralizes Delta (Fig. 3and Supplementary Fig. 11). Like other mAbs in its class, TAU-2212 also exhibited a complete loss of activity against the Beta, Gamma and Omicron VOCs. To summarize, our study provides functional and atomic-level structural data on the interactions between naturally elicited antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 variants. Both TAU-2303 and TAU- 2212 are potently neutralizing but arise through different B cell developmental programs. Neutralization by TAU-2212 is suc- cessful for most of the mutations with the exception of E484K. We therefore conclude that combining mAbs that can bind E484K, such as TAU-1109, 2303 or 2310 with TAU-2212 may be useful for broad spectrum anti-viral neutralization.COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-022-03739-5 ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | used our pre- viously reported wild type plasmid9as template for PCR mutagenesis designed to generate RBD constructs harboring single amino acid mutations.

The following day, concentrated pseudo-particles were incubated with serial dilutions of antibodies for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C and added to the 96 well plates. After 48 h, the cell medium was replaced with fresh DMEM medium excluding Phenol Red, and 24 h later, the 96-well plates were imaged by IncuCyteZOOM (Essen BioScience). Cells were imaged with a 10\u00d7 objective using the default IncuCyte software settings, which were used to calculate number of GFP- positive cells from four 488 nm-channel images in each well (data for each anti- body was collected in triplicates). The number of GFP-positive cells was normal- ized and converted to a neutralization percentage. Pseudo-particles expressing theAlpha, Beta and Delta spikes were produced and tested similarly (Supplementary Table 1). Virus preparation and titer determination . All work with SARS-CoV-2 was conducted under Biosafety Level-3 conditions at the University of California San BEI Resources. Viral stocks originally isolatedon VeroE6 were passaged once through primary human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBECs) differentiated at air-liquid interface (ALI) before expansion on VeroE6- TMPRSS2 (Sekisui XenoTech), referred to here as Vero-TMPRSS2.

The heavy chain and light chain of TAU-2303 or TAU-2212 were cloned separately into a pCMV vector and transiently transfected into HEK293F cells by using PEI at a ratio of 1:1. Supernatant was harvested 4 days after transfection. TAU-2212 was captured and puri ed using protein A beads (GE healthcare), eluted with 0.1 M glycine at pH 3.2, and then neutralized to pH 7.6. For Fab preparation, the puri ed antibodies (TAU-2303 and TAU-2212) were digested by using the protease papain (Sigma, #P3125) with an IgG to papain ratio of 66:1 (w/w) for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C.

The Fab portion of TAU-2212 was concentrated to 7 mg/mL for crystallization. The crystal was grown at 16 26% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.2 M(NH 4)2SO4, pH 8.0. Crystals were soaked in the reservoir solution supplemented with 10% glycerol, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection. Data collection, structure determination, and re nement . The X-ray diffraction data were collected at the BL18U (RBD-Fab2303) and BL02U (Fab2212) of the Shanghai Synchrotron Research Facility. The wavelength was 0.980 \u00c5 and the data collection temperature was 100 K. Data were processed and scaled with HKL200051. The structure was determined by molecular replacement using PHASER52. Manual building and adjustments of the structures were performed in COOT53. The structure of RBD-Fab2303 was re ned by using PHENIX54. Data processing showed that the crystal of Fab2212 belongs to the space group P6 5. However, the merohedral twinning appears to assign the crystal to the space groupP6 522. The structure of Fab2212 was re ned against the twinned data by using Refmac555with the twinning operator k, h, -l and an estimated initial twin ratio of 0.52 to 0.48 between the two domains. The nal re ned twin ratio between the two domains were 0.60 to 0.40. Data collection and re nement statistics are listed in Table 1. The Ramachandran statistics are as follows: 97.24% favored and 2.76% allowed RBD-Fab2303; and 0.24%outlier in R.m.s. deviations col- umns were obtained from refmac5 job output.

Fab2303 was mixed with the puri ed S6P trimer (2:1 molar ratio Fab per protomer) to form the Fab-S complex at a concentration of 2 mg/mL. The mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min. Next, 3 L of the mixture was applied to glow-discharge holey carbon grids (Quantifoil, Cu 200 mesh, R1.2/1.3). The grid was blotted for 4.5 s in 100%humidity before being flash-frozen in liquid ethane by using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher). For TAU-2212-S2P complex preparation, S2P and TAU-2212 were incubated for 30 min on ice at a molar ratio of 1:2. The antibody-spikecomplex was puri ed by protein A beads. The neutralized elution was further puried by anti- eluted complex was crosslinked by 0.125% glutaraldehyde for 20 min. The crosslinked sample was puri ed by size-exclusion chromatography with a Superose 6 10/300 column. The target fraction was col- lected and concentrated to 0.8 mg/mL for cryoEM grid preparation by using similarconditions to those used for S6P and Fab2303. Image data of the S6P-Fab2303 and S2P-mAb-TAU2212 complexes were collected on a Titan Krios electron microscope (FEI Company) equipped with aeld emission gun operated at 300 kV and a Gatan K3 Summit camera. Images of S6P-Fab2303 were recorded at a defocus range of 1.5 to2.8m, with a pixel size of 1.25 \u00c5. A total dose of ~ 50 electrons per \u00c5 2was used. SerialEM was used for the data collection. A total of 2599 movie stacks for S6P-Fab 2303 and 4675 movie stacks for S2P-TAU2212 were collected. The frames in each movie stack werealigned, summed, and 2\u00d7 binned using Motion Cor2 59. The CTF parameters of the micrographs were determined by Gctf with local defocus variations taken into consideration60. For the S6P-Fab2303 complex, a total of 546293 particles were boxed by using Gautomatch, and were then subjected to 2D classi cation using RELION61. The cryoEM 6VXX62) was low-pass ltered to 40 \u00c5 and used as the initial model. A total of 38331 particles were selected for the nal 3D re nement without imposing any symmetry, which yielded a cryoEM map at a resolution of 4.5 \u00c5 (Table 2). For the S2P-mAb-TAU2212 complex, data was collected at defocus 1.5 to 2.0 \u00b5m, with pixel size of 0.97 \u00c5. 90569 particles were picked by Gautomatch and then were subjected to 2D classi cations with RELION 3.0. The 2D classi cation results showed two major classes, one with a single spike and the other with two head-to-head crosslinked spikes. Particles in the two classes were split for separated3D classi cations in RELION 3.0. For the head-to-head crosslinked spikes, 39788 particles were selected for 3D re nement with D3 symmetry imposed, which resulted in a cryoEM map at a resolution of 9.36 \u00c5. To improve the reconstruction, the head-to-head spike particles were split into two particles each with one spike and three bound Fabs. The split particles were subjected to local re nements, which resulted in a cryoEM map at a resolution of 7.3 \u00c5. The resolution of the map with a tight mask generated by cryoSPARC was improved to 6.1 \u00c5 (Supplementary Fig. 6). Particles in classes with a single spike were selected by Gautomatch and subjected to 2D classi cation. Selected particles were subjected to 3D classi cation with a S trimer cryoEM map as the reference (PDB accession number: 6XEY 63). This produced four distinct conformations: conformation 1 has two bound Fabs; conformation 2 has only one bound Fab; conformation 3 has two Fabs from onemAb and one Fab from the other mAb; and conformation 4 is 3-fold symmetric and has three bound Fabs. Particles from each conformation were selected and used for re nement against an RBD \"all-down \"spike that was low passed to 60 \u00c5.For conformation 4, the nal re nements were performed with 72056 selected particles and C3 symmetry imposed. The resolution of the nal reconstructed map is 3.5 \u00c5. We applied the re ned half maps from Relion to cryoSPARC for local resolution estimation and with the cryoSPARC generated auto-tighten mask and local lter tool, the resolution of the post processed map was improved to 3.3 \u00c5. Side chain densities are clearly visible in most of the reconstructed map (Supplementary Fig. 8). For conformations 1, 2 and 3, the nal re nements were performed with 20339, 15868 and 14193 selected particles, respectively, andwithout imposing any symmetry. The re nements resulted in a cryoEM map at a resolution of 5.5 \u00c5 for conformation 1, a cryoEM map at a resolution of 7.8 \u00c5 for conformation 2, and a cryoEM map at a resolution of 6.5 \u00c5 for conformation 3. The processing of the cryoEM map for conformation 1 was equivalent to comformation 4 by cryoSPARC, and the resolution was improved to 4.7 \u00c5. Tokeep the Fab features in conformation 2 and 3, we used looser masks in cryoSPARC Local Filter jobs, and the nal resolution were 7.3 \u00c5 and 6.4 \u00c5, respectively. All of the re ned density maps were applied with a negative B-factor and corrected for the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the detector. The reported resolution is based on the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) 0.143criterion 64,65(Supplementary Fig. 7). Statistics and reproducibility . All graphs were generated and SD calculated using Prism versions 8 and 9. Reporting Summary .
