We address this question by focusing on the gastrointestinal tract where a single layer epithelium separates our body from pathogens and microbial colonizers belonging to the microbiota. Through taking a comparative infection biology approach, our research has identified cellular mechanisms underlying the balanced immune response that is necessary for responding to life-threatening infections while avoiding chronic illnesses like inflammatory bowel disease. Ongoing projects include elucidating how symbiotic intestinal viruses, fungi, and parasites contribute to local and extraintestinal disease susceptibility, defining how the cellular pathway of autophagy mediates resilience towards infectious threats, and understanding how polymicrobial exposure in the natural environment contributes to the developmental maturation of the immune system. Through these projects, we hope to gain further insight into how microbial diversity in the intestinal ecosystem shapes host physiology and pave the way for therapies that restore balanced host-microbe relationships.
