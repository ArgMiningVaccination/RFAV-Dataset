Becky Arthur Julia's \"Protein Power\" is by far the best tasting protein supplement (actually, it's incredibly delicious). I have ever tasted! I believe it's because the monk fruit tastes like a natural sugar. It's just the right amount of sweetness without any weird aftertaste. Julia hit the jackpot when discovering this unique sweetener! I am grateful that she created such a healthy, energetic, and great tasting product! Amy Wilson Julia introduced my family to her \"Protein Power\" when my baby was 18 months old. With severe food allergies, she hated to eat in the morning as she associated it with hurting. Julia sent her \"Protein Power\" and IT CHANGED OUR LIVES! As a mom, I could cry because this protein was a life saver when I was desperate for an answer. My kiddos ask for it and it's a daily part of my nutrition! Elaine Abercrombie \"I love \"Protein Power!\" The monk fruit sweetener tastes so much better than stevia -- with no bitter after-taste. Julia's \"Protein Power\" is my go-to breakfast--sometimes even lunch. It gives me the non-stop energy I need, When I am over-busy I know my protein intake is ample, It mixes easily & tastes great with just water!
