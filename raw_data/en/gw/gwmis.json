It is potentially harmful and often not effective. Those doctors and prac-titioners who advocate the treatment and prevention of disease through the maintenance and restoration of health have always found the tech-niques of vaccination to be objectionable. Experience in the naturopathic approach to medicine teaches that the best way to prevent disease, includ-ing infectious disease, is to maintain robust good health in so far as pos-sible and when needed to use treatments that pose no harm. These must be the goals of any rational medical system. It may be difficult for the modern reader to understand how good health and increased resistance to disease can protect one from germs since we have been told for over a hundred and fifty years to fear these invisible microbes as the cause of our ills. The naturopathic understanding of the cause of disease calls into question the validity of the germ theory of disease, a key departure point for the naturopathic professional from the conventional belief that we are at the mercy of microbes. This is not merely an academic question; rather, it forms the basis for the very argument in support of vaccination and for the fear-based beliefs in recommending them, and even for mandating them. As you read through these pages, it will become clear that many doc- tors within the dominant school of medicine contended that vaccination can be harmful. Many of our own forebears present cases which doc-ument such harm and support this concern. The text of these articles documents how doctors of this earlier time clearly saw vaccination as a deliberate poisoning of the blood and questioned how it was possible that injecting potential toxins into the body could improve a patient's health. They and many others, including the anti-vaccination societies and the general public, not only challenged the rationale of such techniques, but also railed against their compulsory use. Recurring arguments in this persisting conversation and debate are that such objections to vaccination belong in the past and that medicine has advanced since then, not only in terms of vaccine production and distribution, but also in terms of the validity of the science substantiat-ing its use. However, these are dubious assertions. There is little doubt that medical technology has advanced and with it increasingly sophisti-cated ways to measure, analyze and intervene in one's body, but still the therapeutic rationale of treating symptoms with suppressive therapies in conventional medicine has not changed. In addition, the principles that govern health as documented eloquently in this volume remain as valid Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Materialxii Va c c i n a t i o n an d na t u r o p a t h i c Me d i c i n e as ever. Thus, the concept of optimal health as the best treatment and prevention is at odds with the idea of injecting foreign substances into someone to ward off disease. As well, and echoed eloquently in these pages by the early natur- opathic physicians and those allied with their philosophy and practice, is the persisting concern about the potentially harmful effects of vaccina-tion. In our own era these concerns are at an all-time high as the public continues to question the assertions of the dominant school of medicine and its powerful ally\u2014the pharmaceutical industry. The belief that vac-cinations are safe and effective obtains only if one takes the public health view that the collateral damage for the technique is acceptable in light of its perceived benefit. Just as the early naturopathic doctors cautioned, one need only read the package insert for most vaccinations to see that they are not always safe or effective. As reported in these pages, and consistent with today's research, many who are vaccinated are not protected; vac-cinations do not always confer immunity (nor long lasting immunity for that matter), and those who are vaccinated may actually be carriers of the microbe spreading disease by infecting others (here invoking the conven-tional model of infectious disease). The writers presented in this volume were quite prescient. They were concerned as much about the potential damage of vaccinations as they were about the adverse impacts and unpredictability of the microbial mate-rial itself. In recent years in this regard, significant research has shown that some microbes can evolve to evade the vaccination and there is evi-dence that the microbes from the vaccine may indeed colonize the patient. In fact, the stakes for vaccine damage are so high that it eventually became extremely difficult in the United States to sue a medical practitioner or a vaccine manufacturer for damages sustained from a vaccine. Under the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, Congress granted immu- nity to these groups because of the rising number of lawsuits alleging vaccine damage and the concomitant fear of vaccine manufacturers not providing vaccines. Instead of filing a medical injury lawsuit, an indi- vidual's sole remedy for vaccine damage is through the \"vaccine court\" or the United States Court of Federal Claims. Vaccine court is an admin- istrative proceeding overseen by the United States Department of Health and Human Services. In spite of the assertion that vaccines are safe, the vaccine court has awarded since its inception more than $3.2 billion in damages to Americans for certain childhood vaccines. In my own practice of nearly forty years, I have seen dozens of children who were \"normal\", healthy children, meeting all of their developmental milestones, with no health problems until immediately after a vaccination. The changes in their behavior ranged from mild to severe neurological impairment, including diagnoses (made by conventional physicians) from attention deficient disorder to autism. Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material xiiiForeword The doctors in these pages also point out that, despite the argument that vaccination was believed to greatly reduce or eradicate certain infec- tious diseases, much has been documented from their era to the present that suggests or proves otherwise. These undeniable outcomes are more likely due to better sanitation, hygiene, clean water supplies, and other public health measures, and not to the vaccinations themselves. Natur-opathic doctors also recognize that one must go beyond the external envi-ronment and address the internal environment as well. In recent years, reminiscent of the assertions of these early physicians, multitudes of studies have shown, for example, that various essential nutrients including Vitamins A, C, D and E, as well as zinc and selenium, each individually and in combination is effective in reducing the incidence of influenza and other so-called infectious diseases. As I write these words there is news in the press of studies showing that one who gets more than six hours of sleep at night has half the risk of \"catching\" the common cold as someone who gets less than six hours of sleep. Here again this simple way of intervening to prevent and cure illness, by sustaining good health and optimal function, is both explicit and implicit throughout these pages, in the very words of our naturopathic elders from the era of Benedict Lust, Henry Lindlahr and others whom you will meet here. The early naturopathic doctors appear to have had no quarrel with the concept of active immunity. However, naturopathic and homeopath-ic physicians as well as indigenous healers have long known that there are methods which confer such immunity without any risk whatsoever. The naturopathic school of medicine argues that resistance to illness is conferred by good health. It is a matter of historical record that with every infectious disease and every epidemic there are those who are exposed to the \"germ\" with few or no consequences and those who succumb to the disease manifesting in serious symptoms or even death. Whether it's the bubonic plague of the fourteenth century, small pox of Shakespearian England, the 1918 global flu epidemic, or the Ebola scare in North Africa in the early twenty first century, there were many thousands or millions of deaths, but there are also those thousands or millions who survived. The difference is obviously in the individual and in our understanding of susceptibility and resistance. Simply stated, all living organisms, flowers, horses, children and, yes, germs, require the proper milieu or medium for their growth. Without an environment to support microbial growth, there can be no infection. Further, doctors of rational medicine have suc- cessfully treated many diseases now thought of as being caused by bacte-ria or viruses before microbes had been identified. This raises the obvious question discussed by critical thinkers since the discovery of microbes: Does the microbe cause the tissue changes we call disease, or do the dis- Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Materialxiv Va c c i n a t i o n an d na t u r o p a t h i c Me d i c i n e ease conditions provide the proper environment for the proliferation of the microbe? Also referenced in these pages are the practices and fundamentals of the homeopathic school of medicine from which our predecessors under- stood that immunity could be developed through the use of medicines which mimic the disease symptoms or through the use of microbes admin-istered orally in infinitesimal doses. These procedures are similar to vac-cination, and are equally, if not more, effective and without any harm at all. The naturopathic pioneers cited in these pages were very familiar with the arguments for and against vaccination as it is performed in convention-al medicine today. Despite the oppressive measures taken in those early days to establish vaccination with impunity in the community, the doctors cited in these articles did not hesitate to raise questions about its safety and its effectiveness, and further to challenge it as a mandatory medical procedure administered without consent. Theirs was a logical response given the knowledge that there are other safer, more effective, and less costly ways to enhance immunity than vaccination. Their bewilderment about why this was not common knowledge and why this was not known to the dominant medical community even to this day is a question, they insisted, of economics and politics, not of science and medicine. Jim Sensenig, ND Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material xv ForewordPreface Pr e f a Ce Vaccination And Naturopathic Medicine is one of the twelve books that comprise The Hevert Collection. Each title consists of articles selected from the Lust journals from 1900-1923 (and occasionally when English articles are available, from 1899). The Rare Book Room at National Col-lege of Natural Medicine is the home of these unique, precious original papers. Published by Naturopathy's founder, Benedict Lust, across fifty years [1896-1945], the Lust journals coalesce the concerns, ambitions and vision of the emerging, young naturopathic profession. In the early days, The Naturopath and Herald of Health offered a voice to many NDs, MDs, DCs, DOs, and over thirty different groups who aligned themselves with the Naturopaths. The Hevert Collection is a celebration of our natur-opathic history and makes available in the words of our naturopathic pioneers, their voices on what was important in Naturopathy in the early 20 th century. Fifty years of publishing is indeed a long time; it's a lifetime of dedica- tion, editing and writing. Benedict devoted his life to Naturopathy and left behind a rich tapestry of literature that we can benefit from. Benedict did not do anything in small measure. He embraced journalism with ferocity and astute observation. He founded three principle journals and two of these underwent numerous name changes. Amerikanischen Kneipp-Bl\u00e4t- ter [1896-1899] an adaptation of a German publication was his first foray into publishing and was later renamed The Kneipp Water Cure Monthly [1900-1901]. As his horizons expanded from Father Sebastian Kneipp's water therapies, Benedict incorporated Adolf Just and Louis Kuhne and others into the new naturopathic healing paradigm and the next journal reflected those new interests. The Naturopath and Herald of Health [1902-1915] became the first naturopathic journal ever to be published and it too soon underwent a name change to Herald of Health and Naturopath [1916-1922] in 1916. Then in 1923 this same journal became simply, Naturopath [1923-1945] retaining this name even after Benedict's death in 1945 and afterwards when his nephew, John Lust, assumed responsibility for the Lust pub-lications. The third journal, Nature's Path [1925-1960's] preserved its original name throughout its entire lifespan. After Benedict's death, the journals also retained his photo and recognized him as the founder of the journals and of Naturopathy. Benedict's publishing career has made it possible to produce these twelve volumes for the Hevert Collection. In 2010, before the Hevert Collection, a preliminary version of the current Vaccination book in a spiral bound format was published, In Their Words: Vaccinations, a Naturopathic Historical Perspective. It contained Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Materialxvi Va c c i n a t i o n an d na t u r o p a t h i c Me d i c i n e 44 articles. The book in this improvised form used original documents from the Lust journals and it soon became apparent that it needed to be revised. Inclusion and exclusion of articles were often dependent upon being able to legibly duplicate the original, and not always on the merit of their content. In this new collection, there are fifty-eight robust arti-cles selected from 1900 to 1923, highlighting the animated conversations amongst the early doctors who had strong opinions about the political and social implications of compulsory vaccinations. In Vaccinations and Naturopathic Medicine there is a wide range of voices challenging vac-cinations. The line up of articles reflects not only the accumulating objec-tion by medical professionals, but also the broad range of those across the spectrum of the medical professions and civil society who were concerned and determined to speak up. There are 29 by M.D.s, 20 by Naturopaths, 3 by politicians and /or lawyers; 2 by scientists, and 4 by Anti-vaccination organizations who were invariably founded and led by Medical Doctors. Since the introduction of vaccination by Jenner in 1796, the outpour- ing of dissent built and persisted across more than two centuries. Many doctors raised their voices in protest against vaccination, reasoning that vaccinations needlessly maimed and killed innocent people. The same doctors demonstrated the importance of sanitation in disease control and provided credible examples that the low incidence of smallpox hinged not on compulsory vaccination programs, but rather on sanitation and hygiene. The argument that vaccinations saved lives was and remains unresolved. Many of the medical doctors from the regular school attested and witnessed first-hand that people did indeed die from the smallpox vaccine. We may be inclined to conclude that the doctors a century ago were simply over reacting and alarmist in their opposition; however, the statistics speak volumes that their concerns were well founded. In their own words, many of the doctors in this volume were more afraid of vac-cination than of the actual diseases for which the vaccines were devel-oped. This same literature points out that treating diseases such as small- pox was entirely possible using natural treatment guidelines. You will also find in these pages protocols that were used successfully for whoop-ing cough, diphtheria, smallpox, scarlet fever, infantile cholera and the dreaded measles. Further, a careful read of the work of our pioneering forebears will demonstrate that we haven't evolved within the last two hundred years in regards to the germ theory and vaccination. Indeed, a number of the examples and specific cases cited in these articles may well remind us of a recent event in the USA. The American Center for Disease Control [CDC] asserted that low vaccination rates were responsible for a measles outbreak in Disneyland, California [December 2014-February 2015]. The 159 measles cases linked to the Disneyland episode resulted in no Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material xviiForewordPreface deaths; yet during the past ten years [2004-2014] there have been 108 documented deaths in children receiving the measles vaccine, juxtaposed in the same period with there having been zero deaths from contracting measles. What the early Naturopaths knew was that it was far easier to treat smallpox and the other infectious diseases if one followed the laws of Nature. Natural treatment that included dietetics, water therapies, sanitation and hygiene supported the body to eliminate the conditions of disease and restore health. Although articles appear each year from 1900 to 1923, the major- ity of the vaccination pieces were published between 1909 and 1913. In 1913, one sees a shift in the dialogue from vaccinations to medical free-dom contextualized within the naturopathic community. August A. Erz, for example, published a book, Medical Laws vs Rights and Constitution in 1913, which Benedict Lust re-published in his journal allotting many successive pages in each issue. It was with great regret that I could not include whole articles from Erz because of their 20 to 30 page lengths. Vaccination has occupied a continually shifting historical position; sometimes it has the golden seal of approval and then in a blink, it is con-demned as dangerous, only to revert back to good and the cycle persists. We are currently seeing the biomedical community embrace vaccinations as its sanctified miracle against the germs which surround us. At the same time, we are recognizing the importance of the human microbiome and the invaluable contribution micro-organisms have in human health. Some theories persist, such as Koch's Germ Theory. Another example is the work of Metchnikoff and B\u00e9champ whose countering theories of germs recognized their essential role in human life. These debates have persisted for centuries and will likely generate literature for centuries more. In this book, you will discover the history of vaccination from the perspective of the early pioneers. You will read statistics. You will learn about the Anti-Vaccination League of America and its struggles and victories. Pay close attention, as well, to Henry Lindlahr's account of vaccination and see if it still fits for you in the 21 st century. Discover champions and doctors who worked selflessly to educate their patients to choose health. Of the hundreds of vaccination articles found in the Lust journals, there was not one that presented a neutral opinion. All of the articles were polarized against vaccinations and in particular, compulsory vaccination of children. You will find in Vaccination And Naturopathic Medicine examples of patient care and the protocols used to treat infectious diseases. Contem-porary reliance upon antibiotics is reaching a plateau, and perhaps even an end point, or at least a place in medicine when we cannot place our entire trust in a drug that sometimes backfires. You will discover treat- ments that are simple and surprising. These protocols may seem unfath- Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Materialxviii Va c c i n a t i o n an d na t u r o p a t h i c Me d i c i n e omable and perhaps even impossible for treating disease. Let me tell you a secret which was known all over the early naturopathic neighborhood. The early Naturopaths did not have much in the way of gadgets, nutra-ceuticals were non-existent, and antibiotics weren't invented yet (had they been, they would have been completely out of the question). They used water and knew how to manipulate water to achieve the healing reaction desired. They endorsed fresh air, sunshine, dietary measures, exercise and hygiene. With their understanding of Nature, they were able to treat diseases quite successfully that Allopaths attributed to germs. I want to thank everyone who has breathed life into Vaccination And Naturopathic Medicine. Behind the glossy book cover are hundreds of typed pages which were patiently transcribed by many magnificent stu-dents at NCNM. In fact, there are over 1000 articles typed from the Benedict Lust journals in preparation for the books in this collection. I want to acknowledge every NCNM student who typed or proof-read articles while navigating his or her intense course loads and juggling per-sonal lives. I bow with gratitude to Adam Wojciechowski, Rebecca Jennings, Tristian Rowe, and all those whom I am inadvertently missing here. And, as this book project continues, my appreciation for the invalu- able organizational help that I had received from Dr. Karis Tressel at the commencement is a daily reminder that book making is an undertaking of an entire community. I am deeply grateful for her profound love of the traditions and history of Naturopathy and her loving tenacity with this project. I so much enjoyed working with each and every student who sacri- ficed scarce, precious study and leisure time for the hard work of meticu- lous research and transcription. As you launch yourselves into the Natur-opathic profession, never forget how special and important your work has been. You have chosen a path of sacred work. You will be loved and cherished by your patients because you listen and truly care. Remember to trust Nature's power of healing, the Vis medicatrix naturae! Pay care- ful attention to your patients and they will feel enlivened and grateful to have found their way to you. I am grateful for my colleagues who have added their voices to Vaccination and Naturopathic Medicine, especially doctors Jim Sensenig, ND, Jared Zeff, N.D., and Alex Vasquez, DC, ND, DO, FACN. Jim Sensenig, from Connecticut, is a modern day elder of the profession whose foreword graces this book. He has sustained for forty years the same kind of remarkable commitment as students and graduates at the beginning Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material xixForewordPreface of their careers. He has been full throttle at building the Naturopathic profession all these years. Instrumental in every corner of professional formation (to name a few: key architect of the AANP, the CNME, the eventual AANMC; key negotiator in the early licensing efforts across the United States; former Dean at NCNM; lecturer at Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine; award winner from NCNM, CCNM); in family practice for over three decades), his work embodies the very essence of Naturopathic principles and philosophy. Jared Zeff, ND is a champion in the Naturopathic profession, provid- ing leadership and stewardship of our precious naturopathic principles and values. It is one thing to read and talk about the wonders of Natur-opathy and another to put into practice our philosophical values with each and every patient. To embody the essence of Naturopathy means to fearlessly use water as a medicine; it means confidently using food, herbs, sunshine, and fresh air as medicine. We have in Jared a Naturopathic Physician who doesn't mince words when he says that vaccination causes harm, a conviction he holds based on his decades of clinical experience with his patients. Thank you, Jared, for your courageous voice. Dr. Alex Vasquez assimilates and shares his tireless, formidable aca- demic medicine inquiry and scholarship with fellow health professionals, spanning a vast literature of diverse and relevant medical subjects. He too is fearless about standing behind his beliefs and his work. Earlier this year when I was working on Vaccinations and Naturopathic Medicine, news of legislation which proposed to impose compulsory vaccination in Oregon alarmed many physicians in our state. We were disturbed that our oth- erwise progressive state would contemplate such a draconian initiative. I contacted colleagues with my concerns and with lightning speed Alex responded, providing an abundance of research and documents regard-ing vaccination and its effects. The ensuing collaboration of medical and naturopathic doctors yielded a wealth of information for doctors and their patients regarding vaccination. Being part of Alex' network of like- minded, esteemed colleagues is a personal and professional privilege. His position on the vaccination issue quickly puts us in mind of the work of our naturopathic elders a century ago. Their concerns also arose from clinical experiences of the dangers of vaccination. Today, a growing scientific literature clearly and unquestionably corroborates the perils of vaccination. I am deeply grateful that Dr. Vasquez shares clinical data and astute, broad knowledge from which he accesses the facts of the mat-ter and then shares those findings so generously, coherently and systemati-cally. Alex, never stop doing what you do. Dr Alex Vasquez holds three clinical doctorates: DC, ND. and DO. He has authored many definitive textbooks such as Integrative Orthope- Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material20 Va c c i n a t i o n an d na t u r o p a t h i c Me d i c i n e dics (2012), Integrative Rheumatology (2014), and Musculoskeletal Pain: Expanded Clinical Strategies (Institute for Functional Medicine, 2008), among many others, and is a frequent contributor to professional maga- zines and medical journals such as British Medical Journal (BMJ), The Lancet, Annals of Pharmacotherapy, and many more. He is the Chief Edi-tor of International Journal of Human Nutrition and Functional Medicine (Int J Hum Nutr Funct Med.ORG). I am very thankful for the unrelenting support of the Hevert Corpo- ration here in America and in Germany. Thank you and my most gracious accolades to Americana and Wolf Aulenbacher and the Hevert family in Germany for believing in the impossible. Yes, we can create 12 books that are an exquisite testimony to the power of Naturopathy. Much gratitude, as well, to the unwavering, behind-the-scenes support of the Board of NCNM, Dr. Sandra Snyder, Susan Hunter, and Jerry Bores who under-stood from the beginning the importance of this project. The precision and beauty that Fourth Lloyd Productions, Nancy and Richard Stodart, my designers, bring to this book are wonderful. We're now at book six and we have travelled through many conversations and details to bring this book to life. Thank you both for the exquisite care that you took with every minute detail! The best of all, I want to thank, heart to heart, my patient and beloved husband, David Schleich, who inspires me in this journey of revitilizing the past. David becomes my tangible connection to the 21st century when I become lost in the previous one. I could not do what I do without you. Lastly, I am so indebted to the men and women of the profession who lived a hundred years ago and have left behind a trail of wisdom and pas-sion that fills me with confidence and gratitude for their contributions to a literature that I can read when I want. You may find that some of the sentences can be a mile long or embellished with words no longer in our current vocabulary, but this is on purpose. These articles have been care-fully transcribed and edited to ensure that you are taken back into time. So, settle back in a comfortable chair and enjoy these articles chosen from the past and from our elders in their own words.

The body was a mere frame-work of bones covered with loose skin; the face was wrinkled and old-looking, the eyes dull and lusterless, half obscured. The whole body was cold to the touch, particularly the hands and feet; the pulse thin and thread-like, often scarcely perceptible; in short, the whole appearance was the reverse of reassuring. \u2014Otto Wagner, 1900, 45 We condemn a system which makes medical heterdoxy a social crime; we condemn a system which is the principal hindrance to the development of the noblest most humane, most useful of all arts. \u2014J. T. Robinson, 1909, 117 Naturopathy claims that germs of themselves alone cannot create dis-ease\u2014if they could, humanity would soon be extinct. Disease germs are present everywhere, on the food we eat, and the water we drink, and air and dust we breathe, and on the money we handle. Can you imagine anything fouler and more thoroughly saturated with disease germs and bacteria than our beloved money? \u2014Henry Lindlahr, 1910, 130 The system of compulsory vaccination is founded upon a hypothesis too preposterous for a moment's serious argument. It arose from the curious dogma that a healthy person is a focus of disease; and that not having been diseased (i. e., vaccinated) he would be the propagator of disease (small-pox) to those who had been diseased (vaccinated) and thus \"protected.\" If vaccination protected the vaccinated, they would have no occasion to fear infection. \u2014John W. Hodge, 1910, 467 The scab from a running sore is scraped away and the pus or running matter is collected and this is what vaccine virus is that is put into your healthy bodies. This is a direct violation of the principle of asepsis in sur-gery, which is advocated by scientific medicine and which stands for this: that no foreign organisms shall be permitted to go into any cut part on the human body, and aseptic medicines are used in all operations to prevent what is done in vaccination. \u2014 Joseph P. Rinn, 1911, 207-208 A barrel of ignited turpentine could not have flared up with more startling effect than did the epidemic of smallpox in the face of the vicious vaccina-tion crusade. \u2014John W. Hodge, 1912, 224 Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material22 Va c c i n a t i o n an d na t u r o p a t h i c Me d i c i n e Vaccination represents an honest effort on the part of the medical profes- sion to find a preventive for a simple, yet loathsome disease. This effort, however, like many others of its kind, has not only failed to meet the expectation of its discoverer, but has left in its wake, a blighting curse which it will require many generations to remove. Were it not for the fact that vaccination has been enforced by legislation, we would not now be discussing it except as an antiquated medical experiment akin to leeches and blood-letting. \u2014Charles W. Littlefield, 1912, 12 In his classical work on \"History of Epidemics in Britain\", Dr. Creighton tells us that in all the great epidemics of smallpox, which have scourged civilized nations since the adoption and establishment of vaccination, it has been the vaccinated, not the unvaccinated, who were first seized by smallpox, which disease subsequently spread from them, as foci of infec-tion, to the unvaccinated. \u2014John W. Hodge, 1912, 225 Real immunity is overlooked and lost sight of in the mad chase after imag-inary ones, such as serums, antitoxins, and vaccines. The use of these measures to cure or prevent disease diverts attention from genuine immu-nity, from the means that ought to be employed to secure such immunity. \u2014Helen Sayr Gray, 1912, 383 If the prevention theory were true, then no person could possibly ever have smallpox in any form after vaccination. \u2014August Andrew Erz, 1913, 835 Someday our wise and learned will realize that there is a heap of differ-ence between preventing disease and preventing or suppressing reactions. \u2014William Freeman Havard, 1918, 867 Germs are scavengers. Their duty is to break down substances in the body that need to be removed. So long as we live according to the laws of Nature, no germ will or can injure us. \u2014Per Nelson, 1920, 136 No man can violate this unfailing and unalterable law of Nature, which is older than the race itself, and expect to escape suffering the penalty by simply swallowing some poison drug. If we could do that, then the law of God would be completely subservient to the caprice of the will of man, and the price of drugs would soar so high that only the rich could afford to buy them. \u2014Benedict Lust, 1923, 580 Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material 23ForewordPreface Introduction InTrOd uC T I O n The vaccination debate is widespread today, and has a galvanizing effect in our era not unlike on the early Naturopaths entering the new twentieth century. Concerns about the very theory of vaccination, and also about safety and efficacy helped rally the profession to recognize and proclaim the importance of following Nature's laws, about medical free-dom and about choice in health care a hundred and ten years back. Their collective, cumulative voice was not unlike what we experience in con-temporary North America in the middle of the second decade of another new century. For a long time now the idea and practice of vaccination conjure up strong opinions among health care providers, both pro and con. Politicians what the early Naturopaths called \"the laity\" weighed in quickly and often. Just as back in the day of Lindlahr and Lust, sur-rounding issues about health choice accent the worry about safety and effectiveness. The early Naturopaths fought bitterly against compulsory vaccination when this public health net cascaded out of the nineteenth century right into communities all over North America in the early twentieth. This col-lection of articles, by no means an exhaustive compilation, but rather a modest, representative selection of articles found in Lust's journals, voices such concerns of our forebears, raising alarm bells then which reverberate to the modern era in the media and the medical literature. Whereas the concern about vaccination brought together Naturopaths and many more Allopaths than one might expect from our perspective in this century, a century ago, today, the issue of vaccination has been dividing and fractur-ing the naturopathic profession. Some align with vaccination and others choose to oppose its use. Similar fault lines are also seen in the allopathic communities. As you read through these articles, you may well experience as I did the moral conviction and deep commitment to the laws of Nature our elders exhibit. As you reflect further upon the writings of these pioneers, you will soon discern their astute reflection on this complex topic, and the brilliance and courage of their response to elements of the autocratic imposition of vaccination. In some ways, this book distills out for us the essence of Naturopathy, manifesting all of its strength as a natural thera-peutic model. Disease, and especially infectious disease, was not avoided, feared or considered hopeless by the early Naturopaths; rather, they saw such presentations as an opportunity to practice medicine using the gifts of Nature to help heal patients. And heal they did. The first two articles get right to the point and strike home with their clear message. Naturopaths did not blink when faced with dreaded and Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material24 Va c c i n a t i o n an d na t u r o p a t h i c Me d i c i n e feared childhood diseases which claimed so many in 19th and early 20th centuries, such as measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria and infantile cholera. Always, they turned to natural methods of helping the body to overcome disease and malady. The early Naturopaths who confronted these dis-eases in their patients did so with confidence and with their splendid tools, such as the simple protocols used by Father Kneipp. The hay-flower shirt and the salt-shirt invented by Kneipp offered relief for children suffer-ing from measles, and other childhood diseases. (Lust, 1900, 28; Kneipp, 1903, 237) In this regard, Benedict Lust counsels his colleagues, \"One does not need to feel frightened on account of [the rash accompanying diphtheria], for the rash is a natural consequence of the process of heal-ing.\" (Lust, 1900, 28) Otto Wagner in his short article outlines a case of infantile cholera which can only fill us with awe. Having no antibiotics, no heroic medi-cine, nor an urgent intervention in a hospital emergency room, Wagner used simple baths, enemas and diet to cure a six month old infant of cholera within a matter of days. His first impression of this tiny patient was that the infant was a \"framework of bones covered with loose skin; the face was wrinkled and old looking, the eyes dull and lusterless. ... The whole body was cold to the touch, ... the whole appearance was the reverse of reassuring .\" (Wagner, 1900, 45) By his third visit to the bedside of this very young patient, Wagner states, \"The child could be regarded as saved. There was no more vomiting, stools took place 3 or 4 times a day ... sleep and appetite were good, appearance fresher.\" (Wag-ner, 1900, 46) This prognosis comes 4 days after the initial consultation. Very spectacular considering that infantile cholera was essentially a death sentence for infants. This documented account is not unusual in the lit-erature, and even more significant given the profile of the doctor, whose reliable accounts of such cases had wide circulation and profound cred-ibility in this era. Otto Wagner held the Director position at the famed palatial sanitarium that Friedrich Eduard Bilz established in Radebeul - Dresden, Germany. Bilz, for his part, was a devout follower of Father Sebastian Kneipp. He had written a two volume encyclopedia numbering over 2,000 pages and built one of the most successful sanitariums in 19 th century Europe. It was in this context that another Naturopath, Wagner, documents the revival of a dying child, restored back to health with cold water com-presses, baths, enemas and a simple diet. Kneipp and such followers were famous for such miraculous cures and today W\u00f6erishofen stands promi-nently, testament to the wisdom of Kneipp more than a century after his death. The medical feats established by Kneipp and his followers spread to all continents. Infectious diseases could indeed be treated and cured with Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material 25ForewordPreface Introduction confidence and success, just as Kneipp demonstrated, by using ingenious, intuitive variations of Nature's elements of water, sunshine, fresh air and a healthy diet. In his article, \"Children's Diseases\", for example, Sebastian Kneipp describes the use of the salt shirt treatment and fenugreek tea for scarlatina and measles. Kneipp viewed childhood diseases as a detoxify-ing process and health promoting. He states, \"It is a well-known fact that children who have recovered from either of these two diseases [scarlatina, measles], are much healthier and feel much better than those who have not had them.\" (Kneipp, 1903, 237) Thus it was that the introduction of vaccination as the singularly reli- able method of preventing infectious diseases was not unchallenged. In fact, Edward Jenner's solution to disease was met with mounting opposi-tion, including the creation of Anti-Vaccination organizations. One of the first such organizations in the U.S. was the Anti-Vaccination Society of America. We discover in the April 1901 issue of The Kneipp Water Cure Monthly, a notice appearing with its written constitution. Its primary purpose was to educate the public about vaccination with provocative descriptors warning that vaccination was \"a disease and death-producing agency\". (Blue, 1901, 116) Each month a publication was distributed to its membership. In 1910, a second group called the Anti-Vaccination League of America began to publish its meetings and events in the Natur- opath. This group had as its objective \"to secure the abolition of all oppressive medical laws, and ... to give aid and assistance to societies or individuals engaged in the movement for freedom from compulsory vac-cination.\" (Anti-Vaccination League, 1910, 549) One of the members of the Anti-Vaccination Society and second Vice- President, Dr. A. J. Clausen, MD, delivered a speech to its St. Paul, Minne-sota members. As a medical doctor, he was appalled that compulsory vac-cination could even exist under the American constitution. He argued, \"If there is anything a man owns, it is his own blood and just as a man has the unquestioned right to choose his political party, religion, physician, and to say whether or not a surgical operation shall be performed on his body, just so he has the right to reject vaccination.\" (Clausen, 1901, 158) From its inception the naturopathic profession collaborated with the Anti-Vaccinationists many of whose members were from the medical (or allopathic) profession. Illustrative of this shared position, Lust docu-ments the outcome of a meeting of the Naturopathic Society of America at which E. B. Foote, MD (the Treasurer of the Anti-Vaccination Society of America) reported victory on the Stewart Bill, Number 235 in the New York Assembly, a legislative initiative about compulsory vaccination. One of the Society's members was able to retract a few lines to prevent these mandatory vaccinations. Lust comments, \"At least we may congratulate ourselves that the vigilance of a few has protected the many from a very Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material26 Va c c i n a t i o n an d na t u r o p a t h i c Me d i c i n e imminent danger of the worst sort of compulsory vaccination law.\" (Lust, 1903, 127) Prevention was recognized early by the nature doctors to be instru- mental in curbing the incidence of contagion and diseases. Dr. A. L. Wood, MD's article in The Naturopath and Herald of Health recounts the dysentery epidemics in the Lake Champlain district as a result of impure water supplies along with a similar crisis in Brooklyn, New York. He extolls the virtues of distilled water and compares it to \"Nature's distilled water in the form of rain\". (Wood, 1902, 131) Filtered and distilled water were both advocated by the Naturopaths to prevent infections. Impure water containing bacteria was remedied with the use of a water distiller and there were many advertisements of various distillers in The Natur- opath and Herald of Health. The notion of prevention, then as now, was grounded in access to healthy water in this case, along with the Natur-opath's advocacy for clean air, good food and hygienic living space. The Naturopaths did not deny that bacteria introduced into the body caused illness; however, they recognized that when the human body suc-cumbed to an overload of micro-organisms, it was their view that perhaps the problem was not the bacteria, but the underlying conditions that bac-teria favoured. They contended that acute symptoms arising from the presence of bacteria in a body were the body's attempt to restore health. In this regard, Dr. Carl Strueh, MD cites examples of mechanisms of the body protecting itself and maintaining homeostasis. He reminds readers, \"Bacilli by themselves are never the cause of illness; they are everywhere in Nature; they are always swarming about us, but they never settle in our organism and multiply if there be nothing to do for them, i.e., if they do not find dead material on which they can subsist.\" (Strueh, 1904, 82) Strueh viewed vaccination as an interference with such natural protective mechanisms of the body. He states, \"So-called preventive vaccination (immunization) [enables] the disease, i.e., the predisposition, or the mor-bid material in our system [to be] preserved.\" (Strueh, 1904, 82) Morbid matter, in fact, lies at the center of the naturopathic etiologi- cal paradigm. Naturopathic doctors have long anchored their approach in life style counseling to help patients navigate the dangerous terrain of fast food, GMO foods, stress, late nights, sedentary life habits and many related behaviours which accumulate unrelentingly into chronicity, morbidity and mortality. In the early literature morbid matter referred to \"indigestible food and faulty diet ... unhealthy, damp, dark dwelling places, often dirty, and never aired, ... too little exercise.\" (Lust, 1905, 13) Morbid matter and poor life style choices were faulted as the cause of diseases, for example diphtheria. Benedict Lust cites morbid matter as a major cause and provides a detailed account of patient management. The therapies used by Sebastian Kneipp and Louis Kuhne are prominent in his protocol. Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material 27ForewordPreface Introduction In a following article, \"Diphtheria and Antitoxine\", Dr. Schulze brings to our attention the fervent efforts by the Allopaths to discover a solu- tion or antitoxine for diphtheria. Proponents of the antitoxine claimed it to be only effective in the early stages of the disease which confounded men such as Schulze who points out the unpredictable and precipitous onset of diphtheria. He states, \"No other disease approaches so treach-erously and breaks out so suddenly in its fully characteristic developed form, before the least suspicion has been entertained of the presence of the danger.\" (Schulze, 1905, 17) Schulze's paper presents questions and leaves a message of caution. He recounts details of a newspaper story of a medical doctor's use of the antitoxine on his own son. Upon receiving the injection, \"in an instant the boy was a corpse\". (Schulze, 1905, 17-18) The inclusion of this article in Benedict Lust's journal was crystal clear. Lust, having seen personally the success of naturopathic modalities for the treatment of diphtheria, must have cringed witnessing the allopathic pur-suit of dangerous vaccines. He wanted his membership to be forewarned and aware of the adverse possibilities that vaccines entailed. Another medical doctor brings her voice to the vaccination discus- sion. Dr. Ellen Goodell Smith, M.D., bursts the bubble of misconception that vegetarians are safe from contracting smallpox. As a vegetarian, she recounts her brush with the illness and briefly describes her treatments. Her attending physician remarks, \"Your baths, packs and fasting could not have been improved and you do not need a drop of my medicine.\" (Goodell Smith, 1906, 159) The water cure applications used by Dr. Goodell Smith demonstrate that it is possible to cure smallpox without resorting to vaccination. Her case demonstrates that smallpox, treated using Nature's methods, was not synonymous with death. Yet many died from smallpox and more often than not under the care of allopathic methods. Vaccination for the prevention of smallpox seemed reasonable in such a cascading scenario. Yet, questions regarding its use appear and re-appear in The Naturopath. One medical doctor opposed to compulsory vaccination had formulated a logical argument that continues to be heard even to our present day. Dr. Leverson, M.D. states, \"If [vacci-nation] really does protect from smallpox, then those who are vaccinated are protected and can incur no danger from the unvaccinated.\" (Leverson, 1906, 260) From this perspective, compulsory vaccination of those who objected was unequivocally wrong. Another objecting medical doctor, C. S. Carr, M.D., questions the dishonest tactics used by the Public Health Boards in establishing statistics in favour of vaccination and to cover up its failures. Carr exposed the practice by the Public Health Boards in their statistical findings by point-ing out that their methodology included vaccinated people who contract smallpox in the group of un-vaccinated. The discrepancy had huge impli-cations for the illusionary success of vaccination preventing smallpox. Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material28 Va c c i n a t i o n an d na t u r o p a t h i c Me d i c i n e Carr reveals, \"It was frankly stated by the health officer to charge that if these people had been 'successfully vaccinated' they would not have had smallpox. Therefore, he felt entirely justified in classifying them as 'never vaccinated'.\" (Carr, 1907, 222) Smallpox was a much feared disease and so too was pertussis (whoop- ing cough), a highly contagious, respiratory tract infection caused by a bacterium (Bordetella pertussis). The treatment of whooping cough by Allopaths and by Naturopaths differed both in application and outcomes. Benedict Lust remarks upon the allopathic failure to treat whooping cough: \"The treatment of this sickness by the Allopaths, as they them-selves will frankly admit, is in no way satisfactory. Their only remedies are the following ones: belladonna, hydrocyanic acid, inhalations of the nitrate of silver and bromide of potash, infections of morphia and so forth.\" (Lust, 1907, 355) Lust concludes his article with Kneipp's water applications and directions on the treatment of whooping cough that used water therapies as well as herbal remedies. It is easy to understand that some of the Allopaths chose to cling tightly to vaccination as a means to contain infectious diseases. In the early 20 th century compulsory vaccination was limited to small- pox. Those parents who had children vaccinated had more to fear than one vaccination shot. Vaccinated children who did not manifest signs and symptoms as a result of their vaccination were subjected to more vaccination injections until the vaccine 'took'. Proof of a vaccination that took was visible at the injection site. Dr. Walter Elfrink, Secretary of the Anti-Vaccination Society of America explains, \"The Health Department refuses to accept the certificates of physicians in good standing, and insists that every pupil must exhibit a typical scar not smaller than a ten-cent piece before he can be admitted to the schools.\" (Elfrink, 1908, 95) The public outrage against compulsory vaccination in such a political climate was supported by doctors from both the naturopathic and allopathic trenches. Compulsory vaccination enforced by the American Medical Associa- tion was seen by Dr. Robinson, M.D. as \"the greatest evil that confronts the American people today [and] is [an] evil monopoly\". (Robinson, 1909, 116) The monopoly Robinson references was that the A.M.A. exerted in its enforcement of vaccination against the will of the people, thus attract-ing many foes and protestors. It did not take long for people to speak their minds and to rally and expose the tyranny of the Allopaths who had chosen political means to power. Called many names and branded as dia-bolical and villainous, the A.M.A. did not win the support of the people and sometimes of their very own members. Robinson adds emphatically, \"These medical trust pirates pretend that their object is to protect the Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material 29ForewordPreface Introduction people against the imposition of quacks and impostors, judging from the size of the medical fees and the wholesale butcheries in our hospitals infir-maries, the people will not appreciate such protection.\" (Robinson, 1909, 116) A significant proportion of voices that we witness in The Natur- opath actually come from Allopathic medical doctors who determined compulsory vaccination to be nefarious and inexpiable. For medical doc-tors opposed to vaccination, The Naturopath was a vehicle to make their views known. These medical doctors exhibited a social conscience that motivated them to speak out and help inform the public. More views of the dangers of vaccination were presented in a paper by another M.D., William D. Gentry. Determined to influence the Com-mittee on Education of the House of Representatives of the Illinois Leg-islature, he spoke on the subject of compulsory \"vaccination and revac-cination of all inhabitants of towns or cities, the vaccination of inmates of almshouses, reform and industrial schools, hospitals, prisons, jails or any institution which is supported or aided by the State.\" (Gentry, 1909, 633) Gentry's purpose was to educate the members of the House of Repre- sentatives about the dangers of vaccines and to reassure these politicians that more efficient and preventive approaches against smallpox than vac-cination. His address to his members of State may have fallen on deaf ears, though. After all, he was also alerting this group of politicians of the misdeeds of some of its supporters. \"A great amount of money is being made by men and women in the business of producing virus of various degrees of effectiveness in producing disease, and in vaccinating, whose business and income will be greatly increased by having this Bill become a law. These are the individuals who are using every influence in their power to persuade you to approve and recommend this Bill for passage.\" (Gentry, 1909, 634) Today, Big Pharma has the attention of the govern-ment and continues to reap the financial benefits of compulsory vaccina-tion in America. Related to this burgeoning debate about compulsory vaccination was the dialogue about germ theory. Hereward Carrington, writing on the subject of fasting and diet, revisited the theories of the plague that deci-mated the world in the Middle Ages. Indeed, throughout the Lust jour-nals, naturopathic contributors were compelled to make the distinction from the germ theory and what they considered to be the real cause of disease. Carrington states, \"Orthodox medical science contends that the germs cause the disease; many nature-curists contend, equally firmly, that the foul conditions of the disease rendered possible the presence of the germ. Doubtless there is much truth in both of these views.\" (Carrington, 1909, 356) Carrington reminds us that perhaps one important fact is Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material30 Va c c i n a t i o n an d na t u r o p a t h i c Me d i c i n e omitted when viewing the plague and germs and that is the person's indi- vidual health. He continues, \"There can be no doubt ... that this ques-tion of the state of the individual's health is relegated to a very unimport-ant and subsidiary position, when it should hold a very important, if not preeminent one.\" (Carrington, 1909, 356) Carrington contended that hygiene and diet need to be considered in treatment plans for patients. Long before the Ivan Illich published Medical Nemesis: Limits to Medicine (1974) [London: Calder & Boyars, 1974], in which he warned that the medicalizing of the human life continuum had converted millions into lifelong patients and in which he postulated the notion of \"iatrogenic disease\" (side effects, complications arising from treatments or procedures, medical errors, unnecessary treatment for profit), doctors practicing medi-cine throughout the 19 th and 20th centuries have observed an unexplained surge of new disease presentations as a result of vaccinations. Another medical doctor who rose to the forefront of those opposing the enforcement of vaccination was Dr. John W. Hodge, M.D., who had a practice in Lockport, New York. Hodge wrote often in The Naturopath and his articles touched upon every imaginable aspect of the intrusive nature of vaccination. Over time, vaccinations were implicated with dis-eases such as cancer, syphilis, tuberculosis and others. The complicity of tuberculosis and smallpox vaccinations arose, for example, with the practice of using cows infected with tuberculosis to propagate smallpox vaccines. Cows and calves were the primary source for the smallpox vac-cine. Hodge explains, \"These inoculation experiments prove conclusively that tuberculosis is communicable through vaccination; and as cows are peculiarly subject to tuberculosis, both in its latent and active forms, we can never be certain that the so-called \"calf-lymph used by vaccinators is free from the subtle and insidious foe: tuberculosis.\" (Hodge, 1910, 76) Hodge noted that the causal relation between smallpox vaccination and the incidence of tuberculosis was most marked in countries with high vac-cination use. Another who was a leading voice about the danger of vaccination was Henry Lindlahr, M.D. Lindlahr wrote numerous articles on vaccination, four of which are included here, in a series called \"The Anti-Vaccina-tion Crusade\". Reading these four articles, a student and practitioner of Naturopathy can arrive at a comprehensive understanding of the essence and roots of naturopathic practice. Lindlahr encapsulates the philosophi-cal differences which set Naturopathy apart from and renders it superior to its detractors, and he does so without apology. He speaks with convic-tion and tutors us in the laws of Nature. In the first of his series, he challenges Dr. Koch (the originator of the Germ Theory) and his failed Tuberculin serum. He enlightens and entertains: Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material 31ForewordPreface Introduction Naturopathy claims that germs of themselves alone cannot create disease\u2014if they could, humanity would soon be extinct. Disease germs are present everywhere, on the food we eat, and the water we drink, and air and dust we breathe, and on the money we handle. Can you imagine anything fouler and more thoroughly saturated with disease germs and bacteria than our beloved mon-ey? (Lindlahr, 1910, 130) To understand the difference between Naturopathy and Allopathy, one must first understand the differences between acute and chronic dis- ease. Lindlahr makes these distinctions crystal clear for us. If Henry Lindlahr were given the choice, he would choose to have smallpox in the form of the disease rather than to be subjected to a small-pox vaccination. In the following article, he explains why. He illustrates with the example of his son who had contracted smallpox and describes in great detail his protocol. This is where his teaching shines and illumi-nates, generating one of those precious \"Ah ha\" moments in naturopathic medicine. Lindlahr declares, All acute diseases are natural processes\u2014as we express it\u2014the result of Nature's healing, cleansing efforts, which run a cer-tain well-defined, orderly and natural course. There is a stage of incipiency followed by stages of intense acute activity during which Nature endeavors to burn up, tear down and eliminate by means of fever heat, sores, catarrhal discharges, etc., the morbid matter and poisons from the system. (Lindlahr, 1910, 258) Why is the disease preferred? His edifying answer comes next: \"If during any one of these stages Nature's orderly processes is hindered, interrupted or suppressed by ice bags, poisonous drugs, antitoxin, serums, surgical operations, or mental effort, the disease condition is arrested and made a permanent one.\" (Lindlahr, 1910, 258) By creating a chronic smallpox in the body with vaccination, one is predisposed \"to the devel-opment of all kinds of chronic diseases\". (Lindlahr, 1910, 387) Lindlahr reiterated the concerns of his colleagues of new chronic diseases manifest-ing after vaccination: \"Undoubtedly this systematic and almost universal contamination and degeneration of vital fluids and tissues accounts in a large measure for the steady increase of tuberculosis, cancer, syphilis, insanity and for a multitude of other chronic destructive diseases unknown among primitive peoples, free from the blessings of syphilization, mercuri-alization and vaccination.\" (Lindlahr, 1910, 387) In this horrified, for example, with the repeti- tive vaccinations children received if the vaccinations did not \"take\". He recounts a news story in the Chicago papers, \"The case of a girl who had been vaccinated ten times without results and then admission to the public schools was refused to the child because she was not properly vac- Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material32 Va c c i n a t i o n an d na t u r o p a t h i c Me d i c i n e cinated.\" (Lindlahr, 1910, 491) When vaccinations did take, Lindlahr considered that these children were the lucky ones because they were able to expel the vaccine more successfully. John Hodge was one of the most outspoken on compulsory vaccina- tion and especially in children. His views of the doctors who politicized their position to gain entry into schools and to profit from vaccination were searing and exposing. Hodge elucidates, \"In commenting on this wholesale execution of healthy children by doctors who intentionally propagate a filth-disease (cowpox) under the pretense of sanitation, I pointed out the fact that vaccination with the medical faculty is a matter of business, and not one of philanthropy.\" (Hodge, 1910, 465) The injec-tion of pathological and purulent matter into healthy humans lacked ethi-cal integrity on the part of the politicians and doctors bent on enforcing vaccination at all costs. Hodge continues, \"The introduction of the prod-uct's diseased animal tissues\u2014miscalled calf lymph\u2014into the circulation of healthy human body is contrary to the teachings of modern surgery and sanitary science, and has no justification in either science or common sense.\" (Hodge, 1910, 466) Not only can we find appalling the ethical conflict which the monetary gain accruing to medical doctors promoting wholesale vaccination, but also shocking were the ensuing chronic dis-eases (associated with vaccination) that Lindlahr references. Related association of cancer with vaccination prevalence was also viewed with suspicion. Theories and papers were written to find the links. F. M. Padelford, for example, writes, \"While there may not be any direct relationship between vaccination and cancer, yet the practice of inocu-lating generation after generation with the complex product known as vaccine lymph may ultimately so modify the metabolic processes that can-cer is likely to develop.\" (Padelford, 1910, 660) The discovery of \"a resemblance between the inclusions found in cancer and those observed in smallpox and vaccinia were the first to call attention to the analogy between the two processes\". (Padelford, 1910, 659) As scientist explor-ing the connection between chronic diseases such as cancer, it is not hard to see why he and many others including Naturopaths questioned the safety of vaccination. In his 1910 article, \"Public Health Tracts\" Benedict Lust illustrates the gulf between the medical intentions of vaccination and the experi-ence of the people receiving those injections. Lust says, \"The doctors dis-covered that vaccination, with four good marks, prevented smallpox for life\u2014The people find that it does not.\" (Lust, 1910, 661) Lust continues citing the most probable cause of the decline in smallpox, \"The people are discovering that defective drainage, overcrowding, badly constructed dwellings, ill-ventilation, un-wholesome food and deficient water supply are the exciting causes of smallpox epidemics.\u2014The doctors must be com-pelled to make the same discovery.\" (Lust, 1910, 662) Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material 33ForewordPreface Introduction Improved sanitation, a cornerstone of preventative medicine for the early Naturopaths was their trumpet cry around the question of compul- sory vaccination. They did not submit to the notion that vaccination was responsible for the elimination of smallpox epidemics. Their proof came from the municipalities that did something about epidemics using the wis-dom of Nature: clean water, clean air and healthy food and homes. In this connection, the Naturopaths pulled a rabbit out of the debate hat with the example of Leicester, an industrial town in England, with a population of 250,000. John Hodge showed with statistics gathered by Dr. Millard, the medical officer of health in Leicester, how vaccination had a devastating effect on this town and verified that smallpox could be eradicated if a focus on public sanitation was practiced. Hodge states clearly, Surely the experience of unvaccinated Leicester has clearly dem- onstrated that vaccination, if it does anything at all, increases liability to smallpox, and renders it more fatal, and that the only effective plan by which to abolish the 'dread disease' (smallpox) from a municipality is to do as Leicester did. This is: abandon vaccination and devote attention and energy to sanitation and to the isolation of such few cases of smallpox as are wont to occur in the absence of 'preventative' vaccination. (Hodge, 1911, 27) Leicester established proof that with widespread sanitary measures, mortality from smallpox could be reduced drastically. Another caveat with Leicester was that the danger of contracting smallpox in vaccinated people was fraught with morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of facial pock marks was rare in those not vaccinated, unlike the disfigurements found in the vaccinated. Hodge wrote about Leicester and its success in employing sanitation to counter the smallpox epidemic. He applauds the triumphs of hygiene: Leicester stands out conspicuously at the present day, a shining example to the whole world of the fact that prophylaxis against smallpox is to be realized through the attainment of health by means of personal hygiene, isolation and municipal sanitation and not by the inoculation of diseased products of man and beast into the healthy human body. (Hodge, 1911, 32) Hodge boldly extols the heroic efforts of Leicester. Here was a sub- stantial English city whose experience demonstrated clearly that smallpox could be controlled with simple hygiene. Despite the well-publicized out-comes in Leicester, though, the Boards of Health in America continued to enforce and advocate vaccination as the preferable prevention. The literature documents that in communities with lax laws people would eschew vaccination. The reaction from the medical community was to continue reassuring the public that vaccination did not pose any danger. In this regard, Samuel Saloman cites William Osler's position on sanita- Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material34 Va c c i n a t i o n an d na t u r o p a t h i c Me d i c i n e tion versus vaccination in this debate. Osler claims, \"Sanitation cannot account for the diminution in smallpox and for the low rate of mortality.\" (Saloman, 1911, 171) As well, Saloman addresses the related concern that other diseases could be transmitted through vaccination and the new terminology to diffuse and confuse the public. He writes, \"Olser denies that syphilis and tuberculosis may be invaccinated; he concedes though that tetanus may be and undoubtedly is introduced into the system with the vaccine.\" (Saloman, 1911, 172-173) Osler continues, \"If a vaccinated person is brought in contact with smallpox and escapes infection, set his escape down to successful vaccination; if he takes the disease, put it down either to unsuccessful vaccination or to spurious vaccination.\" (Saloman, 1911, 171) So went the ping pong rally of the different sides of the vac-cination camps, each side proffering evidence to disprove the other. Another investigator looking for answers was Joseph Rinn. He cites examples of how vaccination failed in protecting against smallpox even though medicine insisted on its infallibility. Rinn states, Dr. Adolf Vogt, professor of hygiene and sanitary statistics at the University of Berne, one of the greatest statisticians on medical science in Europe, proved in arguments presented to the Royal Commission of Great Britain in its investigation of vaccination resulting in the abolition there of compulsory vaccination, that a previous attack of smallpox and vaccination that took made a person more susceptible to another attack than if they had never had smallpox or been vaccinated. (Rinn, 1911, 207) Using statistics and medical records, Rinn discloses the vaccination fail- ures with data from three countries: Great Britain, United States and Japan. The mortality rates in each of these countries did little to promote the vaccinationists cause. Meanwhile, in the United States men and women recognized that the political forces behind compulsory vaccination laws needed to be opposed. Compulsory vaccination attracted many, and from all sectors of society. Major Thomas Bourden of Connecticut, for example, wrote an open let-ter to the Governor and members of the Legislature of the State \"to fairly weigh the evidence which will be presented\". (Bourden, 1911, 304) In his letter, Bourden used numbers to strengthen his case. He alleged, \"Nearly 100 deaths from vaccination have been reported in the press of the coun-try during the past year, and most of them from lockjaw; yet, there is no doubt that the half has not been told.\" (Bourden, 1911, 304) In The Naturopath news items appeared regularly, tabulating the number of deaths occurring due to vaccinations. The account of one such death stole the hearts of Americans. It was the story of a \"sweet little girl ... Lucille Sturdevant [who] died 13 days after being vaccinated\". (Lust, 1911, 312) The story of this child's death was heartbreaking. An only Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material 35ForewordPreface Introduction child, when Lucille died both of her parents was utterly destroyed with their grief. Lust relays the story and her fate: On May 15, 1902, she was in school 35, Buffalo, N.Y., and two public vaccinators, accompanied by two policemen, visited the school to engraft cow virus into the children at $1 a head. Though Lucille was only six years old she objected, saying she had been vaccinated and that she would go home, but would be vaccinated if she must. In spite of this, the officers threatened and forcibly vaccinated her. (Lust, 1911, 312) She died of blood poisoning 13 days later. Sad stories such as Lucille Sturdevant's sent alarms and parents rose up with more conviction to defeat compulsory vaccination bills within their State. In Berkeley, California, a group of parents removed their chil-dren from the public school and \"an anti-vaccination school was opened on August 7, 1905, for all the children whose parents were opposed to vaccination\". (Antonius, 1911, 429) These parents belonged to the Cali-fornia Anti-Compulsory Vaccination League and together they were able to change the laws so that \"children need not be vaccinated, provided the parents sign a certificate that they are opposed to the practice of vac-cination, and that it is the duty of the school board to furnish every par-ent with one of these blanks [exemption forms].\" (Antonius, 1911, 429) The struggle to win their State Legislature was no easy task. California's Governor, Dr. G. C. Pardee had the power to veto efforts to modify com-pulsory vaccination laws, which he did in fact do. Just as people were divided on the merits of vaccination so were medical doctors. Another doctor, one who did not leave behind a name, published his reasons for opposing vaccination. This unknown author recounts what he considered to be the vulgarity \"of purposely infecting the body of a healthy person in this era of sanitary science with the poi-son from a diseased beast, under the senseless pretext of protecting the victim of the engrafted disease from the contagion of another disease!\" (Unknown author, 1911, 449-450) He explained that a widely avail-able medical lexicon provided its readers with information to discern and determine the knowledge base, use and context of terminology. In this regard, the anonymous writer exposes the medical doctors' use of the word, \"calf lymph\", in the context of vaccine to mean a natural body fluid, when in fact \"the so-called pure calf lymph used by vaccinators is a pathological product, derived from a lesion on a diseased calf.\" (Unknown author, 1911, 450) There are many students of the contemporary ortho-dox medical profession in our current day who would contend that allo-pathic medicine still sanitizes its medical jargon to deceive the patient. In allopathic medicine, a readily documentable pattern to dilute par- ticular medical terminology in an effort to convey harmlessness and safety Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material36 Va c c i n a t i o n an d na t u r o p a t h i c Me d i c i n e is common, and even rampant. Words with original derogatory or wor- rying connotations are constructed, altered or tweaked to become words that are neutral and sanitized, as our anonymous writer from over a cen-tury ago contended. Let us consider several examples from the literature. Vaccination, as a word is still in parlance, has been largely replaced in medical messaging and media with the word 'immunization' in an effort to distance medicine from the not forgotten shadows of vaccination. The word, 'immunization' connotes a natural body function and by using 'immunization' instead of 'vaccination', the medical establishment hand-ily guides the public to think of their body's natural immune system. The word 'vaccine' itself is another example of morphing one medical term into another medical term with a completely different meaning. Vaccine is understood to be an injectable drug for preventing infectious diseas-es. Originally, however, so-called vaccine (actually an adjective meaning \"pertaining to cows, or from cows\") was an injectable fluid derived from the festering pustules of intentionally diseased animals and used to pro-vide protection from smallpox. A quick review of the etymology, then, of the term, would cloud for the lay person the word 'vaccine' with a patina of alarm, and even repulsion. Just recently, I was attending a naturopathic conference on cancer and listened to a Naturopath refer to a new cancer vaccine, as if vaccine equated to a desirable remedy for cancer. When did cancer become an infectious disease? We know that the causes of cancer have been vari-ously documented as deriving from genetic factors, environmental toxins, life habits, and drugs themselves, including vaccination related etiologies. The early Naturopaths knew early that chronic diseases were generally not a result of acute infectious diseases. Every time we use the word 'immu-nization' or 'cancer vaccine', we are defaulting to this recurrent pattern of a type of medical-speak, and more often than not endorsing the strategy established by the Allopaths to minimize concern and opposition with terminology which rhetoricians would label euphemistic, accomplishing neatly an avoidance of harsh or unpleasant connotations. Another medical doctor concerned about vaccination, Dr. Charles Littlefield, was the chair of the Washington State Branch of the National League for Medical Freedom. We find in The Naturopath a record of a debate he participated in with Dr. F. S. Bournes, former Health Officer of Seattle, Washington. He begins, Vaccination represents an honest effort on the part of the medi- cal profession to find a preventive for a simple, yet loathsome disease. This effort, however, like many others of its kind, has not only failed to meet the expectation of its discoverer, but has left in its wake a blighting curse which it will require many gen-erations to remove. Were it not for the fact that vaccination has Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material 37ForewordPreface Introduction been enforced by legislation, we would not now be discussing it, except as an antiquated medical experiment akin to leeches and blood-letting. (Littlefield, 1912, 12) Littlefield was keen to shed light on vaccination by reviewing his- torical events and by analyzing Dr. Jenner's work and claims. Littlefield notes, \"Jenner began by claiming that vaccination made a person immune for life, but the facts of observation soon resulted in the term of immu-nity being shortened to fourteen years; then it was made seven, then two, and in the Spanish-American War, six weeks was the limit of immunity.\" (Littlefield 1912, 14) Dr. Charles Creighton was another medical professional who spoke out against vaccination. He had been an eminent pathologist who had pro-vaccination views. When asked to write an article on vaccination for the Encyclopedia Britannica, he conducted \"a most exhaustive study of the subject, and it was not long before the conviction forced itself upon him that vaccination was not only useless in preventing smallpox, but dangerous in practice\". (Littlefield, 1912, 14) Another prominent statesman, Alfred Russel Wallace, Britain's cele- brated explorer and naturalist, also voiced his opinions on the vaccination question. Wallace is particularly known as having formulated indepen-dently, and prior to Darwin's publication of On the Origins of Species, his own theories of natural selection. He travelled extensively during his career and vaccinations were not foreign to him. Wallace recounts: I was vaccinated in infancy, and before going to the Amazon I was persuaded to be vaccinated again. My children were duly vaccinated, and I never had the slightest doubt of the value of the operation\u2014taking everything on trust without any inquiry whatever\u2014till about 1875-80, when I first heard that there are anti-vaccinators, and read some articles on the subject. (Wallace, 1912, 41) After a chance meeting, Wallace began investigating vaccination and made a complete 180 degree turn after his findings. He recounted his experiences as a member of the Royal Commission on Vaccination in England and disclosed his worry about the futility of raising awareness among officials responsible for the laws regarding vaccination. Compil-ing a comprehensive pamphlet of relevant statistical arguments made spe-cifically for the House of Commons, he was disappointed that \"not one of the six hundred and seventy members gave even that amount of their time to obtain information on a subject involving the health, life, and personal freedom of their constituents.\" (Wallace, 1912, 42) Wallace's dismay resulted in the completion of yet another publication. He states, \"I know that in no work I have written have I presented so clear and so conclusive a demonstration of the fallacy of a popular belief as is given in Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material38 Va c c i n a t i o n an d na t u r o p a t h i c Me d i c i n e this work, which was entitled Vaccination a Delusion: Its Penal enforce- ment a Crime, proved by the Official Evidence in the Reports of the Royal Commission.\" (Wallace, 1912, 42) Wallace was not alone in his distress about the political process. The Honorable Charles Miller, member of the Iowa State Legislature, wrote in 1912 an article for The Naturopath in which he raised the alarm about medical inspections in public schools, then pervasive in many States. On first glance, providing medical checkups of school children appears to be philanthropy at work; yet Miller questions the motives of exposing defenseless school children to unsolicited medical interventions at the expense of unwilling parents and children. Miller cites an example of 60,000 school children in Chicago being examined by doctors belonging to the American Medical Association. Miller discloses: When we consider that the sixty thousand children were the grist of the first inspection, and that it was followed by other grists at monthly intervals, and consider it in the light of the figures in a doctor's trust fee bill, no wild flight of the imagination is neces-sary to transport us quickly from the realm of noble philanthropy where the \"political-doctors\" would have us dwell as we con-template their undertakings, into a realm of high finance where sordidness seems all the meaner for the cloak of benevolence with which it garbs itself. (Miller, 1912, 85-86) The A.M.A. advocate doctors were quick to position themselves in public schools, positioning their work with vaccination as being for the public good, vaccination used as a preventative to germs. That this very widespread activity was demonstrably profitable for the doctors engaged in the welfare of school children is a matter of record, and not of specula-tion. The media helped enormously fan the flames of fear for germs. John Hodge explains, So much has been written in the sensational press about disease germs and the efforts of health departments to protect the dear people against the assaults of these microscopic enemies, which official doctors tell us swarm in the air we breathe, in the water we drink and in the food we eat, lurk on the lips of lovers of mil-lions, billions, trillions, quadrillions, quintillions, sextillions, and so on ad infinitum, that one is led to inquire where will this craze about germs end? (Hodge, 1912, 173) Hodge does not deny in his writing the existence of germs and their pathogenic potential. Rather, he raises awareness in an effort to coun- ter the tactics of fear mongering. Continuing, he writes, \"The supersti-tious fear engendered by bacteriologists, aided by shallow and sensational newspaper writers is developing into an instrument of power and possible oppression which health boards, being political bodies, know but too well Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material 39ForewordPreface Introduction how to manipulate to their own advantage.\" (Hodge, 1912, 173) Hodge had not always been of this opinion. The germ theory that Robert Koch hatched was completely acceptable by Hodge when he first became a doc-tor. In his own words, I was confidently assured by my parents and teachers that every- body who had been once vaccinated was thereby rendered forev-er afterward proof against smallpox infection. From my earliest recollection I had confided in the Jennerian rite more implicitly than in my clerical tenet or religious creed. I never entertained the slightest doubt as to the alleged value of the vaccine opera-tions, taking everything on trust without any inquiry whatever. (Hodge, 1912, 223) Then, by his own account, he graduated and became a doctor, only to witness the tactics and political maneuverings of Health Boards in their campaign to wholesale vaccination programs to entire populations with-out hesitation. The record shows, in this regard, that when vaccination was adminis- tered to whole cities and enclaves, the unexpected occurred; namely more smallpox outbreaks, such as in western New York State as a case in point. Hodge writes, \"Following the wake of the public vaccinators in that vig-orously conducted vaccination crusade, smallpox of a severe type spread throughout the city of Lockport like wild fire on a prairie until the city was in the throes of a raging epidemic of the dread disease, while it lasted for many months, cost the city thousands of dollars and left a number of deaths to its record.\" Hodge observed an increase in smallpox outbreaks after vaccinations were conducted. He continues his narrative, The Lockport experience was an eye-opener to me. From that time on I studied the subject of vaccination as I should have stud-ied it before and as every physician should study it, with a mind open to conviction; and I became actually appalled on discover-ing how fearfully and how wonderfully I had been deceived and how grossly I had deluded my trustful clients by inflicting this ruinous rite upon them. (Hodge, 1912, 225) This eastern U.S. doctor also wrote prolifically on the subjects of vac- cination and the vivisection practices. His western U.S. colleague, Helen Sayr Gray, ND, weighed into this disclosure with considerable wit and passion. Helen Gray, practicing in Portland, Oregon did not leave behind any published books and only a few precious articles that reveal her witty sense of perception. Like Hodge, Gray was aggrieved by the practices of medical doctors. She describes the confusion in vaccination hype, Doctors, like various other people, are very proficient in appro- priating credit and transferring blame. When death or impaired Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material40 Va c c i n a t i o n an d na t u r o p a t h i c Me d i c i n e health results from vaccination, its advocates have a number of scapegoats that they put the blame on. When a vaccinated per-son contracts smallpox, the doctors say that he was not vaccinat-ed successfully or not recently enough or not prior to exposure, or they reassure and console him by telling him that he would have had a severer or perhaps a fatal case, if he had not been vac-cinated. (Gray, 1912, 382) For Helen Sayr Gray, \"Health is the only immunity against disease.\" (Gray, 1912, 383) For others, the prevention of disease balanced on the needle point of vaccination and was heralded as a triumph of medical sci-ence. The magic potion used in vaccination had more to cover up than make public in Dr. Gray's opinion. What was the composition of the much acclaimed and virtuous vaccine, she wanted to know? Transpar-ency in the vaccination industry, as the documented history of this dimen-sion of medicine reveals, has not ever been a strong trait. Just as con-temporary populations are often oblivious to the adjuvants added to the current vaccine concoction, the lexicon used by the early vaccinationists disguised the overall composition of the vaccine. The Anti-Vaccination League of America did not shy from revealing how vaccines were made nor from demystifying the term, \"pure calf lymph\". The procedure that calves were subjected to is nothing short of criminal. The calf is tied down to an operating table, the stomach is shaved for twelve to fifteen inches square, and about one hundred inci-sions are made. Into these incisions, one drop of glycerinated lymph ... is allowed to drop and is thoroughly rubbed in. Fever sets in, and the animal becomes exceedingly sick. In a few days the vesicles appear, the scabs form. (Anti-Vaccination League of America, 1912, 614) Naturopaths of this era knew about these violent and septic condi- tions, and considered that a vivid imagination and exceptional tolerance were essential in order to believe that vaccines could belong to modern medicine. In fact, many health care professionals from the naturopathic and the allopathic communities considered vaccination to be a process characterized by ignorance and superstition. (Zurmuhlen, 1912, 725) Charles Zurmuhlen, MD asks, \"The whole immoral serum traffic can be summoned up in one sentence: do we improve the healthy human blood by injecting the serum from the blood of half rotten animals into it? Only fools and Allopaths believe that we do!\" (Zurmuhlen, 1912, 726) Each new disease presentation fanned the vaccination debate flames. August Andrew Erz, an Osteopath well known to the Naturopathic com-munity at the time, presented many arguments against vaccination. He attributes adverse effects and new diseases to vaccines. Erz states, Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material 41ForewordPreface Introduction 'Varioloid' is a term invented by the profession to conceal the failures of vaccination, and means smallpox-like. According to the vaccination law no person can rightly have smallpox after vaccination, because vaccination prevents smallpox; but he may have, by kind permission of the profession, varioloid\u2014which is in plain language, smallpox that occurs after vaccination. (Erz, 1913, 835) Erz does not mince words, \"The mitigation theory is but another sub- terfuge, and actually implies another confession that vaccination does not protect. If the prevention theory were true, then no person could possibly ever have smallpox in any form after vaccination.\" (Erz, 1913, 835) August Andrew Erz' 1914 book, The Medical Question, The Truth About Official Medicine and Why We Must Have Medical Freedom ignit- ed even more broadly the ruckus about medical freedom. Others added their voices including politicians and lawyers who collectively informed the public of their legal rights. The Honorable Harry Weinberger of New York, for example, provided explanation and clarity about the extent of power that doctors from the Health Board could exert. Weinberger explains, \"No laws are binding on the human subject which assault the body or violate the conscience. The right of personal security consists in a person's legal and uninterrupted enjoyment of his life, his limbs, and his reputation.\" (Weinberger, 1914, 393) He cites cases to illustrate how vaccination enforcement was enacted in the States of New York and Mas-sachusetts. \"The only law in New York on the statute-books in reference to vaccination is that, in order to go to school\u2014that is, public school\u2014a child must be vaccinated.\" (Weinberger, 1914, 393) In Massachusetts, fines of five dollars or essentially a bribe to be vaccinated were charged to anyone refusing vaccination. Five dollars does not sound like a lot yet in 1914, this amount represented several days of labour. The Public Health Boards succeeded in cultivating widespread fear among the general public. The fear of being convicted of not comply- ing with the Public Health Boards coincided with the also prevalent and general fear of contagious diseases. The fear of germs helped mold a population to default to compliance towards vaccination. Dr. Katz notes, \"Never the belief in contagion has been so widespread as at the present time so that many people avoid, so much as possible, the contact with sick persons, in order to protect their own dear selves.\" (Katz, 1915, 428) Fear added, many early Naturopaths felt, to weakening the immune sys-tem and making people more susceptible. Echoing the concern of his naturopathic colleagues, Katz reiterates the counsel of Hippocrates, who \"advised to be moderate in working, eating, drinking, sleeping and love, in such time, for a sober life gives the best protection against the so-called contagious diseases.\" (Katz, 1915, 428) Charles Zurmuhlen, MD cites Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material42 Va c c i n a t i o n an d na t u r o p a t h i c Me d i c i n e Hippocrates too, iterating in his writing and to his patients that living within the laws of Nature was essential for one to have a healthy immune system. Drugs and vaccines did not fit under the category of Nature or abide to natural laws, he felt. Elsewhere, Charles Zurmuhlen, MD raises questions of the vaccines produced to prevent diphtheria. He ponders, \"Why is the serum from the blood of horses suffering from natural diphtheria not a specific for diph-theria? Diphtheria is not a natural disease in horses; it must be produced by the artificial and unnatural method of injecting the bacillus of diphthe-ria into them.\" (Zurmuhlen, 1916, 537) Zurmuhlen next juxtaposes the flawed and irrational disease theory with the naturopathic adherence to natural laws. He warns that with the research efforts by the Rockefeller Institute on serums and vaccines, people may well come to disregard their habits of living. He concludes, \"It teaches men that they can sin with perfect impunity for the serums manufactured under the methods of the Institute render men immune against disease.\" (Zurmuhlen, 1916, 541) While the focus of regular medicine was on finding the next vaccine and serum, Naturopaths returned to the baseline of Nature. In \"The Crime of the Century\", Dr. E. D. Titus reminds readers that \"the only way to prevent disease is to remove the cause through sanitary condi-tions, exercise and good wholesome food\". (Titus, 1917, 130) He con-tinues, \"But these things the political doctor secretly fights.\" (Titus, 1917, 130) In the same article, he points out the value of fermented foods, \"It has been demonstrated that bacterial milk will relieve pain and suffering in certain stomach and intestinal troubles where other known remedial agents have failed.\" (Titus, 1917, 131) Then, Titus concludes his article with a discussion of the political doctors who seemed to be in positions of control. He writes, \"The only way for [the political doctor] to secure this control is to advocate government control of everything in sight.\" (Titus, 1917, 132) Titus is referring to the American Medical Associations and coined the term, \"Medical Mafia\" to describe the A.M.A.'s deliberate efforts to monopolize the practice of medicine by excluding any group who threatened their dominance. The historical record shows that the A.M.A.'s often brutal political ambitions spread to its research centers. The A.M.A.'s resolution to be the determining force for medicine in Amer- ica corresponded to its public efforts to master the threat of disease. In a lecture delivered at the 21 st Annual Convention of the Ameri- can Naturopathic Association held in New York City, William Bradshaw addresses the subject of \"vivisection as a means of finding cures for dis-eases\". (Bradshaw, 1917, 328) Vivisection was a practice employed by the Allopaths confining animals in laboratories for the experimentation in the pursuit of discovering new cures. As referenced earlier in this volume, Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material 43ForewordPreface Introduction the horrific truth of vivisection was as repulsive to Naturopaths as com- pulsory vaccination. The two were tangentially intertwined, though, and each of these triggered a public outcry. Bradshaw quotes Dr. Woglom of Columbia University, the head of a cancer research laboratory, who, in a lecture on the subject of Cancer and Experimental Research, stated that \"over two million animals had been destroyed under circumstances of great cruelty, to find the cause and cure for cancer, but nothing of the kind had ever been discovered, and if anyone said that he had found a cure for cancer through animal experimentation, that man was a liar.\" (Bradshaw, 1917, 328) One laboratory which caught the attention of Naturopaths was that of Dr. Simon Flexner, the director of the Rockefeller Institute and brother of the author of the Flexner Report which benchmarked medical schools in North America in the very early part of the last century. Simon Flex-ner was an avid vaccinationist and despised the Naturopaths for what he considered to be their lack of science. Flexner had developed a serum to fight infantile paralysis, making claims that his serum was 80% effective. In fact, his serum was a complete failure. Bradshaw recounts his encoun-ters with Flexner and others bent on deluding the public about the real statistics and facts of serum failures. The concern was that those familiar with science learned to manipulate research data to produce the desired outcomes. This, the early Naturopaths and sympathetic Allopaths con-tended, was the way Flexner used science to cover his failures. In any case, failure to achieve protective immunity with vaccina- tion became a veritable battle cry of Naturopaths. As the debate and the record of problems accumulated, Lust wanted to address concerns of medical tyranny in the form of compulsory vaccination even more fully. He created a new column which he introduced in the Herald of Health and Naturopath called \"Department of Medical Freedom\" edited by Dr. Gilbert Bowman in the November/December issue in 1917. Bowman is irascible with rage and has left us with a factual and informative article on the subject of compulsory vaccination in the American military. Bow-man writes, Let it be understood that, because of the absolute control of the military and naval affairs by the Medical Trust, every soldier, sailor, marine or airman, is required to submit to vaccination and to an injection of anti-typhus serum as soon as he enlists or is called to service, and as often thereafter as the medical officers may decree.\" (Bowman, 1917, 373) He continues, \"Should any soldier, sailor, airman or marine, refuse to submit to the treatment, he is promptly court-martialed for insubor- dination, the punishment for which is a prison term of probably one or two years.\" (Bowman, 1917, 373) Generally, it is thought that the most Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material44 Va c c i n a t i o n an d na t u r o p a t h i c Me d i c i n e fit and healthy enlist into military duty. Indeed, Bowman reminds us to \"keep in mind the fact that our army, navy and marine corps are made up of picked men; men who have been obliged to pass a rigid test of physi-cal fitness before they could begin admittance to the service.\" (Bowman, 1917, 374) However, Bowman leaves a trail of statistics of mortality and morbidity that is dizzying to comprehend. The American military experi-enced a devastating toll of its soldiers and marines as a result of complica-tions and adverse reactions to vaccinations. The failure of the smallpox vaccines was compounded by the emergence of new diseases in military populations, such as, tetanus, following a smallpox vaccination. Oscar Beasley draws to our attention that tetanus naturally \"exists in soil and in hay, and in the alimentary canal, the hair, and the manure of the calf. We can easily realize, therefore, that the very origin of vaccine virus is in an environment of tetanus.\" (Beasley, 1918, 70) The uncer-tainty of vaccination manufacturing and the diseases that accompanied smallpox vaccination left many to resist vaccination. Beasley comments, \"Meanwhile, many hundreds of thousands of children had been inocu-lated with the vile stuff, and what disease is left in its train is not known.\" (Beasley, 1918, 72) During WWI, 9 million people died. The Spanish Flu of 1918 brought WWI to the abrupt end in 1918, killing an estimated 35 to 50 million people worldwide. The Spanish Flu demonstrated that infectious diseases presented suddenly and were deadly and merciless. Significantly, the Spanish Flu presented early in America at Fort Riley, Kansas, at Camp Funston. A major troop staging and hospital camp in Etaples, France, it is alleged, became a major catalyst arena for this devastating pandemic. Back in America, the Allopaths used epidemics such as the Spanish Flu to foster fear and to promote their \"Germ Theory\". \"Dover's powder, a preparation of ipecac and opium\" (Havard, 1918, 865) was the golden standard of care by Allopaths and the thousands treated by this route became the horrible statistics that we associate with the Spanish Flu. In an editorial, \"Influenza, Immunization\" written by William Free- man Havard at the zenith of the horrific and deadly Spanish Flu, we are exposed to alarming statistics. Allopaths lost patients and Naturopaths didn't. In fact, Naturopaths lost less than 1% and Allopaths as high as 80%. What differentiated their treatment protocols? Allopaths used drugs and experimented with serums and vaccines. The Naturopaths, on the other hand, administered baths, wet sheet wraps and fasted patients. And always lying at the core of naturopathic care is the belief that life style habits determined our health. Havard affirms, Natural immunity is with the individual who has a pure blood stream and such cannot be maintained or acquired on a diet of Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material 45ForewordPreface Introduction animal foods, white bread, devitalized sugar, pastry, coffee, tea, alcohol and tobacco with bad air, overindulgence and lack of exercise as side partners of bad diet.\" (Havard, 1918, 867) Havard, a student of Henry Lindlahr and Louis Kuhne, adhered to the doctrine that morbid matter accumulated over time would result in symp-toms of disease. He adds, Since the war we have had a splendid opportunity to study the action of serums for never before have they been administered in so many varieties and such great quantities. Procure this false immunity from one form of reaction and it takes another form. The serums themselves are an added encumbrance. (Havard, 1918, 867) The various serums and vaccines that Havard alludes to spawned a rash of diseases and unexpected epidemics. E. H. Judkins, M.D. cites, \"Recent epidemics of foot and mouth disease started from a vaccine virus. (Bureau Animal Industry, 147, Farmer's Bulletin, No. 666) Infan- tile Paralysis followed vaccination; and serums to cure that, as in one city hospital, caused 14 out of 15 deaths!\" (Judkins, 1919, 201) Other diseases implicated with vaccination included the dreaded cancer. Jud-kins exclaims, \"Besides pus cocci and bacteria of skin of cow, calf and horse are more or less mixed with all vaccine; and the cell of these ani-mals grows nine times to one of human; hence, Drs. Snow and Bell show seven-tenths of all cancer and consumption is caused by vaccine serums, a 225 percent increase in cancer (New York) causing 80,000 deaths, and 2,500,000 consumptives in this country.\" (Judkins, 1919, 200) Perhaps Judkins is hyperbolic in his statements; even so, the fact of the matter is that in industrialized nations chronic diseases, obesity rates of over 60%, and cancer have not decreased with the advances made in medical science, including refinements in the production and dissemination of vaccines. Per Nelson counsels us in his 1920 article: \"Look around in any com- munity and what will you find? You will find hundreds, yes, thousands of so-called incurables or chronics: men, women and children.\" (Nelson, 1920, 78) Nelson could be speaking of the 21 st century but he is referring to a century ago. His article is poignant and masterful as he encapsulates in his article, \"Naturopathy versus Medicine\" many of the issues, strengths and weaknesses of Naturopathy and Allopathy. Henry Lindlahr had the gift of articulating with astute clarity the heart of Naturopathy. Nelson, also a gifted writer, had astounding insights that are enduring. These authors have left behind clinical pearls that deserve our attention. Nelson was not convinced by the infallible arguments that medicine gave for their drugs and vaccines. Nelson challenges us to think, writing, \"Germs are supposed to be equally dangerous to each and every one of Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material46 Va c c i n a t i o n an d na t u r o p a t h i c Me d i c i n e us, and no matter how strong and healthy we are, if it should happen that they get into our systems, they will at once begin to raise 'cane' with us, especially so if we haven't had all of the 59 varieties of artificial anti-toxins injected into our blood.\" (Nelson, 1920, 78) Per Nelson unravels the germ theory using scientific writings of his day to reveal the flaws and misinformation. He cites the work of a Cana-dian physician, John B. Fraser who showed that drinking a potion con-taining the Klebs-Loffler bacilli (diphtheria) did not have the expected results. Nelson recounts, \"The first test was whether the Klebs-Loffler bacilli would cause diphtheria, and about 50,000 were swallowed with-out any result; later 100,000, 500,000, and a million more were swal-lowed and in no case did they cause any ill-effect.\" (Nelson, 1920, 134) His article is poignant and masterful as he encapsulates in his article many of the issues, and weaknesses of the germ theory that forms the founda-tion of allopathic medicine. The issue of vaccination gave the Allopaths strong bidding powers in their efforts to mobilize and consolidate legislation to empower them with unilateral powers. Fear of disease was convincing and easy to convey to politicians that Allopaths were the only qualified doctors to contend with contagion and disease. In reaction, Naturopaths, Physical Culturists and other allied Drugless therapists rallied to take a position against the efforts of the Allopaths under the banner of medical freedom. One such person, Bernarr Macfadden was incensed that the A.M.A. had succeeded in championing seven bills in Washington. He called the drugless com-munity together to take a stand, \"If we do not defeat these bills we will deserve to die in the festering puss of the vaccination and serum poisons which these monopolistic doctors maintain is the accredited method of treating all disease.\" (Macfadden, 1920, 405) Another prominent voice was Alfred Russel Wallace, referenced earlier for his work on the Royal Commission on vaccination in Eng-land, a scientist who embraced the task of understanding the dilemma of vaccinations. In his amusing yet brilliant article, \"The 'Unvaccinated' Death Rate\", Wallace examines the statistics in England to determine how vaccinations affected the death rate of smallpox. He cites once again the example of Leicester but also includes \"Nelson and cases of smallpox without a death\". (Wallace, 1921, 137) Essentially he destroys the claims that medical doctors contend that unvaccinated people have higher mortality than those choosing vaccina-tions. He illuminates the scam, When we consider all the sources of error to which we have allud- ed we are led to conclude that the difference in fatality between the vaccinated and unvaccinated smallpox patients is not as great Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material 47ForewordPreface Introduction as is sometimes contended, and that so far as it exists it cannot be merely to the effect of vaccination, while the fact that the fatality of all cases lumped together is practically the same now as it was in the unvaccinated of last century, when large numbers are taken for comparison, strongly suggests that of the inclusion of a large contingent of vaccinated persons has not exerted a mitigating effect on the average fatality of the whole. (Wallace, 1921, 138) During this entire tumultuous period, Naturopaths, Allopaths and others continued to submit articles against vaccination to Lust's jour- nals. In the early 1920s, Dr. Lust publishes segments of Dr. Louis Simon Katzoff, MD's views of vaccination. Katzoff writes \"Vaccination never did prevent smallpox.\" He continues, \"Upon observation and reflection I soon realized that smallpox is an illness which has its origin in filth that it follows closely upon flagrant violations of the laws of hygiene and sanitation.\" (Lust, 1922, 230) Katzoff recognized that without address-ing hygiene, diseases would continue to be problems despite the advent of vaccines. Another statement from Katzoff is only too familiar: \"The occurrences of epidemics or scares have coincided with periods of fatigue, anxiety and fear.\" (Lust, 1922, 230) New vaccines came on the market and without delay reports of their entry and possible dangers were published. One such report comes from the London and Provincial Anti-Vivisection Society of England, disclos-ing the hidden dangers of the Schick Test for Diphtheria. The major fear was exposing \"perfectly healthy persons ... to the dangers of successive inoculations for a disease which they may never contract.\" (London and Provincial Anti-Vivisection Society, 1923, 124) Several children died in Texas as a result of receiving this vaccine, details of which disaster were presented in the House of Commons in England to make a case against the use of this new vaccine. The fear of the dangers that drugs and vaccines presented was indeed a recurring and incremental message from the early Naturopaths. Drugs and vaccines didn't heal disease, they insisted, and in their growing prac-tices, Naturopaths certainly did not use them. Benedict Lust in the final article included in Vaccination and Naturopathic Medicine, wrote \"Fal- lacy of Drugs\". He states definitively that drugs are no substitute for abiding Nature's laws. Lust quotes Henry Lindlahr in this seminal piece: \"Almost every virulent poison known to man is found in allopathic pre-scriptions.\" (Lust, 1923, 579) Vaccines and drugs hold out the promise of health and yet, that is not always the results. Lust continues to warn strongly about the dangers of drug therapies, In view of what our foremost medical authorities say as to the worthlessness of drugs in the treatment of disease, how strange Copyrighted Material Copyrighted Material48 Va c c i n a t i o n an d na t u r o p a t h i c Me d i c i n e it is that any number of people will continue to believe that they can abuse their organs until they cease to function normally, and then when they are worn out make them over with drugs or have new ones to replace them. (Lust, 1923, 580) Naturopathy as seen from the eyes of Benedict Lust did not include drugs or vaccines. Lust placed his faith in Nature. Nature and Naturopathy had much more in common that the roots of these word origins. Lust reminds us: Health is the most precious heritage of man. It can be had by strict observance of and obedience to the law of his being, and in no other way. The body of man is governed by Natural Law, which is just as positive in its operation and requirement as the man-made law governing the mechanism of a watch. No man can violate this unfailing and unalterable law of Nature, which is older than the race itself, and expect to escape suffering the pen-alty by simply swallowing some poison drug. (Lust, 1923, 580) Naturopathy began as a movement to restore people's understanding of the power of Nature to enhance and assure health. The early Natur- opaths encouraged their patients always to live according to Nature's laws. What were these laws? Simply, as this early literature reminds us over and over again, to eat healthy food, drink pure water, breathe fresh air, exercise in Nature, sleep adequate hours, practice hygiene and choose a meaningful and moral life. The early Naturopaths treated infectious diseases with conviction and success, abiding by these principles. They restored patients to a wholesome diet; applied water applications; coun-seled patients to adopt sanitary practices, and witnessed their patients recover. Before the proliferation of poly-pharma and the monetizing of treatment around drugs, Naturopaths practiced with confidence and certi-tude. Their teachers, Priessnitz, Kneipp and Kuhne, laid a foundation for success which is as valuable today as a century ago. What is most valuable is our recognizing in these voices from a cen- tury ago, in their own words, the familiar debates of today, attesting to how the fundamental issues surrounding vaccination theory and practice have not subsided. Notwithstanding contemporary claims about safety, efficacy and epidemiological data, the issue is very much with us still. Naturopathic principles and practice continue to be a powerful response to this persistent health dilemma.
