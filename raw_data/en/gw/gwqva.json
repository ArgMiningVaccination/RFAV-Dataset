Health Analysis 4Innovative solutions for healthcare challenges European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, Vytenis Andriukaitis spoke at eHealth week in Riga about how digital applications are integral to tackling today's health challenges in Europe... When I started as a practising medical doctor, we kept hand written health records and had face to face consultations. There was no other way. But this has been changing ever since.Digital applications and digital solutions are part of our daily lives - including in the area of healthcare. It is now common for health records to be kept electronically. Patients' health information can beshared between health professionals in no time regardless of geographic location. Remote consultations with a doctor over the Internet facilitate access to care, save resources and pave the way for telemedicine and tele healthcare services across and within borders. eHealth products and services are contributing to prevention, health risk management, and thus to more sustainable healthcare. It also generates incomeand jobs, while oering high-level technology solutions to healthy people, patients and doctors. eHealth also creates many possibilities for overcoming today's challenges in Europe's healthcare sector.First, there is an increase in health risk factors such as alcohol, smoking, malnutrition which are badly managed, thus causing chronic diseases and premature deaths due to the lack of prevention. Second, the number of people with chronic diseases is predicted to continue to rise which will put even more pressure on healthcare services. Already today, the costs of chronic diseases account for 70-80% of total healthcare costs in the EU. Third, another challenge is Europe's ageing population.The Europeans aged over 65 years already represent 17% of the total European population. This number will nearly double by 2060. All of these challenges scream for innovative solutions - eHealth can oer them.eHealth can empower people with risk factors and patients - we have to act in both cases. \"With the establishment of the eHealth Network, Member State authorities can take the lead in Europe's activities on eHealth. I have no doubt that the eHealth Network will continue fulfilling its mission to the maximum. \" There is huge potential in using eHealth tools to help prevent diseases and to promote good health. New solutions such as mobile health apps can enable people to actively engage in their own health management for instance by tracking their tness or by monitoring their health status. Apps can invite people to take part in screening programmes or inform about promotion campaigns. These solutions are already becoming increasingly popular and the market for them is growing rapidly. Of course, this requires a shift how we organise healthcare systems, to focus more on prevention and promotion, rather than on cure.And, it poses regulatory and other challenges. It is not easy to nd the right balance between quality, safety and condentiality issues and maintaining suciently low barriers for innovation. Indeed, this is a dynamicADJACENT GOVERNMENT Health Analysis 5market where we need to support European SMEs and start-ups. In this context, the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing plays a dening role in pushing for innovative solutions from idea to market, and to deployment across Europe. The Partnership is bringing new solutions to practice, helping millions of EU citizens to continue to lead healthy, active and independent lives as theygrow older. The Partnership is also contributing to the sustainability of our health and social care systems. It is creating new opportunities for businesses ineHealth and the broader silver economy.It is the right momentum and scale-up such innovative approaches to serve citizens in ever greater numbers. To succeed we need to exploit and incorporate technological developments into our healthcare systems and improve their interoperability. I am keen to ensure that the Commission is monitoring the functioning of health systems in the Member States including the implementation of eHealth applications. This will enable us to identify and - where appropriate - recommend actions. I also believe that thanks to eHealth there is a scope to further integrate primary and secondary care in securing early diagnosis and timely treatment. Vytenis Andriukaitis, Commissioner for Health and Food SafetyADJACENT GOVERNMENT Health Analysis 6Health promotion through eHealth tools oers a cheaper solution to prevent or to manage chronic diseases. Already, in many parts of Europe, diabetic patients are monitoring their blood sugar, transmitting theinformation electronically to their doctors. The care for their condition is ensured with less eort and at lower cost. We at the Commission are convinced of the benets of eHealth. We are already providing funding opportunities under Horizon 2020 to support research, innovation and cooperation. It also includes targetedmeasures to support innovative SMEs. With the establishment of the eHealth Network, Member State authorities can take the lead in Europe's activities on eHealth. I have no doubt that the eHealth Network will continue fullling its mission to the maximum. \"New solutions such as mobile health apps can enable people to actively engage in their own health management for instanceby tracking their fitness or by monitoring their health status. Apps can invite people to take part in screening programmes orinform about promotion campaigns. \" It has already adopted the Patient Summary guidelines to provide continuity of care and patient safety across borders, and the Guidelines on ePrescription to facilitate the interoperability of electronic prescriptions between Member States. This is a critical step forward - patients will benet from an electronically processed prescription and get the medicine they need when travelling within the EU. A new Joint Action on eHealth - funded by the EU Health Programme - will be launched to provide technical and scientic support to the eHealth Network.Last but not least, the Commission has launched the new Digital Single Market Strategy. This Strategy includes a set of key actions which will be taken at EU level in the coming years to complete the Digital Single Market. Some of these actions, such as reinforcing trust and security in the handling of personal data; actions related to interoperability and standardisation; and supporting an inclusive eSociety, are of particular relevance for eHealth. I am no techie but it is clear to me that we must seize the Digital Single market opportunities to full a vision for healthcare in the 21st century - a vision of a single, universally accessible, sustainable and high quality, eHealth single market for the benet of all European citizens and healthcare professionals. By coming together and by sharing experiences in the Member States and at EU level, we will drive forward the case for eHealth.

The first is a natural process of evolution, yet has been exacerbated by their over use. The second has been driven by the economics of the pharmaceutical industry where it is not profitable to support research and development in this area. There is now conscious thought towards a multi-pronged approach involved in handling the challenge of 'super-bugs' and antibiotic resistance.A fundamental step required for continuous usage of antibiotics focuses on stewardship for use, and of the unnecessary use, of antibiotics. This will require accurate education for the public and healthcare profes- sionals. These efforts should be combined with further funding directed towards discovery-based research. This will result in new defences against the superbugs resistant to our antibiotic regimen presently available. Currently, active research in academia is exploring a wide range of alterna- tives to traditional organic molecule antibiotics including: bacteriophages (viruses against bacteria); isolated bacteriocins and other components of natural bacterial warfare; competitive therapies in which 'good' bacteria are added; amphipathic cationic peptides;and metals, research to which our group has contributed to. In combina- tion with recognising the need for an antibiotic post infection onset, suitable ideas have been directed at preventing the spread. One such concept is the use of antiseptic treatments such as engineering surfaces to inhibit biofilm formation, impregnating materials with antimicrobials, and use of nanotechnologies for targeted antimicrobial delivery. Beyond developing new chemicals, a new structure of thinking is necessary. Rather than recognising a given bacterial species as a 'problem', we need to comprehend why such abacterium proliferates well during infection. There has been rela- tively little focus in thearea of understanding the relationships in a mixed species microbial ecosystem and the ramifications of an antibiotic on its efficacy and the microbial ecosystem balance. As we now appreciate the existence of the microbiome, the entire ecosystem of the animal must be considered for infectious treatments. For example a biofilm, which is composed of sessile bacteria attached to a surface, is found in a state surrounded by an extracellular matrix. It is this matrix, and additional changes in physiological state of the bacteria in the biofilm, that result in robust antimicrobial resistance. Challenge of antibiotic resistance and the promise of metals as antimicrobials 8Our group has been exploring metals as antimicrobial agents over the past decade in order to determine their efficacy at killing super-bugs and per- sister bacteria, and for the prevention or eradication of biofilms. Popular metals with antimicrobial activity include: silver, copper, zinc, and titanium. Essential metals such as zinc, calcium, nickel, copper and others have crucial roles in the biochemistry of living organisms. However in excess these metals are lethal, through various mechanisms, to all organisms. Other metals such as silver, mercury,PROFILE and tellurium, which are nonessential for life, demonstrate greater toxicity at lower concentrations than essential metals. The antimicrobial activity of both essential and non-essential metals has been exploited for several purposes, much longer than traditional microbe derived antibiotics. \"There is now conscious thought towards a multi- pronged approach involved in handling the challenge of'super-bugs' and antibioticresistance. \" Presently, metallic antimicrobial com- pounds are consumed for a variety of applications in agriculture and medicine and are widely accessible as commercial products. Copper is used as an antimicrobial and antifungal agent in addition to an animal feed additive. Copper can also be found in consumer products such as bedding, for the control dust mites and for the treatment of athlete's foot by inclusion into socks. The EPA has already registered several copper-containing products as supplements to standardinfection protocols in healthcare settings. Silver has certainly taken the stage seeing use as an antimicrobial topical agent in the treatment of burns. We also see silver impregnated into bandages, coated catheters and other medical devices as well as in bedding, towels, clothing, water filters, toothpaste, air purifiers, and homeo- pathic medicine. Additional examples include: zinc in toothpaste, shampoo and topical creams; tin in toothpaste; bismuth used to treat digestive issues and diarrhoea; and even mercury, which can be found as a preservative in eye drops.Although metals are exceptionally effective antimicrobial agents, a fun- damental concern is what happens to the metal after it has completed its role as an antimicrobial agent. As a result of metal persistence in the host (human or animal) or accumulation within the target bacteria, release into the environment upon death of the organism will eventually occur. When used in clothing or laundering, the washed out metals are transported through the drain and not cleared using current wastewater treatment processes. Furthermore, some water treatment facilities are now usingcopper and or silver. Such use leads to accumulation of metals in rivers and lakes. These examples, and others,might lead to ecological toxic disasters we now associate with industry drainage and mining. The natural exposure of bacteria to metals is a process that has occurred for millennia and continues to occur. This exposure has driven the evolu- tionary capability of metal resistance in select micro-organisms to date. Some mechanisms include reduction in permeability or uptake, alteration of target sites, chemical modification, efflux of the metal ions, and detoxifi- cation - comparable to antibiotic resistance. The resistance of micro- organisms to metals might be regarded as of little importance due to their limited use in human and veterinary medicine to date, nonetheless their historical use in agriculture provides a reservoir of resistance. The use of antimicrobials in both agri- culture and medicine has contributed to the progression of microbial resistance. While we can continue toRaymond J.

Postponing the emergence of metals as antimicrobials may lessen thedevelopment of resistance, however, the commercial widespread access of antimicrobial metals to the public has formally prevented this action. We must re-evaluate the use of metals for non-medical purposes before the presence of multidrug resistance outgrows this potential alternative. PROFILE eHealth in health services and systems Dr Joan Dzenowagis from the eHealth Unit at the World Health Organization (WHO) outlines how eHealth is making an impact in countries worldwide...ADJACENT GOVERNMENT Health Analysis 10Ten years ago the World Health Organization's (WHO) governing body, the World Health Assem- bly, recognised that eHealth was transforming health services and systems around the world, andurged Member States to plan for appropriate eHealth services in their countries 1. The digital economy was already a reality, and its continued growth over the past decade has further expanded the opportunities for health. On the broader development agendaeHealth is now seen as a driver, as well as a beneciary of development, innovation and economic growth. Today eHealth is making an impact in every country.From the local to the national level, information and communication technologies (ICT) in health, or eHealth, is changing how health care is delivered and howhealth systems are run. It supports critical functionsby improving the ability to gather, analyse, manage and exchange information in all areas of health, from research on molecular genetics to large-scale humani-tarian interventions. In health systems, ICTs are being used to improve the timeliness and accuracy of public health reporting and to facilitate disease monitoringand surveillance. They are fundamental in distance learning, and in enabling rapid response in emergen- cies. The strategic use of eHealth can support sector- wide planning as well as coordinating decentralised district health systems, and improving the ability to plan, budget and deliver services. Since the rst global survey on eHealth in 2005, WHO's Global Observatory for eHealth has documented the trends worldwide. Its adoption has continued to accelerate as stakeholders such as governments, industry, academia and others increasingly depend on it to conduct the daily business of health. Morerecently the rapid global uptake of mobile technologies has opened important opportunities in public healthand clinical practice to reach patients, health professionals and the public when and where needed. As health systems face stringent economic challenges, greater demands for eciencies and higher expectations from citizens there is a need to provide more care and better care to more people, especially those most in need. The use of eHealth is now understood to be central to this eort. However, there are social, economic and other barriers that aect a country's ability to take advantage of digital opportunities. To make eHealth a reality, countries must tackle a number of challenges at the national level. These include planning for and building infrastructure, deploying services and applications, developing a capable health workforce, ensuring asound legal and regulatory environment and improv- ing governance, standardisation and interoperability. The days of pilot projects are waning as governments move towards strategic, integrated planning and sustainable nancing mechanisms to enable solid foundations for investment and change. WHO has long recognised the need for a systematic, practical approach that aligns the many stakeholders in eHealth around a national vision and strategy. Towards that end, sustained commitment, investment and political will are as important as ever. Legal andethical issues must be addressed to ensure that everyone benets. Leadership and engagement arecritical, as well as a long-term view to develop the potential of eHealth in regards to a country's economic context and needs. Health systems will need to develop new ways to test and adopt innovationsthat create value for patients and society, but which may not match the short time horizons for return on investment that now characterise our approaches. Beyond the technical challenges of implementingADJACENT GOVERNMENT Health Analysis 11eHealth at the national level, it will be critical in the coming years to ensure that cross-border, regional and international eorts in eHealth work in harmony, and that all governments build their capacity to engage in this area. \"The adoption of eHealth has continued to accelerate as stakeholders such as governments, industry, academia andothers increasingly depend on it toconduct the daily business of health.\" WHO provides guidance to countries, to understand how ICT can support health goals and in dening a comprehensive strategy development process to go forward. Public policymakers often need a much better understanding of the main components of eHealth and how to plan for its adoption. The process of strategy development encourages the active participation of a wide range of stakeholders, public and private, towards achieving a shared goal of lasting progress in public and individual health. The case for adopting information and communication technologies has been evident for over a decade. However, it has often taken a crisis in the health sector to move eHealth from the periphery to thecentre of strategic health planning. Today, many countries are poised to take the next step: developing national eHealth strategies, building capacity, engaging in collaborations and striving to ensure public owner- ship, trust and condence in eHealth for the Organization (WHO) www.who.int/en Creating digital possibilities for healthcare In an article, Federal Health Minister Hermann Gr\u00f6he, details the introduction of the electronic health card, the digital possibilities of telemedicine and the proposed e-health law...ADJACENT GOVERNMENT Health Analysis 12On January 1, the electronic health card nally replaced the old insurance card. For now, it is like a sports car, which lurks in the garage on its use. We nally need information highways so that the electronic health card can show what it can do, as it is an important step towards the digital age ofhealthcare. It brings something forward, what we urgently need, but do not have much: networking! It is a paradox: Almost all surgeries and hospitals usedigital data at a high level. But the transfer of this data is often still in the analogue age. Digitalisation must and will come. If we do not tackle it now, we will later run into problems after the development. Losing time now is a costly endeavour and harms everyone - in every respect. Digital networking does not only mean faster communication and greater economic eciency, for the most tech-savvy nerds or costs xed manager, it's about tangible medical benets. An example of thepotential of the health card, which today lies idle but we nally want to open, with electronic, callable emergency data to the physician would provideimportant information in the future which is immedi- ately available. This can save lives! We need more networking, but not just in emergencies. In Germany, unfortunately more people die by adverse drug reactions than on the road. A digital overview of theprescribed drugs can be a real step forward, especially for the elderly and people living alone. We are just beginning to exploit the opportunities of the digital age in the health sector. However, I want more to happen quicker. For years, the electronic health card has been blocked and delayed by many sides. It makes no sense to stem the digitisation of healthcare. It is better to make this process construc-tively, and where necessary, also critically. I expect,doctors, hospitals, the entire self-government, and the industry to keep their promises and support the progress of the electronic health card with all their strength. I do not understand that blockers appear on the scene again and try to stop the great progress into the digital age of health care with specious arguments. It is wrong, that it is not enough given privacy. The opposite is the case. The structure of the telematics infrastructure meets the highest safety standards: There is clear access rights, the access of doctors to data is logged, and health insurance companies are Hermann Gr\u00f6he, Federal Health MinisterADJACENT GOVERNMENT Health Analysis 13obliged to provide information. Medical data is encrypted twice, the patient can also delete data - and unauthorised access leads to criminal prosecution.Above all, the relationship of trust between doctor and patient remains untouched. For me, the following applies: Eective data protection and health care inthe digital age is of paramount importance. Digital networking is a driver of medical progress. It is fascinating to see what is possible through telemedicine. For example, if someone has a stroke an expert is already available in the emergency room via video- conference for the treatment, and is placed directly above played computed tomography images of the patient within a few seconds. This ensures that the expert can help the patient quickly and eciently along with the doctor. It overcomes telemedicine spa- tial barriers, especially for rural areas that will be in the future of the utmost importance. Networking, telemedicine, new therapies and privacy protection - this is the digital revolution in thehealthcare sector. Whoever denies this step out of selshness, harms the interest of the public. This iswhy the \"e-health law\" that we now bring, has a simple principle: Who blocks, pays. The central actors of self-government - in particular the accredited physicians' associations and the central association of statutory health insurance - get periods to which they must achieve specied results. Cannot be sent, they have to take nancial cuts in purchasing. Only then can we take pace. Nevertheless, it is not about what istechnically feasible. But, it is important that we use alltechnical possibilities to ensure that the medical progress all patients really benet. This is an article that was used from permission of the Minister's of- ce. It was rst published in Minister Federal Ministry of Health www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de Transnational leadership programme between Germany and Canada 14PROFILE Background The many challenges in health care today create a special need for advanced effective leadership strate- gies (Stoller 307 -28; 876-78). Leader- ship development in healthcare includes principles of competency- based development, interdisciplinary, team learning and continuous assessment (Leatt and Porter 14-31). Progressive health systems that invest in leadership development for the entire senior management team will have the more significant return on investment in terms of organisationaleffectiveness (Leatt and Porter 14-31). There have been a range of networks and programmes develop related to education involving specific aspects of healthcare such as technology assess- ment (Kristensen et al. 107-16) and interprofessional education (Liaskos 107-16). Additionally, a range of pedagogical strategies have been proposed (Wilkerson and al. 414-21). One of the mostinnovative to date has been the AFWI 1, which is provided a contemporary approach to the translation and mobil- isation of scientific knowledge into practice an the Transnational leader-ship Programme (TNLP) (Bomke 66-69).Method Once established, the international relationship initiated a three-year pro- gramme implementation phase. This phase required identification of partici- pants, definition of roles, curriculum outline, timelines, processes, objectives and goals. In situ across the programme a continuous reflective process was enacted for the purpose of feedback and goal correction at each step. The implementation process involved three international excursions and a summa- tive symposia. Results The programme was well accepted within the health service networks of both countries. Participants were able to use the programme to enhancelocal projects designed to innovate and improve service delivery, which were component prerequisites and goals of their roles in the leadership programme. Furthermore, the inter-national context was identified as a highly useful and novel learning space. While all aspects of the project were conducted in English, the fact that English was not the first language for half the group resulted in the sim- plification of concepts and principles that were to be communicated withinand between groups and within and between the different professions of the participants. Last but not least, the programme is the base of the ongoing prevention-initiative in the palatine region, called \"Die PfalzIncreasing Innovation through Leadership in public funded Expert-Organisations -Finding a road to resilience... macht itself/you -building a road to resilience). Resilience is not only a matter of each individual it must be realized on all social levels (Bomke, Kendall-Taylor and Cawthorpe 2014; Bomke and Kendall- Taylor 2014). Enterprises, schools and communities should also promote mental health as a preventive measure and network their activities. So the group around the Pfalzklinkum uses a socio-ecological and multi-agencey approach. Together with experts from medicine, health, work and social policy the initiative looking for ways to promote a sustainable change towards prevention in the health system in the Palatinate and are cooperating closely with international initiatives, such as the Centre for Early Child Develop- ment, Blackpool and the think tank Framework Institute, Washington, D.C. The vision is to build a resilient Palati- nate until 2025 where mental health will be high on the citizens', enterprises' and politicians' agenda. Conclusions 1 The requirement to simplify language in the international context was directly related to the ability to simplify language and concepts in the communication of innovation within the responsible organisation. 2 The international context also highlighted leadership is a learning process related to both others and the self. 3 The international context provided an atmosphere that was directly related to the ability of participants to identify foci for innovation, strengths and weaknesses within their own organisations. 4 The long-term nature of the pro- gramme was a cornerstone of its success in relationship to partici- pants' realising their organisational goals and objectives and to improve the social skills of the participants.

The Irish health and social care system is undergoing a signicant reformprogramme, with a focus on modernising the health infrastructure including the development of a newnational children's hospital; progressing universalhealthcare with the introduction of GP services without fees to the under-6s and the over 70s; developing new strategies for maternity care andcancer, pursuing innovative funding models, and a range of reforms to improve patient outcomes and patient safety. Driving the Healthy Ireland agenda is one of the 5 priority areas. This agenda is focussed on implemen- tation of the government-led, multifaceted frameworkto improve the health and wellbeing of the populationpublished in 2013. Drawing on international policy approaches such as World Health Organization (WHO) Europe's Health 2020, Healthy Ireland seeks to moreeectively address the key lifestyle behaviour issues which result in ill health and chronic disease as well as the social and environmental determinants of healthand wellbeing, through a 'whole of government' and 'whole of society' approach. Under the Healthy Ireland agenda, a number of signicant policies and strategies are being developed and are due for publication over the coming months. These include a rst National Physical Activity Plan jointly developed with the Department of Tourism, Transport and Sport; a new Obesity Policy and Action Plan; a Sexual Health Strategy and a signicant legislative agenda including public health legislation on alcohol and tobacco.Healthy Ireland Framework and implementation The Framework's vision is an Ireland where everyone can enjoy physical and mental health and wellbeing to their full potential, where wellbeing is valued and supported at every level of society and is everyone'sresponsibility. It emphasises the international evidence that a whole-system approach, involving governmentand society, is required to eect sustainable improve- ments in health and wellbeing. The Framework has 4 main goals: Increase the proportion of people who are healthy at all stages of life; Reduce health inequalities; Protect the public from threats to health and wellbeing; Create an environment where every individual and sector of society can play their part in achieving a healthy Ireland. It sets out a range of action areas under themes which include partnerships and cross-sectoral working, empowering people and communities, reform of the health service to ensure a renewed focus on prevention, and building capacity around research, monitoring and evaluation. The implementation of the framework is overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Sector Reform which is chaired by the Taoiseach (Prime Minister). A Cross-Sectoral Group comprising senior ocials from other government departments, as well a range of national agencies relevant to health,ADJACENT GOVERNMENT Health Analysis 17research, environmental protection and local authori- ties supports the cross-sectoral implementation. In addition, a Healthy Ireland Council, consisting of stakeholders from a wide range of sectors and chaired by businessman and former Irish rugby captain KeithWood, has been established to champion the 'whole of society' engagement. It will also act as a platform to connect and mobilise communities, families and individuals into a national movement with one aim: to support everyone to enjoy the best possible health and wellbeing. The rst meeting of the Council in June 2014 was addressed by WHO DG Dr Margaret Chan, who complimented the Framework, saying that it was \" ... a carefully orchestrated and united ght in a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach. Engagement goes from the national level to the local, from the heights of academic research to the grass- roots voices of civil society organisations, who are extremely important, right down to communities and families which is where action will happen\".The Council has published an action plan for 2015, and established a number of subgroups to focus on key areas including communications and health inequalities.We are currently developing a communications strategy for the Council to support their role in engaging with their stakeholder networks and the wider public around the key deliverables such as the forthcoming National Physical Activity Plan. Health challenges in Ireland Ireland's health challenges are not dissimilar fromthose of other countries across Europe. While our population is living longer, people are unfortunately not necessarily leading healthier lives. Ireland consistently records high rates of self-evaluated good health, but as set out in the Healthy Ireland framework, the picture in relation to chronic disease related to poor diet, smoking, alcohol misuse and physical inactivity presents a real clinical, social and nancial challenge. For example, over 60% of Irish adults, and25% of 3-year olds are overweight or obese, and the Minister for Health Leo VaradkarADJACENT GOVERNMENT Health Analysis 18prevalence of chronic conditions and accompanying lifestyle behaviours are strongly influenced by socio- economic status. A new Healthy Ireland Survey which will report later in 2015 will give us an up-to-date picture of the health and wellbeing of the population for the rst timesince the last similar study in 2007. Meeting the Challenges The Healthy Ireland Framework provides the contextfor addressing not only the lifestyle behaviour issueswhich adversely aect health and wellbeing, but also the social determinants and predictors of health and wellbeing. Many of these fall outside the healthsector, e.g. housing, transportation, education, workplaces and environment along with an individual's socio-economic status. In addition, the broad and complex nature of the Framework and the massive change agenda associated with its implementation requires that a critical focus remains on the wider enablers of implementation,such as stakeholder consultation, building a supportive culture, communication and leadership. The initial phase of implementation (2013/14) focussed on: establishing the underpinning architecture and accountability structures and mechanisms; building the capacity of the new Programme set up in the Department to coordinate implementation, and embedding its work in the Department's overall responsibilities and work; establishing and supporting the Health Service Executive (HSE) capacity around health and wellbeingthrough a new Health and Wellbeing Division; identifying and building key strategic relationships and partnerships across a range of cross-sectoral partners.The successful delivery of the priority projects set outfor 2015, in addition to driving a number of cross-sec- toral projects in partnership with other government departments and stakeholders, is the agenda over the next phase of implementation. These include ensuring close alignment with the new national policy framework for children and young people; integrating health and wellbeing into the educational agenda across primary, post-primary, higher and further education; embedding health and wellbeing into new structures and arrangements in local government; and, developing a national 'Healthy Workplaces' initiative across public and private sectors. In addition, the HSE recently published its implementation plan for Healthy Ireland in the Health Services for 2015-2017 which will be the main driver of that strand of implementation. The implementation of Healthy Ireland, as well as the other signicant reforms of our health system, is critical to the future health and wellbeing of our population, which in turn is central to our social and economic recovery and progress. The enormity of the challenge is clear but by taking a collective and collaborative approach across government and society we aim to achieve the critical mass that can generate fundamental changes and make lasting positive impacts on Irish Programme Department of Health www.health.gov.iewww.twitter.com/HealthyIreland www.adjacentgovernment.co.uk/subscribeAdjacent Government is pleased to oer a FREE subscription service to all our products including our regular newsletters.

Depression is common in young people, with around 1 in 20 of those in adolescenceaected. This leads not only to distress for the individual and their family and carers, but also socialand educational impairments. Depression is also amajor risk factor for self-harm and suicide, and there is an association with poor physical health, includingincreased rates of smoking and substance misuse,and obesity. There is a high recurrence rates in adult- hood - young people who experience depression aremore likely to experience an episode in adult life, compared to young people who do not. Adolescent depression is therefore a major clinical problem butthere are treatments available. Everyone's experience of depression is dierent. However, there are common symptoms listed in the diagnostic criteria, such as those of the International Classication of Diseases (ICD-10), published by theWorld Health Organisation (WHO). The criteria for a diagnosis of depression in young people are similar to those in adults, with the core symptoms being depressed mood most of the day and almost everyday, loss of interest or decreased energy. Irritability is also a core symptom in adolescence in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association. Other possible symptoms include: loss of condence, unreasonable or excessive feelings of guilt, change in activity levels (agitated or 'slowed down'), concentration and sleeping diculties, appetite loss/gain and a corresponding change in weight, and self-harm or suicidal thoughts/behaviour. However, the diagnosis is more often missed in adolescents than in adults. This might be because the presentation can be dierent in young people, for example because of the presence of irritability and fluctuating symptoms. The primary presenting problem may not be specic to depression, for example physical symptoms such as pain (especially in younger adoles- cents), a decline in academic performance or social withdrawal. Many young people with depression haveat least one other mental health diculty, which can also complicate the assessment and management. Depression in adolescenceADJACENT GOVERNMENT Health AnalysisADJACENT GOVERNMENT Health Analysis 21There is a range of risk factors for depression in adolescence - including individual, family and social issues. The strongest risk factors are a family historyof depression and exposure to psychosocial stress, such as bullying. Ospring of parents with depression show 3-4 times increased rates of depression compared with ospring of non-depressed parents, although many children of depressed parents do not experience diculties. Usually there is a complex interaction ofthe factors above, although there may not be an obvious reason. The treatment of depression is targeted at the reduction of early and later adversities, modicationof ways of thinking and feeling (such as cognitive behaviour therapy and other psychotherapies), and antidepressant medication in more severe episodes. Prevention strategies focus in particular on a combi- nation of education and psychological approaches. There has also been increasing interest in resilience,which could be dened as better than expected functioning across psychosocial outcomes over time, in the context of a known risk factor (such as a family history of depression). Protective or resilience factors can inform prevention and management approaches. There have been government calls for an emphasison prevention and early intervention of depression,and centres such as the Child and Adolescent Psychia- try Section at Cardi University have led studies in this area. For example over recent years, the 'EarlyPrediction of Adolescent Depression' (EPAD) study aimed to understand the links between parent andchild depression. The study has also looked at protec-tive and resilience factors in relation to adolescent depression. The translational aims of EPAD included increasing awareness, and improving assessment, prediction and monitoring of depression in children and adults. Further to this study, a group within the department is developing an online multimedia package andaccompanying 'app' to help young people with (or at high risk of) depression and their families. This is funded by the National Institute for Health Research(NIHR), and is consistent with the National Institutefor Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for 'Depression in children and young people (Identica- tion and management in primary, community and secondary care'), which were updated earlier in 2015. These stress the need for good information for theyoung person, family and carer and the use of psychosocial interventions which are evidence-based in the initial management. Engaging young people in prevention and early intervention programmes is a major challenge for health and other services, as is improving the identication of depression and its management in this age group.

Currently CATCH-IT is in the third phase of randomised clinical trials, funded by the NIMH. With each phase they have refined their approach to addressing the pressing need for catching depression before itbegins. They developed the primary care/Internet based depression pre- vention intervention (CATCH-IT) andare currently, in this phase comparing this intervention to a control intervention consisting of general health information (Health Education, HE). CATCH-IT is being fielded in a multi-site trial within six major primary care health (and over 30 primary care clinics) systems in Boston and Chicago. They have been able to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing this model in multiple health systems and have to date screened over 4,000 teens from primary care offices. The design of this intervention, that targets adolescents with beginning signs of depression, works within the framework of the recently established United States' Affordable Care Act.The goal is to create a widely available public health strategy to reduce illness and death associated with depression, which is a lifelong illness. This strategy is intended to meet the NIMH call for developing \"new and better interven- tions\" for \"diverse needs and circum- to \"...preempt occurrence of These interventions must: Have broad \"reach\" into at-risk populations; Work outside of traditional mental health systems; Use new technologies; Build on previous clinical trials; Reduce identified disorders/enhance functional outcomes; Addressing Population Health - One Teen at a Time Answering the National Call for Better Mental Health Care... Include families; and Be personalised. While such approaches widely desired, few if any have been successfully implemented at scale in diverse population within actual primary care sites and little is known about whetherbenefits of such interventions may be sustained or which aspects of these complex interventions are most associated with favorable outcomes. Innovation of the Trial Design The innovation of this work lies in its novel approach to addressing population needs. Population based prevention of major, common mental disorders has not been previously been attempted at scale within multiple, complex health systems and 23PROFILE diverse populations. Face-to-face inter- ventions have shown to be effective, however the CATCH-IT intervention represents a paradigm shift. The key innovations of this study include: It is the first of its kind, a public health adolescent depression prevention strategy (low cost, easily disseminated, acceptable and feasible primary care/Internet model), It combines a brief primary care- based motivational program with anInternet-based self-directed Cognitive Behavioral (CBT) and Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) approach to address the key barrier of engage- ment/adherence; It targets both adolescent and parent vulnerability and protective factors in separate interventions, using an ecological model; It is personalised to the presence of parental depression and ethnicity/ culture, key moderators in prior studies; and It uses media based learning strategies including music, videos, and stories to convey learning. \"The goal is to create a widely available public health strategy to reduce illness and death associated withdepression, which is a life- long illness. \" Relational Intensity Necessary to Address Barriers to Implementation Fielding a trial of this nature is not without its difficulties - but the study staff has adapted to both internal and external barriers presented by this trial. The internal barriers are identified asorganisational and behavioral, and the external behaviors as political,economic, and regulatory complexities. These factors work against the imple- mentation process and consequently affect the potential public health ben- efit to the proportion of adolescents at risk for major depression identified through screening in primary care. During the initial run in phase of the clinical trial, the team examined the nature of how they confront barriers to implementation of the study. The themes reflect the considerable, and largely relational intensity of their work, rather than purely traditional practice education and implementation guidance to the primary care sites. This relational intensity was found to be necessary on the part of study staffDr Benjamin Van Voorhees Department of Paediatrics University of Illionois at Chicago College 312 996 8352 bvanvoor@uic.edu www.chicago.medicine.uic.edu/cms/O ne.aspx?portalId=506244&pageId=76 3950members implement the study. Critical factors of implementa- tion have emerged around the need to deepen and broaden relational engagement with the practices so that they would create an environment in which screening could take place of adolescents. The team has considered the impact of the nature of the study- mental health - on the willingness of the practice sites to carry out the study. Because of the less discussed nature of mental illness in society in general, the team works to reflect back to the sites the recognition that the topic of mental illness may be difficult; but the effect of addressing it with teens before it is severe is a great service to individuals and the population at large. Dr. Benjamin Van VoorheesCancer research - 50 years and counting Christopher P. Wild, Director at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) outlines how 50 years on, prevention still remains key to cancer research...ADJACENT GOVERNMENT Health Analysis 24Have you found a cure yet?\" Which cancer researcher upon revealing their profession has not faced this question? One can respond condently with examples of major improvements insurvival: childhood leukaemia, testicular and breast cancers being notable. One can point to remarkableinsights into the previously hidden biology of cancer, with drugs now tailored to exploit the molecular Achilles heel of an individual tumour. These triumphsof scientic creativity and endeavour merit the telling. Yet the disturbing, deeper truth is we cannot treat ourway out of the cancer problem. As people live longer and populations increase, the number of new cancers each year is projected to rise sharply. In 2035, just 20 years from now, there will be an estimated 10 million more people every year facinga cancer diagnosis. Increases are greatest in the devel- oping countries where there is least capacity to treat and care for patients. The spread of risk factors linked to western patterns of individual behaviour and socie- tal structure will exacerbate the problem. Even for the world's richest countries the spiralling cost of cancermeans improved treatment alone is an inadequate response. For the world's poorest, the out-of-pocket expenses of treatment for one individual can be nancially catastrophic for an extended family. The pain of cancer is far reaching. How did we end up here and what might be done better? Fifty years ago, when the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) was established, IARC scientists considered the striking global variations in cancer patterns and decided to study the causes of this heterogeneity as an avenue to prevention. Over the last 5 decades IARC played its part, with many others, in discovering human carcinogens. Tobacco remains the pre-eminent culprit. Chronic infectionsaccount for 16% of all cancers, one in 4 in the mostpopulous nation, China. Alcohol, radiation including excess sunlight, unhealthy diets, environmental con- taminants and occupational exposures all contribute. Imbalances in calorie intake and expenditure are addingto the problem; many people are no longer moving enough to justify the amount they eat and drink. \"The benefits of prevention can take many years to manifest. This is incompatible with the duration of a political mandate (at least in most democracies) but also with the immediacy of people's personal experience, where what is sought is a cure. \" Estimates vary but one can safely conjecture thatsome 40-50% of cancers could be prevented by trans- lating this accumulated knowledge into interventions. Further inroads are made by detection of early-stage cancers or pre-cancerous conditions, combined with more eective treatment e.g. for cervical, breast, colorectal and oral cancers. Furthermore, prevention and early detection demonstrably work. Major declines in lung cancer following reduced tobacco consumption are remarkable as are the falls in cervical cancer following introduction of screening. Improved protection against work place carcinogens form part of the successes. Vaccination against hepatitis B virus and human papilloma viruses will in time yield their fruits. Many interventions have added value through reducingother illnesses of aging such as cardiovascular diseaseand diabetes. Despite proof and promise, prevention is too often neglected. Commonly less than 5% of cancer research funding goes to prevention, a proportion dwarfed bythe investment in basic science and clinical translational research. In addition, the science that is performed\"ADJACENT GOVERNMENT Health Analysis 25too often remains at the stage of proof-of-principle, with a failure to implement. This under-investment in research and in implementation is costly and while the underlying drivers are complex, they merit exploration. Part of the problem may be time. The benets of prevention can take many years to manifest. This is incompatible with the duration of a political mandate(at least in most democracies) but also with the immediacy of people's personal experience, where what is sought is a cure. Economics is important,because while new therapeutics oer opportunitiesfor private sector investment and growth, public health interventions are perceived as cost pressures. Complexity is a further element. Prevention requires a multi-sectoral cooperation across health, transport, environment, etc., to address the \"causes of the causes\". Responsibility has been too often placedsolely on the shoulders of the individual whereas tobacco control has shown how appropriate legislation has been key to success. Nevertheless, this is an exciting time for cancer prevention. Advances in cancer biology oer fresh impetus to studies of causes, early detection and prevention. Implementation research, close to policy,can better indicate factors which help or hinder thetranslation of promising interventions into eective national programmes. Thorough analyses of the economic benets of prevention may yet reduce the unpopularity of the Minister of Health among govern- ment colleagues. Prevention, applied at the populationlevel, oers a sustainable approach contributing in turn to reduced inequalities in society. From a global perspective the necessity of prevention is blindingly obvious. IARC enters its second 50 years with a renewed mandate to conduct cancer research for cancer prevention. As there is an undeniable responsibility to oer the very best in treatments forthe patients of today, there is also an undeniable responsibility to prevent the suering from cancer forthe populations of tomorrow. Perhaps eventually, on revealing one's identity as a cancer researcher to a new generation, the question may just occasionally be:\"Can you Research on Cancer (IARC) www.iarc.fr Emerging from the Swiss-based organisation Reliable Cancer Therapies, founded in 2009 by Belgian entrepreneur Luc Verelst, the Brussels-based Anticancer Fund (ACF)is a private not-for-profit foundation dedicated to expanding the range of treatment options available to patients. It is this central focus on patients which is the common theme that runs through the diverse activities of the ACF - both in terms of its approach to scientific and clinical research andalso in its day-to-day work. While the ACF is a relatively small organisation, employing mainly scientists and med- ical staff, it has an international reach which extends well beyond the borders of Belgium. This manifests itself both in terms of supporting projects world- wide and in making available compre- hensive scientific information to the public in multiple languages. These twin tracks of scientific and public engagement are apparent in the range of ACF projects and activities. Public Engagement The most visible form of public engagement is in the provision of scientifically accurate information to the public via the ACF website (www.anticancerfund.org ). Here patients can find information on current cancer treatments, a gateway to search for clinical trials and information on non- mainstream treatments - includingdietary and lifestyle interventions. Alsoof importance is information on someof the 'alternative' and complementarytherapies that cancer patients may come across. The ACF takes seriously the task of'quack busting', and has been active in exposing the activities of fraudsters who seek to exploit vulnerable cancer patients seeking 'miracle cures'. For example there is a very active group of people in Europe selling a fake cure called GcMAF. The ACF has been active in informing the authorities about the fraudsters, publishing factual infor- mation about GcMAF, and ensuring retraction of a number of fraudulentscientific articles. The ACF is seeking recommendations at the European level on how we can act against fraud- sters operating in different countries. However, the ACFs engagement with the public goes beyond publishingThe Anticancer Fund 26information and extends to direct support for individual patients seeking new options. Since 2010 over 500 patients, primarily from France, Belgium and the Netherlands have used this service. Finally, there is another form of public engagement in which the ACF is becoming increasingly involved and that is public policy intervention - most notably this arises from the ACF research agenda. Scientific Research The ACF believes that as a society we need to ensure that no treatment option is left untapped. To this end there are three major strands of research, focused primarily on non- mainstream treatments: drug repurpos- ing, non-commercial immunotherapiesPROFILE and non-pharmaceutical interventions. The objective is to bring these non- mainstream treatments into main- stream clinical practice. The Repurposing Drugs in Oncology (ReDO) project is a collaboration with the US not-for-profit organisation Global Cures. The aim of the project isstraightforward - to identify a range of existing non-cancer drugs which show strong evidence of anti-cancer activity and which have the potential for clinical use. There is a broad spectrum ofdrugs that the project has identified, many of them available as cheap generics, including antibiotics, anti- fungals and antiparasitics. Taking evidence from a variety of sources, the ReDO project has reviewed, summarised and published the results in peer-reviewed journals. The ACF also aims to confirm this promising data in well-designed clinical trials. Examples include a pioneering trial of ketorolac in women undergoing breast cancer surgery, and the use of celecoxib and fluvas- tatin in paediatric optic nerve gliomas. The ultimate goal is to persuade other foundations, European and national governmental organisations to start mining this relatively unexplored fieldof affordable, non-toxic and poten- tially breakthrough opportunities thatcould benefit patients. Another key area is non-pharmaceutical interventions, which covers nutritional, lifestyle and other non-drug approaches to cancer. While these interventionsare gaining more and more public attention there are important issues to tackle in order to allow proper eval-uation of these as additions to current standard of care treatments or, as claimed by some proponents, as alternatives to standard of care therapies. Quality of supplements and plant extracts need to be guaranteed, mind body interventions standardized and clinical trial guidelines adapted. In terms of non-pharmaceutical inter- ventions the ACF supports a UK trial exploring dietary changes in advanced breast cancer; another is investigating mindfulness meditation in young adults during and after their cancer treatment. Finally, the ACF is also active in the field of immunotherapy - with an emphasis on commercially neglected areas, such as non-patentable, cellular immunotherapy or combinations of the latest generation of highly expen- sive immunomodulating drugs with low-cost interventions. The patient focus of ACF is also reflected in the support of clinical trials in patient populations with high unmet needs - particularly rare, refractory or metastatic cancers. For these indications repurposed drugs are the logical choice. An example is a multicentre trial in France with four repurposed drugs in advanced pre-treated osteosarcoma. This is a start but ideally this type of trial should be organised at a European level to minimise problems of slow patient accrual. Another instance of the ACF commit- ment to public engagement is to look at the institutional and regulatory obstacles to these non-mainstream treatments. These treatments need to be compared to standard of care, but Anticancer Fund info@anticancerfund.org www.anticancerfund.org 27this is not always a simple task. For example, trials using herbal extracts or nutraceuticals as a monotherapy are problematic due to current Euro- pean clinical trial directives. There is also a lack of standardised extracts or GMP manufacturing of agents - and manufacturers are unwilling to invest to gain accreditation. Trials in drug repurposing are easier to initiate, but there are obstacles to the adoption when positive results are reported. For example there have been a number of instances where repurposed drugs have shown evidence of efficacy but which have not then been licensed for cancer nor been adopted clinically. Changingpractice is hard and the ACF believes it needs the involvement of regula- tors, insurers, clinicians, patients and other stakeholders to make it happen. If we are to deliver on the potential benefits of these commercially neglected non-mainstream therapies, particularly in an era with globally rocketing health-system costs, these non-scientific barriers must also be overcome. PROFILEIt is well-recognised that cancer is a major public health problem worldwide. In fact, it also constitutes an enormous economic burden on society. The increasing burden is antic- ipated because cancer will surpass heart diseases as the leading cause of death in the US in the next few years. This is also likely in other parts of the world as well, in part, due to the growth and aging of the population. There- fore, effective and low cost cancer prevention and therapeutic regimens are urgently needed. Vitamin D was discovered almost a century ago as an antirachitic agent. Its role in maintaining healthy bones is well-established. There are twomajor forms of vitamin D, vitamin D 2 and vitamin D3. They are derived from two different, but closely related pre- cursors, 7-dehydroergosterol (provita- min D2) and 7-dehydrocholesterol (provitamin D3) by the same photo- synthetic mechanism. In humans, vitamin D3is the endogenous form and can be photosynthesised in the skin from provitamin D3, which is present in the epidermis of human skin, after sunlight exposure. However, vitamin D (D2or D3) itself is inert and must be activated before it can exert its biological effects on bone. The activation of vitamin D involves two successive hydroxylation steps catalysed by cytochrome P450 enzymes. The first hydroxylation occurs in the liver at the carbon-25 of vitamin Dmolecule, mainly by CYP2R1, to form 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], the major circulating form of vitamin D. The subsequent hydroxylation of 25(OH)D is carried out by 1-hydroxy- lase or CYP27B1 to produce 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], the active form of vitamin D. CYP24A1 is another one involved in vitamin D metabolism and actions. This enzyme is responsible for the degradation of 25(OH)D3and 1,25(OH)2D3and, therefore, terminating the vitamin D actions. The dependence of vitamin D synthesis on sunlight has led to the hypothesis that there might be a connection between vitamin D and cancer. It was reported in 1980 that there was an inversed association between latitude and colon cancer; people living closer to equator have less colon cancerVitamin D & Analogues in Cancer Prevention & Therapy Research 28mortality rate than those living far from it. This connection was later extended to several other forms of cancer. The ecological evidence serves as a stimulator to further explore the mechanisms of this association at the cellular and molecular levels. 1,25(OH)2D acts through its receptor called vitamin D receptor or VDR. Its binding to VDR can regulate a gene through the interaction of 1,25(OH) 2D/VDR complex with a VDR response element (VDRE). VDR has been identi- fied by gene expression profiling approach not only in tissues involved in calcium, phosphate and bone metabolism, but in almost all cell types in our body, implying that vitamin D must play important roles beyond bone. Today, it is speculated that vitamin D may regulate morethan 600 genes. Among the genesPROFILE affected are those closely linked to cancer biology, including genes regu- lating cell cycle, differentiation, apop- tosis, angiogenesis, inflammation, and immune function. More recent studies using human cell cultures and animal models have provided unequivocal data supporting the vitamin D and cancer connection and, more impor- tantly, the potential use of the active form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D, in cancer prevention and therapy. \"The increasing burden is anticipated because cancer will surpass heart diseases as the leading cause of death in the US in the next few years. \" In early clinical trials, unfortunately, 1,25(OH)2D, was found to cause serious hypercalcemia and hypercal- ciurea in patients, and was not suitable for clinical practice. Aiming to eliminate the unwanted side effectsand at the same time to enhance its anti-tumor activity, several thousands of vitamin D analogues have been synthesised. Knowing that the addition of 2-(3-hydroxypropyl) group to C-2 of 1,25(OH) 2D3molecule enhances VDR binding, that the 19-nor analogues of 1,25(OH)2D, such as 19-nor-1,25(OH)2D3and its sister compound, 19-nor-1,25(OH)2D2(also called Zemplar or Paricalcitol, which is an FDA-approved drug for treating secondary hyperparathyroidism), arenon- or less-calcemic while maintain- ing activitiesof 1,25(OH) 2D, Professor Kittaka rationalised that a vitamin D skeleton having a combined structure of \"2- (-hydroxy)alkylated\" and \"19-nor\" moieties could have enhanced biolog-ical activities without inducing a signif- icant hypercalcemic 25-dihydroxy-19-norvitamin D3), which is about 2-3 magnitudes more active than 1,25(OH)2D in prostate, liver, pancreatic, breast, and head and neck cancer cells in cultures. In a xenograft animal model inocu- lated with pancreatic cancer cells, MART-10 showed a 10-fold greater antitumor activity than 1,25(OH)2D without raising serum calcium. The higher biological activities exhibited by MART-10 in vitro may be attributable to its tighter binding to VDR, more resistance to CYP24A1 degradation inside the cells, and lower binding tovitamin D binding protein in circulation, making it more bio-available inside the cells. The less dramatic effects in vivo may suggest that further modifi- cation may be necessary to makeMART-10 more suitable as a drug. Based on the existent literatures, we have further synthesised two conju- gates of MART-10, and showed that it was released upon the incubation of these two compounds with rat serum. We further demonstrated that these two compounds had similar antipro- liferative activity as MART-10 in prostate cancer cell cultures. Recent advances in vitamin D research by several laboratories, including the laboratory of Professor Sakaki, has demonstrated that 1-hydroxylation of 25(OH)D molecule may not be a prerequisite step for the manifesta- tion of vitamin D biological activity as long as there is a sufficient level of 25(OH)D. The finding suggests thatTai C. Chen, PhD Professor Boston University Tel: +1 617 638 4543 Toshiyuki Sakaki, PhD Professor University Tel: +81 7 6656 7500 Atsushi D analogs without 1-hydroxyl group could be developed as drugs for cancer prevention and treatment. In conclusion, ecological and bio- chemical evidence strongly suggests a potential use of non- or less-calcemicanalogues of vitamin D for the preven- tion and treatment of cancer. By making a simple substitution at the A-ring of the 1,25(OH) 2D3molecule, our team has obtained an ultra-potent vitamin D analogue, MART-10, as demonstrated in both in vitro and in vivo pre-clinical studies. Its furtherderivatisation has produced potentially more effective drugs for the prevention and treatment of different forms ofcancer. PROFILE Professor Jonathan Valabhji, National Clinical Director for Diabetes and Obesity, NHS England, details the main impacts of type 2 diabetes and how the NHS National Diabetes Prevention Programme (NHS DPP) aims to limit these impacts... 30Diabetes is associated with in excess of around 22,000 deaths every year in England. Type 2 diabetes accounts for over 90% of all cases of diabetes. The health impact on the individual is stark - it is a leading cause of preventable sight loss in people of working age as well as being a major contributor to kidney failure, lower limb amputation, heart attack, and stroke. Financially, the cost of treating type 2 diabetes accounts for almost 9% of the annual NHS budget - \u00a38.8bn a year. There is a direct association between the growth in the number of people with type 2 diabetes and Britain'sexpanding waistline, as those who are overweight or obese are at higher risk of developing the condition. Currently two thirds of adults and one third of 11 year olds in England are overweight or obese and thisgure is increasing. We estimate that over 5 millionpeople in England are currently at high risk of devel oping type 2 diabetes and worryingly, if current trends persist, one in 10 people could have type 2 diabetes by 2034, meaning that if nothing is done these devas tating health and nancial burdens will get a lot worse. \"The programme will establish and implement simple and eective referral mechanisms so individuals identified to be at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes can be oered appropriate, evidence based interventions. \" Studies suggest that a large number of cases of type 2 diabetes are related to modiable lifestyle factors and ADJACENT GOVERNMENT Health Analysis Reducing the type 2 diabet es burdenADJACENT GOVERNMENT Health Analysis 31the risk of developing the condition can be signicantly decreased by reducing weight, increasing physical activity and improving diet. The evidence shows such interventions can reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetesin those at high risk by 26% on average . This is why NHS England, Public Health England and Diabetes UK are establishing the rst national at-scale diabetes prevention programme in the world, aiming to reduce the future incidence of type 2 diabetes. The NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme (NHS DPP) is an evidence-based behaviour change programme focused on lowering weight, increasing physical activity and improving the diet of those individuals identied as being at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes.It is about supporting people to take control of their own health and reduce the risk of developing thecon dition. It's about prevention. The programme will establish and implement simpleand eective referral mechanisms so individuals identied to be at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes can be oered appropriate, evidence basedinterventions. It will also allow outcomes and follow up activity to be captured so that we can evaluate and improve the programme over time. The NHS DPP will be available for adults identied as at risk. This will include people who have already been identied as at risk through previous blood tests and have existing results on practice registers and willalso provide a referral option from the NHS HealthCheck programme, which invites adults between the ages of 40 and 74 for cardiovascular risk assessment, including an assessment for diabetes, every 5 years. Public Health England has commissioned reviews of the available evidence from existing diabetes preven- tion programmes and from real-world translations of the evidence from the clinical trials. This will be published, following peer review, over the summer.The evidence reviews have informed the development of the programme, ensuring it is driven by the best available and most current evidence. \"Studies suggest that a large number of cases of type 2 diabetes are related to modifiable lifestyle factors and the risk of developing the condition can be significantly decreased by reducing weight, increasing physical activity and improving diet. \" Alongside this we are currently working with 7 local areas, known as demonstrator sites, to learn practical lessons from delivery. These sites were selected to work with us to co-design the service model and support us in developing and implementing a national programme. In particular they will support us in examining local perspectives on the service model, including potential barriers and facilitators to implementation, and strategies for the recruitment and retention of at risk individuals and alignment with existing services.

Medicinal chemistry is the application of synthetic organic chemistry to biological problems with the end goal of developing a novel small molecule therapeutic agent to treat an unmet medical need. Medicinal chemists are charged with understanding all aspects of drug discovery (chemistry, pharmacology, drug metabolism and in vivo behavior), and utilising these diverse inputs to design molecules suitable for use in humans while also enabling intellectual property position, e.g., patent protection. Moreover, the chemistry (e.g., chemical matter) varies across programs, and the medicinalchemist must be an astute synthetic chemist with a broad repertoire of chemical knowledge to be success- ful. It is often unappreciated, but like medical doctors, most medicinal chemists spend more than 10 years in undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate education before landing their rst pharmaceutical position.While drug discovery is the very denition of 'big team science', medicinal chemists are perhaps the most well-rounded of all the scientists, following programs from conception to the clinic. Without question, medicinal chemistry is the major force driving thera- peutic discovery and improving human health overthe last 100 years - from antibiotics to chemotherapy to schizophrenia. Consider the past 25 years of medical advancement for which medicinal chemistry has led the charge. Medicinal chemists have developed revolutionary treatments for HIV/AIDs, rendering it a manageable disease from what was formerly a death sentence, fundamentally changed cardiovascular health (and CV-related deaths) with the statins (e.g., Lipitor), produced game-changing cancer therapies that can add more than 10 life-adjusted quality years,and in 2014, with the launch of Sovaldi, an HCV cure that eliminated the need for liver transplants. Medicinal Chemistry - driving therapeutic discoveryADJACENT GOVERNMENT Health Analysis 32ADJACENT GOVERNMENT Health Analysis 33Great strides have also been made in terms of brain disorders and therapeutics for the central nervoussystem (CNS). Here, medicinal chemists play dual roles, developing not only the small molecule drugs, but also diagnostic and imaging agents to enable personalised, eective treatments across diverse patient populations. New small molecule therapies are under clinical development for schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease (PD), major depressive disorder(MDD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) that representnovel mechanisms of action with disease modifying potential and oer ecacy far beyond the standard of care. For schizophrenia, medicinal chemists rescuedpatients from asylums and electroshock therapy, with drugs that address the positive, negative and cognitive symptoms and enable them to integrate back intosociety. To this point, the top selling small molecule drug last year was Abilify, an antipsychotic with world-wide sales in excess of $9.2bn. In the case of PD, scientists have studied the brain circuit modied by invasive surgical procedure known as deep brainstimulation (DBS), identied molecular targets (proteins) that can be modulated to mimic DBS output, and then, medicinal chemists created small molecules to engage these targets and normalise these dysfunctional circuits. Three new drugs have launched in recent years for Multiple Sclerosis (MS),which have transformed how this neurodegenerative disease is managed, and medicinal chemists are now focused on neuroprotection/neuro-restorationstrategies that will impact a broader array of CNS disorders. Here, in CNS drug discovery, medicinal chemists truly shine. Not only do they have to design and synthesise compounds to engage the desired target, but they must be orally bioavailable (e.g., a pill), cross the blood-brain barrier (evolutionarily designed to keep foreign chemicals out), and be safe to allow daily maintenance therapy for life. These are incredibly dicult requirements and challenging obstacles, but medicinal chemists surmount these issues, as theyknow patients are waiting, and driven to impact human health. Despite these successes, medicinal chemists areunder great employment pressure from the scalrealities of outsourcing in developing nations, from downsizing/lay-os due to mergers/acquisitions in the pharmaceutical/biotech industry, as well as pharma- coeconomics. Thus, the ranks have greatly dissipated, by approximately 70%, in the United States and Europeduring the past 2 decades. These trends should alarm the public. When the next \"HIV-like\" epidemic emerges, we will have neither the needed numbernor the diversity of medicinal chemists in place to eectively rally and combat such a scenario as we did in the 1990s, with disastrous results for society.Moreover, we should all consider Alzheimer's disease (AD), forecasted to aect 1 in 5 over 65 by 2030, for which we have no cure, only palliative treatments. Scientists and medicinal chemists need to focus on AD as the drug discovery challenge of this generation to nd disease-modifying treatments. Rest assured, it is not all gloom and doom - medicinal chemists are actively and passionately working on the design and synthesis of new small molecules toaddress the unmet medical needs of the day, graduallyreplacing invasive surgical procedures and extended hospitalisations with simple pills or capsules one can take at home, with great overall savings and benets for society.

My job was to make sure that the patient and the public had a voice in the debates. With that in mind, my blunt answer to the title question is that I don't care, provided that the new medicine is effective and safe. However working also in early stage drug discovery (at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland), I must have a starting point from which to begin the search for a new drug. Inthe history of therapeutics, many things have been used as medicines: plant and animal products, microbio- logical products, synthetic compounds including both small organic molecules and large proteins, and even a few ele- ments. Almost all of these possibilities remain viable today but different people take different approaches. Some pharma companies specialize in proteins, the so-called biologics. This is the most recent source of active compound to reach the market and has had an impact chiefly in the ther- apy of cancer and inflammatory disease. My experience on the SMC showed that these medicines were high cost, often required out-patient care for administration, and were The first purified chemical compound to be used as a drug is believed to be digitalis obtained from foxgloves in the mid 18th Century.Where will our A view from one of the drug discovery teams at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotlandsometimes challenging with respect to side effects. Other companiesmaintain an emphasis on small, organic molecules as the active ingre- dient. Indeed there are pressures for the size of molecule to become smaller in order to get the best value for a drug. Cost and side effects matter with these compounds too. Outwith western industrial pharma an answer from an Indian physician might be \"Very little, actually. We've have plenty of good drugs from Mother Nature in our traditional Ayurvedic medicine\". Everybody can't do everything and companies need to make choices but we can't afford to ignore any viable possibilities as a scientific and indus- trial community interested in improv- ing health and well-being. There's no doubt that drug discovery is more difficult than it once was for many reasons including an increasingly challenging regulatory environment, a lack of good druggable targets (all the easy ones having been done), increas- ingly challenging disease states asso- ciated with aging populations, a lack of good quality new chemical entities, and so on. Overall an intrinsically risky business has become riskier. Now as an academic, one of my prin- cipal concerns is to create opportunity from my research, specifically in the field new small molecule chemical entities for new drugs; most of the work in my labs concerns designed small organic compounds. Our central scientific input is the mature field ofheterocyclic chemistry, which, almost uniquely, is able to bridge creativelychemistry and biology and to connect further with medicine. So I make no apology for plugging a science thatstill makes a difference at the cutting edge. We must continue to teach and train young scientists in chemistry so that they can translate its powerful methodology and creativity into prod- ucts containing new chemical entities that will make a difference. No surprise, therefore, that having found something new with potential, I'm very keen for it to be developed towards the market and happy to play an appropriate role in that. Gratifyingly I can speak to several new opportunities from my lab in immunomodulation, cardiovascular disease, and most significantly in anti- infective compounds where we have a new antibacterial compound that has entered phase I clinical trialsdeveloped by our partner company, MGB Biopharma in a formulation designed to treat Clostridium difficile infections. MGB Biopharma has also developed an intravenous formulation for the treatment of other Gram-pos- itive bacterial infections building upon basic science from the University of Strathclyde [see http://www.mgb-bio - pharma.com ]. MGB-BP3 is the first in a line of new anti-infective compounds that ulti- mately work by controlling gene expression by binding to the minor groove of DNA in the target organism, according to the best evidence we 35have. It's one of a family of com- pounds that we call Strathclyde MGBs (S-MGBs). We now have S-MGBs that are effective against a wide range of infectious organisms in particular Gram-positive bacteria and try- panosomes, the disease causing agent of sleeping sickness. We've been able to make such progress and to create such impact for several reasons. Firstly the S-MGB platform uses very flexible heterocyclic chemistry so that we can tune the properties of our compounds to target different pathogens whilst remaining safe for the infected host. Secondly, we have strong team-work between many aca- demic colleagues in chemistry and biology at Strathclyde but also at the University of Glasgow. Thirdly, we've worked in partnership with MGB Bio- pharma; the company's ability to raise funds in a difficult economic climate and to drive through the development programme for MGB-BP3 has been extraordinary. The outcomes of our research are not just the important practical applica- tions but the advancement of theunderlying science. For example, we are developing new chemical technologies to synthesise the compounds we need to evaluate. Also in studying the effect of our drugs on the target bacteria and par- asites we are discovering more about the internal workings of the infectious organisms. With such information available we would hope to devise new and more effective drugs for infectious disease.PROFILE new medicines come from?So what does a heterocyclic chemist do to create opportunities for new drugs? Firstly, there has to be a prom- ising and preferably novel starting point, which could be a new com- pound discovered by screening, usually plant or microbial products or occasionally a compound from animals, or it could be a molecular hypothesis. This is not new at all. In fact it's what has been done ever since chemists got into drug discovery. The new thing, however, is the stringency with which 'promising' and 'novel' can be defined. 'Promising' may relate to an unmet need in medicines currently available. 'Novel' may also reflect unmet need but will also concern the chemical class of compound being investigated. From there, the chem- istry-biology interface is so much better developed now that a good deal can be discovered about impor- tant things like selectivity and toxicity before a synthetic chemistry pro-gramme is begun. Choosing what to make and how to make it with due regard for the proba- bility of a successful development and for chemical novelty is then the key contribution of the heterocyclicchemist. This is the essential link that both mediates between chemistry and biology and also creates the therapeu- tic opportunities through the new com- pounds that emerge. What makes today's science so exciting is that thetools and techniques that we have the power to explore the most detailed properties of molecules and the inti- mate workings of biology. This means that the coupling between chemistry and biology that is essential in drug discovery is stronger than ever before and is why we place such an emphasis on scientific teamwork at Strathclyde,as is discussed in my e-book which also gives more details of our projects and our approaches through heterocyclic chemistry [see \"Chemistry, the Queen of Sciences\" available here from the Adjacent Government website. 36PROFILE Caption Left: MGB-BP3 formulated in capsules freeze-dried sample of an intravenous medicine (courtesy MGB Biopharma).

Chemistry pervades everything we do. It is all around us and we could not live the lives we do without it. Manmade chemicals are all around us too. Without them, we would not be able to feed the world or have safe drinking water. We would not be able to drive our cars or cure diseases. Life wouldbe much less comfortable without modern textiles, plastics, paints, etc. and we would have no mobilephones computers or televisions. All of these very important uses of chemicals lead to a huge economic advantage for regions which have well developed chemical industries, and Europe is a good example of this. About a quarter of the balance of trade surplus of the EU comes from the chemical industry and about 1.2 million people work in chemistry and a further 2.4 million in jobs dependent on chemistry. A renewable chemical landscape However, there are still huge challenges. Most of the manmade chemicals now in use are made from oilbased feed stocks, but oil is becoming scarcer and more expensive, threatening our current way of life. This presents a huge opportunity for chemists to developnew processes for making the many things we currently take for granted but from renewable resources. Most ofthese resources will be plant based, but they have to be developed without threatening the food supply. This means that they should mostly come from by-products of food production, especially cellulose and lignin. Current research into using these chemically rich but very dicult to work with resources is growing fast and will lead to a whole new chemical landscape. Tackling climate change Climate change arises from burning fossil fuels in power plants, vehicles and industry. If we do not stop this endless pumping of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, the planet will not be able to sustain our children and grandchildren. It has been suggestedthat climate change is the very worst problem aecting future life on earth. Everyday chemistryADJACENT GOVERNMENT Health Analysis 38Hydrogen is the perfect fuel because when it burns it gives very large amounts of energy and produces onlywater - no pollution and no greenhouse gases. At the moment hydrogen is made from fossil fuels, but it can be made from water using sunlight if the right catalystsare added. Potentially, this allows us to make a fuel from abundant water and to burn that fuel to regeneratethe water used. Current research is aimed at increasing the eciency and especially lifetimes of the catalyst. \"About a quarter of the balance of trade surplus of the EU comes from the chemical industry and about 1.2 million people workin chemistry and a further 2.4 million in jobs dependent on chemistry.\" Controlling life-threatening diseases Tackling diseases of ageing, antibiotic resistant bacteria and cancer are all chemical problems. Huge progress has been made but much more needs to be done. Chemists, working in collaboration with biochemists and medical doctors hold the key to conquering these and many other diseases. How can EuCheMS help? EuCheMS, the European Association for Chemical and Molecular Sciences is an overarching body for all the chemical societies in Europe and as such it provides an independent and unied voice for 160,000 chemists. It aims to ensure that the European Parliament and the Commission are aware of the chemical aspects ofany legislation that is being considered; it responds to consultations concerning chemical matters issued bythe European bodies and provides early information on chemical issues as they arise. It does this by running awareness events in the European Parliament. Recent or forthcoming examples include workshops on: Energy storage through chemical means; Using carbon dioxide as a feedstock for chemicals production; Preserving endangered elements; elements that are used in everyday consumer goods such as computers and mobile phones, but for which thetotal supplies are only sucient for < 100 years. EuCheMS also attempts to raise public awareness ofthese critical issues with recent public lectures related to securing clean food and water supplies for an increasing population, as well as to ways to makeenergy without producing any carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. Finally, EuCheMS, through its Divisions and Working Parties, as well as through its biennial chemistry congresses - the next one of which will be held inSevilla in September 2016 - keeps the chemistry community updated on the very latest developments that are occurring in all areas of chemistry.
