Reduces itching, improves skin and coat and supports immune system.", "sitename": "Natural Dog Company", "date": "2019-11-27", "cleaned_text": "Essential Fatty Acids like Linoleic Acid, ALA, EPA, and DHA are organic compounds that cannot be created naturally by your dog, but are necessary for proper functioning and health. These compounds support skin and coat health, mobility, and brain health and can be found naturally in ingredients like salmon, flax seeds and chia seeds. Luckily, this product includes all of these great ingredients for well rounded nutrition! - Every dog is different - for some dogs, you'll notice a difference in a few days, other dogs may take a few weeks to see changes in their skin and coat. For best results, use in conjunction with our Itchy Dog Shampoo and our Skin Soother balm or wipes for that salon worthy, fresh, healthy glow. - Whichever you prefer! Both products deliver the same essential nutrients to your dog, it's just a matter of administration preference. However, we don't recommend using both products together. - Supplements can be taken together just like humans take vitamins simultaneously! However, there can be too much of a good thing. We recommend using our supplements in conjunction with one additional supplement not in the same product line. For significant overlapping ingredients, use half the recommended amount for each supplement. Always refer to the serving size per your dog's weight. - Skin and Coat chews helps the skin through fatty acids, which help support cell regeneration and moisture content. The Aller-Immune chews target the gut and immune system, which supports the dogs ability to fight off the allergens directly, not just the effects of them. If you're torn between both products, they're safe to use together! - Always consult with your veterinarian before giving your dog dietary supplements if you have any questions or if your dog is under medical supervision. - Every dog is different. Most dogs can start using the product as directed and experience no problems. If a dog has existing GI problems, then start them out slow and build up over 2-3 days. Changes they may experience would be less firm stool, but if your dog is experiencing vomiting or prolonged diarrhea, we suggest consulting your veterinarian. Customer Reviews & Questions - MCMaria Cristina M.Verified BuyerI recommend this productBreed BulldogAge AdultCanine Concerns Itchy Skin, Allergies, Dry Skin, Hot Spots, InfectionRated 5 out of 5 stars2 years agoAmazing! Our bulldog has all sorts of skin issues: dry skin, yeast infections, hot spots, allergies, etc. He'd scratch and bite so much his skin would break and bleed at times. The vet gave us some medication which helped, but it was expensive after a few months it all came back. We've been trying different products to figure out what works and thought we'd give this a try. Within a week of using these supplements we noticed the difference! It's been about three weeks and not only has his skin began to heal, there haven't been any major breakouts since then. His coat is looking shiny and his fur has began to grow back. He's still not completely healed, but he's looking so much better. Best of all, he actually likes the \"treats!\" We'd been using the wrinkle balm and and the paw soother already and they seemed to help alleviate the itchiness temporarily, but now combined with the skin and coat supplement I only apply them once a day and he's fine! Sorry for the long review, I'm just in awe of how much his skin healed and how much better he looks and feels! (The pictures are of a hot spot on the chin/cheek area) - JTJennifer T.Verified BuyerI recommend this productAge SeniorCanine Concerns Itchy Skin, Allergies, Infection, Hot Spots, Dry SkinRated 5 out of 5 stars1 year agoNatural Dog Company ROCKS! My husky mix had HORRIBLE skin allergies that turned into a fungal/bacterial infection. The first two pictures were taken about 2 years ago after we had to shave her beautiful fur down to the skin so she could heal. We originally had to bathe her with medicated prescription shampoo from the vet to get the infection under control. During this time I saw an ad for Natural Dog Company products so I purchased the Itchy Dog shampoo, Skin & Coat supplements, and the Spruce Up Pup shampoo bar. I'm not gonna lie, it took about a month before I could see any results, but slowly I noticed she wasn't itching as much and her fur was starting to grow back in thick and full like it was before. About a month ago I purchased the Alaskan Salmon Oil and started adding it to her food twice a day. Well, the last picture was taken about a week ago and as you can see, her fur is back to it's full and fluffy self. So happy I found these products, and I'm even more happy that they are all naturally derived! Thank you Natural Dog Company! - AEAllison this productBreed 5 out of 5 stars1 year Got my frenchie off recommend this Concerns Itchy Skin, Dry Skin, Wound/Scar, AllergiesRated 5 out of 5 stars1 year agoImprovement! We rescued Blu a little over a month ago. She had lots of scabs when we found her. Also- as most pitties do, she has allergies. When we first got her , she was constantly itching and biting at her skin. Since I started giving these to her, it's has almost completely stopped! Her coat is looking better as well. Can't wait to see the improvement of it as we continue! Highly recommend - EEBPVerified BuyerI recommend this productBreed DachsundsAge SeniorCanine Concerns Itchy Skin, Hot SpotsRated 5 out of 5 stars1 year agoMy dog cleeeearly loved them after just one! Well, I have to give a 5-star review for the skin and coat supplements. I gave Bella 1 chew (she's a 13yo, 20# Doxie mix) and the next morning my husband and I left the house for 30 minutes and in that time she managed to jump on the dining room chair to get to the table and grab the treat container, pull it down to the floor, chew off the ***** top lid and eat the remain 89 chews! OBVIOUSLY not recommended by the company or any dog parent but after a rush to the vet and a lot of um... other gross stuff, she's going to be A-ok! We're just so thankful these supplements have natural and organic ingredients or I think it could have been a lot worse. Will buy again and store them much MUCH higher! Naughty Doxin. On the bright side, she hasn't been itching at all today so they definitely work!
