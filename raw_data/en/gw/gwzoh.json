Diabetes is a disease that is caused when your blood sugar level is way too high than what is normal. Blood sugar is your body's main and vital source of energy and you get it from the food you eat. Curious to know the whole process? Let's dive in. Diabetes occurs when there is not enough insulin production in your body. What is this insulin? Insulin is a hormone which is made by the pancreas that helps the glucose from the food that you eat to get into your cells to be used as a source of energy production.

A study which was done by the doctors at AIIMS, Delhi have concluded that a combination of allopathic drugs can have a positive effect on diabetes. The findings hold importance given that people with diabetes are two to four times more likely than others to develop cardiovascular disease, deadly comorbidities that could put a person at a high risk of contracting COVID-19. According to the study reports, the doctors at AIIMS have found that the pace of diabetes growth can be halted if an allopathic drug is integrated with BGR-34, a herbal formulation enriched with [antioxidant](https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/diabetes/home-remedies-for-diabetes-64404/) properties that do not allow bad cholesterol to accumulate in the heart arteries. To find the efficacy of BGR-34 with allopathic drugs, the All India Institute Of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) doctors gave the Ayurveda formulation and allopathic medicine glibenclamide separately to one group and in combination with another group in the study. Speaking to the media, the doctors said that the interim findings have stated that the combination group who were given ayurvedic BGR-34 and glibenclamide had more improvement in insulin levels than those given allopathic drugs alone. It also showed the cholesterol-lowering (cardioprotective) effect. The study also established that BGR-34 improved lipid profile in terms of triglycerides and levels of VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein), thus showing that it can be [safely](https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/diabetes/diabetes-how-it-differs-for-men-and-women-780618/) taken with synthetic antidiabetic drugs. Based on herbs like vijaysar, daruharidra, manjisth, gudmar, giloe and methika found in the upper region of the Himalayas, BGR-34 has been prepared after intensive research by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research's two Lucknow-based labs - Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP) and National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI). Recently, a team of scientists from Tehran University had in their separate study concluded that herbal drugs having antioxidant properties can reduce the risk of COVID-19 in [diabetic](https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/diabetes/obesity-alone-can-up-your-diabetes-risk-significantly-lose-weight-the-right-way-747439/) patients.
