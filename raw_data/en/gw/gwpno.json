Glossary of DAWN Terms, 2011 Update](#attA) [Attachment B. Drug Abuse Warning Network Methodology Report, 2011 Update](#attB) [Attachment C. Guide to Drug Abuse Warning Network Trend Tables, 2011 Update](#attC) This publication presents national estimates of drug-related visits to hospital emergency departments (EDs) for the calendar year 2011, based on data from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN). Also presented are comparisons of 2011 estimates with those for 2004, 2009, and 2010. DAWN is a public health surveillance system that monitors drug-related ED visits for the Nation and for selected metropolitan areas. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is the agency responsible for DAWN. SAMHSA is required to collect data on drug-related ED visits under Section 505 of the Public Health Service Act. DAWN relies on a nationally representative sample of general, non-Federal hospitals operating 24-hour EDs, with oversampling of hospitals in selected metropolitan areas. In each participating hospital, ED medical records are reviewed retrospectively to find the ED visits that involved recent drug use. All types of drugs\u2014illegal drugs, prescription drugs, over-the-counter pharmaceuticals (e.g., dietary supplements, cough medicine), and substances inhaled for their psychoactive effects\u2014are included. Alcohol is considered an illicit drug when consumed by patients aged 20 or younger. For patients aged 21 or older, though, alcohol is reported only when it is used in conjunction with other drugs. Marked findings of this report are (a) a 29 percent increase in the number of drug-related ED visits involving illicit drugs in the short term between 2009 and 2011; (b) simultaneous, short-term increases in the involvement of both illicit and licit stimulant-like drugs; and (c) some indications that the pace of increases in pharmaceutical involvement is slowing down. In 2011, over 125 million visits were made to EDs in general-purpose, non-Federal hospitals operating 24-hour EDs in the United States. DAWN estimates that over 5 million of these visits, or about 1,626 ED visits per 100,000 population, were related to drugs, a 100 percent increase since 2004. In 2011, drug-related visits range from a low of 288 visits per 100,000 population aged 6 to 11 to a high of 2,477 visits per 100,000 population aged 18 to 20 ( [Figure 1](#fig1)). Figure 1. Rates of drug-related ED visits per 100,000 population, by age group, 2011 SOURCE: Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, SAMHSA, Drug Abuse Warning Network, 2011. In 2011, DAWN estimates that about 2.5 million ED visits resulted from medical emergencies involving drug misuse or abuse, the equivalent of 790 ED visits per 100,000 population. For those aged 20 or younger, the rate is 500 visits; for those aged 21 or older, the rate is 903 visits. Understanding that a visit may appear in more than one group, DAWN found that, out of all drug misuse or abuse ED visits, In the long term, between 2004 and 2011, the annual overall number of ED visits attributable to drug misuse or abuse has risen steadily each year for a total increase of 52 percent, or about 844,000 visits. In the short term, between 2009 and 2011, ED visits involving overall misuse or abuse increased by 19 percent, or by about 400,000 visits over the 2 years. Almost half of the net increase in visits seen in the 8 years from 2004 to 2011 occurred in the last 2 years of the period, 2009 to 2011. Unlike the long-term trends, though, which are largely driven by rises in pharmaceutical involvement, the short-term rise reflects the 38 percent increase seen in ED visits involving illicit drugs only, with no significant increases over the last 2 years for visits involving pharmaceuticals or alcohol alone or combinations of pharmaceuticals, alcohol, and illicit drugs. Of the approximately 2.5 million drug misuse or abuse ED visits that occurred during 2011, a total of 1,252,500, or just over half (51%), involved illicit drugs. That is the equivalent of 402 ED visits for each 100,000 persons in the U.S. population. The highest rates of involvement were found for cocaine and marijuana (162 and 146 ED visits per 100,000 population, respectively). Almost 40 percent of visits involving illicit drugs resulted in some form of follow-up, including admission to the hospital (24%), transfer to another health care facility (10%), or referral to a drug detox/dependency program (6%). The overall level of ED visits involving illicit drugs was stable in the long term, between 2004 and 2011. In the short term, between 2009 and 2011, though, visits involving illicit drugs have experienced a 29 percent increase. DAWN estimates that over 1.2 million ED visits involved nonmedical use of prescription medicines, over-the-counter drugs, or other types of pharmaceuticals in 2011. At 46 percent, pain relievers were the most common type of drugs involved in medical emergencies associated with nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals; narcotic pain relievers were involved in 29 percent. Some form of follow-up was observed for almost 40 percent of visits. Overall, medical emergencies related to nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals increased 132 percent in the period from 2004 to 2011, with opiate/opioid involvement rising 183 percent. In the short term, between 2009 and 2011, overall pharmaceutical involvement increased just 15 percent, and opiate/opioid involvement saw no significant increase. One category of drugs that has experienced both short- and long-term increases in involvement is central nervous system (CNS) stimulants (e.g., ADHD drugs). The short-term increase in involvement of CNS stimulants (85%) echoes a similar short-term rise observed for involvement of illicit stimulants (amphetamines/methamphetamine) (71%). In 2011, about a quarter of all ED visits associated with drug misuse or abuse also involved alcohol. Among all visits involving alcohol, 58 percent involved illicit drugs and 56 percent involved pharmaceuticals. Among all visits involving illicit drugs, about 30 percent also involved alcohol; higher levels of alcohol involvement were found for visits involving ketamine (72%). Among all visits involving pharmaceuticals, 25 percent also involved alcohol. Alcohol was present in 38.6 percent of visits involving penicillin, 38 percent of visits involving CNS stimulants, and 31 percent of visits involving antidepressants. Just under half of the patients received follow-up care. In 2011, of the nearly 440,000 drug abuse-related ED visits made by patients aged 20 or younger, more than 40 percent involved alcohol. The rate of medical emergencies involving alcohol was 287 visits per 100,000 population aged 12 to 17 and 858 per 100,000 population aged 18 to 20, almost a threefold difference. Visits involving drugs and alcohol have remained stable over the period from 2004 through 2011, with no short-term increases. DAWN estimated there were over 200,000 ED visits resulting from drug-related suicide attempts in 2011. Almost all involved a prescription drug or over-the-counter medication. Over 80 percent of patients attempting drug-related suicide had some form of follow-up after their ED visit. The number of drug-related suicide attempts has risen 41 percent from 2004 to 2011. DAWN estimates that there were about a quarter million drug-related ED visits for patients seeking detox or substance abuse treatment services during 2011. Nearly 60 percent of ED patients classified as seeking detox obtained some follow-up based on their ED visit: about 30 percent were admitted to the hospital, 20 percent were referred to detox/treatment services, and 7 percent were transferred to another facility. While the overall number of ED visits by patients seeking detox for illicit drugs did not change significantly either in the long or short term, a short-term increase of 36 percent between 2009 and 2011 was observed for patients seeking detox from heroin; there were over 20,000 more visits in 2011 than in 2009. For 2011, DAWN estimates that over 2.3 million ED visits, or 738 visits per 100,000 population, involved adverse reactions to prescription medicines, over-the-counter drugs, or other types of therapeutic substances. Rates for women were higher than for men (887 and 584 visits per 100,000 population, respectively). For children aged 5 and under, the rate of ED visits for adverse reactions was 842 visits per 100,000 population. The rate dropped to a low of 248 visits for children aged 6 to 11 and then rose consistently to reach a high of 1,526 visits for patients aged 65 or older. About three quarters of patients were treated and released, and about a fifth of patients were admitted to the hospital. ED visits resulting from adverse reactions to pharmaceuticals increased 84 percent in the long term, rising from about 1.3 million visits in 2005 to about 2.3 million visits in 2011. The number of ED visits for adverse reactions to pharmaceuticals rose by about a quarter million visits (or more) per year between 2005 and 2008, leveling off at about 2.3 million visits per year over the period from 2009 to 2011. The preponderance of ED visits for accidental ingestion involved children aged 5 and under. In 2011, out of a total of 113,634 visits, over 77,000 involved children in this age range. The rate of visits for accidental drug ingestion was about 25 times higher for children aged 5 and under than for adults: 318 visits per 100,000 children aged 5 and under compared with 13 visits per 100,000 population for the general adult population aged 21 or older. Pain relievers were the most common class of drugs involved in accidental ingestion among children aged 5 and under, appearing in 25 percent of visits. Medical emergencies related to accidental ingestions by patients aged 5 and under were stable from 2004 to 2011, though increases were observed for particular drug groups. With over 8,000 visits recorded in 2011, ED visits involving drugs to treat anxiety and insomnia rose 120 percent since 2004. With about 5,000 visits in 2011, visits involving narcotic pain relievers increased 225 percent over that period. This publication presents estimates of drug-related emergency department (ED) visits from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) for 2011, with comparison of estimates for 2004, 2009, and 2010. DAWN is a public health surveillance system that monitors patients' medical records of ED visits for the Nation to identify those visits that are related to drug use, misuse, and abuse. The Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ) of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has been responsible for DAWN operations since 1992. This introduction provides a brief description of the major features of DAWN and the statistics presented in this report. Survey findings, as well as comparisons to earlier years' data, are organized in eight sections, with each section focusing on a specific type of ED visit (as listed in [Table 1](#tab1)). Additional details on DAWN terminology and methodology are provided as attachments to this document. Detailed tables of DAWN estimates, this document, its attachments, other reports using DAWN data, and other methodology reports are available at the DAWN Web site. [1](#ftn1) As they become available, DAWN data are accessible through SAMHSA's Data Archive (SAMHDA). [2](#ftn2) |Analytic group||Description| |All Visits||This group includes all visits that are reportable to DAWN without regard for the reason for the visit or the specific drugs involved. It includes visits involving all forms of drug misuse or abuse plus visits resulting from adverse reaction, accidental ingestion, suicide attempts, and visits where patients were seeking detoxification services. These estimates are useful for looking at overall levels of drug involvement in ED visits.| |\u2014||Drug-related ED visits that involve drug misuse or abuse| |All Misuse and Abuse||This analytic category includes ED visits that involve all forms of drug misuse or abuse, as defined by DAWN. This category is the combination of visits from the following four analytic groups: illicit drug visits, nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals, alcohol-related visits, and underage drinking. A visit may appear in more than one of those subgroups, but it will appear only once in this overall group. Suicide attempt visits and seeking detox visits will be included in this category if illicit drugs were involved.| |Illicits (excluding alcohol)||This analytic category includes ED visits that involve the use of drugs that have limited or no therapeutic value and are generally illegal if taken without a prescription. These substances include cocaine, heroin, marijuana, synthetic the inhalation of substances for their psychoactive properties (e.g., sniffing model airplane glue) are included.| |Nonmedical Use of Pharmaceuticals||This analytic category includes ED visits that involve nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals: patients who took a higher than prescribed or recommended dose of their own medication, patients who took a pharmaceutical prescribed for another person, malicious poisoning of the patient by another individual, and documented substance abuse involving pharmaceuticals.| |All Alcohol||This analytic category includes ED visits involving alcohol. For adults aged 21 and older, the alcohol was found in combination with other drugs. For patients under the age of 21, the visit may involve alcohol alone or in combination with other drugs.| |Underage Drinking||This analytic category includes ED visits that involve alcohol use (alone or with other drugs) for patients under the age of 21. Underage drinking is an important barometer of adolescent drinking patterns and a predictor of more serious substance abuse problems in young adults.| |Suicide Attempts||This analytic category includes ED visits that involve drug-related suicide attempts. It includes visits for drug overdoses and for suicide attempts by other means (e.g., using a firearm) if drugs were involved or related to the suicide attempt. Inclusion in this analytic category has no restrictions on the type of drug used.| |Seeking Detox||This analytic category includes nonemergency requests made through the ED for admission to detoxification unit, visits to obtain medical clearance before being incarcerated, and acute emergencies where an individual is experiencing withdrawal symptoms and requests detox. These estimates do not include patients who seek or enter the hospital's detox unit through other avenues.| |\u2014||Drug-related ED visits that do NOT involve drug misuse or abuse| |Adverse Reactions||This analytic category includes ED visits in which an adverse health consequence (e.g., side effects or an allergic reaction) resulted when taking prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or dietary supplements as prescribed or recommended.| |Accidental Ingestions||This analytic category includes ED visits in which an individual accidentally or unknowingly used or was administered a prescription drug, over-the-counter medication, or dietary supplement. Drug-related accidental ingestions typically involve patients aged 5 and under.| A DAWN case is any ED visit involving recent drug use that is implicated in the ED visit. The reason a patient used a drug is not part of the criteria for considering a visit to be drug related. Therefore, DAWN includes ED visits resulting from accidental ingestions and adverse reactions as well as explicit drug abuse. DAWN captures drugs that are explicitly named in the medical record as being involved in the ED visit. The relationship between the ED visit and the drug use need not be causal. That is, an implicated drug may or may not have directly caused the condition generating the ED visit; the ED staff simply named it as being involved. Conversely, DAWN does not report medications or pharmaceuticals that the ED medical records mention as having been taken by the patient but that are unrelated to the ED visit. Within those guidelines, DAWN collects data on all types of drugs, including the following: This report provides detailed information on ED visits involving drug use, misuse, or abuse for the years 2004 through 2011. The types of ED visits (referred to as analytic groups) highlighted in this publication are listed in Table 1. The analytic groups are defined by the reason for the visit and the types of drugs involved. Because a visit may involve multiple types of drugs (e.g., an illicit drug, such as marijuana, and a pharmaceutical, such as hydrocodone), a single visit may appear in multiple analytic groups. DAWN relies on a nationally representative sample of hospitals with oversampling of hospitals in selected metropolitan areas. The universe of hospitals eligible for DAWN includes non-Federal, short-stay, general medical and surgical facilities in the United States that operate 24-hour EDs. DAWN excludes specialty hospitals (e.g., pediatric hospitals), long-term care facilities, and Federal facilities (e.g., Veterans Health Administration hospitals). The American Hospital Association Annual Survey Database (ASDB) was used to identify the original frame members. Subsequent ASDB surveys are used annually to identify \"births\" of new hospitals that open and \"deaths\" of hospitals that close or merge with other hospitals. For 2011, 5.2 million charts out of a universe of 12.2 million charts were reviewed to determine if a visit was drug related. Data on 229,211 drug-related ED visits submitted by 233 hospitals were used for estimation. The overall visit weighted response rate was 35.2 percent. This publication reports nationally representative estimates of drug-related ED visits for the United States. Estimates are calculated by applying weights and adjustments to the data provided by the sampled hospitals participating in DAWN. The primary sampling weights reflect the probability of hospital selection, and separate adjustment factors are included to account for sampling of ED visits, nonresponse, data quality, and the known total of ED visits delivered by the universe of eligible hospitals, as reported by the most current ASDB survey. Many of the tables in this report provide estimates of visits, by drug. DAWN is able to identify more than 3,300 individual drugs (which map to more than 19,000 individual brands and street names). [3](#ftn3) The more commonly involved drugs and drug categories were selected for inclusion in the drug detail tables appearing in this report. Because (a) a single ED visit may involve multiple drugs, or (b) the same drug may be reported both under its specific drug name and under its drug category, the sum of ED visits from different rows in the drug detail tables will be greater than the total number of visits. For the same reason, percentages will add to more than 100. Standardized measures are helpful when comparing levels of drug-related ED visits for different age and sex groups. This publication reports rates of ED visits per 100,000 population by age groups and sex groups per year, e.g., visits per 100,000 population aged 12 to 17 or visits per 100,000 male population. Population estimates are based on counts provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. [4](#ftn4) Population-based rates for race/ethnicity categories are not reported because race/ethnicity information is often missing from ED records; a dash (\u2014) is displayed instead. Because DAWN relies on a sample of hospitals, each estimate produced from the DAWN ED data is subject to sampling variability, the variation in estimates that would be observed naturally if different samples were drawn from the same population using the same procedures. One measure of sampling variability of an estimate used in this publication is the relative standard error (RSE). The precision of an estimate is inversely related to its RSE. That is, the greater the RSE, the lower the precision. A second measure of sampling error used in this publication is the 95 percent confidence interval (CI). A 95 percent CI means that if repeated samples were drawn from the same population of hospitals using the same sampling and data collection procedures, the true population value would fall within the CI 95 percent of the time. A CI, which is expressed as a range of values, is useful because the interval reflects both the estimate and its particular margin of error. For example, in 2011, there were 2,462,948 ED visits associated with drug misuse or abuse with a CI of 2,112,868 to 2,813,028. The CI indicates with a high degree of confidence that the actual number was within this range. An asterisk (*) is displayed in the place of suppressed estimates and rates. Data may be suppressed to protect patient confidentiality or to ensure that published findings meet statistical standards of reliability for survey results. In all DAWN published materials, estimates are suppressed according to the following rules: Ratios (percentages or rates per 100,000 population) based on suppressed estimates are likewise suppressed. In this publication, between-year changes are assessed by comparing estimates for 2011 with those for 2004, 2009, and 2010. [5](#ftn5) This publication reports only those between-year changes that are statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level. The p-value is a measure of the probability (p) that the difference between two estimates could have occurred by chance, if the estimates being compared were really the same. The larger the p-value, the more likely the difference could have occurred by chance. For example, if the difference between two DAWN estimates has a p-value of 0.01, it means that there is a 1 percent probability that the difference observed could be due to chance alone. The redesign of DAWN in 2003 altered most of DAWN's core features. Changes were made to the design of the hospital sample, the protocol for selecting charts to review, the eligibility criteria for being a DAWN case, and the data items submitted on these cases. These changes created a permanent disruption in trends. As a result, comparisons cannot be made between old DAWN (2003 and prior years) and the redesigned DAWN (2004 and forward). Readers are advised to consider the following limitations to the DAWN data when interpreting results: For 2011, DAWN estimates that there were over 5.1 million drug-related ED visits. Of these, 2.5 million ED visits were associated with drug misuse or abuse ( [Table 2](#tab2)). That is the equivalent of 790.4 ED visits for each 100,000 persons in the Nation; for those aged 20 or younger, the rate is 500.0 visits; for those aged 21 or older, the rate is 903.4 visits. |Drug combinations (1)||ED visits||Percent of | (%)||95% | Lower bound |95% CI: | Upper bound |(1) The classification of drugs used in DAWN is derived from the Multum Lexicon, \u00a9 2012 Lexi-Comp, Inc. and/or Cerner Multum, Inc.

SOURCE: Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, SAMHSA, Drug Abuse Warning Network, 2011. Of the ED visits in 2011 that involved drug misuse or abuse, nearly two thirds (64.9%) were associated with a single drug type (illicit drugs, alcohol, or pharmaceuticals). Illicit drugs alone were involved in 26.6 percent of drug misuse or abuse visits, pharmaceuticals alone were involved in 33.9 percent, and alcohol with no other drug (aged 20 or younger only) was involved in 4.8 percent. The remaining visits (34.7%) involved some combination of illicit drugs, alcohol, and pharmaceuticals. Understanding that a visit may appear in more than one group, DAWN found that out of all ED visits involving drug misuse or abuse, This section presents the trends in the estimates of ED visits involving drug misuse or abuse for the period from 2004 through 2011 ( [Table 3](#tab3)). Differences between years are presented in terms of the percentage increase or decrease in visits in 2011 compared with the estimates for 2004 (long-term trends) and for 2009 and 2010 (short-term trends).

SOURCE: Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, SAMHSA, Drug Abuse Warning Network, 2011. In the long term, between 2004 and 2011, the annual overall number of ED visits attributable to drug misuse or abuse has risen steadily each year for a total increase of 52 percent, or about 844,000 visits. While visits involving illicit drugs alone or underage drinking have not risen, ED visits related to the use of pharmaceuticals with no other drug involvement rose substantially (148%), as did the use of pharmaceuticals with illicit drugs (137%), pharmaceuticals with alcohol (84%), and pharmaceuticals combined with both illicit drugs and alcohol (93%). These increases reflect almost 500,000 more ED visits related to pharmaceuticals alone in 2011 compared with 2004, over 142,000 more visits related to pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs, almost 120,000 more visits related to pharmaceuticals and alcohol, and over 42,000 more visits related to all three types of substances. In the short term, between 2009 and 2011, ED visits involving overall drug misuse or abuse increased by 19 percent, or by about 200,000 visits per year for 2 years. Almost half of the net increase seen for ED visits involving misuse or abuse between 2004 and 2011 occurred in the last 2 years of the period. Unlike the long-term trends, though, which are largely driven by rises in pharmaceutical involvement, the short-term rise reflects the 38 percent increase seen in ED visits involving illicit drugs only, with no significant increases over the last 2 years for visits involving pharmaceuticals or alcohol alone or combinations of pharmaceuticals, alcohol, and illicit drugs. For analysis, DAWN groups together ED visits that involve illicit drugs. These substances include cocaine, heroin, marijuana, synthetic of nonmedical substances for their psychoactive properties (e.g., sniffing model airplane glue) are also included. [6](#ftn6) Of the approximately 2.5 million drug misuse or abuse ED visits that occurred during 2011, a total of 1,252,500, or just over half (50.9%), involved illicit drugs ( [Table 4](#tab4)). A majority (56.3%) of illicit drug ED visits involved multiple drugs. Overall, 27.9 percent of visits involving illicit drugs also involved alcohol. |Drugs (1)||ED visits||Percent of | ED visits |RSE (%)||95% Lower bound |95% CI: | Upper bound |(1) The classification of drugs used in DAWN is derived from the Multum Lexicon, \u00a9 2012 Lexi-Comp, Inc. and/or Cerner Multum, Inc.

SOURCE: Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, SAMHSA, Drug Abuse Warning Network, 2011. Cocaine and marijuana were the most commonly involved drugs, with 505,224 ED visits (40.3%) and 455,668 ED visits (36.4%), respectively. Cocaine and marijuana were followed by heroin, at 258,482 ED visits, or 20.6 percent, and then by amphetamines/methamphetamine, at 159,840 visits, or 12.8 percent. [7](#ftn7) Other illicit drugs involved in ED visits occurred at levels under 5 percent and included the following: The estimates for visits involving flunitrazepam (e.g., Rohypnol) was suppressed due to low statistical precision. Synthetic cannabinoids, also known as \"Spice\" or \"K2,\" appeared for the first time at reportable levels in DAWN in 2010; they were involved in 11,406 ED visits (1.0%). In 2011, a total of 28,531 ED visits, or 2.3 percent, involved synthetic cannabinoids. While there appears to be a number of different chemical compositions, synthetic cannabinoids are functionally similar to 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active ingredient in cannabis. [8](#ftn8) Users report effects similar to those produced by marijuana, and regular users may experience withdrawal and addiction symptoms. [9](#ftn9) According to the Monitoring the Future survey, almost one in nine, or 11.4 percent, of high school seniors reported using synthetic cannabinoids in 2011. [10](#ftn10), [11](#ftn11) In 2011, there were 402.0 ED visits that involved illicit drugs for each 100,000 persons in the U.S. population ( [Table 5](#tab5)). The highest rates were found for cocaine involvement (162.1 ED visits per 100,000 population) and marijuana (146.2 visits) ( [Figure 2](#fig2)). These were followed by (83.0 visits per 100,000 population), amphetamines/methamphetamine (51.3 visits), PCP (24.2 visits), synthetic cannabinoids (9.2 visits), and MDMA (Ecstasy) (7.2 visits). Lower-incidence drugs had rates below 4 visits per 100,000 population. |Drugs (1)||Rate of ED | visits per 100,000 population (2) |RSE (%)||95% CI: | Lower bound |95% CI: | Upper bound |(1) The classification of drugs used in DAWN is derived from the Multum Lexicon, \u00a9 2012 Lexi-Comp, Inc. and/or Cerner Multum, Inc.

For most illicit drugs, the rates were more than 50 percent higher for males than for females. Comparing visits by patient age, 21- to 24-year-olds had the highest rate of medical emergencies involving marijuana (446.9 visits per 100,000 population aged 21 to 24), heroin (266.1 visits), and amphetamines/methamphetamine (141.5 visits); 45- to 54-year-olds had the highest rate for cocaine (344.6 visits per 100,000 population aged 45 to 54). |Patient illicits||Cocaine||Heroin||Marijuana||Amphetamines/ | methamphet- amine |MDMA | (Ecstasy) |GHB||LSD||PCP| |(1) The classification of drugs used in DAWN is derived from the Multum Lexicon, \u00a9 2012 Lexi-Comp, Inc. and/or Cerner Multum, Inc.

DAWN does not produce population-based rates for race/ethnicity categories because race/ethnicity information is often missing from ED records. Overall, 39.4 percent of visits involving illicit drugs resulted in some form of follow-up, including admission to the hospital (24.0%), transfer to another health care facility (9.6%), or referral to a drug detox/dependency program (5.8%) ( [Table 8](#tab8)). Most other patients (52.5%) were treated and released to home, with the remainder (8.1%) experiencing other outcomes. |Patient disposition||ED visits||Percent of ED visits||Rate of ED visits | per 100,000 population (1) |(1) All rates are ED visits per 100,000 population.

The overall level of ED visits involving illicit drugs was stable between 2004 and 2011, though several specific illicit drug categories experienced increased involvement over the 8 years. With 455,668 visits in 2011, marijuana experienced a 62 percent increase between 2004 and 2011. MDMA (Ecstasy) involvement more than doubled, reaching over 20,000 visits in 2011. The category of miscellaneous hallucinogens also more than doubled, with about 8,000 visits in 2011. In the short term, between 2009 and 2011, illicit drugs overall as well as individual drugs have experienced significant increases. Contributing to the overall 29 percent 2-year increase in illicit drug involvement are rises in the involvement of synthetic cannabinoids, amphetamines, methamphetamine, PCP, and various combinations of these drugs. Synthetic cannabinoids first appeared in DAWN records in 2009, though at levels too small to be reported. By 2010, ED visits involving synthetic cannabinoids rose to a reportable level for the nation: 11,406 visits. By 2011, the number reached 28,531 visits, a 150 percent 1-year increase. Amphetamines involvement saw an 89 percent increase, and methamphetamine involvement had a 61 percent increase between 2009 and 2011 for a total of about 160,000 visits in 2011. PCP rose 106 percent over the 2 years, going from about 36,000 visits in 2009 to about 50,000 in 2010 and about 75,000 visits in 2011. Combination illicit drugs (e.g., cocaine/heroin combinations called \"speedballs,\" marijuana mixed with PCP [\"angel dust\"]) increased 116 percent since 2009, reaching over 10,000 visits in 2011. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), more than 150 medications have harmful additive or interactive effects when combined with alcohol. The harmful effects of combining drugs with alcohol are heightened by drugs that depress the central nervous system, such as heroin, opiate pain relievers, benzodiazepines (anti-anxiety drugs), antihistamines, and antidepressants. These drug-alcohol interactions may result in increased risk of illness, injury, and even death. Medications for certain disorders\u2014including diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease\u2014also can have harmful interactions with alcohol. [12](#ftn12) In 2011, over 600,000 ED visits involved drugs combined with alcohol ( [Table 10](#tab10)). This represents nearly a quarter of all ED visits associated with drug misuse or abuse. |Alcohol use category (1)||ED visits (2)||Percent of all | drug misuse/ abuse visits |RSE (%)||95% CI: | Lower bound |95% CI: | Upper bound |(1) The classification of drugs used in DAWN is derived from the Multum Lexicon, \u00a9 2012 Lexi-Comp, Inc. and/or Cerner Multum, Inc.

Illicit drugs were involved in over half (57.6%) of ED visits involving alcohol-drug combinations, with cocaine and marijuana representing the greater proportions of such visits (28.6% and 25.0%, respectively) ( [Table 11](#tab11)). Pharmaceuticals were also involved in over half (57.0%) of such visits. Anxiolytics, sedatives, and hypnotics (drugs to treat insomnia and anxiety) were involved in 24.6 percent of visits, with the largest part of that category being benzodiazepines (20.4%). Pain relievers were involved in a similar number of visits (21.8%), with narcotic pain relievers accounting for over half of that number (12.6%). Psychotherapeutic agents (antidepressants and antipsychotics) were involved in 7.7 percent of visits involving alcohol-drug combinations. |Drugs reported with alcohol (1)||ED visits||Percent of ED | visits |Rate of ED visits | per 100,000 population (2) |(1) The classification of drugs used in DAWN is derived from the Multum Lexicon, \u00a9 2012 Lexi-Comp, Inc. and/or Cerner Multum, Inc.

Looking at alcohol involvement from the perspective of all visits involving drug misuse or abuse, DAWN found that about 30 percent of visits involving illicit drugs also involved alcohol ( [Table 12](#tab12)). Among illicit drugs, higher levels of alcohol involvement were found for visits involving ketamine (71.5%). Among visits involving pharmaceuticals, about 25 percent also involved alcohol. Alcohol was present in 38.6 percent of visits involving penicillin, 37.9 percent of visits involving central nervous system (CNS) stimulants (e.g., ADHD drugs), and 31.2 percent of visits involving antidepressants. |Drugs category and selected drugs (1)||All ED visits | involving drug |Percent also | involving alcohol |(1) The classification of drugs used in DAWN is derived from the Multum Lexicon, \u00a9 2012 Lexi-Comp, Inc. and/or Cerner Multum, Inc.

The rate of drug-related ED visits involving alcohol was higher for males (249.5 visits per 100,000 males) than for females (141.5 visits; [Figure 4](#fig4)). By age, the highest rate of alcohol involvement was found for those aged 21 to 24 (393.9 visits per 100,000 population aged 21 to 24), though alcohol involvement was consistently near or above 300 visits per 100,000 population for all the age groups between 21 and 54. |Patient demographics||ED visits||Percent of ED | visits |Rate of ED visits | per 100,000 population (1) |(1) All rates are ED visits per 100,000 population.

Intervention at an early age is critical to preventing these patterns from developing. Intervention during an ED visit may be an efficient way to identify those youth at higher risk. In 2011, of the nearly 440,000 drug abuse-related ED visits made by patients aged 20 or younger, almost half (188,706 visits, or 43.2%) involved alcohol ( [Table 15](#tab15)). category (1)||ED visits (2)||Percent of | drug misuse/ abuse visits made by patients < 21 |RSE (%)||95% CI: | Lower bound |95% CI: | Upper bound |(1) The classification of drugs used in DAWN is derived from the Multum Lexicon, \u00a9 2012 Lexi-Comp, Inc. and/or Cerner Multum, Inc.

Of these ED visits involving underage drinking, 71,991 visits were made by patients aged 12 to 17, and 115,841 visits were made by patients aged 18 to 20 ( [Table 16](#tab16)). Considering rates, though, the difference is more striking. The rate of medical emergencies involving use of alcohol was 286.7 visits per 100,000 population aged 12 to 17 and 857.6 per 100,000 population aged 18 to 20, almost a threefold difference. For those aged 18 to 20, about two thirds of these visits involved just alcohol, with the remainder involving alcohol taken with other drugs ( [Figure 5](#fig5)). The visits were more evenly split between alcohol alone and alcohol in combination with drugs for those aged 12 to 17. |Alcohol use category (1)||ED | visits (2) |Rate of ED | visits per 100,000 population (3) |RSE (%)||95% CI: | Lower bound |95% CI: | Upper bound |(1) The classification of drugs used in DAWN is derived from the Multum Lexicon, \u00a9 2012 Lexi-Comp, Inc. and/or Cerner Multum, Inc.

SOURCE: Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, SAMHSA, Drug Abuse Warning Network, 2011. Involvement of alcohol in drug-related medical emergencies has remained stable over the period from 2004 through 2011. Underage drinking has, likewise, remained constant for youth aged 12 to 17 and young adults aged 18 to 20. There is growing concern in the public health community about the misuse or abuse of pharmaceuticals. When taken as directed for legitimate medical purposes, pharmaceuticals are usually safe and effective. However, when misused, pharmaceuticals can be just as dangerous and debilitating as illegal drugs. [13](#ftn13) As documented by the 2011 National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), misuse of pharmaceuticals appears to be widespread. NSDUH estimated that over 14 million persons aged 12 or older used prescription-type pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, or sedatives nonmedically in 2011. [14](#ftn14) Of the estimated 3.1 million persons aged 12 or older in 2011 who misused or abused drugs for the first time within the past 12 months, more than one in five initiated with nonmedical use of psychotherapeutics (22.0%, including stimulants, and 1.2% with sedatives). Initiation rates for nonmedical pain reliever use continued to be second only to marijuana rates. NSDUH also reported that about 700,000 persons received treatment in the past year for use of pain relievers, exceeding the number for cocaine (511,000 persons), heroin (430,000 persons), or tranquilizers (300,000 persons). DAWN defines nonmedical use to include misuse or abuse of any therapeutic substance. While use of any illicit drug is assumed to constitute drug abuse, nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals must be substantiated in the patient's ED medical records. Evidence supporting nonmedical use includes the following: Nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals may involve a single pharmaceutical, multiple pharmaceuticals, or pharmaceuticals in combination with illicit drugs or alcohol. Pharmaceuticals that the patient may have taken recently but that are not related to the reason for the ED visit are not included in the DAWN data. [15](#ftn15) For 2011, DAWN estimates that 1,244,872 ED visits involved nonmedical use of prescription medicines, over-the-counter drugs, or other types of pharmaceuticals ( [Table 18](#tab18)). This represents about a quarter (24.6%) of all drug-related ED visits and about half (50.5%) of ED visits for drug abuse or misuse. Over half (53.0%) of medical emergencies seen in the ED resulting from nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals involved multiple drugs. [16](#ftn16) About one in five (17.6%) of ED visits involving nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals also involved alcohol. |Drug category and selected drugs (1)||ED | visits |Percent of | ED visits |RSE (%)||95% CI: | Lower bound |95% CI: | Upper bound |(1) The classification of drugs used in DAWN is derived from the Multum Lexicon, \u00a9 2012 Lexi-Comp, Inc. and/or Cerner Multum, Inc.

SOURCE: Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, SAMHSA, Drug Abuse Warning Network, 2011. At 46.1 percent, pain relievers were the most common type of drugs involved in medical emergencies associated with nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals; narcotic pain relievers were involved in 29.4 percent. Specific narcotic pain relievers seen more commonly were oxycodone, hydrocodone, and methadone at 12.1, 6.6, and 5.4 aspirin\u2014were at levels below 4 percent. Anxiolytics, sedatives, and hypnotics (drugs to treat anxiety and insomnia) were found in 33.9 percent of visits related to nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals. Benzodiazepines were involved in 28.7 percent of ED visits, with alprazolam (e.g., Xanax) indicated in about a third (9.9%) of such visits. Among other major categories of drugs, psychotherapeutic agents (antidepressants and antipsychotics) were involved in 10.9 percent of ED visits related to nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals. Central nervous system (CNS) stimulants (e.g., ADHD drugs), respiratory agents, cardiovascular agents, muscle relaxants, and anticonvulsants each were involved in about 3 to 4 percent of ED visits. Other types of drugs were found in under 2 percent of visits. When population size and sampling error are taken into account, visits for nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals did not differ between males and females (399.0 and 399.7 visits per 100,000 population, respectively; [Table 19](#tab19), [Figure 6](#fig6)). The rate of ED visits for patients in age categories between 21 and 29 were over 700 visits per 100,000 population, with lower levels observed for younger and older patients. |Patient demographics||ED visits||Percent of ED | visits |Rate of ED visits | per 100,000 population (1) |(1) All rates are ED visits per 100,000 population.

In terms of race/ethnicity, 72.1 percent of visits related to nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals involved patients who were White, 11.7 percent who were Black, and 8.4 percent who were Hispanic. DAWN does not produce population-based rates for race/ethnicity categories because race/ethnicity information is often missing from ED records. Some form of follow-up was observed for 38.0 percent of patients whose visits involved nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals ( [Table 20](#tab20)). Follow-up included admission to the hospital (25.8%), transfer to another facility (9.6%), and referral to detox/treatment (2.6%). Of the remainder, 56.2 percent of patients were treated and released to home, and 5.7 percent had other outcomes. This distribution of outcomes is similar to that found for patients whose ED visits involved illicit drugs (see [Table 8](#tab8)). |Patient disposition||ED visits||Percent of ED | visits |Rate of ED visits | per 100,000 population (1) |(1) All rates are ED visits per 100,000 population.

Large increases in the number of ED visits involving nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals were observed between 2004 and 2011. It is likely that there are multiple causes contributing to these increases. Some portion may be associated with the greater number of prescriptions being written, making prescription drugs more accessible and able to be diverted. Also, as more people are taking prescription medications as part of their regular health care, there is more risk that drugs taken as prescribed will interact with other drugs that are being used nonmedically. It is beyond the scope of this report to explore the causes behind the growing numbers of ED visits involving misuse or abuse of pharmaceuticals, and further research is needed. Medical emergencies related to nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals increased 132 percent in the period from 2004 to 2011, rising from about a half million visits to about 1.25 million visits. Contributing heavily to this rise was a 183 percent increase in the involvement of drugs classified as opiates/opioids. There were over 315,000 more visits involving opiates/opioids in 2011 than in 2004. Narcotic pain relievers increased 153 percent, or over 220,000 visits, beyond the 2004 level of about 145,000 visits. Among specific opiate drugs, oxycodone had the largest impact, with a 263 percent increase and over 100,000 more visits in 2011 than in 2004. Drugs experiencing large relative increases but having smaller impact included tramadol (e.g., Ultram\u00ae), a narcotic-like opiate agonist used for moderate to severe pain, and hydromorphone (e.g., Dilaudid\u00ae), a morphine derivative. Visits involving tramadol increased 312 percent, reaching 20,000 visits in 2010. Hydromorphone involvement rose 438 percent, reaching almost 20,000 visits in 2011. For about a quarter of visits designated as involving opiates/opioids, the type of opiate involved was not reported in the ED records. The category \"Opiates/opioids unspecified\" rose 334 percent, with over 100,000 more visits in 2011 than in 2004. Between 2004 and 2011, the number of visits involving drugs for anxiety and insomnia increased 138 percent overall\u2014a jump of more than 244,000 visits over the 2004 level of about 180,000 visits. Benzodiazepines (e.g., alprazolam, clonazepam, diazepam, lorazepam) increased 149 percent and were involved in about 215,000 more visits in 2011 than in 2004. Visits involving zolpidem (e.g., Ambien\u00ae), a sleeping aid with benzodiazepine-like properties, increased 136 percent, reaching over 30,000 visits in 2011. Trends in the short term are quite different from those observed in the long term. Overall, visits involving nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals increased just 15 percent over the 2 years between 2009 and 2011, about half the annual rate of increase seen in earlier years. There was no increase in overall opioid/opiates involvement in the short term. Among specific drugs, there were no measureable increases in visits involving the involvement dropped from a high of over 13,000 visits in 2008 to under 2,000 visits in 2011 (88%); [18](#ftn18) and hydrocodone involvement dropped 14 percent, or over 13,000 visits in the 1 year between 2010 and 2011. The most notable exception was for the category \"Opiates/opioids unspecified,\" which increased 64 percent, or over 50,000 visits, between 2009 and 2011. The other exception is buprenorphine products, whose involvement increased by a little over 7,000 visits between 2009 and 2011 (51%). This trend likely reflects the increased availability of buprenorphine after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved its use for treatment of opioid dependence in 2002 and also the increasing number of physicians who subsequently became certified to prescribe it. [19](#ftn19) In 2005, approximately 100,000 patients had received a buprenorphine prescription. By 2010, more than 800,000 patients had received a prescription\u2014an eightfold increase. [20](#ftn20) With one exception, there have been no short-term increases in the involvement of drugs for anxiety and insomnia between 2009 and 2011. The exception is barbiturates, whose involvement increased by a little under 7,000 visits between 2010 and 2011. One category of drugs that has experienced both short- and long-term increases in involvement is CNS stimulants (e.g., ADHD drugs). With over 40,000 visits in 2011, visits with CNS stimulant involvement increased 307 percent in the long term and 85 percent in the short term. Among specific CNS stimulants, the ADHD drug amphetamine-dextroamphetamine (e.g., Adderall\u00ae) saw a 650 percent increase in the long term and 100 percent increase in the short term, for a total of over 17,000 visits in 2011. This growth in involvement of CNS stimulants echoes the previously noted short-term rise in illicit stimulants, where amphetamines/methamphetamine saw a 71% increase and a rise of over 66,000 visits between 2009 and 2011. According to the National Vital Statistics System, there were 38,285 suicide deaths in 2011 in the United States. [21](#ftn21) Suicide was the second leading cause of death for adults aged 15 to 24 and the fourth leading cause for those aged 5 to 14 and 25 to 44. [22](#ftn22) Substance abuse is strongly associated with suicide attempts. Evidence suggests that one third of those who died by suicide were positive for alcohol at the time of death and that nearly one in five had evidence of opiates in their system. [23](#ftn23) Highlighting the relevance of drugs to the overall problem of life-threatening suicide attempts, the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control estimated that, overall, there were about 420,000 ED visits per year for the past 5 years resulting from self-harm; for the same range of years, DAWN estimated there were about 210,000 ED visits for suicide attempts involving drugs per year, or about half the total number of all visits for self-harm. [24](#ftn24) DAWN data provide a unique window to study life-threatening suicide attempts that involve drugs in respect to the types of drugs involved, the characteristics of the patients, and the follow-up treatments provided. DAWN reports on suicide attempts involving all types of illicit drugs and prescription drugs as well as over-the-counter products and attempts involving alcohol alone for patients aged 20 or younger. DAWN cases are not limited to drug overdoses. Suicide attempts involving firearms, for example, are included as DAWN cases if drugs are noted as being involved at the time of the suicide attempt. [25](#ftn25) DAWN estimated there were 228,366 ED visits resulting from drug-related suicide attempts in 2011 ( [Table 22](#tab22)). Almost all (94.7%) involved a prescription drug or over-the-counter medication, about two thirds (64.4%) involved multiple drugs, and over one quarter (29.0%) involved alcohol. |Drug category and selected drugs (1)||ED visits||Percent | of ED visits |RSE (%)||95% CI: | Lower bound |95% CI: | Upper bound |(1) The classification of drugs used in DAWN is derived from the Multum Lexicon, \u00a9 2012 Lexi-Comp, Inc. and/or Cerner Multum, Inc.

Marijuana and cocaine were the more commonly involved illicit drugs, appearing in 6.8 and 6.3 percent of visits, respectively. Pharmaceuticals were much more common than illicit drugs in suicide attempts: After population size and sampling error are taken into account, the rate of drug-related suicide-attempt visits for females (84.7 visits per 100,000 population) was higher than that for males (61.5 visits) ( [Table 23](#tab23), [Figure 7](#fig7)). Suggesting the vulnerability of youth, rates ranged from a low of 12.0 visits per 100,000 population for those aged 65 or older to a high of 150.6 visits for those aged 18 to 20. |Patient demographics||ED visits||Percent of ED | visits |Rate of ED visits | per 100,000 population (1) |(1) All rates are ED visits per 100,000 population.

The level of follow-up for drug-related suicides is approximately double that found for visits involving illicit drugs or nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals. DAWN only records death as the outcome if the patient died in the ED after admission. DAWN does not record deaths for patients who died prior to admission to the ED or after admission to inpatient units of the hospital or transfer to another facility. Therefore, death as an ED disposition is rarely observed by DAWN. This section presents the trends in the estimates of drug-related ED visits involving suicide attempts for the period from 2004 through 2011.

With about 230,000 visits in 2011, the number of drug-related suicide attempts has risen 41 percent from 2004 to 2011 ( [Table 25](#tab25)). |Drug category and selected drugs (1)||ED visits, | 2004 |ED visits, | 2005 |ED visits, | 2006 |ED visits, | 2007 |ED visits, | 2008 |ED visits, | 2009 |ED visits, | 2010 |ED visits, | 2011 |Percent | change, 2004, 2011 (2) |Percent | change, 2009, 2011 (2) |Percent | change, 2010, 2011 (2) |(1) The classification of drugs used in DAWN is derived from the Multum Lexicon, \u00a9 2012 Lexi-Comp, Inc. and/or Cerner Multum, Inc.

The DAWN category of visits referred to as \"seeking detox\" includes nonemergency requests for admission for detoxification and visits to obtain medical clearance before entry to a detox program as well as acute emergencies in which an individual is experiencing withdrawal symptoms and seeking detox. [26](#ftn26) Because detox may be sought through other avenues (e.g., direct admission to a hospital, services provided through private clinics, entry into programs outside the community), the overall demand for detox services is most likely higher than suggested by DAWN estimates. DAWN estimates that there were 250,596 drug-related ED visits for patients seeking detox or substance abuse treatment services during 2011 ( [Table 26](#tab26)). Visits for almost three quarters (66.4%) of patients seeking detox involved multiple drugs. On average, 27.9 percent of visits associated with seeking detox involved alcohol. [27](#ftn27) Approximately 60 percent of visits involved illicit drugs and 60 percent involved pharmaceuticals. Cocaine was observed in 24.2 percent of visits, heroin in 31.5 percent, marijuana in 14.5 percent, and amphetamines/methamphetamine in 6.6 percent. Other illicit drugs were seen at lower levels. Among pharmaceuticals, narcotic pain relievers were observed in 37.6 percent of visits, including oxycodone at 17.1 percent. Benzodiazepines (anti-anxiety drugs) were observed in 21.8 percent of visits, with alprazolam (e.g., Xanax) at 12.0 percent accounting for about half. |Drug category and selected drugs (1)||ED | visits |Percent | of ED visits |RSE (%)||95% CI: | Lower bound |95% CI: | Upper bound |(1) The classification of drugs used in DAWN is derived from the Multum Lexicon, \u00a9 2012 Lexi-Comp, Inc. and/or Cerner Multum, Inc.

In terms of race/ethnicity, the majority (77.2%) of seeking detox visits involved patients who were White, 12.6 percent who were Black, and 4.7 percent who were Hispanic. DAWN does not produce population-based rates for race/ethnicity categories because race/ethnicity information is often missing in ED records. Nearly 60 percent (57.4%) of ED patients classified as seeking detox obtained some follow-up based on their ED visit: 30.4 percent were admitted to the hospital, 20.1 percent were referred to detox/treatment services, and 6.9 percent were transferred to another facility ( [Table 28](#tab28)). The remaining patients were treated and discharged home (38.5%) or had other outcomes (4.1%). |Patient disposition||ED visits||Percent of ED visits||Rate of ED visits | per 100,000 population (1) |(1) All rates are ED visits per 100,000 population.

While ED visits by patients seeking detox for illicit drugs did not change significantly either in the long or short term, a short-term increase of 36 percent between 2009 and 2011 was observed for heroin, with over 20,000 more visits in 2011 than in 2009. Pharmaceutical involvement in ED visits seeking detox has also been stable, with the exception of a 1-year spike in oxycodone. Between 2009 and 2010, involvement of oxycodone rose 47 percent but then dropped 36 percent between 2010 and 2011, returning to its 2009 level. [28](#ftn28) Adverse reactions to pharmaceuticals are a growing problem in the United States. It is likely that there are multiple causes contributing to increases in adverse reactions. Some portion may be associated with the greater number of prescriptions being written and more people taking prescription drugs as part of their medical care. Additionally, people of all ages are increasingly being prescribed multiple drugs simultaneously, which, in turn, increases the possibility for unintended interactions. This is particularly common among older populations who are placed on long-term medication for chronic conditions, and the number of older persons in the nation is growing. [29](#ftn29) While it is beyond the scope of this report to assess the precise impact of these different causes, DAWN data provide insight concerning the number and characteristics of medical emergencies resulting from the recent use of prescription drugs, over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, or other therapeutic substances used as prescribed or indicated. Included in DAWN are ED visits related to side effects, drug-drug interactions, and drug-alcohol interactions. Visits involving illicit drug abuse or documented misuse of pharmaceuticals are excluded from this grouping. [30](#ftn30) As with all ED visits that DAWN considers to be drug related, the involvement of a drug must be documented in the ED records. If the relationship between a drug and an adverse reaction is not recognized, a visit will not be considered drug related and will not be captured by DAWN. Also, adverse reactions that are identified in different medical settings (e.g., during a visit to the doctor's office or while a patient is already hospitalized) will not be captured by DAWN. Therefore, the total number of people experiencing adverse drug reactions is greater than reported by DAWN. For 2011, DAWN estimates that 2,301,059 ED visits ( [Table 30](#tab30)), or 738.5 visits per 100,000 population ( [Table 31](#tab31)), involved adverse reactions to prescription medicines, over-the-counter drugs, or other types of pharmaceuticals. This represents just under half (45.4%) of all drug-related ED visits. About one in five (17.6%) involved multiple drugs. Alcohol was a contributing factor in just 1.3 percent of adverse reaction visits. |Drug category and selected drugs (1)||ED visits||Percent | of ED visits |RSE | (%) |95% CI: | Lower bound |95% CI: | Upper bound |(1) The classification of drugs used in DAWN is derived from the Multum Lexicon, \u00a9 2012 Lexi-Comp, Inc. and/or Cerner Multum, Inc.

Not surprisingly, given their widespread use, anti-infectives (e.g., antibiotics) were found to be involved in 22.5 percent of adverse reaction visits. Of these, penicillins were involved in 6.1 percent of adverse reaction visits, followed by sulfonamides (e.g., sulfa drugs) in 3.9 percent, quinolones (e.g., Cipro\u00ae) in 2.8 percent, cephalosporins (e.g., Keflex\u00ae) in 2.5 percent, and macrolides (e.g., Zithromax\u00ae) in 1.8 percent. Pain relievers were found to be involved in 15.7 percent of visits. Among these, 8.3 percent involved narcotic pain relievers, 3.3 percent involved nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), 1.5 percent involved aspirin products, and under 1.0 percent involved acetaminophen products. Cardiovascular agents were found to be involved in 9.3 percent of visits. Among these, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (e.g., Prinivil\u00ae, Zestril\u00ae) were involved in 2.9 percent and beta blockers (e.g., Lopressor\u00ae, Toprol XL\u00ae) in 2.0 percent. Appearing in between 5 and 6 percent of visits each were anticoagulants (e.g., Coumadin\u00ae), antidiabetic agents (e.g., insulin), and antineoplastics (chemotherapy drugs). Appearing in between 3 and 5 percent of visits each were antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anxiolytics (drugs used to treat insomnia and anxiety). When population size and sampling error were taken into account, women had notably more visits than men (887.3 and 584.2 visits per 100,000 population, respectively; [Table 31](#tab31), [Figure 9](#fig9)). For children aged 5 and under, the rate of ED visits for adverse reactions was 842.4 visits per 100,000 population. The rate dropped to a low of 248.2 visits for children aged 6 to 11 and then rose consistently to reach a high of 1,525.8 visits for patients aged 65 or older. Figure 9.

In terms of race/ethnicity, 65.6 percent of visits related to adverse reaction to pharmaceuticals involved patients who were White, 13.7 percent who were Black, and 10.9 percent who were Hispanic. DAWN does not produce population-based rates for race/ethnicity categories because race/ethnicity information is often missing from ED records. About three quarters (76.6%) of patients were treated and released ( [Table 32](#tab32)). About a fifth (20.6%) of patients were admitted to the hospital, and the remainder (2.8%) had other outcomes. |Patient disposition||ED visits||Percent of ED | visits |Rate of ED visits | per 100,000 population (1) |(1) All rates are ED visits per 100,000 population.

SOURCE: Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, SAMHSA, Drug Abuse Warning Network, 2011. ED visits resulting from adverse reactions to pharmaceuticals increased 84 percent in the period from 2005 to 2011, rising from about 1.3 million visits to about 2.3 million visits. The number of ED visits for adverse reactions to pharmaceuticals rose by about a quarter million visits, or more, per year between 2005 and 2008, leveling off at about 2.3 million visits per year over the period from 2009 to 2011. Accordingly, most drugs, though not all, have seen some increase in involvement in the long term between 2005 and 2011 but, unless noted otherwise, no short-term increases. The following remarks are ordered by number of visits in 2011. To be classified by DAWN as an accidental ingestion ED visit, a drug must have been taken unintentionally or without it being known which drug was actually taken. The drug may be taken by the patient or given to the patient by someone else (e.g., a parent giving medication to a child). [32](#ftn32) This chapter focuses on the characteristics of accidental ingestion ED visits for children aged 5 and under as the preponderance of ED visits for accidental ingestion involve children in this age range. In 2011, DAWN found 77,074 ED visits out of a total of 113,624 involved children aged 5 and under. The rate of these ED visits was about 25 times higher for children aged 5 and under than for adults: 317.8 visits per 100,000 children aged 5 and under compared with 12.9 visits per 100,000 for the general adult population aged 21 or older ( [Figure 10](#fig10)). As soon as infants learn to crawl and especially once they learn to walk, their mobility, curiosity, and tendency to put things in their mouths make many substances in the home a potential danger. [33](#ftn33) Pharmaceutical products belonging to other household members present a particularly critical danger to children because, due to their physiology and smaller size, children's unintended ingestions of even small amounts can lead to medical emergencies requiring care in an ED. [34](#ftn34) This combination of propensity, accessibility, and susceptibility is evidenced in calls to poison control centers, where over half (51.0%) of human exposure calls involve children aged 5 and under and where 14 of the top 25 substances involved in pediatric exposure are drugs and therapeutic substances. [35](#ftn35) Figure 10. Rates of ED visits per 100,000 population involving accidental ingestion of pharmaceuticals, by age, 2011 SOURCE: Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, SAMHSA, Drug Abuse Warning Network, 2011. Drugs recognized as being particularly dangerous when accidentally ingested by children include pain medications, such as narcotic pain relievers (e.g., oxycodone, hydrocodone); cardiac medications, such as calcium channel blockers (\"heart pills\") and blood pressure and nasal sprays (e.g., Afrin\u00ae).

Other drugs found at measureable levels included the following: A negligible number of visits involved alcohol or illicit drugs. Overall, there were 317.8 ED visits per 100,000 persons aged 0 to 5 resulting from accidental ingestion of drugs or other therapeutic substances ( [Table 35](#tab35)). The Consumer Product Safety Commission's National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) reported a similar rate of 336.1 drug poisoning injuries treated in an ED per 100,000 population aged 0 to 4.

Medical emergencies related to accidental ingestions by patients aged 5 and under were stable from 2004 to 2011, though increases were observed for particular drug groups. With over 8,000 visits recorded in 2011, drugs to treat anxiety and insomnia rose 120 percent since 2004. With about 5,000 visits in 2011, narcotic pain relievers rose 225 percent over that period. Topical agents rose 219 percent, reaching over 7,000 visits in 2011. Hormone-containing drugs increased in the long term by 280 percent, reaching over 2,000 visits in 2011. No increases were observed in the short term, and two drugs groups, benzodiazepines and respiratory agents, saw declines (35% and 30%, respectively) in the 1 year between 2010 and 2011. The decrease in benzodiazepine involvement appears to part of general decline that began in 2008. The decrease in respiratory agents merely offsets a 1-year spike that occurred between 2009 and 2010, returning visits to their 2009 level.

DAWN Field Reporters are careful to distinguish abuse from adverse reactions when classifying visits involving these drugs. [7](#ftnref7) Heroin-related ED visits may be slightly underestimated. When drugs related to an ED visit are determined through toxicology tests, heroin metabolites are indistinguishable from other opiates unless a test specifically for the heroin metabolite is conducted. In the absence of this test, or if there is no evidence in the written record that heroin, specifically, was involved, the visit will be grouped with pharmaceuticals labeled \"unspecified opiates\" and not classified as heroin, an illicit drug. The number of drug misuse or abuse ED visits involving unspecified opiates is estimated at 157,981 visits, and about 53 percent of these (84,499 visits) were determined through toxicology testing. The portion that is attributable to heroin is unknown. [8](#ftnref8) European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA). (2009).

[15](#ftnref15) DAWN tries to capture only pharmaceuticals that are related to the ED visit and actively discourages reporting of current medications that are unrelated to the visit. Given the limitations of medical record documentation, though, it is not always possible to distinguish and exclude current medications that are unrelated to the visit. This limitation may have the effect of overstating the variety of pharmaceuticals involved in ED visits. [16](#ftnref16) Multiple drugs may not all be taken for the same reason; a patient may misuse one type of prescription medication while taking another medication as prescribed. To be counted as a DAWN case involving multiple drugs, though, both drugs must be involved as a reason for the ED visit (e.g., the drugs' interaction caused or worsened the medical emergency). [17](#ftnref17) ED records frequently do not distinguish methadone used properly for the treatment of opiate addiction (and not specifically related to the ED visit) from nonmedical methadone use (related to the ED visit). This could result in overreporting the estimated number of ED visits related to methadone, but the extent of the overreporting is unknown. [18](#ftnref18) In November 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a recommendation against continued prescribing and use of the pain reliever propoxyphene because new data showed that the drug may cause serious toxicity to the heart, even when used at therapeutic doses. FDA requested that companies voluntarily withdraw propoxyphene from the U.S. market. Propoxyphene is an opioid pain reliever used to treat mild-to-moderate pain. It is sold under various names as a single-ingredient product (e.g., Darvon\u00ae) and as part of a combination product with acetaminophen (e.g., Darvocet\u00ae).

This glossary defines terms used in data collection activities, analyses, and publications associated with the emergency department (ED) component of the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN). The glossary is updated to reflect terms and conventions applicable in the 2011 data collection year. Accidental ingestion: This category of drug-related ED visits includes those involving the accidental ingestion of a drug, for example, childhood drug poisonings and individuals who take the wrong medication by mistake. It includes a caregiver administering the wrong medicine by mistake. It does not include a patient taking more medicine than directed because the patient forgot to take it earlier. (See Nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals, Overmedication.) Adverse reaction: This category of drug-related ED visits represents the use of a prescription or over-the-counter pharmaceutical for therapeutic purposes that results in an ED visit due to adverse drug reactions, side effects, drug-drug interactions, and drug-alcohol interactions. Although adverse reactions are typically limited to pharmaceuticals, a small number of adverse reaction visits involve (a) illicit drugs for which there are legitimate pharmaceutical versions, and (b) pharmaceutical inhalants (such as anesthetic gases). Alcohol use: DAWN notes whether alcohol was involved in addition to other drug(s) for patients of all ages. Because alcohol is considered an illicit drug for minors, alcohol without the involvement of other drugs is considered a drug-related ED visit for patients under the age of 21. (See Drug misuse or abuse and Underage drinking.) Case description: A description of how the drug(s) were related to the patient's ED visit. The case description, in conjunction with other documentation in the ED medical record, is used to determine whether the ED visit is reportable to DAWN. It is copied verbatim from the patient's chart when possible. Case type: See Type of case. Case type other: See Drug misuse or abuse. Confidence interval (CI): An interval estimate, that is, a range of values around a point estimate that takes sampling error into account. A broadly accepted standard of confidence is 95 percent. If repeated samples were drawn from the same population of hospitals using the same sampling and data collection procedures, the true population value would fall within the CI 95 percent of the time. A 95 percent CI is a straightforward way to summarizes both the estimate and its margin of error. Diagnosis: The condition(s) for which the patient was treated as determined by the clinician after evaluation. Disposition: The location or facility to which an ED patient was referred, transferred, or released. Treated and released includes three categories: Admitted to this hospital includes five categories of inpatient units: Other disposition includes five categories: Drug: A substance that is (a) used as a medication or in the preparation of medication; (b) an illicit substance that causes addiction, habituation, or a marked change in consciousness; or (c) both. Substances reportable to DAWN include alcohol; illicit drugs (e.g., club drugs, cocaine, heroin, marijuana, synthetic cannabinoids, amphetamines/methamphetamine); nonpharmaceutical inhalants; prescription drugs (e.g., drugs for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, antibiotics, antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticoagulants, beta blockers, birth control pills, hormone replacement, insulin, muscle relaxants, pain relievers, sleeping aids); drugs used in treatment of medical conditions (e.g., respiratory therapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy); vaccines; dietary supplements; vitamins; and other over-the-counter pharmaceutical products. DAWN publications use the term \"drug\" to refer to any of these substances. Multiple substances can be reported for each DAWN case. Therefore, the total number of drugs exceeds the total number of DAWN cases reported. Drug category: A generic grouping of related pharmaceuticals or other substances reported to DAWN, based on the classification system developed by Multum Information Services, a subsidiary of the Cerner Corporation, and modified for use with DAWN. The Multum Lexicon is available at [http://www.multum.com/](http://www.multum.com). In general, the Multum drug categories reflect the therapeutic uses for prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals. Additional clarification is provided for the following drug categories, because these are unique to DAWN: Drug misuse or abuse: A group of ED visits defined broadly to include all visits associated with illicit drugs, alcohol use in combination with other drugs, alcohol use alone among those younger than 21 years, and nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals. (See also Alcohol use, Illicit drug use, Nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals, and Underage drinking.) Drug-related ED visit: This category includes any ED visit related to recent drug use. To be a DAWN case, the ED visit must have involved a drug, either as the direct cause of the visit or as a contributing factor. (See also Single-drug case.) One patient may make repeated visits to an ED or to several EDs, thus producing a number of visits. The number of unique patients involved in the reported drug-related ED visits cannot be estimated because no direct patient identifiers are collected by DAWN. There are some circumstances in which ED visits are not reviewed for DAWN. These include persons who left before being seen by a physician, visits for suture removal, and direct admission to the hospital through the ED for women in labor. Estimate: A statistical estimate is the value of a parameter (such as the number of drug-related ED visits) for the universe that is derived by applying sampling weights and other adjustments to data from a sample. Estimates of drug-related ED visits are calculated by applying weights and adjustments to the data provided by the sampled hospitals participating in DAWN. The sampling weights reflect the probability of selection; separate adjustment factors account for nonresponse, data quality, and the known total of ED visits delivered by the universe of eligible hospitals as identified by the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey Database (ASDB) for the relevant time period. GHB: Gammahydroxybutyric acid, a hallucinogen and depressant frequently combined with alcohol and other beverages. Also used by bodybuilders to aid in fat reduction and muscle building. For further information, see [http://www.drugabuse.gov/infofacts/infofactsindex.html](http://www.drugabuse.gov/infofacts/infofactsindex.html). Hospital emergency department (ED): An emergency department (ED) (also known as an emergency room) is a medical treatment facility, specializing in acute care of patients who present without prior appointment, either by their own means or by ambulance. EDs are usually found in hospitals or other primary care centers. Only EDs in hospitals that meet DAWN's eligibility criteria may participate in DAWN. For information on drug-related ED visits, DAWN relies exclusively on medical records maintained by EDs. No patients, ED staff, or other records are consulted. DAWN is based on a sample of hospitals; in the cases where there are multiple EDs in a hospital, records from all the EDs are reviewed to identify drug-related cases. (See Universe.) Illicit drug use: This category of drug-related ED visits includes all visits related to the use of illicit or illegal drugs. Illicit drugs include Additional clarification is provided for the following drug categories: LSD: d-lysergic acid diethylamide, a hallucinogen usually taken orally. For further information, see [http://www.drugabuse.gov/infofacts/infofactsindex.html](http://www.drugabuse.gov/infofacts/infofactsindex.html). Malicious poisoning: See Nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals. MDMA: Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, a hallucinogen with stimulant effects, usually taken orally. For further information, see [http://www.drugabuse.gov/infofacts/infofactsindex.html](http://www.drugabuse.gov/infofacts/infofactsindex.html). Metropolitan area: An area comprising a relatively large core city or cities and the adjacent geographic areas. Conceptually, these areas are integrated economic and social units with a large population center. Unless otherwise noted, DAWN metropolitan areas correspond to Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) based on the 2000 decennial census and updated in 2003. DAWN also prepares estimates for subsections of three of the large MSAs that correspond to MSA Divisions; in a fourth MSA, subsections were established by local users of DAWN data. Nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals: Nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals includes taking more than the prescribed dose of a prescription pharmaceutical or more than the recommended dose of an over-the-counter pharmaceutical or supplement; taking a pharmaceutical prescribed for another individual; deliberate poisoning with a pharmaceutical by another person; and documented misuse or abuse of a prescription drug, an over-the-counter pharmaceutical, or a dietary supplement. Nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals may involve pharmaceuticals alone or pharmaceuticals in combination with illicit drugs or alcohol. Nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals includes prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals in ED visits that are of the following types of cases: (See also Drug misuse or abuse and Type of case.) Not otherwise specified (NOS): This is the catchall category for substances that are not specifically named but are known to be reportable to DAWN. Terms are classified into an NOS category only when assignment to a more specific category is not possible based on the information in the source documentation (ED patient charts). Not tabulated above (NTA): This designation is used when drugs or drug categories are not explicitly listed in a table. Low-incidence drugs (or drug categories) falling under a broader drug classification may be summarized into a single row under that classification and labeled as NTA. Overmedication: See Nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals. Oversampling: Without oversampling, one would expect a sample to resemble the population from which it was drawn. Oversampling implies the deliberate selection of a much higher proportion of certain types of sampling units than would normally be obtained in a simple, random sample. The deliberate selection of certain types of sample units is done to improve the precision of estimates of the properties of these types of sampling units. This is a form of stratified sampling. (See also Sampling, Sample frame, and Sampling unit.) In DAWN, selected metropolitan areas are oversampled so that estimates can be produced for those areas. p-value: A measure of the probability (p) that the difference between two estimates could have occurred by chance, if the estimates being compared were really the same. The larger the p-value, the more likely the difference could have occurred by chance. For example, if the difference between two DAWN estimates has a p-value of 0.05, it means that there is no more than a 5 percent probability that the difference observed could be due to chance alone. PCP: Phencyclidine, a hallucinogenic white crystalline powder that is readily soluble in water or alcohol or may be snorted or smoked. For further information, see [http://www.drugabuse.gov/infofacts/infofactsindex.html](http://www.drugabuse.gov/infofacts/infofactsindex.html). Population: See Universe. Precision: The extent to which an estimate agrees with its mean value in repeated sampling. The precision of an estimate is measured inversely by its standard error (SE) or relative standard error (RSE). In DAWN publications, estimates with RSEs greater than 50 percent are regarded as too imprecise to be published. ED table cells where such estimates would have appeared contain the asterisk symbol (*). (See also Relative standard error.) Race/ethnicity: Race/ethnicity data in DAWN are collected retrospectively from the medical record. This approach involves a single question listing six race/ethnicity groups (plus not documented) and allows for multiple responses. [1](#attafn1) For published reports, DAWN collapses the reported race/ethnicity information into four mutually exclusive categories, plus an unknown category, as follows: Race/ethnicity is missing from ED patient records about 10 to 20 percent of the time, although this varies widely by hospital. In some cases, the race information is ambiguous (e.g., \"European\"), and detail about multiple races/ethnicities is often missing. Rates of ED visits per 100,000 are not calculated for race/ethnicity categories because of these data limitations. Rate: A measure of the incidence of drug-related ED visits per 100,000 population. A rate can be calculated for the total population or for any subset defined by characteristics such as age and sex. Relative standard error (RSE): A measure of an estimate's relative precision. The RSE of an estimate is equal to the estimate's standard error (SE) divided by the estimate itself. For example, an estimate of 2,000 cocaine visits with an SE of 200 visits has an RSE of 0.1 and is multiplied by 100 to change it to a percentage. This resulting RSE percent value is 10 percent. The larger the RSE, the less precise the estimate. Estimates with an RSE of 50 percent or greater are not published by DAWN. (See also Precision.) Sample frame: A list of units from which a sample is drawn. In DAWN, the hospital is the unit used for the ED sample. All members of the sampling frame have a known probability of being selected. A sampling frame is constructed such that there is no duplication and each unit is identifiable. Ideally, the sampling frame and the universe are the same. The sampling frame for the DAWN hospital ED sample is derived from the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey Database (ASDB). (See also Universe.) Sampling: Sampling is the process of selecting a proper subset of elements from the full population so that the subset can be used to make inference to the population as a whole. A probability sample is one in which each element has a known and positive chance (probability) of selection. A simple random sample is one in which each member has the same chance of selection. In DAWN, a sample of hospitals is selected to make inference to all hospitals; DAWN uses simple random sampling within strata. Sampling unit: A member of a sample selected from a sampling frame. For the DAWN sample, the units are hospitals, and data are collected for drug-related ED visits at the responding hospitals selected for the sample. Sampling weights: Numeric coefficients used to derive population estimates from a sample by adjusting for deviations from the original sample design due to unequal probability sampling, variable nonresponse, and other potential sources of bias. Seeking detox: This category of drug-related ED visits reflects patients seeking substance abuse treatment, drug rehabilitation, or medical clearance for admission to a drug treatment or detoxification unit. They are classified separately because they often reflect administrative practices that vary across hospitals and may vary over time within the same hospital. Seeking detox visits tend to be concentrated in those facilities that operate specialized inpatient units providing substance abuse treatment or detoxification services, and the largest numbers are found in facilities that require medical clearance for entry into such treatment to be granted in their EDs. Single-drug case: An ED visit in which only one drug was involved. The single drug may be the direct cause of the visit or a contributing factor as determined by the medical evaluation done in the ED. Because DAWN considers alcohol to be an illicit drug for minors, DAWN includes visits where alcohol is the single drug if the patient is younger than 21 years of age. Statistically significant: A difference between two estimates is said to be statistically significant if the value of the statistic used to test the difference is larger or smaller than would be expected by chance alone. For DAWN ED estimates, a difference is considered statistically significant if the p-value is less than 0.05. (See also p-value.) Strata (plural), stratum (singular): Subgroups of a universe within which separate ED samples are drawn. Stratification is used to increase the precision of estimates for a given sample size or, conversely, to reduce the sample size required to achieve the desired level of precision. The DAWN ED sample is stratified into metropolitan area cells plus an additional cell for the remainder of the United States. To ensure thorough coverage within metropolitan areas, the universe of hospitals in each is allocated into substrata identified by (a) two types of hospital ownership (public, private), and (b) up to four size categories (measured in terms of the number of ED visits annually). This allocation creates up to eight substrata in each metropolitan area stratum. Hospitals in the stratum that covers the rest of the United States are stratified first by census region, type of ownership, and size (also measured in terms of ED visits). A systematic sample is selected from each of the geographic strata. Suicide attempt: This type of drug-related ED visit captures suicide attempts that are documented in the medical record and in which a drug was involved. Suicidal gestures, thoughts, or ideation, including attempts to harm oneself, are not included in this category. Synthetic cannabinoids: Synthetic cannabinoids are substances that are designed to be chemically similar to the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). They were initially developed over 40 years ago as therapeutic agents but more recently have been packaged as herbal smoking mixtures or \"herbal incense\" and marketed with claims that their effects mimic those of marijuana. Leading brands were sold under the names \"Spice\" and \"K2,\" but many other brand names appeared over time; these are specified in the DAWN Drug Reference Vocabulary. A comprehensive national ban was enacted in July 2012. For further information, see [http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/spice-synthetic-marijuana](http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/spice-synthetic-marijuana). (See also Illicit drug use.) Type of case: A classification used to define similar DAWN cases for analysis. Each case must be assigned a type and may not be assigned more than one type. Cases are classified into one of the following eight categories: suicide attempt, seeking detox, alcohol only (age younger than 21), adverse reaction, overmedication, malicious poisoning, accidental ingestion, and other. The case is coded into the first group that meets the inclusion criteria for that group. Underage drinking: An ED visit where the patient is under the age of 21 and alcohol is involved. Because DAWN considers alcohol to be an illicit drug for minors, DAWN includes visits where alcohol is the only drug involved and visits where alcohol is present with other drugs. Universe: The entire set of units for which generalizations are drawn. The universe for the DAWN ED sample is all non-Federal, short-stay, general medical and surgical hospitals in the United States that operate one or more EDs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Specialty hospitals, hospital units of institutions, long-term care facilities, pediatric hospitals, hospitals operating part-time EDs, and hospitals operated by the Veterans Health Administration and the Indian Health Service are excluded. The universe of EDs is identified from the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey Database (ASDB).

An understanding of the methodology behind the collection and processing of DAWN data allows data users to better evaluate the validity, representativeness, and meaning of the findings. The methods described here were initiated in 2004 and are current as of 2011. Comparisons across data collection years can only be made for 2004-2011. Due to changes introduced to core survey features\u2014such as the design of the sample, protocol for selecting charts to review, and the eligibility criteria for being a DAWN case in 2004\u2014DAWN data for 2004 and forward are not comparable to data for earlier years (2003 and earlier). This report is organized into eight parts: For convenience, the 2011 DAWN ED Annual Report includes as attachments all methodological documents related to the 2011 data collection year. These attachments include the following: These items individually as well as additional information about DAWN are provided on the DAWN Web site. [1](#attbftn1) Available at the site are This section documents the participation of sampled hospitals in 2011 and other survey methodology information relevant for the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) data collection year 2011. Additional detail on the basic DAWN data collection and survey methodology is provided in subsequent sections. DAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-Federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24-hour emergency department (ED). For data collection year 2011, data were collected from a representative sample of hospitals in the Nation and select metropolitan areas. Over 5 million ED visit charts out of a universe of 12.2 million charts at reporting hospitals were reviewed. [2](#attbftn2) Data submitted by 233 participating hospitals on 229,211 drug-related ED visits were used in estimation ( [Table 1](#methods-tab1)). [3](#attbftn3) Estimates for the entire universe of DAWN-eligible hospitals in the United States are produced by applying poststratified weights to the data received from the participating sampled hospitals. Thus, for 2011, a total of 229,211 submitted cases was extrapolated to an estimate of 5,067,374 drug-related ED visits. Considering the margin of error, this estimate may range from 4,616,753 to 5,517,995 drug-related ED visits out of the approximately 126 million total ED visits estimated for the universe of DAWN-eligible hospitals. Of these approximately 5.1 million drug-related visits, 2.5 million were considered to involve drug misuse or abuse, with the balance primarily involving adverse reactions and accidental ingestions. |Type of visit||Unweighted | sample data |Weighted (%)||95% CI: | Lower bound |95% CI: | Upper bound |(1) Estimates of ED visits are based on a representative sample of non-Federal, short-stay hospitals with 24hour EDs. | (2) These are estimates of drugs involved in ED visits.

Response rates and nonresponse bias were assessed to determine which of these areas had sufficient participation to warrant separate estimates. In 2011, a total of 12 areas (9 metropolitan areas and 3 submetropolitan areas) was determined to be able to support separate estimates. Oversampled hospitals in the areas that could not support separate estimates were treated as if they were not sampled. For 2011, this has the effect of reducing the sample from 1,292 hospitals to 562 hospitals, the number used for purposes of computing the overall response rates. Population estimates used to generate rates (visits per 100,000 population) for 2011 are provided in [Table 3](#methods-tab3). |Age||Total United States||Males||Females| |SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, United States Resident Population Estimates by Age, Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin DAWN produces estimates of ED visits for different types of visits, referred to as DAWN analytic groups. The analytic groups are defined by the reason for the visit and the types of drugs involved (see [Section 5.1](#methods-5.1)). Unlike the type of case categories, DAWN analytic groups are not mutually exclusive. For example, a visit that involves cocaine and oxycodone will be counted in both the illicits analytic group and the nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals analytic group. The total number of ED visits for the seven analytic groups related to drug misuse or abuse are as follows: Estimates for ED visits related to adverse reactions to and accidental ingestions of pharmaceuticals, medications, and other health-related products available over the counter are also produced. These groups are not related to drug abuse or misuse and are as follows: DAWN is a public health surveillance system that reports on drug-related visits to hospital EDs. [4](#attbftn4) DAWN is used to monitor trends in drug misuse and abuse, identify the emergence of new substances and drug combinations, assess health hazards associated with drug use and abuse, and estimate the impact of drug use, misuse, and abuse on the Nation's health care system. DAWN's target sample frame consists of all non-Federal, short-stay, general medical and surgical hospitals in the United States that have one or more EDs open 24 hours a day. DAWN employs a multistage sampling design for the selection of EDs for analysis. Stratified simple random sampling with oversampling in selected metropolitan areas is used to select the hospitals. A DAWN case is any ED visit involving recent drug use. DAWN cases are identified through the review of ED medical records in participating hospitals. DAWN captures both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. These criteria encompass all types of drug-related events, including accidental ingestion and adverse reaction, as well as drug misuse or abuse. Within each hospital, 50 percent to 100 percent of the days of the month are systematically selected, and a census of ED visits is selected for review for these days. DAWN collects data on all types of drugs\u2014illegal drugs, prescription and over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, and both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical inhalants. DAWN notes whether alcohol is involved in addition to drug(s) for patients of all ages. Because alcohol is considered an illicit drug for minors, alcohol abuse without the involvement of other drugs is considered a drug-related ED visit for patients under the age of 21. DAWN does not report current medications (i.e., medications and pharmaceuticals taken regularly by the patient as prescribed or indicated) that are deemed by the ED medical staff to be unrelated to the ED visit. DAWN classifies drugs using a modified version of the Multum Lexicon, \u00a9 2012, a drug vocabulary and classification tool originated by Multum Information Services, Inc. DAWN has adapted the Lexicon to allow for the inclusion of illegal drugs, inhalants, and alternative medicines that are reported to DAWN. Annually, DAWN produces estimates of drug-related visits to hospital EDs for the Nation as a whole and for selected metropolitan areas. DAWN Trend Tables contain weighted estimates of drug-related ED visits that are the result of drug misuse or abuse, adverse reactions to drugs, and accidental ingestion of drugs. Among visits resulting from drug misuse or abuse, separate estimates are made of visits involving illicit drugs, nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals, and alcohol. Estimates are also made of ED visits resulting from drug-related suicide attempts, ED visits made by patients seeking detoxification services, and visits involving alcohol (with or without other drugs) for patients under the age of 21. For each of these types of visits, estimates are available by patient sex, age group, and race/ethnicity. Estimates are also provided for each visit's disposition (e.g., treated and released, admitted to the hospital intensive or critical care unit [ICU], died). Estimates are made of the different types of drugs involved in each of these categories of visits. These sets of estimates are prepared for the Nation as a whole and for selected metropolitan areas where hospital participation was high enough to produce reliable results. DAWN Trend Tables containing ED estimates are available at the DAWN Web site. [5](#attbftn5) The document Guide to the DAWN Trend Tables provides guidance on accessing these tables, understanding their content, and locating data items of interest. [6](#attbftn6) The DAWN public use file (PUF) containing ED visit-level data is available through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive (SAMHDA). [7](#attbftn7) The SAMHDA site offers a query capacity to build tables online using the DAWN PUF data as well as the means to download data files. The presentation Analyzing the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) Data available at the DAWN Web site provides guidance on accessing, interpreting, and analyzing DAWN PUF data. Additional detailed documentation for the DAWN PUF is also available at the SAMHDA site. The weights needed to produce estimates representative of the Nation and select metropolitan areas are provided in the DAWN PUF. A lengthier description of SAMHDA's services is provided in [Section 5.9](#methods-5.9) of this document. DAWN is a major component of the Nation's capacity to monitor trends in the morbidity and mortality associated with drug misuse and abuse. DAWN is the only national data system providing estimates of the number of ED admissions associated with drug misuse and abuse and the particular drugs involved both for the United States as a whole and also for selected metropolitan areas. Additionally, DAWN is the only national data collection system on drug abuse with the capacity to monitor specific and relatively infrequently used substances of abuse (e.g., club drugs, phencyclidine [PCP], or medications used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD]) as they emerge and diffuse across population groups and geographic areas. Within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), DAWN data help SAMHSA to target program resources to areas of greatest need and to assess program impact. For example, as part of its intervention programming, SAMHSA uses DAWN data to monitor adverse events associated with buprenorphine treatment for opiate addiction. Additionally, DAWN data are used by the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ) to prepare reports on topics of interest to the public health community, to provide regular updates to SAMHSA and other federal agencies on trends in drug involvement, and to respond to ad hoc inquiries from public health researchers. DAWN estimates are used to monitor trends in major substances of abuse (e.g., heroin, cocaine, marijuana); to assess alcohol use by minors that results in ED visits; to identify emerging new drugs of abuse (e.g., synthetic cannabinoids, \"bath salts\"); and to identify the misuse and abuse potential of prescription and over-the-counter drugs. The DAWN Web site provides a complete listing of all publicly available reports developed by SAMHSA using DAWN data. Outside of SAMHSA, DAWN is used by national, state, and local health professionals, policymakers, law enforcement officers, and pharmacologists to understand the consequences of drug use and abuse and to identify emerging trends and changing patterns of drug use. The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy uses DAWN data to monitor national trends; the Drug Enforcement Administration uses it for surveillance, diversion control, and intelligence; and, at the direction of the Food and Drug Administration, the pharmaceutical industry uses it to conduct post-marketing surveillance of prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, monitor adverse events associated with medications, and assess the abuse potential that drives labeling and scheduling decisions. State and local professionals, including law enforcement and the Community Epidemiology Work Group, use DAWN to assess changes in local trends and patterns of drug use. DAWN data are collected through a retrospective review of ED medical records for patients treated in the ED. Patients or families are never interviewed. The review of source records is performed by a trained DAWN Reporter in each member facility. Depending on the needs of the facility, the DAWN Reporter may be an employee of the hospital or an employee of the DAWN operations contractor. For each facility that participates in DAWN, the designated DAWN Reporter reviews all medical records to find ED visits related to drug use. The DAWN Reporter submits an electronic case report to the DAWN system for each ED visit that meets the specific case selection criteria. DAWN Reporters also track, on a copy of the ED registration log, their progress in reviewing the universe of ED visits. Because of the volume in some EDs, a sample of medical records is obtained rather than reviewing a census. This subsampling introduces another component of variance that is accounted for in the weighting and estimation process. A DAWN case is any ED visit where the patient was treated in the ED for a condition that was induced by or related to recent drug use. The patient chart is reviewed by the DAWN Reporter to determine if there is evidence that a drug(s) is involved. The patient ED chart has three key areas, and this evidence may come from any one of these areas: patient's chief complaint; physician's, nurse's, and/or other appropriate clinician's assessment; and/or diagnosis detail. The drug use must be implicated in the ED visit, but it does not need to be the direct cause. The reason a patient used a drug is not a factor in determining whether the ED visit is a DAWN case. Only drugs that are determined to be involved are recorded in the DAWN system. Unrelated drugs that are simply \"on board\" are not recorded. As a result of these criteria and approaches, DAWN includes ED visits associated with substance abuse and misuse, both intentional and accidental, as well as ED visits related to the use of drugs for legitimate therapeutic purposes and under a doctor's direction. The DAWN visit eligibility criteria are intended to be broad and inclusive and to have few exceptions. They take into account the fact that documentation in medical records varies in clarity and completeness across hospitals and among clinicians within hospitals. The criteria are designed to minimize the potential for DAWN Reporter judgments that could cause data to vary systematically and unexpectedly across different data collectors and hospitals. In addition, the criteria allow for the capture of a diverse set of drug-related visits that can be aggregated or disaggregated to serve a variety of analytical purposes and the interests of multiple audiences. There are a few clearly delineated exceptions to the DAWN eligibility criteria. An ED visit is not a DAWN visit if By design, DAWN's broad case criteria yield a diverse set of visits. To bring order to this heterogeneous mix of ED visits, DAWN Field Reporters assign each visit to one of eight case types. [8](#attbftn8) The eight case types are as follows: Each ED visit is assigned to a single case type. Because many ED visits meet the criteria for more than one case type, the case types are assigned based on an algorithm depicted in the DAWN Decision Tree ( [Figure 1](#methods-fig1)). Each ED visit is assigned to the first applicable case type. To assist DAWN Reporters with case assignment, a series of questions and decision rules is included with the DAWN Decision Tree; detailed instructions are included in the 2007-2011 ED Reference Guide. [9](#attbftn9) The final category in the decision tree, Other, is reserved for DAWN visits that do not meet any of the rules for classification into one of the first seven types. Most cases of drug abuse are classified as Other. This approach, which never directly identifies drug abuse, comes from the recognition that medical records frequently lack explicit documentation of substance abuse. This lack of documentation may occur for several reasons. First, the distinctions among use, misuse, and abuse are often subjective. Second, if there is a low index of suspicion for drug abuse in some types of patients (e.g., older adults), ED physicians may be unlikely to label those types of patients as drug abusers. Third, ED staff may be concerned that the patient's insurance company will disallow coverage if the visit is related to substance abuse. The case type of a visit, in combination with the types of drugs involved, is used to construct groupings of visits that have similar characteristics\u2014for example, visits for drug abuse involving illicit drugs. [Section 5.1](#methods-5.1) provides additional details on how visits are grouped for the purpose of analyses. Figure 1. Type of case decision tree [Figure 2](#methods-fig2) depicts the data items collected by DAWN. Additional detail on key items is provided in the following sections. Figure 2. DAWN ED case form DAWN collects information on basic patient demographics: sex, age, race/ethnicity, and patient home ZIP code. The ZIP code variable has space to indicate if the patient was homeless, institutionalized, or from outside the United States and, therefore, has no home ZIP code. For reporting purposes, age is typically collapsed into the following groups: The age categories used for reporting ED visits reflect critical junctures in drug use. For example, patients aged 5 and under are reported separately to facilitate study of visits involving accidental ingestion. Patients aged 12 to 17 are considered to be in their formative years, and understanding the nature of their drug use is important for prevention efforts. Patients under the age of 21 are reported separately to facilitate study of topics such as underage drinking. Patients aged 18 to 20 are reported separately from those aged 21 to 24 to isolate drug-taking behaviors before and after the critical age of 21. Older patients are grouped in wider categories where age differences are not as critical to intervention and treatment. As a consequence, the age categories are not evenly sized\u2014for example, the age group 30 to 34 covers 5 years, whereas the age group 35 to 44 covers 10 years. The size of an age group is an important consideration when comparing estimates of ED visits for different age categories. ED records vary in the level and type of detail provided. Although sex, age, and ZIP code are usually present in patients' ED records, race/ethnicity is often missing or insufficient (e.g., \"European\"). Although it is possible to record multiple race/ethnicities, for reporting purposes race/ethnicity is collapsed into a single variable with five levels: DAWN collects detailed information about each visit. The data items include DAWN Reporters also provide a brief description of the visit, drawn directly from the ED record, which includes the reason for the visit and any other information necessary to document that the visit is a DAWN case. For the purpose of DAWN, a drug is any substance that is (a) used as a medication or in the preparation of medication; (b) an illicit substance that causes addiction, habituation, or a marked change in consciousness; or (c) both. Substances reportable to DAWN include illicit drugs (e.g., club drugs, cocaine, heroin, marijuana, stimulants, and alcohol when used by a minor [10](#attbftn10)), nonpharmaceutical inhalants, [11](#attbftn11) prescription drugs (e.g., drugs for ADHD, antibiotics, antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticoagulants, beta blockers, birth control pills, hormone replacement, insulin, muscle relaxants, pain relievers, sleeping aids), drugs used in treatment of medical conditions (e.g., respiratory therapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy), vaccines, dietary supplements, vitamins, and other over-the-counter pharmaceutical products. Using the DAWN Drug Reference Vocabulary (DAWN DRV), DAWN is able to identify more than 3,300 individual drugs (which map to more than 19,000 individual brands and street names). The DAWN DRV is a comprehensive drug vocabulary and classification system based on the Multum Lexicon, \u00a9 2012, that has been modified to meet DAWN's unique requirements. The DRV includes codes for brand (trade) names, generic names, chemical names, metabolites, nonspecific drug terms, and street terms for legal and illegal substances, including prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and selected nonpharmaceuticals that are abused by inhalation. DAWN Reporters collect the most specific information about each drug that is available in the ED record. Up to 22 drugs implicated in a visit are assigned a code using the DRV. Because multiple substances can be reported for each DAWN case, the total number of drugs exceeds the total number of DAWN cases reported. The DRV provides the flexibility needed to accommodate the varying level of drug detail provided in ED records. A drug might be recorded in the ED records by its brand name (e.g., OxyContin\u00ae), a generic name (e.g., oxycodone), or by the class to which it belongs (e.g., an unspecified narcotic pain reliever). Each of these has a code in the DRV. Narcotic pain relievers are mapped to the larger grouping \"Opioid/opiate Pain Relievers,\" which is part of the broader category \"Pain Relievers,\" which is one of the categories among \"Central Nervous System Agents.\" Illicit drugs and other DAWN-reportable substances are maintained in a similar tiered structure in the DRV. The Multum Lexicon is updated every 2 months to incorporate new products and, occasionally, to introduce new drug categories. Through the end of data collection year 2011, the DAWN DRV was updated to incorporate those changes as well as include any drugs reported by EDs that were not in the Multum Lexicon (e.g., imported drugs, new combinations of illicit drugs). At the end of each data year, all the drug data received from EDs\u2014the current year's data and data from all previous years\u2014were coded using the most recent DRV. This process ensures that estimates of visits by drug across years are comparable. Additional information on the Multum Lexicon, \u00a9 2012, the DAWN DRV, and the Multum Licensing Agreement governing use of the Lexicon can be found on the DAWN Web site. [12](#attbftn12) Readers interested in exploring the DRV and the manner in which it classifies drugs may obtain the full set of DAWN DRV tables in the relational database named \"DAWN_DRV.mdb.\" [13](#attbftn13) Queries are used to join tables and display relationships between different drugs and drug groupings. The DRV is also available as a spreadsheet named \"DAWN__Final_Table.xls.\" The visit disposition records where the patient went after leaving the ED. There are three major categories: treated and released, admitted to this hospital, and other dispositions. Additional detail is provided with subcategories. Treated and released includes three categories: Admitted to this hospital includes five categories of inpatient units: Other disposition includes five categories: Visit dispositions may be reported using the three major categories or 13 subcategories, as noted above. A third way of reporting disposition that often appears in DAWN reports and tables groups ED visits based on whether there is any indication in the ED record that the patient received some type of follow-up treatment. \"Evidence of follow-up\" includes patients who were referred to detox/treatment, admitted to the hospital (any unit), or transferred. \"No evidence of follow-up\" includes patients with any other disposition. The statistical and methodological design of the current DAWN system was introduced in data collection year 2004. A new stratified simple random sample of hospitals was drawn at that time from among the universe of eligible hospitals in the Nation; oversampling was conducted in selected metropolitan areas. [15](#attbftn15) For each participating sampled hospital and for each month of the year, days of the month are systematically selected and all ED visits for these days are reviewed for eligibility as DAWN cases. Data collection following the new sampling plan was fully implemented for the first time in the 2004 data collection year, and the original sample of hospitals has been followed longitudinally since then. That is, each year since 2004, new hospitals are given the opportunity to be sampled into the longitudinal panel of hospitals. The DAWN sampling frame was built from among all hospitals meeting the DAWN criteria for eligible hospitals (i.e., non-Federal, short-stay, general medical and surgical hospitals in the United States that have one or more EDs open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week) that appeared on the 2001 American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey Database (ASDB). [16](#attbftn16) A probability sample proportionate to the number of ED visits in each facility was drawn from among eligible hospitals. Samples were drawn from the initial frame to provide the capability to make estimates for the Nation as well as selected metropolitan areas. The metropolitan areas are referred to as oversampled areas (OS areas) or DAWN metropolitan areas. Two goals guided the selection of the DAWN metropolitan areas. The first was to preserve the ability to represent the 21 areas that had been part of DAWN since its inception. The second was to improve population and geographic coverage beyond these 21 legacy areas. Accordingly, the design ensured representation of the original 21 legacy areas plus the 5 most populous MSAs in each of the 9 census divisions. Oversamples were selected in a total of 48 MSAs; in 4 of those 48 MSAs, additional oversamples were drawn to allow reporting for subareas within those MSAs. Resources available to DAWN have allowed for data collection in only a portion of the OS areas. The DAWN sample design was conceived to provide the statistical infrastructure to produce reliable and representative estimates for the Nation and a portion of DAWN metropolitan areas (OS areas), depending on available resources and interest. To accomplish this objective, a subset of the hospitals within each OS area was identified a priori as having a dual purpose in estimation. Referred to as dual-purpose hospitals, these designated hospitals can contribute either to an estimate for the OS area in which they are located or to the estimate for the remainder area outside of OS areas. Dual-purpose hospitals carry two probabilities of selection (POS) and two stratum identifiers. One POS/stratum is associated with membership in an OS area oversample, and the other is associated with membership in the remainder area sample. [17](#attbftn17) Each data year, the response rates and nonresponse patterns for each OS area are reviewed to determine data quality. Those OS areas with acceptable data quality are allowed to stand on their own as the basis for separate estimates; they are referred to as stand-alone OS areas. If it is determined on the basis of response rates and bias analyses that an OS area cannot stand alone, the design provides that the OS area is eliminated as a separate area but becomes part of the remainder area. DAWN national-level estimates are the sum of the estimates for stand-alone OS areas plus the remainder area. The formula for the national estimate is where ai is the estimate for stand-alone OS area i, N is the number of stand-alone OS areas, and b is the remainder area estimate inclusive of dual-purpose hospitals in OS areas that do not stand alone. Sampled hospitals in each of the OS areas were stratified by hospital size (up to four categories, on the basis of the number of ED visits [18](#attbftn18)) and ownership type (public and private). The stratification plan included an additional geographic construct to represent the remainder of the United States outside the OS areas. Hospitals in the remainder area were divided into 24 strata on the basis of four regions (Northeast, South, Midwest, West), three size categories, and ownership type. Each hospital in the DAWN sample was selected through a random process, which theoretically could have been repeated many times, resulting in many hypothetical samples. Sampling variance, or the margin of error, refers to the extent to which these samples were likely to have varied. Two measures of this variability are the standard error (SE) and the relative standard error (RSE), which is defined as the SE of the estimate divided by the estimate itself. The precision of an estimate is inversely related to the sampling variance, as measured by the RSE. The greater the RSE value, the lower the precision. DAWN is designed to have estimates for major drug categories (i.e., all drug-related ED visits plus ED visits for cocaine, heroin, and marijuana), wherein the RSEs are less than or equal to 10 percent for metropolitan area estimates and less than or equal to 15 percent for national estimates. Sample sizes for each metropolitan area and the Nation were set using these targeted precision levels in combination with the theory of optimal allocation for stratified samples. This section documents the methodologies used to collect DAWN data. The DAWN operations contractor (DOC) is responsible for collecting DAWN data. Additional detail on data collection methodology is available in the 2007-2011 ED Reference Guide. [19](#attbftn19) DAWN ED data are collected directly from the medical records of patients treated in the ED. The review is done after the ED visit is completed. Patients, their families, and clinical staff are never interviewed. The data are collected by trained DAWN Reporters who review ED medical records to identify ED visits related to recent drug use. For each DAWN case, an electronic case report is completed ( [Figure 2](#methods-fig2), in [Section 3](#methods-3), depicts the data elements collected). Case reports are submitted electronically using the Electronic Hospital Emergency Reporting System (eHERS), a customized system developed specifically for DAWN. DAWN Reporters also submit an activity report detailing their progress in reviewing the ED charts, and they report the monthly census of all ED visits made to the hospital. Data collection is performed on an ongoing basis as soon after the ED visit as possible. The majority of DAWN ED data are collected on site at hospitals by a DAWN Reporter who reviews paper or electronic records. A growing number of hospitals have centralized electronic medical records systems that can be accessed from the outside. In these cases, DAWN Reporters access the systems via remote access from the DOC's headquarters. A secured transmission line is maintained for this purpose by the DOC. The original DAWN redesign protocol called for direct review of all available ED records. After careful review and testing, however, it was established that a sample of ED visits could be used to produce sufficiently precise estimates in comparison to a census of visits provided that the cost savings be redirected toward recruiting additional hospitals. In 2008, a protocol was developed for drawing a systematic sample of each ED's medical records based on the date of the ED visit. In those EDs with sampling, the DAWN Reporter is sent a list each month of designated dates for chart review, and the charts for all the ED visits occurring on the designated dates are reviewed for drug-related visits. By 2010, sampling of ED records had been introduced in all larger hospitals and many smaller ones. A vast majority of sampled records are reviewed, but there are some instances when they are not. Unintentional gaps in chart review may occur due to such factors as a DAWN Reporter's unexpected absence or circumstances at the hospital that preclude review of some ED records (e.g., limitations on the hours or days that a DAWN Reporter may access ED records, removal of records from facility). A similar method of within-hospital visit weighting is used to compensate for both intentional sampling of ED records as well as unintentional gaps in record review (see [Section 4.4.3](#methods-4.4.3)). The DOC performs numerous reviews that begin at the point of entry and continue through the final delivery of the data to SAMHSA. Automated systems check DAWN case data to confirm eligibility of cases submitted and for case type discrepancies. In addition, edit programs are run to identify range and consistency errors. \"Unknown\" drugs entered by the DAWN Reporter are reviewed by CBHSQ; when possible, they are upcoded to extant codes or new drug codes are added to the DRV, when appropriate. At the end of every data collection year, an extensive data review is conducted. Statistical process control (SPC) is used to evaluate the monthly counts of ED visits, charts reviewed, and cases reported for each ED. If any monthly count of visits, charts, or cases is identified as inconsistent by SPC, that count is investigated via communication with contacts from the ED. The results of the investigation are documented and sent along with the final delivery. As a final step, the SPC results and monthly counts for each ED are reviewed by the DOC, the Data Analysis Contractor (DAC), and representatives from CBHSQ. The DOC prepares the database as described in [Section 4.3](#methods-4.3), at which point the annual data files and the current DRV are transferred to the DAC. The DAC performs a number of data quality and data processing steps to prepare the file for weighting and for developing estimates (see [Section 4.4.1](#methods-4.4.1)). Sample maintenance is then performed (see [Section 4.4.2](#methods-4.4.2)). Weights and adjustments are then developed (see [Section 4.4.3](#methods-4.4.3)). [Section 4.4.4](#methods-4.4.4) describes the sequential processing steps for developing and applying weights and adjustments. Because up to 22 drugs may be reported for each visit, the DAC begins its processing by ensuring that no duplicate drugs are recorded for a visit. The DRV, the database that defines how drugs are classified and mapped to drugs, is applied to the microdata received from the DOC to derive drug IDs and the standard drug list (SDL) classification associated with each drug. [20](#attbftn20) The resulting drug IDs for a visit are compared with one another to ensure that a drug appears only once for a visit. [21](#attbftn21) After the initial deduplication, codes for mouthwash and alcohol are deduplicated. Lastly, a check is run to ensure there are no cases that involve only alcohol for respondents aged 21 or older. The data are classified originally on a brand level and then are processed to a drug ID level; a final step is to flatten the data file to a visit level. Discrepancies or irregularities are resolved through discussion among the DOC, the DAC, and the DAWN team at CBHSQ. As noted above, the initial DAWN sample was selected from a sampling frame created from the 2001 AHA ASDB. Because DAWN is a longitudinal survey, maintenance is conducted every year to ensure that the sample remains representative of the target population of eligible hospitals. Over time, new hospitals will be opened, some will close, some will merge with other hospitals, and some will \"demerge\" to form two or more smaller hospitals. Some hospitals no longer maintain 24-hour EDs and become ineligible; others open them and become eligible. Each year the sampling frame is updated to reflect new, closed, merged, and demerged hospitals on the basis of information in the most current AHA ASDB. Since 2004, a master file has been maintained of the changes to the frame and originally sampled hospitals, plus information on all new frame and sampled hospitals. All variables in the AHA master file are assigned consistent names from year to year, even if there are variable name changes in later AHA ASDBs. Conversely, documentation accompanying the AHA ASDB each year is carefully reviewed to ensure that variables with the same name still mean what they did in earlier years. Newly eligible hospitals identified on the most current ASA ASDB, and confirmed for having a 24hour ED, are provided the opportunity to be selected into the sample on the basis of the sampling fraction of the stratum in which each newly eligible hospital is located. Each year, weights and adjustments are calculated and applied to the collected data to ensure that the survey results represent the target population. Sampling weights are first calculated as the inverse of the probability of selection and then adjusted for variable nonresponse by a procedure known as poststratification, or benchmark adjustment. For steps involving within-hospital adjustments, the processing is carried out at the facility/month level; that is, adjustments are made to data for each month within each facility within each hospital. The derivation of weights to adjust for unequal POS, nonresponse, and other sources of bias is processed at the hospital/stratum/region level. Probabilities of selection. DAWN hospitals are selected using stratified simple random sampling with oversampling in DAWN metropolitan areas. A hospital can have up to three POSs: a remainder-level POS, a division-level POS, and an OS area-level POS (see [Section 4.1.3](#methods-4.1.3)). Decisions about which POS to use are made after an analysis of response rate and nonresponse bias is conducted for each OS area. Within-hospital weighting adjustment. Charts may be intentionally sampled, or there may be unintentional gaps due to problems in collecting data or obtaining access to records (see [Section 4.2.2](#methods-4.2.2)). To compensate for within-hospital nonresponse, the DAWN weighting plan includes a nonresponse adjustment factor for each month of data collection within each facility; it is equal to the number of ED visits divided by the number of charts reviewed for each of 12 months in the data collection year. The within-hospital weights are applied to the by-month count of visits. That is, the visit counts for a given facility/month are first summed for each drug and then multiplied by the corresponding within-hospital adjustment factor for that facility/month. The weighted totals are then summed over all facilities and months to give a total weighted visit count for each drug for each hospital. Weighting adjustment for hospital nonresponse. Hospital-level nonresponse occurs when hospitals fail to provide valid data for at least 3 months of the data collection year. To minimize the impact of hospital nonresponse, the DAWN weighting plan includes nonresponse adjustment factors that are developed and applied within each weighting class. Weighting classes are formed on the basis of the aforementioned sampling stratification schemes. Within each weighting class, the nonresponse adjustment factor is calculated as the sum of the sampled hospital weights divided by the sum of the weights of the responding hospitals. The hospital nonresponse adjustment factors are checked to make sure the adjustments are within reasonable bounds. If a nonresponse adjustment factor is too large, adjacent weighting classes are collapsed, and new nonresponse adjustment factors are calculated. When the hospital-level nonresponse adjustment factors are finalized, a nonresponse-adjusted sampling weight is then calculated as the product of the nonresponse adjustment factor and the sampling weight. For each weighting class, a verification check is conducted to ensure that the sum of the nonresponse-adjusted sampling weights is equal to the sum of the sampled hospital weights. Weighting adjustment for population benchmarks (poststratification). The DAWN weighting plan also includes a poststratification adjustment factor that reconciles the weighted number of total visits for responding hospitals with the number of total visits from the most recent AHA ASDB. DAWN uses a ratio adjustment within strata to implement this adjustment. Within each stratum, the adjustment factor is calculated as the ratio of the AHA count of total visits to the weighted sum of total visits for responding hospitals. The factors are verified to ensure they are within reasonable bounds. If they are out of bounds (either too small or too large), adjacent poststratification strata are collapsed, and new poststratification adjustment factors are calculated. When the poststratification adjustment factors are finalized, a poststratified weight is then calculated. The final weight is calculated as the product of the poststratification adjustment factor and the nonresponse-adjusted sampling weight. For each poststratification stratum, a validity check is conducted to ensure that the sum of the poststratified weighted total visits is equal to the corresponding AHA count of total visits from each stratum. Estimates for the entire universe of DAWN-eligible hospitals in the United States are produced by applying poststratified weights to the data received from the sampled hospitals. The order of processing the weights and adjustments is as follows: DAWN issues both regular and ad hoc reports, tables, and related data products. In addition, DAWN PUFs are available on the SAMHDA Web site. This section describes the characteristics of these data products and the standards DAWN uses to compile data, present estimates, and produce data files. For the purpose of analysis, DAWN developed a set of categories to use when reporting on ED visits. Referred to as \"analytic groups,\" these categories combine visits with similar characteristics to produce summary statistics. The DAWN analytic groups and their definitions are provided in [Table 4](#methods-tab4). The analytic groups fall into one of three types: all visits (regardless of intent), visits where there is an indication of some type of drug misuse or abuse, and visits where there is no indication of misuse or abuse. Because of DAWN's focus on drug misuse and abuse, this topic is addressed by several analytic groups, including all drug misuse or abuse, all visits involving illicit drugs, visits involving nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals, visits involving alcohol for patients of all ages, and visits involving alcohol for patients under the age of 21. Also isolated for analysis are visits involving drug-related suicide attempts and visits made by patients seeking detoxification services. The subgroups under \"All Misuse and Abuse\" in [Table 4](#methods-tab4) are not mutually exclusive because a single visit can involve multiple types of drugs. For example, an ED visit involving marijuana and oxycodone would be grouped with other visits involving illicit drugs, as well as with visits involving nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals. Annually, DAWN produces comprehensive sets of tables, the DAWN Trend Tables, that provide estimates and rates of drug-related ED visits by type of drug, patient sex and age, visit disposition, and other characteristics; each table includes estimates and rates for the current year and all prior years. A complete set of tables is produced for each analytic group listed in [Table 4](#methods-tab4). Each set is reproduced for the Nation and for metropolitan areas with sufficiently high levels of participation (see [Table 1](#methods-tab1)). A more detailed description of the DAWN Trend Tables is provided in the Guide to the DAWN Trend Tables. [22](#attbftn22) |Analytic group||Description| |All Visits||This group includes all visits that are reportable to DAWN without regard for the reason for the visit or the specific drugs involved. It includes visits involving all forms of drug misuse or abuse plus visits resulting from adverse reaction, accidental ingestion, suicide attempts, and visits where patients were seeking detoxification services. These estimates are useful for looking at overall levels of drug involvement in ED visits.| |\u2014||Drug-related ED visits that involve drug misuse or abuse| |All Misuse and Abuse||This analytic category includes visits that involve all forms of drug misuse or abuse as defined by DAWN. This is the combination of visits from the following four analytic groups: illicit drug visits, nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals, alcohol-related visits, and underage drinking. A visit may appear in more than one of those subgroups, but it will appear only once in this overall group. Suicide-attempt visits and seeking detox visits will be included in this category if illicit drugs were involved.| |Illicits (excluding alcohol)||This analytic category includes visits that involve the use of drugs that have limited or no therapeutic value and are generally illegal if taken without a prescription. These substances include cocaine, heroin, marijuana, synthetic the inhalation of substances for their psychotherapeutic properties (e.g., sniffing model airplane glue) are included.| |Nonmedical Use of Pharmaceuticals||This analytic category includes visits that involve nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals: patients who took a higher than prescribed or recommended dose of their own medication, patients who took a pharmaceutical prescribed for another person, malicious poisoning of the patient by another individual, and documented substance abuse involving pharmaceuticals.| |All Alcohol||This analytic category includes ED visits involving alcohol. For adults aged 21 and older, the alcohol was found in combination with other drugs. For patients under the age of 21, the visit may involve alcohol alone or in combination with other drugs.| |Underage Drinking||This analytic category includes ED visits that involve alcohol use (alone or with other drugs) for patients under the age of 21. Underage drinking is an important barometer of adolescent drinking patterns and a predictor of more serious substance abuse problems in young adults.| |Suicide Attempts||This analytic category includes ED visits that involve drug-related suicide attempts. It includes visits for drug overdoses, as well as suicide attempts by other means (e.g., using a firearm) if drugs were involved or related to the suicide attempt. Inclusion in this analytic category has no restrictions on the type of drug used.| |Seeking Detox||This analytic category includes nonemergency requests made through the ED for admission to detoxification unit, visits to obtain medical clearance before being incarcerated, and acute emergencies where an individual is experiencing withdrawal symptoms and requests detox. These estimates do not include patients who seek or enter the hospital's detox unit through other avenues.| |\u2014||Drug-related ED visits that do NOT involve drug misuse or abuse| |Adverse Reactions||This analytic category includes ED visits in which an adverse health consequence (e.g., side effects or an allergic reaction) resulted when taking prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or dietary supplements as prescribed or recommended.| |Accidental Ingestions||This analytic category includes ED visits in which an individual accidentally or unknowingly used a prescription drug, over-the-counter medication, or dietary supplement. Drug-related accidental ingestion typically involves patients aged 5 and under.| In addition to being a coding system that accommodates different levels of drug detail, the DAWN DRV provides a method for aggregating drugs into meaningful, higher-level groupings. DAWN currently collects drug information on thousands of individual products. The individual products are mapped to their generic drug name; currently, DAWN reports on approximately 3,300 generic drugs. The DAWN Trend Tables provide estimates and rates using a shorter list of approximately 500 drugs, known as the \"standard drug list.\" The tables in the DAWN ED Annual Reports highlight approximately 100 drugs selected from the standard drug list. All estimates provided in DAWN publications and tables are calculated using data that have been weighted as described in [Section 4.4](#methods-4.4). Estimates for any variable of interest are determined by first summing the case totals within facility/month, applying the within-hospital weight, summing to the hospital level, applying the final hospital weight, and summing over all hospitals. The DAWN ED Annual Reports, short reports, and the DAWN Trend Tables include predominantly estimates at the ED visit level\u2014that is, how many visits involved a certain drug. Another measure is the total number of drugs reported. Because most ED visits involve more than one drug, the total drug reports will always exceed the total drug-related ED visits. To illustrate the difference, consider a visit involving oxycodone and aspirin. Both drugs are pain relievers. This visit will count as one visit involving oxycodone and one visit involving aspirin. When reporting the number of visits involving pain relievers in general, this visit will be counted just once even though two types of pain relievers were involved. DAWN ED Annual Reports and the DAWN Trend Tables include population-based rates as well as estimates. Rates are standardized measures that are helpful when comparing levels of drug-related ED visits for different years, types of visits, and demographic groups. DAWN rates for years and types of visits are based on the whole population; for example, there were 790.4 ED visits involving drug misuse or abuse per 100,000 population in 2011 compared with 552.9 visits in 2004. For specific age groups and sexes, the denominator is limited to the population in that age group or sex. For age in particular, rates are important because the size of the underlying population differs considerably across DAWN age groups (see [Section 3.4.1](#methods-3.4.1)). For example, in 2011, there were 13.5 million individuals aged 18 to 20 in the United States and 40.6 million aged 35 to 44. Accordingly, the estimated number of ED visits involving drug misuse or abuse was 239,281 visits for those aged 18 to 20 and 432,957 visits for those aged 35 to 44. To allow comparison between the two age groups, standardized rates are calculated as the number of ED visits per 100,000 persons in that age group. In this example, while the estimated number of visits was much lower for persons aged 18 to 20, the rate of visits was substantially higher: 1,771.5 for persons aged 18 to 20 compared with 1,065.7 visits for persons aged 35 to 44. Because they are reported as percentages, the RSEs provided in DAWN tables apply equally to the estimates and the rates. The U.S. Census Bureau issues population estimates for each decennial year. Each year between decennials, estimates for the current year as well as estimates for all years since the last decennial are reissued. Each year's reissued estimates are referred to as \"Vintage 20xx.\" Every reporting year, DAWN recalculates rates for all years (2004 through current data collection year) using the most recent census population estimates for all data collection years. [23](#attbftn23) For DAWN reporting years 2004-2009, the population data were based on the 2000 decennial census. For DAWN reporting years 2010 and 2011, population counts were based on the 2010 decennial census. Population estimates used to generate DAWN rates are as of July in the data collection year as reported in the Postcensal Resident Population National Population Dataset, National Estimates by Demographic Characteristics\u2014Single Year of Age, Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin, Monthly Population Estimates series. Estimates at the metropolitan area level were drawn from the Postcensal Resident Population County Population Datasets, County Estimates by Demographic Characteristics\u2014Age, Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin, State Datasets series. The 2011 DAWN data series included estimates and rates for 2004-2011. The estimates and rates for 2004-2010 that were issued as part of the 2011 series replaced previously issued estimates and rates for those years. As a matter of record, the 2004-2010 DAWN data issued as part of the DAWN 2010 series used a different method for estimating population because Vintage estimates for 2010 were not available at the time of publication of the 2010 DAWN data series. This methodology is described in the DAWN Methodology Report, 2010 Update. Each hospital in the DAWN sample was selected through a random process, which theoretically could have been repeated many times, resulting in many hypothetical samples. Sampling error refers to the extent to which these samples vary. Two measures of this variability are the SE and the RSE, which is defined as the SE of the estimate divided by the estimate itself. The precision of an estimate is inversely related to the sampling variance, as measured by the RSE. The greater the RSE value, the lower the precision. For example, if 10,000 estimated visits involve a given drug, and this estimate has an SE of 500 visits, then the RSE value is 5 percent: RSE = SE/Estimate RSE = 500/10,000 RSE = 0.050 = 5.0% (RSE \u00d7 100%). In addition to RSEs, confidence intervals (CIs) are often included in tables published by DAWN. The 95 percent CI is calculated as CI = Estimate \u00b1 (1.96 \u00d7 RSE \u00d7 Estimate), where 1.96 comes from the table of normal distribution z-values and means that 95 percent of the normal distribution lies within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean. Applying the formula to the example above, the 95 percent CI would be 10,000 \u00b1 (1.96 \u00d7 0.05 \u00d7 10,000) = 10,000 limit: 10,000 980 = 9,020 980 = 10,980 95% CI: 9,020 to 10,980. If repeated samples were drawn from the same population of hospitals, using the same sampling and data collection procedures, then 95 percent of the time the true population values would fall between 9,020 and 10,980. Both between- and within-hospital variance components are accounted for in the variance estimation process. Within-hospital variance is estimated using a replication strategy by which two random replicates are created within each hospital, and the variance between the two replicates represents the within-hospital contribution. Typically, this component is considerably smaller than the between-hospital variance, which is calculated as the variance between weighted hospital totals within each stratum. Variance estimates reported in the DAWN Trend Tables are determined using the Taylor series linearization variance estimation method available in SUDAAN\u00ae software. This method is particularly appropriate for analyzing cluster data, such as those that are generated by the DAWN sampling plan. DAWN uses a set of criteria to determine whether estimates can be released to the public. Data may be suppressed to protect patient confidentiality or to ensure that published findings meet statistical standards of reliability for survey results. In all published materials, estimates are suppressed according to the following rules: It is mathematically possible that an estimate could have no sampling error and an RSE of zero. This occurs when the number of ED visits being estimated is small, all the hospitals contributing to that estimate were selected with certainty, and the absence of any sampled hospital is due to nonresponse. In most cases, an estimate with an RSE of zero is suppressed on the basis of the small number of cases. In the unlikely event that an estimate is published with an RSE of zero, it is most appropriate to interpret the RSE as signifying that the necessary data were not available to approximate the sampling error. In DAWN ED Annual Reports and the DAWN Trend Tables, comparisons in the estimates of ED visits between years are presented in the form of percentage differences, calculated as the current estimate minus an earlier year's estimate divided by that estimate. For shorter-term comparisons, percent changes are calculated for the current year compared with last year and the current year compared with 2 years ago. For longer-term comparisons, estimates for the current year are compared with those for 2004. [24](#attbftn24) The percent change is reported only if the difference is statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level. Tests for the significance of differences between two years' estimates consider the variance of each year's estimate and the covariance between the two. Hospitals that appear in both samples and provide data in both years will contribute to the covariance and thus decrease the overall sampling variance beyond the combined contribution of the two samples. That is, the variance estimation process used to establish significance takes into account any overlap between hospitals that participated in both years. SAMHDA has primary responsibility for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of behavioral health data collected by SAMHSA. SAMHDA promotes the access and use of SAMHSA's substance abuse and mental health data by providing public-use data files and documentation for download and online analysis tools to support a better understanding of this critical area of public health. DAWN data are made available at the SAMHDA site as soon as the data are released by SAMHSA. Data are available in the following formats: SPSS, SAS, Stata, ASCII, and tab delimited. PDF and HTML codebooks are available online for all years. Activities and services SAMHDA performs in support of public-use versions of data and documentation include the following: The SAMHDA Web site was first published on December 3, 1997. The University of Michigan's Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research is under contract to CBHSQ to disseminate data and to maintain the SAMHDA Web site and bibliography of publications. Survey error, also referred to as bias, is the extent to which findings from the survey sample differ from those of the population of interest. Error can be introduced at any stage in the survey process, from building the sample frame to reporting estimates. This section documents methodologies employed by DAWN to help ensure that published estimates are representative, accurate, and reliable. To control the nonsampling error components and produce data of high quality, DAWN has a well-defined and ongoing data quality assurance (QA) and data quality control (QC) program. The two primary components of the data QA/QC program are (a) the extensive and continuous monitoring of data quality during data collection and processing, and (b) annually, an intensive review of the monthly data for each ED in relation to other months for the current and all prior reporting years. Measures used to monitor data quality during data collection include but are not limited to onsite quality audit reviews and quarterly standardized error feedback reports. In addition to those measures, DAWN employs a custom-built software system (eHERS) to collect DAWN data. eHERS, which provides automated prompts to ensure that DAWN Reporters collect complete data, is populated with the most current detailed codes for drugs, race/ethnicity, visit disposition, and other categorical variables. It performs real-time data validation checks to ensure that the data are within valid ranges and consistent with other information collected for the visit. eHERS also checks across visits to ensure that visits are not entered multiple times and follows a procedure to resolve conflicts if multiple entries are detected. Before data are weighted, researchers responsible for the collection (the DAWN operations contractor) and analysis (data analysis contractor) of DAWN data meet with staff from CBHSQ to review the quality of the data. This process is referred to as the data quality review (DQR). Before the DQR meeting, the DAWN operations contractor prepares an electronic file that summarizes what is known about the quality of the data that was collected in the prior year. The DQR spreadsheet contains descriptive information including facility ID, facility name, oversampled area name, stratum, eligibility, subsampling information, and participation status. In addition, the DQR spreadsheet includes summary data for each of the fields for each ED by month, as shown in [Table 5](#methods-tab5). Review of these data items reveals what portion of ED visits in each hospital for each month were evaluated for inclusion in DAWN. Depending on the pattern of missing data for an ED, the review committee comes to a consensus about whether to delete, adjust, or impute the count of eligible ED visits, the count of medical charts reviewed, and the count of identified DAWN cases in each ED for each month of the reporting year. These counts are vital to developing accurate within-facility adjustment factors for each month for described in [Section 4.4](#methods-4.4) reflect efforts to minimize sampling error. For example, the DAWN statistical methodology provides for clearly defined criteria to construct the initial hospital sampling frame. Coverage error is minimized by using a sampling frame that has virtually 100 percent coverage of the target population. Weighting is introduced to account for the probability of selection, within-hospital nonresponse, hospital-level nonresponse, and the total number of visits in the sample frame as independently established by the AHA ASDB. Validity checks are made at each stage of weighting to ensure that the sum of weights at that stage equaled the relevant reference point. All publications and tables issued by DAWN are subject to multitiered data QC measures. Tables are produced and independently verified by a separate statistician/programmer. Estimates are verified against other tables to ensure cross-table consistencies. Estimates for different years are verified against each other to ensure cross-year consistencies. Tables in reports are verified against source files. Text descriptions of findings are verified against report tables by three separate and independent readers. All observations in respect to the similarity or differences between estimates are established through statistical testing that is independently recomputed and verified. Information on drug-related ED visits in DAWN is based on a sample and is, therefore, subject to sampling variability. The SE measurements and CIs provided for all estimates reflect the sampling variability that occurs (a) by chance because only a sample rather than the entire universe is surveyed, and (b) by nonresponse. As in any survey, nonresponse is of concern because it creates larger-than-expected sampling errors plus the opportunity for unpredictable biases. DAWN addresses these issues in the short term by always reporting SEs based on the actual sample of respondents and for the long term by continuing its efforts to raise the hospital participation rate. Although every effort is made during the data collection phase to collect data accurately and precisely, extant medical records vary in specificity and detail. Factors that may affect the reliability and accuracy of the findings include the following: Although DAWN documents whether a drug was positively confirmed by toxicology testing, DAWN does not require that all drugs reported for the ED visit be confirmed by laboratory testing. Toxicology tests are not used consistently across EDs, and some toxicology tests are not specific enough to identify particular drugs. Furthermore, a positive toxicology test is not necessarily evidence of recent drug involvement in an ED visit if it is a current medication or a drug that persists in the system long after it was used. For this reason, DAWN requires that the involvement of drugs be mentioned in the ED record, not just in the toxicology testing results, for the visit to be considered a DAWN case. DAWN is a public health surveillance system that has monitored drug-related ED visits to hospitals since the early 1970s. DAWN was initially established by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. DAWN was transferred to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in 1980. Within HHS, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) conducted DAWN from 1980 to 1992. For the period 1992 through 2011, CBHSQ (formerly the Office of Applied Studies) of SAMHSA was responsible for DAWN operations and reporting. CBHSQ ceased performing DAWN data collection as of the end of calendar year 2011, and the responsibility for collection of data on drug-related ED visits was passed to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). NCHS incorporated DAWN data elements into the National Hospital Care Survey (NHCS). NCHS is observing DAWN conventions and methodologies to the greatest extent possible so that data collected via DAWN for the years 2004-2011 can be compared with the data collected by the NHCS for later years. For example, given its sample design and size, the drug-related ED visits data collected through NHCS will be representative of the nation but not the DAWN metropolitan areas. Additional information on NHCS and its collection of information on drug-related ED visits is available at the NHCS Web site. [25](#attbftn25) Since its inception, DAWN has relied on data collected from a sample of hospitals. However, over the years, the exact survey methodology has been adjusted to improve the quality, reliability, and generalizability of the information produced by DAWN. When NIDA assumed responsibility for DAWN in 1980, implementation of a sample of hospitals to produce representative estimates for the Nation and for selected metropolitan areas became a priority. This sample, refreshed with annual maintenance, continued to support DAWN estimates for the contiguous United States and 21 metropolitan areas until 2002. Major population shifts and changes in the hospital industry between 1980 and 2002 made apparent the need for a redesign of the sample of hospitals. Many other features of DAWN (e.g., definition of a DAWN visit to include all drug-related medical emergencies and not merely those involving misuse or abuse) were also introduced at that time. [26](#attbftn26) In the redesign in 2003, DAWN's goal remained to produce national as well as metropolitan area-level estimates. Retention of the original 21 metropolitan areas was important because of the ongoing demand for DAWN estimates by public health professionals in those areas. In addition, inclusion of major population centers in each of the nine census divisions was deemed important to improve DAWN's geographic and population coverage. A total of 48 metropolitan areas was identified for inclusion in DAWN. The composition of these metropolitan areas was based on the definitions issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in June 2003. For consistency, DAWN has maintained the 2003 definitions, even if counties were added in subsequent years. Between 1980 and 2003, OMB had substantially enlarged the coverage areas for 4 of the original 21 metropolitan areas. Users of DAWN statistics in these 4 areas\u2014Los Angeles, Miami, New York, and San Francisco\u2014remained interested in obtaining estimates for the areas covered by the original 21 metropolitan areas. To address the needs of these users, DAWN subdivided these metropolitan areas according to their earlier composition and planned oversamples in the subdivided portions. That is, for each of these areas, there were an oversample for the metropolitan area as defined in 2003 and also additional oversampling in the submetropolitan areas. When participation is high enough, separate estimates are made for the submetropolitan areas as well as the entire metropolitan area. In 2000, DAWN adopted the Multum Lexicon, \u00a9 2012, a drug vocabulary and classification tool developed and maintained by Lexi-Comp, Inc., a private firm that distributes the Lexicon and regular updates through its Web site. While the use of the Lexicon is free of charge, a licensing agreement specifies the terms required of users. In accordance with the licensing agreement, DAWN publications, tabulations, and software applications cite the Multum Lexicon as the source and basis for the system DAWN uses to code drugs. The DAWN survey relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-Federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. This sampling strategy was first implemented in the 2004 data collection year and has been followed since that year. End Notes [1](#attbftnref1) DAWN documents can be found on the DAWN Web site, [https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/dawn-drug-abuse-warning-network](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/dawn-drug-abuse-warning-network). [2](#attbftnref2) DAWN draws a systematic sample of eligible charts to review. [3](#attbftnref3) Not all hospitals reporting to DAWN are part of the current sample. These hospitals' data are provided to them for local use. Therefore, the number of drug-related ED visits used in estimation is smaller than the total number identified. [4](#attbftnref4) Drug-related visits are defined by DAWN as any ED visit related to recent drug use. Additional detail on DAWN's definition of drug-related visits is provided in [Section 3.2](#methods-3.2).

Additional information on collection of DAWN data is provided in [Section 3.2](#methods-3.2).

[10](#attbftnref10) Alcohol use by a minor with no other drug involvement is eligible for DAWN. Alcohol use by an adult must be accompanied by another drug to be eligible for DAWN. [11](#attbftnref11) To be reportable as an illicit drug, a nonpharmaceutical substance must be intentionally consumed by inhalation, sniffing, or snorting, and it must have a psychoactive effect when inhaled. Carbon monoxide is excluded from the inhalants. Cases involving accidental exposures to inhalants (e.g., exposure to paint fumes while one is painting a closet) are excluded.

Also included herein are \"combo\" units, e.g., a unit that offers both psychiatric and detox services. [15](#attbftnref15) The redesign of the DAWN ED component is described in detail in DAWN: Development of a New Design, which is available at the DAWN Web site ( [https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/dawn-drug-abuse-warning-network](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/dawn-drug-abuse-warning-network)). [16](#attbftnref16) The 24-hour status of hospitals is not contained on the AHA file and is determined by contacting otherwise eligible hospitals directly. [17](#attbftnref17) Hospitals in the four MSAs with submetropolitan area oversampling can have up to three nonzero POS/strata: (a) POS/stratum for membership in the MSA, (b) POS/stratum for membership in the submetropolitan area, and (c) POS/stratum for membership in the remainder area. [18](#attbftnref18) In DAWN metropolitan areas, size categories were determined independently for each OS area. The number of hospitals determined the unique size categories: fewer than four hospitals were placed in one size category; four to seven hospitals were placed in two size categories; and eight or more hospitals were placed in four size categories. Areas outside of DAWN metropolitan areas were organized into three size categories. [19](#attbftnref19) The 2007-2011 ED Reference Guide is available at the DAWN Web site ( [https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/dawn-drug-abuse-warning-network](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/dawn-drug-abuse-warning-network)). [20](#attbftnref20) This version of the annual data is referred to as the \"microdata\" because it includes one record for every brand of drug mentioned in a visit. There are up to 22 records for each visit. [21](#attbftnref21) Identical drug IDs can result when different brand codes map to the same drug ID. When the duplicate drug ID is removed, the brand code associated with it will be lost because only one brand is retained for each unique drug ID in the visit-level file. The detailed information on all brands is retained in the brand-level file and can be retrieved, if needed. [22](#attbftnref22) The Guide to the DAWN Trend Tables is available as an attachment to the DAWN ED Annual Reports and as a freestanding document at the DAWN Web site ( [https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/dawn-drug-abuse-warning-network](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/dawn-drug-abuse-warning-network)). [23](#attbftnref23) The most current population estimates for earlier years (e.g., population estimates for 2004 that were issued in 2010) may be different than those issued earlier (e.g., population estimates for 2004 that were issued in 2009). The most currently issued population estimates are used in DAWN rate calculations, and the newly calculated rates replace previously published rates. Differences in the rates at the national level are usually insignificant, but differences at the metropolitan area level may be larger and more noticeable. [24](#attbftnref24) Due to data limitations in 2004, long-term comparisons for ED visits resulting from adverse reactions are made between 2005 and the current year.

Each year DAWN produces an updated set of DAWN Trend Tables that includes data for 2004 through the current year. The DAWN Trend Tables, 2011 Update, includes 120 Microsoft Excel workbooks: 10 workbooks contain estimates for the Nation, and the same 10 workbooks are repeated for each of 11 metropolitan areas. Each workbook contains 56 tables (1 table per worksheet). Each table presents data for 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011. This document is intended to help DAWN users find the workbooks, tables, and estimates of interest to them. Further information about DAWN is available at the DAWN website, including detail on the DAWN data program and the methodologies used to collect, process, and report DAWN data. [1](#Trend-fn1) Information on other sources of data on substance abuse and mental health from the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality is located at [https://www.samhsa.gov/data/](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/). DAWN analytic groups represent different groupings of visits that were developed to meet the data needs of a range of audiences. The DAWN analytic groups and their definitions are provided in [Table 1](#Trend-Tab1). Workbook names have three parts: a prefix that describes the geographic coverage of the workbook, a middle term that reflects the latest year of the data, and a suffix that describes the analytic group. [Table 2](#Trend-tab2) lists the workbook names for the 10 workbooks containing estimates for the Nation. Each worksheet contains data for 2004 through 2011. [2](#Trend-fn2) |Analytic group||Description| |All Visits||This group includes all visits that are reportable to DAWN without regard for the reason for the visit or the specific drugs involved. It includes visits involving all forms of drug misuse or abuse plus visits resulting from adverse reaction, accidental ingestion, suicide attempts, and visits where patients were seeking detoxification services. These estimates are useful for looking at overall levels of drug involvement in ED visits.| |\u2014||Drug-related ED visits that involve drug misuse or abuse| |All Misuse and Abuse||This analytic category includes visits that involve all forms of drug misuse or abuse, as defined by DAWN. This category is the combination of visits from the following four analytic groups: illicit drug visits, nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals, alcohol-related visits, and underage drinking. A visit may appear in more than one of the subgroups listed below, but it will appear only once in this overall group. Suicide attempt visits and seeking detox visits will be included in this category if illicit drugs were involved.| |Illicits (excluding alcohol)||This analytic category includes visits that involve the use of drugs that have limited or no therapeutic value and are generally illegal if taken without a prescription. These substances include cocaine, heroin, marijuana, synthetic the inhalation of substances for their psychoactive properties (e.g., sniffing model airplane glue) are included.| |Nonmedical Use of Pharmaceuticals||This analytic category includes ED visits that involve nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals: patients who took a higher than prescribed or recommended dose of their own medication, patients who took a pharmaceutical prescribed for another person, malicious poisoning of the patient by another individual, and documented substance abuse involving pharmaceuticals.| |All Alcohol||This analytic category includes ED visits involving alcohol. For adults aged 21 and older, the alcohol was found in combination with other drugs. For patients under the age of 21, the visit may involve alcohol alone or in combination with other drugs.| |Underage Drinking||This analytic category includes ED visits that involve alcohol use (alone or with other drugs) for patients under the age of 21. Underage drinking is an important barometer of adolescent drinking patterns and a predictor of more serious substance abuse problems in young adults.| |Suicide Attempts||This analytic category includes ED visits that involve drug-related suicide attempts. It includes visits for drug overdoses and for suicide attempts by other means (e.g., using a firearm) if drugs were involved or related to the suicide attempt. Inclusion in this analytic category has no restrictions on the type of drug used.| |Seeking Detox||This analytic category includes nonemergency requests made through the ED for admission to detoxification unit, visits to obtain medical clearance before being incarcerated, and acute emergencies where an individual is experiencing withdrawal symptoms and requests detox. These estimates do not include patients who seek or enter the hospital's detox unit through other avenues.| |\u2014||Drug-related ED visits that do NOT involve drug misuse or abuse| |Adverse Reactions||This analytic category includes ED visits in which an adverse health consequence (e.g., side effects or an allergic reaction) resulted when taking prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or dietary supplements as prescribed or recommended.| |Accidental Ingestions||This analytic category includes ED visits in which an individual accidentally or unknowingly used or was administered a prescription drug, over-the-counter medication, or dietary supplement. Drug-related accidental ingestion typically involves patients aged 5 and under.| |Analytic group||Abbreviated analytic group name||Workbook name for file |All Misuse estimates each year for DAWN metropolitan areas that have sufficient participation to support estimates with acceptable reliability and precision. [Table 3](#Trend-tab3) lists the names of workbooks containing estimates for metropolitan areas and divisions. For example, the workbook containing national estimates for ED visits involving all drug misuse or abuse is named \"Nation_2011_AllMA.xls.\" The workbook with parallel estimates for Boston is named \"Boston_2011_AllMA.xls.\" Each of the 11 geographic areas listed in [Table 3](#Trend-tab3) has a set of 10 Excel workbooks, one workbook for each analytic group listed in [Table 2](#Trend-tab2). |Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) and Divisions (1)||Workbook name| |(1) Unless otherwise noted, DAWN defines metropolitan areas using the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and Division definitions issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in June 2003 (available at | (2) Miami-Miami Beach-Kendall, FL, Division. (3) Fort Lauderdale-Pompano West Palm Beach-Boca Raton-Boynton Beach, FL, Divisions. (4) Bronx, Kings, New York, Queens, and Richmond Counties, NY. With minor exceptions, each Excel workbook in the DAWN Trend Tables is organized the same way. Each workbook represents one geographic area and one analytic group. Each workbook contains 56 tables (worksheets), with each table representing visits for a single demographic or visit characteristic. Examples of a demographic characteristic are \"male patients\" or \"patients aged 0 to 5.\" An example of a visit characteristic is \"the patient was discharged home.\" [Table 4](#Trend-tab4) lists the tables that appear in each workbook. Unless otherwise noted in [Table 4](#Trend-tab4), each table in each workbook has the same arrangement of rows and columns. |Sheet tab label||Description of visits included in table| |Contents||The Table of Contents lists each table that appears in the workbook. By clicking the table name, the user is taken automatically to that sheet in the workbook. A link to return to the Table of Contents is provided at the top and bottom of every spreadsheet.| |Table Notes||The table notes that appear in this spreadsheet apply to each table in the workbook. Also included here is the suggested citation to use when reproducing a table.| |ED Visits by Drug||All ED visits included in the analytic group (e.g., the workbook named \"Nation_2011_Illicit.xls\" includes just visits involving illicit drugs). See | The rows of the tables represent drug categories and drugs. Each drug and each drug category appear on the same row in each table (e.g., the estimates of ED visits involving cocaine appear on row 15 in every table). The classification of drugs used in DAWN is derived from the Multum Lexicon, \u00a9 2012 Lexi-Comp, Inc., and/or Cerner Multum, Inc. The Lexicon was slightly modified to meet DAWN's need to report on illicit drugs using street names. The 39 columns in each table provide the following information: The age categories used for reporting ED visits in the DAWN Trend Tables reflect critical junctures in drug use. For example, patients aged 5 and under are reported separately to facilitate study of visits involving accidental ingestion. Patients aged 12 to 17 are considered to be in their formative years, and understanding the nature of their drug use is important for prevention efforts. Patients under the age of 21 are reported separately to facilitate study of topics such as underage drinking. Patients aged 18 to 20 are reported separately from those aged 21 to 24 to isolate drug-taking behaviors before and after the critical age of 21. Older patients are grouped in wider categories where age differences are not as critical to intervention and treatment. As a consequence, the age categories are not evenly sized\u2014for example, the age group 30 to 34 covers 5 years, whereas the age group 35 to 44 covers 10 years. The size of an age group is an important consideration when comparing estimates of ED visits for different age categories. The following values appear in the cells of the DAWN Trend Tables. The order in which values are listed here corresponds to the order in which they appear in the standard table format, going from left to right across the table. The section headings below match the overarching headings that appear in row 6 of the standard table format. Estimates of drug-related ED visits are calculated by applying weights and adjustments to the data provided by the sampled hospitals participating in DAWN. The primary sampling weights reflect the probability of selection, whereas separate adjustment factors are included to account for nonresponse, data quality, and the known total of ED visits delivered by the universe of eligible hospitals, as reported by the most current American Hospital Association survey. Estimates of the number of visits are reported to the fifth decimal place, though they are formatted to appear as whole numbers. An asterisk (*) appears if a value is suppressed (see [Section 2.6](#Trend-2.6)). All estimate fields are populated with a value or an asterisk; blanks do not appear and are not valid. All rates in the DAWN Trend Tables are visits per 100,000 persons. Rates are standardized measures that are helpful when comparing levels of drug-related ED visits for different years, types of visits, and demographic groups. DAWN rates for years and types of visits are based on the whole population; for example, there were 790.4 ED visits involving drug misuse or abuse per 100,000 population in 2011 compared with 552.9 visits in 2004. For specific age groups and sexes, the denominator is limited to the population in that age group or sex. For age in particular, rates are important because the size of the underlying population differs considerably across DAWN age groups (see [Section 1.5](#Trend-1.5)). For example, in 2011 there were 13.5 million individuals aged 18 to 20 in the United States and 40.6 million aged 35 to 44. Accordingly, the estimated number of ED visits involving drug misuse or abuse was 239,281 visits for those aged 18 to 20 and 432,957 visits for those aged 35 to 44. To allow comparison between the two age groups, standardized rates are calculated as the number of ED visits per 100,000 persons in that age group. In this example, while the estimated number of visits was much lower for persons aged 18 to 20, the rate of visits was substantially higher: 1,771.5 for persons aged 18 to 20 compared with 1,065.7 visits for persons aged 35 to 44. Because they are reported as percentages, the RSEs provided in DAWN tables apply equally to the estimates and the rates. Rates are reported to the ninth decimal place, though they are formatted to display only the first decimal (e.g., 123.4). Rates based on suppressed estimates are likewise suppressed, with an asterisk (*) appearing instead of a value (see [Section 2.6](#Trend-2.6)). DAWN does not produce population-based rates for race/ethnicity categories because race/ethnicity information in ED records is often missing or is very limited. Three dots (...) appear in the rate fields in the race/ethnicity tables. All rate fields are populated with a value, asterisk, or three dots; blanks do not appear and are not valid. Because DAWN relies on a sample of hospitals, each estimate produced from the DAWN ED data is subject to sampling variability, the variation in the estimate that would be observed naturally if different samples were drawn from the same population using the same procedures. The sampling variability of an estimate in this publication is measured by its relative standard error (RSE). The precision of an estimate or rate is inversely related to its RSE. That is, the greater the RSE, the lower the precision. RSEs are reported to the ninth decimal place, though they are formatted to display only the first decimal (e.g., 12.3). The RSE values reported are percentages (e.g., 12.3 = 12.3%). Because it is reported as a percentage, an RSE measure applies to both the estimate and the rate. RSEs based on suppressed estimates are likewise suppressed, with an asterisk (*) appearing instead of a value (see [Section 2.6](#Trend-2.6)). All RSE fields are populated with a value or an asterisk; blanks do not appear and are not valid. The DAWN Trend Tables assess between-year changes by comparing estimates as follows: In the DAWN Trend Tables, 2011 Update, 2011 estimates are compared with those for 2004 (first year), 2009 (year before last), and 2010 (last year). The underlying formula is of the form: ((estimate for earlier year estimate for later year) / estimate for earlier year). The resulting values are reported to the seventh decimal place, though they are formatted to display a whole number that represents a percentage difference (e.g., 12 = 12% increase in the number of visits). Declines in percentage difference appear as negative numbers (e.g., 12 = 12% decrease in the number of visits). The tables report percentage differences between years only if they are statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level; otherwise, a blank appears. A blank also appears if either estimate in the percentage difference formula is suppressed (see [Section 2.6](#Trend-2.6)). Percent change measures for rates are not provided. The DAWN Trend Tables include the lower and upper boundaries of the confidence intervals (CIs) for all estimates at the 95 percent confidence level. For example, the estimate of the number of ED visits involving any type of drug misuse or abuse in 2011 was 2,462,948 visits. A 95 percent CI means that if repeated samples were drawn from the same population of hospitals using the same sampling and data collection procedures, the number of ED visits reported (2,462,948 visits) will fall between the lower boundaries (2,112,868 visits) and upper boundaries (2,813,028 visits) 95 percent of the time. The confidence limit estimates are reported to the eighth decimal place, though they are formatted to appear as whole numbers. An asterisk (*) appears if a value is suppressed (see [Section 2.6](#Trend-2.6)). All CI fields are populated with a value or an asterisk; blanks do not appear and are not valid. DAWN estimates with RSE values greater than 50 percent or estimates based on fewer than 30 ED visits (weighted or unweighted) are considered too imprecise for publication and are not shown. An asterisk (*) is displayed in the place of a suppressed estimate or any value based on a suppressed estimate (i.e., rate, RSE, percent change, lower CI, upper CI).

[2](#Trend-foot2) Major changes to DAWN were instituted in 2004 as the result of a redesign that altered most of DAWN's core features. Changes were made in the design of the hospital sample, the drug-related cases eligible for DAWN, the data items submitted on these cases, and the protocol for case finding and quality assurance. These improvements created a permanent disruption in trends. As a result, the base year for comparison to later years is 2004. [3](#Trend-foot3) Because of data limitations in 2004, the 2011 data for visits involving adverse reactions are compared with 2005, not 2004. "}
