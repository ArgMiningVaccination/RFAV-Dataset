The Cacao: Attune to your senses. Sip. Attune again. A mindfulness-based guided meditation with gentle movement and a serving of ceremonial grade Peruvian Cacao Criollo. Cacao drink made with 1 oz of Ceremonial Grade Cacao Paste, coconut milk, vanilla, and a touch of honey. Cacao is the raw whole food form of chocolate. This velvety drink is plant medicine. It inspires euphoric states in the body. After you sip the Nitric Oxide production in your body increases, relaxing your arteries, which allows for increased blood flow. Cacao contains Anandamide. Termed \"the bliss molecule\" it's associated with improved motivation and increased pleasure. The Sound: Alchemy Crystal Sound Bath Sound Healing is one of the oldest forms of healing known to mankind and has been used the world over to invoke, attune, and transform Consciousness. Sound produces powerful vibrations and, as we are vibrational beings by nature, our very structure is transformed by its movement. Alchemy Crystal Tones Singing Bowls are made of the highest quality (99.992% pure) quartz crystal, making them incredibly resonant. The tones produced by Alchemy Crystal Bowls are not just heard by the ear, you feel them in your body, with certain tones affecting your energy centers (chakras) for healing, balancing & meditation. Our bodies are crystalline in structure. When working with crystals, there may be profound effects on the organs, tissues, and cells, as well as the circulatory, endocrine, and metabolic systems. Thoughts are energy forms. When thought energy interacts with a crystal, those thoughts are changed to more harmonic forms, which change brainwave frequencies, showing possible alterations in consciousness. Thus, the power of positive intention or affirmation combined with the use of crystals provides remarkable healing results. GONG BATH The sound of a gong helps the brain reach deep relaxation - specifically the delta and theta brain wave states, which are the slowest brain waves in humans. We tend to reach these states during daydreaming or deep sleep, and they are known to aid relaxation, creativity and natural healing. Samhain: This celebration was one of the four main festivals of the Gaelic calendar. Tradition holds that Samhain is a time to honor the end of harvest season and the start of the coldest half of the year. It's also been referred to as The Celtic New Year. Modern folx who would like to invoke a sense of nature-inspired-spirituality may choose to use a Samhain ritual to remember and cherish their innate cosmic belonging.
