Like a door or pathway, activating a marma point opens into the inner pharmacy of the body. The body is a silent, universal, biochemical laboratory\u2014operating every moment to interpret and transform arising events. Touching a marma point changes the body's biochemistry and can unfold radical, alchemical change in one's makeup. Stimulation of these inner pharmacy pathways signals the body to produce exactly what it needs, including hormones and neurochemicals that heal the body, mind and consciousness. This deep dimension of marma therapy has the potential to unfold spiritual healing. ISBN-13: 978-1-883725-19-8 Paperback, 8.5 x 11 inches, 368 pp. $50.00 \"An excellent and invaluable resource for acupuncturists to enhance their clinical knowledge of acupoints. The authors offer an insightful comparison between Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine and how both systems have a similar approach to heal body, mind and spirit through treatment of these energy points.\" - Dr. Qijian YeFormer Professor and Academic Dean at Southwest Acupuncture College, Albuquerque \"As a yoga primer, textbook, practice manual, and encyclopedia for one specialized area of Ayurveda, this isn't a volume to absorb in a few hours...There is a lot of information here, enough to keep you learning for years.\" - Todd JonesYoga Journal review, August 2009 \"Ayurveda and Chinese medicine are the world's two preeminent systems of holistic health and healing. These two systems, each complete in itself, have been cross-fertilizing for millennia, and will continue to do so for generations to come. This truly timely book, which presents one approach to how each system's concepts might be accurately translated into the idioms of the other, blazes a trail that future efforts can expand into a traditional medicine information highway.\" - Dr. Robert E. Svoboda, B.A.M.S.Author, Ayurveda: Life, Health and Longevity, the Aghora series and more \"This is not your typical book about Ayurveda and yoga. One of the topics the authors write about is based on their personal knowledge of traditional yoga postures. But they also offer insight into the ancient practice of Indian pressure points, or marma, which are stimulated in the body during yoga poses. What is unique is how the authors connect the two practices. Following their suggestions can contribute to your deeper understanding of your body and to enhanced health. Recommended for yoga teachers and students alike.\" - Judith Hanson Lasater, Ph.D., P.T.Yoga Teacher and Author, including 30 Essential Yoga Poses "}
