Most homeopathic remedies come from plants, animals, or minerals and is both environmentally friendly and cruelty-free. Remedies are made from a tincture of the substance to be used. The tincture is diluted repeatedly in highly purified water and shaken vigorously in a process known as dilution and succussion. The mixture becomes more potent and more deeply acting the more times it is diluted and succussed. The tincture is added to sugar pills or pellets. The pills or pellets can be taken as a dry dose, in which they are placed under the tongue to dissolve, or as plussed or LM doses, in which they are dissolved in water and succussed before a specific dose is taken. In homeopathy, homeopaths examine the root cause of a client's concerns, working to stimulate the body's responses. Physical symptoms the body produces are a natural response and are the body's way of restoring balance. Homeopathy remedies work by moving the body's energy. Homeopaths theorize that when a remedy has resonance with the body, its energy balances the body's system.
