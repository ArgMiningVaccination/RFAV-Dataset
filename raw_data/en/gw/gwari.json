From the outset of the pandemic, preventing the spread of COVID-19 through the observance of health protocols, especially the use of sanitizers and disinfectants was given more attention. Despite the effectiveness of disinfection chemicals in controlling and preventing COVID-19, there are critical concerns about their adverse effects on human health. This study aims to assess the health effects of sanitizers and disinfectants on a global scale. A total of 91056 participants from 154 countries participated in this cross-sectional study through an electronic questionnaire. Results implied that detergents (67%), alcohol-based materials (56%), and chlorinated compounds (32%) were the most commonly used types of sanitizers and disinfectants. Most frequently reported health issues include skin complications 48.8% and respiratory complications 29.8%. The Chi-square test showed a signi\u0000cant association between chlorinated compounds with all possible health complications under investigation (p-value<0.001). Examination of risk factors based on multivariate regression analysis showed that alcohols-based materials were associated with skin complications (OR, 1.98; 95%CI, 1.87-2.09), per-chlorine was associated with eye complications (OR, 1.83; 95%CI, 1.74-1.93), and highly likely with itching and throat irritation (OR, 2.00; 95%CI, 1.90-2.11). Furthermore, formaldehyde was associated with a higher prevalence of neurological complications (OR, 2.17; 95%CI, 1.92-2.44). The \u0000ndings of the current study suggest that health authorities need to implement more awareness programs about the side effects of using sanitizers and disinfectants during viral epidemics. 1. Introduction COVID-19 is one of the great challenges to human health. According to the report of the World Health Organization, by November 16, 2022, 548 million people were infected and more than 6 million deaths worldwide had occurred (WHO, 2022). The emergence of new and mutated strains of the virus over time has exacerbated this catastrophic health challenge (Hashemi et al., 2022b). From the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak until now, simultaneously with treatment measures, health and preventive measures such as strict quarantine, social distancing, hand washing, disinfection of various surfaces, and wearing a mask among others, as health protocols to reduce and cutting off the transmission chain were on the agenda of governments and health organizations (Alimohamadi et al., 2022a; Amanollahi et al., 2021; Hashemi et al., 2022b). With the hypothesis of the persistence of the virus on different surfaces and its transmission through skin contact, personal and public hygiene by hand washing and disinfection of different surfaces became more important. Among the various surfaces with the most frequent contact were door handles, smartphones, remote controls, keyboards, tables and chairs, light switches, and elevator buttons, etc. (Al-Sayah, 2020; Ghafoor et al., 2021; Jin et al., 2020; Yari et al., 2020). The literature shows that coronavirus can \u0000oat in the air for 3 hours, on smooth surfaces (glass, plastic, banknotes) for 4 to 7 days, on the outer layer of the surgical mask for up to 7 days, on copper surfaces, cardboard, and paper for less than 3 hours and stainless steel up to 72 hours (Chin et al., 2020; Dhama et al., 2021; Doremalen et al., 2020). The shelf life of the virus depends on various factors such as temperature, relative humidity, and pressure (Dindarloo et al., 2020; Kampf, 2020). To reduce the spread of the virus and disrupt the transmission chain, disinfection using sanitizers and disinfectants for living and non-living surfaces as an e\u0000cient method was recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Environmental Protection Agency in accordance with the issued instructions (Chen et al., 2021; Dindarloo et al., 2020). Sanitizers and disinfectants used include alcohol-based materials, oxidizing agents, detergents, agents (sodium hypochlorite, disinfectants, iodine-releasing agents, peroxide, and compounds, etc. (Al-Sayah, 2020; McDonnell and Russell, 1999; Rutala and Weber, 2019). Using sanitizers and disinfectants may have adverse effects on human health, mainly because of the harmful and corrosive compounds in the composition of most sanitizers and disinfectants, such as chlorine-releasing agents, quaternary ammonium cations, or oxidizing agents (Bonin et et al., 2019; Emmanuel et al., 2004; Nabi et al., 2020). The severity of these side effects may vary depending on the type of chemicals, their target objects (living or non-living surfaces), the frequency and volume of the chemicals, and the risk status of the exposed individual (Prajapati et al., 2022). Lack of knowledge and insu\u0000cient experience in sanitizer and disinfectant use increases the rate of side effects due to the use of these chemicals (Gharpure et al., 2020; Rai et al., 2020). Potential acute side effects of using sanitizers and disinfectants include skin complications, itching, sore throat, eyes, and nose irritation, and ailments of the respiratory system (cough, sneezing, shortness of breath). Neurological complications such as headache, dizziness, and vomiting have been also reported (ECDC, 2020; Goh et al., 2021; Lachenmeier, 2008). Regardless of the sanitizer and disinfectant safety information and application instructions prolonged use of these products may cause chronic side effects including disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), reproductive disorders, cancer, pulmonary obstruction, etc. (Choi et al., 2020). Although several studies have been conducted regionally in a variety of countries on some of the adverse health effects due to disinfectant use (Dawood et al., 2021; Dhama et al., 2021; Dindarloo et al., 2020; Ghafoor et al., 2021; Rosenman et al., 2021; Shah et al., 2021), the current study is a comprehensive survey aimed to estimate the health effects associated with the use of sanitizers and disinfectants among the general population on a global scale. 2. Methods 2.1. Design, participants, and sampling procedure This study aims to assess the health effects of sanitizers and disinfectants on a global scale. There were no exclusion/inclusion criteria for participation in the study, and all individuals regardless of race, age, gender, occupation, and income level were included. The research project was approved by the ethics committee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. This study follows the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Survey design (non- interventional) is not considered a clinical trial under Directive 2001/20/EC and Regulation (Europe) No 536/2014. All participants provided online informed consent before the study.Page 8/222.2. Measurement Tools 2.2.1. Questionnaire The questionnaire was translated into 26 different languages by native language speakers. The questionnaire includes three parts (including 28 items). The \u0000rst part (7 questions) was referring to demographic information including age, gender, educational and occupational status, country, place of residence, and income level. The second part (6 questions) includes the type, monthly consumption volume, and the number of daily use of sanitizers and disinfectants for living and non-living surfaces. The chemicals which have been investigated included detergents (Soap and toilet liquid, dishwashing liquid), alcohol or alcohol-based materials, (sodium hypochlorite, per-chlorine), hydrogen peroxide, and formaldehyde. The third part (13 questions) includes health outcomes. Skin complications (itching and skin irritation, dryness, scaling, and urticaria), ocular (itching and eye irritation, and redness), irritation and itching of the throat, respiratory problems (itching and nasal irritation, runny nose, cough and sneezing, and shortness of breath), and neurological effects (headache, dizziness, and vomiting) were questioned. Questionnaire-related questions and options were reviewed by several specialists, including a dermatologist, otolaryngologist, ophthalmologist, pulmonologist, and chemist, as well as a biostatistics specialist. 2.2.2. Reliability and Validity The reliability of the questionnaire showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.90). The validity of the questionnaire for only seven living languages (Arabic, English, French, German, Persian, Russian, and Spanish) which are considered o\u0000cial or secondary languages of several countries, was reviewed by 5 to 7 experts with research backgrounds related and faculty members. These experts assessed the validity in light of \u0000ve components of necessity, relevance, transparency, simplicity, and ambiguity related to each question. 2.2.3. Data collection procedure The questionnaire was designed using Google Form\u00ae. In some countries (e.g., China), lack of access to Google or due to poor bandwidth, other internal platforms (e.g., wenjuanxing) and sites (e.g.; https://www.wjx.cn/) were used to create online links to the questionnaire. The questionnaire was distributed via email or social networks such as Telegram, WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and WeChat, etc. The questionnaire was available online for 9 months from [Aug 2021] to [Apr 2022] to achieve maximum participation. 2.3. Statistical analysis The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS for Windows, version 28.0 (IBM Inc., Armonk, NY). The Chi-square test was used to analyze descriptive statistics (n, %), and to evaluate the signi\u0000cance of the association between variables. To assess risk factors for health outcomes in participants, a multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed, and the relationship between risk factors and adverse effects of using sanitizers and disinfectants are presented as odds ratios (ORs) and 95%CIs, after adjustment for confounders, including age, gender, educational level, occupational status, place of residence (rural and urban areas), and income level. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically signi\u0000cant 3. Result 3.1. Study design and participants Demographic characteristics are shown in Table 1. A total of 91056 participants [58 845 (64.6%) females and 32211 (35.4%) males]. Respondents were well represented by ages 21 to 30 years (37577, 41.3%), urban areas (76122, median income (48776, 53.6%). In this study, the income level was considered relative to the average income of each country. Therefore, the majority of participants had an average income in their country. Out of 193 United Nations (UN) members (and 2 countries that are non-member observer states: the Holy See and the State of Palestine), 154 countries participated in this study. The global participation rate was reported to be 79%. 41 countries (21%) from different continents did not participate in the study. According to Table 1, the number of participating countries from each continent includes Africa (48), America (19), Asia (44), Europe (39), and Oceania (4) countries correctly completed the questionnaire.Page 9/22Table 1 Demographic characteristics of the study (N=91,056) Characteristics N Male Female Age 20 9861(10.8) 3502(3.8) 6359(7.0) 21 to N (RR*) Africa America Asia Europe Oceania 48 (24.6%) 19 (9.7%)44 (22.5%)39 (20%)4 (2%) No participation: N 6 16 4 5 10 *Response Rate 3.2. Type and volume of sanitizers and disinfectants used In the second part of the questionnaire, questions were asked about the type, volume, and number of times of daily use of 5 types of chemical compounds as sanitizers (Fig. 1) and 7 types of substances as disinfectants (Fig. 2). The status of the use of sanitizers and disinfectants is shown in Table 2 and Figs. 1 to 3. The consumption status of the sanitizers for handwashing or other living surfaces is shown in Fig. 1. Compared to other sanitizers, the highest use was detergents (soap and toilet liquid, dishwashing liquid) at 74% (n=67445), and alcohol or non-commercial sanitizers at 57% (n=52083). In contrast, chlorine compounds such as sodium hypochlorite at 10.5% (n=9490) were used less often as sanitizers. Additionally, the status of seven groups of disinfectants, which are used for the disinfection of various high-touch surfaces such as door handles, tables, chairs, remotes, keys, elevator buttons, etc., was explored (Fig. 2). In this group, in addition to detergents at 60% (n=54445) and alcohol-based products at 55% (n= 49879), which were most used compared to other disinfectants, the use of sodium hypochlorite was reported as a high-consumptive disinfectant at 26% (n=24296). In contrast, formaldehyde by 1.6% (n=1441) and per-chlorine by 7.2% (n=6605) had the lowest consumption as a disinfectant.Page 10/22Table 2 Consumption status of sanitizers and disinfectants frequency of daily use (N/d) Monthly consumption volume (CC) Once a day1-3/d 4-6/d >6/d Low day1-3/d 4-6/d >6/d None Low (0.5)Average (0.5 to use of sanitizers and disinfectants N (%) N (%) Detergents (Soap and toilet liquid, dishwashing liquid) 60948 (67)Alcohol or 7380 (8.1) Formaldehyde 1444 (1.6) In terms of the frequency of daily use of sanitizers and disinfectants, the results showed that most participants tended to use sanitizers and disinfectants 1 to 3 times a day (n=29778, 32.7%) and once a day (n=35959, 39.5%), respectively. The volume of chemicals used was also one of the important factors in creating the scenarios of possible adverse effects and we found that most of the participants stated using the sanitizers and disinfectants at a volume of approximately 101-300 mL, and 0.5-1 liter per month, respectively (Table 2). The continental distribution of the inclination of consumers (individuals) to use sanitizers and disinfectants is shown in Fig. 3. Four groups of countries were determined according to the sanitizers and disinfectant consumption rate: countries with low consumption (blue<1000), medium consumption (yellow=1001-2000), high consumption (brown=2001-3000), and countries that tend to consume too many sanitizers and disinfectants (red>3000). The number of countries that were less inclined to use sanitizers and disinfectants was in Africa, while the number of countries with the highest level of consumption was in Asia. Similarly, the continental distribution shows that most countries with moderate consumption of sanitizers and disinfectants were in continental Europe. 3.3. Adverse health outcomes of sanitizers and disinfectants The distribution of the frequency of adverse events showed that the most common complaints reported by the participants were related to skin and respiratory system complications (Fig. 4). The highest and lowest frequencies were related to skin dryness by 72% (n=65680) and neurological effects (headache, dizziness, and vomiting) by 14.3% (n=13063), respectively. Table 3 shows the possible adverse health outcomes as a result of the use of sanitizers and disinfectants based on the reports of the participants in this study. There was a signi\u0000cant relationship between the use of chlorine compounds such as sodium hypochlorite and per-chlorine with all the adverse effects (p<0.001) (Table 3).Page 11/22Table 3 Frequency table and the relationship between sanitizers/disinfectants and health outcomes (Chi-square test) Type of chemical Itching and Skin Irritation Skin Dryness Hand Scaling Skin urticaria (Hives) Yes No Yes No Yes No Yes No N (%) N (%) N (%) N (%) N (%) N (%) N (%) N (%) Detergents (Soap and toilet Type of chemical Itching and Eye Irritation Eye Redness Itching and Throat Irritation Itching and Nose Irritation Yes No Yes No Yes No Yes No N (%) N (%) N (%) N (%) N (%) N (%) N (%) N (%) Detergents (Soap and toilet The use of detergents and alcohol or alcohol-based products resulted in a greater adverse effect on the skin than other chemicals (Table 3). Among the skin complications, the most commonly reported adverse effect was skin dryness. 49.7% (n=45259) and 43.5% (n=39573) of the participants complained of dry skin due to the use of detergents and alcohol or alcohol-based materials, respectively. There was a signi\u0000cant relationship between itching and skin irritation with all chemicals (except other commercial sanitizers and hospital disinfectants) (p<0.001). Unlike other chemicals, there was no signi\u0000cant relationship between skin scaly with alcohols, commercial sanitizers, and hydrogen peroxide (p>0.001). 3.3.2. Ocular complications The contribution of sodium hypochlorite in causing ocular complications was greater than other chemicals. Participants reported itching and ocular irritation by 17% (n=15407) and ocular redness by 12.5% (n=11302) after using sodium hypochlorite. The data show a signi\u0000cant relationship between itching and ocular irritation with all sanitizers and disinfectants (except detergents and alcohol or alcohol-based materials) (p<0.001) (Table 3). 3.3.3. Throat complications Participants reported itching and irritation of the throat after using alcohol or alcohol-based products by 13.8% (n=12591), hospital-grade sanitizers commercial sanitizers by 6.6% (n=6035). Itching and irritation of the throat as one of the possible side effects of sanitizers and disinfectants was signi\u0000cantly associated with some chemicals such as chlorine compounds (sodium hypochlorite & per-chlorine), hospital disinfectants, hydrogen peroxide, formaldehyde (p<0.001) (Table 3). 3.3.4. Respiratory system complicationsPage 13/22Respiratory complications including itching and nose irritation by 21.6% (n=19692), runny nose by 13.8% (n=12601), and cough and sneezing by 22.1% (n=20148) were reported after using alcohol or alcohol-based products. There was a signi\u0000cant relationship between shortness of breath with all chemicals except detergents (all p<0.001). In contrast, except for chlorine compounds, there was no signi\u0000cant relationship between cough, sneezing, and runny nose with the majority of sanitizers and disinfectants (p>0.001) (Table 3). 3.3.5. Neurological complications The present \u0000ndings showed that less than eight percent of the participants had self-reported neurological complications including headache, dizziness, and vomiting after using sanitizers and disinfectants. In total, 7.8% (n=7114), and 0.5% (n=419) of participants complained of headaches, dizziness, and vomiting after using alcohol (the most) and formaldehyde (the least), respectively. The results indicated that a statistically signi\u0000cant relationship was found between possible neurological problems due to the use of analyzed sanitizers and disinfectants (except detergents) (all p<0.001) (Table 3). 3.3. Multivariable logistic regression analysis After controlling for confounders (demographic characteristics), a multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the risk factors associated with adverse health outcomes (Table 4). The use of some sanitizers and disinfectants was associated with skin adverse effects (e.g., Itching and skin irritation after using alcohol or alcohol-based materials: OR, 1.86; 95%CI, p>0.001; or as using sodium hypochlorite: OR, 1.43; 95%CI, p<0.001). In contrast, the use of some other sanitizers and disinfectants was associated with a lower chance of itching and skin irritation (hospital disinfectants: OR, 0.91; 95%CI, 95%CI, p<0.001) were associated with higher odds of skin dryness, scaling of the skin, skin urticaria respectively. Table 4 Risk Factors for Health complications by Multivariable Logistic Regression Analysis Type of chemical Itching and Skin Irritation Skin Dryness Skin scaling Skin urticaria (Hives) Adjusted ORCI for age, sex, educational level, occupational status, place of residence (rural & city), and income level.Page 14/22Table 4 Cont. Type of chemical Itching and Eye Irritation Eye Redness Itching and Throat IrritationItching and Nose Irritation Adjusted ORCI ORCI 1.730.001 Adjusted for age, sex, educational level, occupational status, place of residence (rural & city), and income level. Itching and ocular irritation were reported after using per-chlorine: OR, p<0.001. ocular redness was the use of per-chlorine (OR, 1.77; 95%CI, p<0.001), and hydrogen peroxide (OR, 1.49; 95%CI, p<0.001). The results showed that one of the important risk factors for throat-related effects is chlorine-based compounds. Per-chlorine resulted in double the risk for throat-related effects (OR, 2.00; 95%CI, p<0.001), and sodium hypochlorite use is also a serious risk factor for itching and throat irritation (OR, 1.66; 95%CI, p<0.001). Furthermore, the use of sodium p<0.001), and formaldehyde (OR, 1.56; 95%CI, p<0.001) were accompanied by coughing and sneezing. Similarly, shortness of breath was associated with the use of sodium hypochlorite (OR, 1.78; 95%CI, p<0.001), and per-chlorine (OR, 1.67; 95%CI, p<0.001). There was a strong association between the use of formaldehyde and the occurrence of neurological complications (OR, 2.17; 95%CI, p<0.001). 4. Discussion Regarding the use of sanitizers and disinfectants in different continents, it was observed that in African countries, due to low-income levels, and lack of accessibility the tendency to use disinfectants was lower than in other continents. In contrast, in some less-resourced countries, such as Iran, and more- resourced countries, such as China, the US, the UK, Germany, and Australia, etc., there was a greater tendency to use disinfectants. Adequate income levels, adequate education, and information, easy access to the types of sanitizers and disinfectants, and strict controlling measures by the governments have been effective in increasing the use of these chemicals (Becher et al., 2021; Bu et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2020; Unruh et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2020). Although our claim regarding some countries such as Venezuela, Iraq, Afghanistan, etc. was not correct. Contrary to the economic crisis prevailing in these countries, the use of sanitizers and disinfectants was high. In addition to this more attention and the fear of contracting the disease, sometimes leads to the excessive consumption of sanitizers and disinfectants, which leads to the occurrence of adverse effects due to the toxic nature of these chemicals on the population; \u0000nally, the body's resistance to other infectious agents may decrease (Tachikawa, 2020; Vogel, 2011). On the other hand, the denial of the existential nature of the COVID-19 disease by people from different countries (Afolabi and 2021) can be one of the main reasons for not tending to use sanitizers and disinfectants as part of health protocols. We found that the disinfectants with the highest rate of causing different adverse health effects are chlorine compounds (sodium hypochlorite and per-chlorine). One of the reasons for this \u0000nding could be the widespread use of these compounds as bleaches, cleansers, and vegetable washes, for washing different surfaces, water disinfection as well as easy access and affordability. In addition to the inherent complications of using chemicals as sanitizers and disinfectants, there are other reasons such as misuse (mixing several chemicals without following the instructions), excessive use, and counterfeit and unauthorized products that can cause side effects (Alhouri et al., 2020; Cook and Brooke, 2021). However, some disinfectants (e.g., detergents) may not have serious adverse effects on human health, but prolonged exposure and overuse of any chemical increase their harmful potential (Baldeo et al., 2022). Similar studies have shown that most disinfectants, such as alcohols and proxygene compounds, can be considered potential irritants or skin allergens (Goh et al., 2021; Lachenmeier, 2008; Murphy and Friedman, 2019). ThePage 15/22US centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) reported an increase in calls to the center because of overuse and frequent exposure to cleaning chemicals during the Covid-19 pandemic (CDC, 2020; Rosenman et al., 2021). Various reports have claimed that long-term use of surfactants causes dryness and roughness of the skin (Goh et al., 2021; Paudel et al., 2022; Shibuya et al., 2022). Similarly, alcohol-based substances despite their low permeability to the skin had the most skin effects as a result of prolonged contact and regular and continuous use. Similar studies have reported increased exposure and frequency of alcohol use as a cause of skin irritation or dermatitis (Bouthoorn et al., 2011; Ghafoor et al., 2021; Lachenmeier, 2008). Unlike sanitizers and other disinfectants, alcohols were more effective in causing skin urticaria. In one study, skin urticaria was reported as a result of alcohol use (such as isopropanol) due to the combination of these alcohols with some solvents and organic matter (Berardi et al., 2020; Goh and Ahmed, 2020; Pecquet et al., 1992). The results obtained in this study regarding skin complications were in accordance with some scienti\u0000c texts and similar studies (Bito et al., 2010; Chan and Maibach, 2008; Europe, 2017; Murphy and Friedman, 2019). The results of the multivariate regression analysis showed that detergents, alcohols or alcohol-based substances, and chlorine compounds have a higher potential of causing skin complications compared to other sanitizers and disinfectants. Ocular complications (itching and irritation and eye redness) due to the use of sanitizers and disinfectants were less common than other complications. However, in terms of frequency, detergents and alcohol accounted for the largest share of ocular side effects. The results of some studies con\u0000rm our \u0000ndings that itching and eye irritation are a result of the use of alcohol as a sanitizer/disinfectant (Ghafoor et al., 2021). Statistical results showed that among the chemicals studied, chlorine compounds had a higher chance of causing ocular complications compared to other disinfectants. This is probably due to the wide range of applications of chlorine compounds for different purposes as well as their ability to be mixed with other solvents. Studies have shown that the use of chlorine-based compounds in the form of sprays to disinfect surfaces will cause itching and eye irritation (Ghafoor et al., 2021; Schyllert et al., 2016; WHO, 2020). Since people used several types of chemicals separately or mixed to wash hands, face, and feet or to disinfect different surfaces, improper mixing of chemicals may release toxic gases and vapors that can affect the respiratory system. Studies have shown that mixing bleach with acidic cleaning agents leads to the release of highly irritating gases (PHE, 2015; Racioppi et al., 1994). Rosenman et al. claimed that not following hygienic instructions on how to use or mix cleansing products with other chemicals such as acid would create the conditions for chemical pneumonia or pulmonary edema (Rosenman et al., 2021). Our \u0000ndings showed that chlorine compounds (sodium hypochlorite and per- chlorine) were involved in causing all complications related to the respiratory system. This claim was consistent with a list approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency (Alimohamadi et al., 2022b) that sodium hypochlorite is an irritant and allergen for the respiratory system (EPA, 2020). The results of multivariate regression analysis showed that formaldehyde had an immensely signi\u0000cant chance of causing neurological effects compared to other sanitizers and disinfectants. Formaldehyde, as a carcinogen by OSHA (Tarka et al., 2016), has an unpleasant odor and is an irritant that can cause many adverse effects on human health (Ghafoor et al., 2021). 4.1. Strengths and limitations This is a comprehensive study with a coverage percentage of 79% (with the presence of 154 countries) that was conducted on a global scale and is remarkably valuable in its way. Another strength was the diversity of the participants there were no criteria for inclusion or exclusion of people in terms of age, gender, race, social, economic, and cultural class to participate in this study. The main limitations of this study were the non-participation of individuals for personal reasons or lack of access to the internet, the drop-out of some countries (41 countries), and background effects such as exposure to various pollutants causing complications such as in\u0000ammation and respiratory complications, etc. (Hashemi et al., 2022a). 5. Conclusion Our \u0000ndings could serve as a useful source of information in reducing concerns related to the adverse health effects of sanitizers and disinfectant use through education and information by governments and health organizations during viral epidemics. Furthermore, the present results can be helpful for safety and health organizations overseeing the production of chemicals in updating instructions on how to use chemicals, as well as replacing low-risk, low-dose, high-impact chemicals in the production process if possible.
