In less than thirty years, it has placed thousands of graduates into productive and satisfying employment; it has helped hundreds of citizens improve their literacy or earn a GED; it has assisted dozens of businesses and industries in retraining their workers. The Georgia General Assembly established Ogeechee Technical Institute as a public, two-year technical school in 1986. Soon afterw ards, Ogeechee Tech began offering Practical Nursing courses to 25 students who met for classes at the local hospital. Faculty, staff, and students moved into the original 75,000 square foot, $6 million facility in the fall of 1990. By this point the school was also offering instruction in Adult Literacy and in the General Equivalency Diploma (GED) exam preparation. Programs in business, industry, and other health programs were soon added. The school was accredited by the Council on Occupational Education. Ogeechee Technical Institute's growth during the mid-1990s coincided with the expansive growth of Georgia Southern University and the Statesboro area. Local support and the establishment of the Georgia St ate Lottery fund ed HOPE grant (Helping Outstanding Pupils E ducationally) in 1993 were contributing factors in the rapi d growth of Ogeechee Tech. The school continued to add programs to better serve the employment needs of its three- county service area: Bulloch, Evans, and Screven. In 1999, Ogeechee Technical Institute experienced a $5.5 million expansion by adding a Health Science Building, a childcare facility, and a Horticulture Building. During this time, Ogeechee Tech also expa nded its servi ces through the opening of the Screven County Learning Center in Sylvania. The first Associate of Applied Technology (AAT) degree program, Industrial Manufacturing, was started during Winter Quarter 2000, and soon after seven additional AAT programs were offered: Accounting, Computer Information Systems, Early Childhood Care and Education, Funeral Service Education, Health Informatio n Technology, Marketing, and Opticianry. On July 6, 2000, Ogeechee Technical Institute officially had its name changed by the state le gislature to Ogeechee Technical College. Student growth continued due largely to the addition of new programs, many of which were unique in the state technical college system. These distinctive programs included Funeral Service Education, Forensic Science Technology, and Opticianry. During the summer of 2002, Ogeechee Tech opened the Evans County Learning Center. With the opening of the Occupational Studies Building in Fall 2003, a wider variety of programs, such as Agribusiness, Wildlife and Plantation Management, Geographical Information Systems Technology, Veterinary Technology, Culinary Arts, and Hotel, Restaurant & Tourism Management, enabled the college to further expand its employment training opportunities. In 2004, Ogeechee Technical College paid tribute to the late Senator Joseph E. Kennedy for his role in the establishment of Ogeechee Technical Institute by dedicating the main building on campus as the Joseph E. Kennedy Building. In July 2008, Ogeechee Technical College was awarded a Regional Law Enforcement Academy which is housed in Evans County. The project allowed new law enforcement officers to receive their basic law enforcement training and obtain college credit at the same time. That same year, Ogeechee Technical College began construction of the Evans Technical Education Complex. The new complex included the Logistics and Public Safety Building, a driving track for the Commercial Truck Driving program, and an emergency vehicle operator track for the Regional Law Enforcement Academy. Another big change came at the beginning of 2009 when an Emergency Mass Notification System for faculty, staff, and students was implemented. The new OTC Alert system provided a way to send emergency warnings via cell phone and email messages. In an effort to offer better services to the students, Ogeechee Tech moved the Adult Education program to a new location adjacent to the main campus. In 2011, Ogeechee Tech transitioned from a quarter to a semester course schedule as well as moving to a tobacco-free campus. Also in that same year, Ogeechee Technical College was named the 2011 Technical College of the Year for the State of Georgia. Determined by meeting benchmarks in a variety of critical areas, Ogeechee Tech earned the top spot in the state system. In January 2013, classes began in the new Health Science Building-North. The Echocardiography, Opticianry, Radiologic Technology, Radiology Picture Archiving, and Sonography programs were relocated to this new building which provided expanded classroom and lab space for each program. Included in the new facility was a modern biology lab and a tiered lecture/demonstration hall. In November 2013, the College broke ground on a new 60,000 square foot Natural Resources Building which will house programs such as Agribusiness, Geographic Information Systems, and Fish and Wildlife Management. Soon thereafter in December, the College surpassed a major milestone in its history by becoming a candidate for accreditation with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges and was named a finalist for the 2013 Technical College of the Year award fo r the State of Georgia. 9 In June 2014, Ogeechee Tech was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges. Accreditation by SACSCOC was the culmination of many years of work by the College. It continues as an ongoing process which helps ensure the highest standards of education are met and allows greater opportunities for students who choose to pursue additional education following their time at Ogeechee Tech. Throughout the years, the excellence of Ogeechee Tech's instruction has been recognized. In 1999, John Groover, an English instructor, was named the statewide winner of the Rick Perkins Award for Excellence in Technical Instruction. Three Ogeechee Tech students have been named as the top student in the state by winning the Ge orgia Occupational Award of Leadership (GOAL) award: Molly Bickerton in 2008 Alvie Coes III in 2011 Lucas Teague in 2014 An ongoing determination to provide innovative programs of study keeps Ogeechee Tech in the forefront of meeting the educational demands of citizens in this region of Georgia. With 3,196 students attending classes in 2014, the demand for Ogeechee Tech's services re mains strong. With credit programs, continuing education courses, GED instruction, and literacy programs along with various other services, the College's commitment to meet the needs of the region continues.

Applicants of home schools located in Georgia who did not attend a recognized accredited program must adhere to the following alternative path for admission: Submit a letter from the local superintendent's office verifying that (1) the parent or legal guardian notified the superintendent of intent to home school and (2) that the parent or legal guardian submitted the required attendance reports to the superintendent's office on a monthly basis as required by O.C.G.A. \u00a7 20-2-690. Submit annual progress reports or a final transcript for the equivalent of the home-schooled student's junior and senior years. The final progress report should include the graduation date. Applicants of home schools lo cated outside the state of Georgia who did not attend a recognized accredited program must adhere to the following alternative path for admission: Submit annual progress reports or a final transcript for the equivalent of the home-schooled student's junior and senior years. The final progress report should include the graduation date. Submit SAT or ACT scores that meet the TCSG system minimum requirements. The President may waive the high school equivalency /high school diploma requirement for secondary students or those pursuing a high school equivalency who are otherwise eligible to enroll in a specific program of study. Assessment The ability for a student to succeed in a program at Ogeechee Technical College is greatly determined by the math and language skills possessed by that student. Ogeechee Tech is committed to assisting each student to reach their maximum potential. All students applying for diploma, degree, and certificate programs must be assessed prior to acceptance to a program of study. Stud ents will then be admitted in accordance with the academic standards applicable to that program. Ogeechee Tech utilizes COMP ASS or ASSET, the TCSG- approved assessment instruments, when evaluating students for program readiness. Howeve r, in the place of COMPASS or ASSET, Ogeechee Tech may accept a student's official entrance score on a validated assessment instrument (such as SAT, ACT), or Georgia High School Graduation Test in English/Language Arts if the scores meet the college program's required minimums. If a student's SAT, ACT, or Georgia High School Graduation Test in English/Language Arts scores do not meet th e college program's minimums for regular admission, a student must be assessed using one of the TCSG-approved instruments. Algebra scores are required only for Associate Degrees and certain other programs of study. All other programs require a Numerical Skills score. Assessment results will be valid for placement purposes for a period of 60 months and are transferable to any TCSG college. Official transcripts from a regionally or nationally accredited postsecondary ins titution recognized by the United States Department of Education documenting equivalent program-level English and math coursework successfully completed (C or better) may be used in lieu of completing the corresponding portion of the TCSG-approved assessment instrument. Placement Testing The COMPASS placement exam cons ists of a series of four tests: Writing, Reading, Mathematics, and Algebra. This test is an untimed, multiple choice examination given by computer. Required scores ma y be found in the Academic Programs section of this catal og. For applicants who are uncomfortable with taking computerized tests or in certain other situations, Ogeechee Technical College offers ASSET, another state approved instrument published by ACT. 13 ASSET consists of a series of four tests: Writing, Reading, Numerical Skills, and Elementary Algebra. This test is a paper and pencil and multiple choice format with each section timed at 25 minutes. The first placement exam given for admissions into Ogeechee Tech is free of char ge. Retesting is allowed for new students only, and new students may be allowed to retest only one time with appr oval. There is a $15 retest fee payable prior to testing.

High School Students High School Initiatives (HSI) provides students with a planned program of study that incorporates academic and career-related courses articulat ed between the secondary and postsecondary levels leading to a certificate, diploma, or degree. Students may take advantage of the HSI program in three ways from Ogeechee Technical College: Articulation, Joint Enrollment, and Move On When Ready. Articulation: Local articulation agreements have been developed to aid in a seamless transition from area high schools to Ogeechee Tech without repetition of coursework already mastered in the high school. To obtain a list of articulated courses, students sh ould contact the high school guidance office. Joint Enrollment: Joint Enrollment provides high school students the opportunity to take courses at Ogeechee Technical College and receive college credit only for the courses that they take at the college. Joint Enrollment students are allowed to take academic core and occupational program courses for any tec hnical certificate or diploma program in which they are eligible. Hours taken through Joint Enrollment do count against a student's HOPE Grant and Scholarship caps. Move On When Ready (MOWR): MOWR provides for participation in dual credit enrollment for eligible high school and home study students, 9th-12th grades. MOWR allows high school students to take academic degree level core courses that will transfer to any TCSG or USG college or university, occupational courses, and diploma level core courses. Some students may choose to enroll fully into a degree, diploma or technical cer tificate of credit program, or they may choose to just take a few courses. All college coursework taken through MOWR will be fully covered through MOWR funding, and students will not be required to pay out of pocket for tuition, college fees, or textbooks. The only fees students may be responsible for are course- specific fees determined by the college. No hours taken through the MOWR program will count towards a student's HOPE Grant or Scholarship Caps. Change of Program Students wishing to change programs are encouraged to complete the appropriate forms by mid-term of the semester prior to which the program change is desired and meet the admission criteria for the new program of study. Students will not be able to change programs after the third day of the term. A Change of Program fee of $15 will be charged.

A student will be required to complete the curriculum requirements in place at the ti me of re-enrollment. Also, some programs have specific readmission guidelines. Visit the individual program description in the OTC Catalog and Student Handbook for specific program readmission procedures. Advanced Placement Admission of Transfer Students Applicants to Ogeechee Technical College who have been previously enrolled at a postsecondary institution will be considered for admission under the following policies: Applicants who are in go od standing at their previous institution may be accepted in good standing; and Applicants who are on academic probation at their previous institution may be accepted on academic probation. Applicants who wish to transf er to the College must meet the entrance requirements and follow the guidelines listed in the \"Program Requirements/Ad mission Procedures\" section of the Ogeechee Technical College Catalog and Student Handbook . Applicants who have been previously enrolled at a postsecondary institution and desire entrance into one of the competitive admission programs (Diagnostic Medical Sonography, Echocardiography, Practical Nursing, Radiologic Technology, or Surgical Technology) must meet certain specific requirements listed in the Ogeechee Technical College Catalog and Student Handbook . Criminal Background Checks and Drug Screenings are not transferable. Students may be eligible for advanced placement through two methods: transfer cr edit and exemption credit. This policy guides all adva nced placement activities at Ogeechee Technical College. Ad vanced placement allows a student to receive course credit based on previous experience, formal or informal, and results in advanced standing within a certificate, diploma, and degree program. Ogeechee Technical College does not award academic credit for course work taken on a noncredit basis. Transfer Credit Ogeechee Technical College recognizes previous postsecondary coursework by accepting credits earned from 17 other regionally or nationally accr edited institutions that are applicable to the student's program of study. A student who presents credit for evaluation and transfer must be aware that the awarding of credit does not guarantee that institutions subsequently atte nded by the student will accept those credits. Credit for courses received at an institution accredited by a national or regional accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education and the Technical College System of Georgia (TCS G) and whose entrance requirements and curriculum ar e equivalent to or greater than those of OTC will be cons idered for awar d of transfer credit. Credit may be granted for formal military schools, training and correspondence co urses in accordance with the American Council on Education. Ogeechee Tech recognizes that it is necessary to establish reasonable and definitive policies for accepting transfer credit. The College developed these guidelines in accordance with the standard s set by the American Association of Collegiate Registrar's and Admissions Officers. Ogeechee Tech distinguishe s between the acceptance of credit and the applicability toward program requirements. Applicability of credit toward a credential refers to the prerogative of the academic divisions to count specific credit toward fulfillment of graduation requirements. The Registrar determines the tr ansferability of courses taken at other postsecondary institutions by considering the educational quality of the learning experience for which the students seeks transfer credit; the comparability of the nature, content, and level of learning experiences to the courses offered at Ogeechee Tech (the course is essentially the same content as the course to be taken at the College); and the appropriateness and applicability of the learning experience to the programs o ffered at Ogeechee Tech and how recently they occurred, and the credit hours are the same or greater The College established the following procedures to guide the Registrar in awarding transfer credit: In order for the Registrar to evaluate credit, the students must submit official transcripts from all colleges to Ogeechee Tech. All official transcripts must include final grades. The student must also complete and submit the Transfer/Articulated Credit Evaluation form requesting the evaluation of their transcript(s) to the Registrar. Students may receive transfer credit for courses for which they earned a C or better. The Registrar will not award transfer credit with grades below a C, including D, F, I, IP, W, WF, and WP. Due to the rapid changes in technology and technical information, program-specific courses will be considered for transfer credit in a program only if the coursework has been completed within the past five years (60 months). Technical courses that were taken five years prior to admission to Ogeechee Tech will be evaluated for technical currency for course conten t by the program faculty. A student desiring consideration of credit for technical courses or experiences that are more than five years old can request transfer by exemption testing. Transfer credit will be considered without restriction of completion dates for those courses in academic disciplines. Examples of these courses include, but are not limited to, English, psychology, mathematics, physical sciences, natural sciences, and social sciences . The Registrar will not aw ard transfer credit for learning support coursework or other institutional courses such as college orientation courses or exemption exams taken at other colleges. The transfer credit is recorded as TRA, TRB, or TRC on the Ogeechee Tech transcript and is not included in the calculation of the semester, cumulative, or graduation grade point average. The third letter indicates the actual grade earned in the course. For competitive admission programs, grades for credit earned as transfer credit will be evaluated for GPA and calculated in the GPA under consideration for program admission. Students may access their records online through the College website via BannerWeb to verify the transfer credit awarded by the Registrar. If coursework is earned at a nationally accredited college, Ogeechee Tech reserves the right to evaluate instructor creden tials applicable to the requested transfer coursework. A student who has attended a previous college and is eligible for transfer of credit for Englis h and math is not required to take the COMPASS placement exam. However, if the student for any reason takes the exam and scores indicate the need for a learning support class, the student forfeits evaluation of their transcript and the scores on the exam will determine placement, except in the case of a competitive admissions program. Students wishing to transfer from Ogeechee Tech to another college must contact that college directly to determine transfer of credit. Experiential Learnin g/Military Training Credit Credit may be awarded for education/training experiences in the Armed Services. Such experiences must be certified by the American Council on Education (identified in the Council's publication: Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the Armed Services) or the official catalog of the Commun ity College of the Air Force or a similar document. The experiential learning will be evaluated by the program instru ctor along with the Registrar to determine the course competencies. Credit will be given on the basis of individual evaluation. Course information must be present on the Armed Forces transcript. Credible military experience must closel y correspond to the course(s) in the Ogeechee Tech curricul um content and competencies. The time limit specified in the transfer credit section also applies to the experiential learning. 18 Professional Certification Ogeechee Technical College co nsiders credit awarded for non-collegiate educational pr ograms as recommended by the American Council on Education (ACE). ACE's National Guide to College Credit for Workforce Training and National Guide to Credit Recommendations for Non- collegiate Courses contain recommendations for experiential learning and prof essional examinations or certifications offered by other organizations separate of postsecondary educational institutions, including agencies offering professional certifications and the military. Documentation is required. The faculty member of the program in which the student is enrolled evaluates the documentation to determine if the experience meets or exceeds the program/course standards and makes a recommendation to the Registrar only if sufficient documentation is provided. Final determination is made by the Registrar. The process en sures all course work and outcomes are at the appropriate collegiate level. Foreign Earned Credit Credit may be awarded based upon an evaluation performed by an independent evaluation service. Recommended evaluation services are availabl e in the Admissions Office. The Registrar will make the final decision regarding the award of transfer credit. Gr ade points will not be assigned to transfer credit. Articulated Credit Articulated Credit is an option that allows high school students to receive advanced placement or exempt courses by taking articulated courses in high school. The student must submit a high school transcript showing the completed courses the student wants to receive credit from. Ogeechee Technical College must validate student competencies before awarding articulated credit for competencies learned in high school by administering the final examination/exemption ex amination for the course to be articulated. No fee shall be charged to students taking an exam to validate articulated credit from high school. The student must score equal to or higher than the required scores for the courses. The College shall bank credit after a high school student successfully passes the exemption exam required to articulate subject credit. This credit shall be applied to the student's record once he/she matriculates to the College. The high school student must matriculate within 2 years after high school graduation, unless dictated by programs standards. A list of approved courses is available from a high school counselor or the Admissions Office. Ogeechee Tech will honor local articulation agreements statewide when students move from one area of the state to another and will validate the credit by administering the final examination/exemption examination for the course being transferred. Articulated credit awarded will be indicated on transcript/permanent records by use of the letters \"AC.\" Institutional Exemption Exam A student may receive credit for courses by passing an exemption examination only if the student has never attempted the course nor made a grade of D or F in an equivalent course at OTC or another postsecondary institution. A student cannot withdraw from a course and register to take an exemption examination within the same term nor can a student take an exemption examination if he/she is currently registered for the course. Students wishing to pursue credit by examination must: Never have attempted the course at Ogeechee Technical College; Never have made a D or F in an equivalent course at another postsecondary institution; Be admitted and enrolled in a program of study at Ogeechee Technical College; Be able to present evidence which would indicate that the student has the education, training, or work experience similar to that given in a course being challenged. Faculty members are not eligible to take OTC exemption exams. Complete the Application for Credit by Examination form, and obtain approval from the student's academic advisor and the instructor responsible for administering the exam, the Academic D ean, and the Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs; Take the application to the Business Office in Building 600 (JEK Annex) and pay the TCSG approved non-refundable fee for the examination; Present the application an d a receipt of payment to the instructor responsible for administering the examination; and Earn a score of at least a \"C\". NOTE: Exemption exams are normally given during the final week of a semester. Completed applications must be submitted at least fourteen calendar days before the beginning of the final week of a semester. A grade of \"EXE\" will be entered on the permanent record if the exemption exam is successfully completed. The hours for the exempted grades will not be computed in the grade point average. NOTE: The Academic Affairs Division determines which courses exemption exams may be given for. A list of courses is available in the Office of the Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs. Academic Affairs reserves the right to change the courses on this list at any time and without notice. 19 Standardized Exam Credit Credit may be awarded based on nationally normed exams including, but not limited to, the following: CLEP - Credit will be awarded for successful completion of any appropriate CLEP (College Level Examination Program) subject area examin ations. Credit should be awarded based on score recommendations of the Council on College Level Services. Advanced Placement Examinations - Credit will be awarded to students who have taken appropriate courses (determined equivalent to courses offered at the College) in high school and achieve a score of 3 or more on the Advanced Placement Examination. The Advanced Placement Examinations are offered by the College Entrance Examination Board. International Baccalaureate Cr edit- Credit will be awarded to students who have taken appropriate courses (determined equivalent to courses offered at a Technical College) in high school and achieve a score of 3 or more on the International Baccalaureate Examination. The IB Examinations are offered by the Internationa l Baccalaureate Examination Board Residence Requirements for Degree/Diploma Ogeechee Technical College requires that a minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) of the coursework of a particular program of study be completed at the College in order to be granted an award. Changing Program of Study If students change their progra m of study at Ogeechee Tech, any courses common to the original program of study and the new program of study are transferable, providing that the student received a minimum score of C for the course. Transient Courses A transient student is a student who is currently enrolled at one postsecondary institution seeking to take classes at another postsecondary institution. At Ogeechee Tech, students must obtain permission from their program advisor before applying as a transient student to other postsecondary institutions through www.gvtc.org. Grading procedures for transient students are the same as for traditional students. Therefore, the transient student's grade will be sent from the host school to Ogeechee Tech (home school) for recording of the grade upon completion of the course. The grade becomes a part of the student's permanent record. The grade will be recorded as a transfer credit. 20 CAMPUS SAFETY/POLICE EMERGENCY CONTACT INFORMATION All emergencies should be reported to the receptionist at 912.681.5664 or 5664 for internal calls on the main campus.

Satisfactory Academ ic Progress (SAP) To be eligible to receive St udent Financial Aid (SFA) funds (PELL, FSEOG, FWS, Federal Direct Loans, HOPE); students must maintain satisfactory academic progress. Ogeechee Technical College (OTC) is required by the U.S. Department of Education to establish minimum standards of satisfactory academic progress. Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) means the student is proceeding in a positive manner toward fulfilling educational requirements. Students attending OTC must be in good academic standing and making satisfactory progress. OTC uses the following standards to monitor students' progress toward their diploma, degree, or certificate: Grade Point Average Students must maintain a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.0 to remain in good standing. A student's GPA will be mon itored at the end of each semester. A student whose cumulative GPA falls below a 2.0 is placed on financial aid warning for the next semester of attendance. This will allow the student one semester to increase the cumulative GPA to the satisfactory level. If, after one semester, the GPA remains below 2.0, the student will lose financial aid eligibi lity (placed on financial aid suspension). Students may receive financial aid while on warning. Students will not receive financial aid while on suspension . 28 Maximum Time Frame There are a maximum number of hours that students may attempt in pursuing their program of study. All students must complete their educational objective within a maximum time frame of one and one half (150 percent) times the length of the program in which they are enrolled. This means that once a student has attempted one and one half times the minimum number of credit hours necessary for completing program requirements, the student is ineligible to receive financial aid. Completion Rate In order for students to graduate within this maximum \"time frame\" of hours, at the end of each semester they are expected to have cumulatively completed at least 66.6% of their credit hours attempted. A student who at the end of any semester has not successfu lly completed 66.6% of the cumulative hours attempted will be placed on financial aid warning for the next semester of attendance. This will allow the student one semester to increase the cumulative completion rate to the satisfactory level. If, after one semester, the cumulative completion rate remains below 66.6%, the student will lose financial aid eligibility (placed on financial aid suspension). Students may receive financial aid while on warning. Students will not receive financial aid while on suspension. Grades The following grades are calculated in the completion rate but do not count toward successful completion: I, W, WP, F, or WF. Repeat courses w ill be considered as any other class and both grades will be counted in both the GPA and completion rate. A grade of A*, B*, or C* will be considered satisfactory comp letion of a learning support course. A grade of D* an d F* will be considered unsatisfactory. Grades received for learning support courses are not calculated in the GPA, but the hours are calculated in the 66.6% cumulative completion rate. Transfer Students Transfer students accepted by Ogeechee Technical College (OTC) but not previously enrolled at OTC will be classified as maintaining Satisfactory Academic Progress for the first semester enrolled. Only classes transferred in will be used in the completion rate calculation. At the end of the first semester, the student's grades will be measured in accordance with the College's Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements. Students who previously attended OTC, transferred to another school, and then returned to OTC, will have all OTC courses and courses transferred from other institutions calculated in the cumulative completion rate. Warning/Suspension If a student fails to meet the cumulative GPA, cumulative completion rate, or the maximum time frame standards at the end of a semester, the student will be placed on Financial Aid Warning. The student will continue to receive financial aid while on financial aid warning. However, if the student does not meet the Satisfactory Academic Progress standards by the end of the warning period, he/she will be placed on Financial Aid Suspension. The student can continue taking courses while on financial aid suspension at the student's expense. Appeal of Financial Aid Suspension Students have the right to appeal their suspension of financial aid if they have mitigating circumstances that prevented them from making satisfactory academic progress. A student wishing to appeal financial aid suspension must do so in writing with supportive documentation and is only allowed three appeals. The form may be obtained from the Financial Aid Office or the financial aid website. The SAP Appeal form must be submitted at the Financial Aid Appeals Briefing. Dates and times of all Financial Aid Appeal Briefing are posted in the Financial Aid Office and on the Ogeechee Technical College (OTC) website. The SAP Appeals Reviewer will review the appeals. The SA P Appeals Reviewer will notify the student of the decision. The Reviewer's decision is final. Appeal Outcomes Students will receive one of three decisions when they appeal: 1.

Outstanding students attending Georgia's technical colleges and divisions are recognized for academic excellence and personal achievement. The first phase of GOAL takes place at the college level. College instructors identify their most promising students and nominate them for GOAL based on academic achievement and personal leadership. As nominees move through an interview and screening process, the college's top student is selected to represent their college and community. Then, all college GOAL winners compete at the regional level. Each regional competition will select three students (there are three regions), so nine semi-finalists will compete at the state level in Atlanta. The state level competition involves another round of interviews as the nine semi-finalists receive individual consideration from a panel of judges. From this outstanding group of students, the judges will select one student, the state GOAL winner, to serve as an ambassador for technical education in Georgia. Ogeechee Technical College's 2014 GOAL winner won the prestigious title of 2014 state GOAL winner. Along with this title the student won many awards including a brand new Chevrolet vehicle. The state GOAL winner is an ambassador for the Technical College System of Georgia promoting the system throughout the state. 39 POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Student Conduct (Student Rights and Responsibilities) I. Policy Academic institutions exist for the transmission of knowledge, the pursuit of truth, the development of students, and the well-being of society. Free inquiry and free expression are indispensable to the attainment of these goals. As members of this academic community, students are encouraged to develop the capacity for critical judgment and to engage in a sustained and independent search for knowledge. Freedom to teach and freedom to learn are inseparable facets of academic conditions in the classroom, on the campus, other college sites, and in the community. Students are expected to exercise their freedom with responsibility. As members of the academic comm unity, students are subject to the obligations which accrue to them by virtue of this membership. As members of the larger community of which the college is a part, students are entitled to all rights and protection accorded them by the laws of the community. Nothing in the Code of Conduct shall be interpreted to interfere with any person's right to free speech as provided by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America. By the same token, students are also subject to all laws, the enforcement of which is the responsibility of duly constituted authorities. When students violate laws, they may incur penalties prescribed by legal authorities. In such instances, college discipline will be initiated if the presence of the student on campus is considered a possible threat to persons or property, or if that person's presence may disrupt the educational process of the college. However, when a student's violation of the law also adversely affects the college's recognized educationa l objectives, or violates the college's Student Code of Conduct, the college will enforce its own regulations. When students violate college regulations, they are subject to disciplinary action by the college whether or not their conduct violates the law. It is the policy of the Technical College System of Georgia (TCSG) and Ogeechee Technical College to provide technical and adult education programs for the people of Georgia. TCSG's technical colleges must provide opportunities for intellectual, emotional, social, and physical growth. Ogeechee Technical College students assume an obligation to act in a manner compatible with the fulfillment of the mission. The technical college community recognizes its responsibility to provide an atmosphere conducive to growth. With these principles in mind, the Technical College System of Georgia establishes this Student Code of Conduct. Generally, technical college jurisdiction and discipline shall be limited to conduct which occurs on technical college premises, off-campus classes, activities or functions sponsored by the technical co llege, an examination or any other written or oral work submitted for evaluation and/or a grade, or which otherwise adve rsely affects members of the technical college community and/or the pursuit of the technical college's objectives.

No student may engage in the unlawful manufacture, possession, use or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol on the Technical College's property or as part of any of its sponsored activities. Such unlawful activity may be considered sufficient grounds for serious punitive action, including expulsion. Disciplinary sanctions for students convicted of a felony offense involving alcohol or the manufacture, distribution, sale, possession or use of marijuana, controlled substances or other illegal or dangerous drugs shall be immediate suspension and denial of further state and/or federal funds from the date of conviction. Sp ecifically in the case of a drug related offense the student shall minimally be suspended for the remainder of the quarter an d forfeit all acad emic credit for that period. The Technical College shall notify the appropriate state/federal funding agency w ithin 10 days after receiving notice of the conviction from th e student or otherwise after receiving the actual notice of co nviction. Within 30 days of notification of conviction, the Technical College shall with respect to any student so convicted: 1) Take additional appropriate action against such student up to and including expulsion as it deems necessary. 2) Provide such student with a description of any drug or alcohol counseling treatment, or rehabilitation or re-entry programs that are available for such purposes by a federal, state or local health, law enfo rcement or other appropriate agency. The Technical College is responsible for ensuring the development and implementation of a drug free awareness program to inform students of the following: 1) The dangers of drug and alcohol abuse on the campus and elsewhere. 2) Any available drug and alcohol counseling, rehabilitation and assistance programs. 3) Any penalties to be imposed upon students for drug and alcohol abuse violations occurring on the campus. 50 Each Technical College shall conduct a biennial review of its program to determine its effectiveness and implement changes to the program if they are needed and to ensure that the sanctions required by the program are consistently enforced. Each Technical College shall maintain and make available to the U. S. Secretary of Edu cation and to the public a copy of each item in the program as required by this policy and applicable law as well as results of the biennial review. Drug or Alcohol Reso urces for Students Ogeechee Technical College recognizes drug or alcohol dependency or abuse as a majo r health problem as well as a safety and security problem. A student in need of help in dealing with such a problem is encouraged to contact his or her personal physician and to use the Student Affairs referral system. A conscientious effort to seek help shall not, in itself, jeopardize any student's enrollment. Complaints Any student or employee with a complaint relating to the application of the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act may seek redress through any applicable Ogeechee Technical College complaint resolution policy and procedure or collective bargaining agreement.

A student must be registered for a minimum of 12 semester credit hours to be considered a full-time student. Approval from the Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs is required for a course load of more than 22 hours. Dropping/Adding Courses A student may add or drop courses during the Registration and Schedule change period. Tuition and fees for courses dropped after the first three da ys of each semester are not refundable. To add or drop a course, a student can either complete a Drop/Add Course(s) Form and have it filled out by the instructor of the course(s ) they wish to drop or e-mail the instructor(s) and have them drop them via BannerWeb. Students who add courses may owe additional tuition and fees. (See Fees and Expenses section) Courses dropped during this period will not appear on the student's official academic reco rd and will not be calculated in the course load for financ ial aid purposes. Students who drop a course may be due a refund. (See Tuition Refunds) Auditing Courses A student who wishes to audit a course and receive no credit may apply as a Special Student if not already enrolled as a Regular Student. Courses taken on an audit basis will not be used for certification for Financial Aid, Social Security, or Veterans Administration educational benefits. Auditors will receive a grade of \"AU\" in the course and will not have the grade computed in the semester or cumulative grade point average. A student regist ering as an auditor is Not allowed to receive credit for the course; however, a student will be permitted to re- register for the course for credit in a subsequent semester. Required to complete a Request to Audit form at the time of registration. Not permitted to change from audit to credit or from credit to audit after time of registration for the course.

Attendance Policy Attendance and punctuality ar e valued traits in any employee; therefore, students are expected to attend all classes and be on time for each class. The student is responsible for all material presented in class and for all announcements and assignments. For financial aid reasons, attendance of all students will be officially verified the first day of class. Students who have not been attending class may not receive financial aid or may be dropped from the class roll. Classes will begin and end at their scheduled time. Three tardies will be counted as one absence. A student may be dropped from the class roll when his/her absences exceed 10% of the total class hours for the course. Grading System Grades are issued at the end of each semester using the following grading system(s): For Credit: Grades Explanation Grade Points A Excellent (90-100) 4 B Good (80-89) 3 C Satisfactory (70-79) 2 D Poor (60-69) 1 F Failing (0-59) 0 WF Withdrew Failing 0 W Withdrew Not Computed WM Withdrew Military Not Computed WP Withdrew Passing Not Computed I Incomplete Not Computed AU Audit/Warranty Not Computed EX Credit by Exam Not Computed EXE Credit by Exemption (Exam) Not Computed EXP Credit by Exemption (Portfolio) Not Computed TRA Transfer Credit Not Computed TRB Transfer Credit Not Computed TRC Transfer Credit Not Computed TRM Transfer Credit (Military) Not Computed AC Articulated Credit Not Computed Learning Support (Institutional Credit): A * Excellent (90-100) Not Computed B * Good (80-89) Not Computed C * Satisfactory (70-79) Not Computed D * Poor (60-69) Not Computed F Failing (0-59) Not Computed I* Incomplete Not Computed \"WF\" Withdrew Failing - After mid-semester, the student was failing upon withdrawing or being dropped from the course. \"W\" Withdrew - The student withdrew or was dropped from the course on or before mid-semester. \"WM\" Withdrew Military - The student withdrew from school in response to being called to active military duty. \"WP\" Withdrew passing - After mid-semester, the student was passing upon withdrawing or being dropped from the course. \"I\" Incomplete - The grade \"I\" may be given to any student who has not completed all required work by the end of the semester. If the required make-up work is not completed by the last day of the following semester, the instructor will submit the Completion Form for Incomplete Grades with a grade of \"F\" for the course. When a student receives a grade of \"I\" in a course which is a prerequisite to other courses, the student must complete the required make-up work to determine the final grade and eligibility to enroll in subsequent courses. \"AU\" Audit/Warranty - Indicates that a course was audited. No credit is given. This is not computed into GPA. Exceptions to this policy include certain laboratory courses and supervised work experience. \"EXE\" Credit by Exemption (Exam) - Signifies that a student received credit by successfully completing a course exemption examination. \"EXP\" Credit by Exemption (Portfolio) - Signifies that a student received credit by prior learning or work experience. \"TRM\" Transfer Credit (Military) - Signifies that a student received transfer credit for military experience. \"TRA\", \"TRB\", and \"TRC\" Transfer Credit - The student transferred coursework to the College from another regionally or nationally accred ited college. A student may transfer up to 75% of the total credits required for the program of study. The Registrar may confer with academic deans or program instructors when determining appropriateness of transfer request but is responsible for final transfer credit approval. \"AC\" Articulated Credit - The student earned credit for coursework completed at the secondary level. Validation of Credit - Ogeechee Technical Co llege must validate student competencies before awarding articulated credit for competencies learned in high school by administering the final examination/exemption ex amination for the course to be articulated. Learning Support - A grade with an asterisk following is a learning support grade and is not computed in a student's GPA. Grade Point Average Grade point average (GPA) is the numerical average computed by dividing total quality points (for each course, hours attempted multiplied by grade value) by total hours attempted each semester (see below). A cumulative GPA is calculated by dividing total quality points by total hours attempted at the College. For example: 25 Total Quality Points divided by 11 Hours Attempted equals a GPA of 2.27. 62 Class Code Hours Attempted Grade Grade Value Quality Points MATH 1013 3 A 4 12 ENGL 1010 3 B 3 9 COMP 1000 3 F 0 0 EMPL 1000 2 C 2 4 11 25 Work Ethics All courses at Ogeechee Technical College will positively reinforce the work ethics traits through discussion, modeling of behavior, and other assignments; however, formal grading on work ethics will be done in program capstone courses only. The work ethics traits will be introduced in a designated entry level course in each program. The instructor for the course will introduce the traits in a method that suits the design of the course and program. Program instructors will continue to incorporate the work ethics traits informally throughout the program courses. The work ethics traits will be emphasized formally again in a designated capstone course for the program. Instruction containing program-sp ecific characteristics of the traits will be included for this course. A written student self- assessment and a written evaluation by the instructor of the student's behavior demonstrating adoption of the work ethics traits will be done before course completion and discussed with the student. A work ethics grade of Pass (2) or Fail (0) will be assigned in addition to the course grade for this capstone course and will appear on the student's transcript. Grade Reports Final grades are recorded by in structors. Official grades are posted to the student's transcript via BannerWeb. Academic Appeals Ogeechee Technical College faculty and administrative staff have the right and responsibility to exercise professional judgment in making decisions about student performance and progress. Th e College is accountable for setting and maintaining standards of academic performance and is committed to ensuring stud ents are treated fairly in regard to all matters that relate to academic performance and progress. A student will be provided with a fair opportunity to have decisions that are believed by the student to negatively impact academic performance and progress reviewed in accordance with policies and procedures established by the College. Informal If a student believes that a basis exists for appealing an academic decision regarding a grade which prevents progression in a program of study, that student should first attempt to resolve the matter informally through discussion with the instructor who made the decision. A student has five (5) working days to discuss the academic decision. If no resolution can be reached within these five (5) working days, then the student will have another five (5) working days to discuss the concern with the Dean for Academic Affairs. The expecta tion is that the difference of opinion is to be resolved as closely as possible to the level at which it originated, and as quickly as is possible with careful review. It is only when a disagreement cannot be resolved through this informal process that a formal appeal of the academic decision should be made. A student may seek advice from a counselor for support and direction. Formal Once a decision has been made that the informal process has not resulted in resolution, formal procedures will begin. Written notification to the Dean for Academic Affairs must be made regarding the decision under question. The Dean for Academic Affairs, upon completion of his/her review (course outline, documentation related to the student's progress, transcript, summary of events, etc.) may uphold, modify, or reverse the academic decision. The Dean for Academic Affairs will notify the student, the instructor, and the Registrar (if necessary) in writing of his/her decision with a rationale for the decision. If any party believes that the decision is not fair or reasonable, the decision may be appealed to the Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs. This gives the opportunity to ensure that all necessary and relevant information, documentation, opinion, and argument are fairly presented. The decisi on of the Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs is final. Repeating Courses By registering for a course for which the student has already received credit, a student forfeits the previous credit in that course for graduation purposes. The student's official grade for graduation purposes in the course(s) will be the last one earned on repetition. Although all grades remain on the official academic record, only the final attempt will be calculated for the purpose of meeting graduation requirements. For graduation purposes, a student must have a graduation GPA of a 2.0 and a cumulative GPA of 2.0. A student who fails or who does not earn a passing grade as required for courses specified in the OTC Catalog and Student Handbook within two attempts will not be allowed to repeat that course for one year and will be allowed to retake a third time on a space-available basis only. Before retaking a course the third time, the student must complete any remediation assigned by the appropriate Dean for Academic Affairs. A stud ent may request from the appropriate Dean an exemption to this requirement if the student feels that additional information should be considered. 63 Academic Probation and Suspension Students must maintain a minimum of a 2.0 cumulative grade point average to be in satisfactory academic standing. Students whose cumulative grad e point average falls below a 2.0 will be placed on academic probation for the next academic semester. A student is subject to suspension for one semester if the cumulative grade point average is less than a 2.0 during the semester enrolled on academic probation. Students will be advised and counseled as to academic deficiencies and give n official notification of academic probation/suspension status. Academic probation or suspension is indicated on the student's transcript via BannerWeb and recorded on the student's permanent academic record. Academic Transcript Request Process Students can receive an unofficial transcript via BannerWeb. The first official transcript for a student is provided free of charge. A fee of $5.00 will be charged for each additional official transc ript, which must be paid before the transcript is released. Transcripts will not be released externally without the student's written consent unless as directed by law to comply. (Transcripts will be released in compliance with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena. However, every reasonable attempt will be made to notify the student in advance of the compliance.) An academic transcript will be issued within three (3) business days of receiving a written request. The Academic Transcript Request form may be obtained in the Registrar's Office or on the Ogeechee Tech website using the BannerWeb electronic request/signature. If the student is unable to come to the Registrar's Office or download the form, Ogeechee Technical College will accept written consent in the form of a letter (either mailed or faxed) from the student. Enrollment Verification Students requiring verification for insurance, loan deferments, military I.D., past and current enrollment, and degree(s) earned can now access this information through the Self-Service program with the National Student Clearinghouse. Ogeechee Techni cal College has authorized the National Student Clearinghouse to provide enrollment verification certifications for students through its Web- based Student Self-Service program. Student Self-Service enables students to print official enrollment verification certifications on demand through their BannerWeb account at www.ogeecheetech.e du. Instructions are located in the Registrar's Office and online. Verification of enrollment status is based on the number of semester credit hours for which a student is or was enrolled. Full-time students carry 12 or more credit hours, three- quarter students carry nine to eleven credit hours, half-time students carry six to eight credit hours, and less than half- time students carry one to five credit hours. Withdrawing from a Course or the College Students withdrawing from courses or the College must complete an Application for Withdrawal form, which may be obtained from the Student Affairs Center, academic advisor, or the Counseling and Retention Coordinator. The effective date of the withdrawal is the last date the student attended or the last date of academic activity. The impact a withdrawal has on the student's academic record is determined on a course-by-course basis. In certain cases, the Counselor or Registrar may act on behalf of the student in completing the withdrawal process. Typically, this would occur in cases involving death, serious injury or illness, or formal requests to do so. Failure to attend classes does not constitute an official withdrawal. Students who fail to continue attending class and who do not complete an Application for Withdrawal form may be awarded a withdr awal-failing (WF) grade by the instructor. The instructor must still report the last date the student attended or the last date of academic activity to comply with the Federal Refund Policy. Students who withdraw from a course and have attended 60% or less of the course will receive a \"W\". Students who withdraw from a course and have attended more than 60% of the course will be issued a \"WF\" if the student was failing or a \"WP\" if the student was passing upon withdrawing or being dropped from the course. The 60% attendance date for each term is posted on the Campus Calendar located online at www.ogeecheetech.edu. If a student is called to active duty during a semester, he/she will be issued a WM, Withdrew Military. Ogeechee Technical College calculates earned Title IV federal fund amounts based on attendance. A student receiving Title IV federal fund s, such as loans and the Pell Grant, and withdraws prior to attending sixty percent (60%) of the semester, will only receive the earned amount. Since choosing to drop a course is a serious academic decision that may affect a student's progress towards a degree or a student's financial aid status, a student should consult with the in structor of the c ourse, the academic advisor, and a financial aid advisor before making this decision. Limited Withdrawals Students may withdraw from a maximum of three (3) courses at the College. If a student wants to withdraw from a course after he/she has accumulated three \"W\" grades, he/she may elect to receive a \"withdrawal-failing\" (WF) grade for the course or remain in the course. The grade of \"WF\" is calculated as an \"F\" for GPA purposes. Students are encouraged to verify the official number of withdrawals on their record as indicated in Banner prior to processing a withdrawal. Student s may not exercise the right to withdraw to avoid sanction for academic dishonesty. It is the responsibility of the student to complete the withdrawal process. A withdrawal is official when it is received and processed by the Registrar's Office. The following types of withdrawals do not count against the limit of three course withdrawal (\"W\") grades: 64 Exceptions Hardship withdrawals Medical or mental health withdrawals Military withdrawals Withdrawals during the first three days of the semester Withdrawals taken in semesters before Fall Semester 2013. Withdrawals taken at other institutions. Hardship Withdrawals Procedure A student who has an emergenc y that prevents him/her from completing all classes for that term may request a Hardship Withdrawal through the Withdr awal Exemption Committee. Students must contact the Counseling and Retention Coordinator to withdraw them from all of their current semester classes. Students are strongly encouraged to contact their instructors by phone and/or email to notify them of their intentions to withdraw. Students must provide hardship documentation to the Withdrawal Exception Committee, including a letter from the student explaining the circumstances along with supporting documentation such as the following: for a death in the immedi ate family, a verifiable obituary; for a serious illness in the immediate family, documentation recommending withdrawal from a physician on the physician's letterhead signed by the physician (documentation on a prescription pad is unacceptable); for a workpl ace change, documentation from the employer on the company's letterhead. The hardship withdrawal process cannot begin until both the students' written permission and the supporting documentation have been received and verified. In cases where the student is petitioning to change a regular withdrawal to a hardship withdrawal, the actual assigned grade (\"W\") will not change; if the petition is granted, that withdrawal will not count towards the Limited Withdrawal policy. Medical Withdrawal Procedure A student who has an injury or illness that prevents the completion of all classes for that term may request a Medical Withdrawal through the Withdr awal Exemption Committee. Students must contact the Counseling and Retention Coordinator to withdraw them from all of their current semester classes. Students are strongly encouraged to contact their instructors by phone and/or email to notify them of their intention to withdraw. Students must provide medical documentation recommending withdrawal from a physician on the physician's letterhead signed by the physician (documentation on a prescription pad is unacceptable). The Withdrawal Exception Committee will verify the authenticity of the physician's letterhead. Per Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) the Counseling and Retention Coordinator is not permitted to discuss a student's medical issues with instructors. (In some clinical programs, the student may subsequently be required to submit medical documentation to their program advisor or/and instructor prior to enrolling in future coursework as verification that the student is eligible to return to class.) If the documentation proves to be untruthful, the College reserves the right not to grant the request or to revoke the withdrawal. In cases where the student is petitioning to change a regular withdrawal to a medical withdrawal, the actual assigned grade (\"W\") will not change; if the petition is granted, that withdrawal will not count towards the Limited Withdrawal procedure. Military Withdrawal Procedure A student who is called to active duty during a semester and cannot complete all courses for the semester may request a military withdrawal through the Withdrawal Exemption Committee. Students must contact the Counseling and Retention Coordinator to withdraw them from all of their current semester classes. Students are strongly encouraged to contact their instructors by phone and/or email to notify them of their intentions to withdraw. Students must provide the appropriate military documentation to the Withdrawal Exception Committee, including a letter from the student explaining the circumstances. The military withdrawal process cannot begin until both the student's written permission and the supporting documentation have been received and verified. In cases where the student is petitioning to change a regular withdrawal to a mil itary withdrawal, the actual assigned grade (\"W\") will not change; if the petition is granted, that withdrawal will not count towards the Limited Withdrawal policy. Reinstatement Procedure Students that are dropped from a course for non-payment or non-attendance may request to be reinstated into the course by following the steps outlined below. 1. Students must request to be reinstated with the instructor of the course that he/she was dropped from. 2. If the instructor approves, the instructor will request reinstatement on behalf of the student to their respective Dean for Academic Affairs. 3. If the Dean for Academic Affairs approves, an email or memo will be sent to the Registrar's Office to acknowledge the approval fo r reinstatement into the specified course. 65 4. Once the student has been reinstated, the Registrar's Office notifies the instructor and student via email. Students are limited to one reinstatement per course each semester. Students may drop and add courses during the first three days of each term w ithout having to request a reinstatement. If a student is dropped for non-payment after the beginning of a term, he/she will have to pay tuition and fees in full at the time of reinstatement.
