A strong immune system helps to combat the invasion of foreign particles and consequently resists the diseases. Vaccination is such a context becomes imperative as it strengthens an individual's immunity. In vaccination, antigens or germs are given in very small doses. They stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to fight against that particular infection. Vaccinations are provided to both children to protect them from a number of diseases. However, different vaccinations are provided at different ages according to the susceptibility to diseases. Some of the vaccinations that are provided to newborns are: 1. Hepatitis B vaccine: This vaccination is given in order to prevent the child from having Hepatitis B. Hepatitis B is a liver disease that if persists can lead to liver failure or even liver cancer. This vaccine must be injected immediately after the birth of the baby. The first dose must be followed by administering a second dose within a span of a month or two. 2. Rotavirus Vaccine (RV): This vaccine, taken orally, prevents the infant from Rotavirus. This virus causes vomiting and diarrhoea in children that often leads to severe dehydration. This vaccine is administered within two to four months of the baby's birth. Sometimes, on a doctor's prescription, a second dose may be necessary for the sixth month. 3. Acellular Pertussis Vaccine and Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids: This is a combination of various vaccines that protects the child from tetanus and diphtheria. Newborns are extremely prone to diphtheria that causes fatal illness and sometimes even deaths in children. This vaccination thereby, is extremely important and must be administered within two or four months and must be followed up with secondary doses later under the doctor's supervision. Exposure of hepatitis A virus can cause severe liver infection, which is usually lighter and resolves by itself. There is a considerable difference in the symptoms and duration of the disease, in which many people do not see any signs. Two of the symptoms associated with hepatitis A infections are fever and joint. If you drink water or food which has become contaminated with the stools of someone with the virus, then you can catch the disease. You may also be infected, if you: 1. Eat fruits, vegetables, or other foods that were contaminated during handling 2. Eat chopped raw shellfish with water that has a virus 3. Swallow the contaminated snow If you have this infection, your liver may be swollen due to your virus. You do not always get symptoms, but when you do, you may have: Children generally have diseases with some symptoms. You can develop hepatitis A virus approximately 2 weeks before your symptoms appear and they appear during the first week, or even if you do not have any. If you are prone to the disease: How is it detected? Blood tests enable doctors to detect it. Is there a prolong effect? Usually, the virus does not cause any long term issues or complexities. But as per the CDC, 10% to 15% people with Hepatitis A will have symptoms that last for long periods or come back in the 6- to 9 month's period. In rare cases, some people may suffer liver damage or require transplantation. Is there a Hepatitis A Vaccine? Yes, Vaccination is suggested: What is the treatment? There is no treatment to cure this disease. Your doctor can take such tests to check your liver function to make sure that your body is recovering. Patients with preexisting liver disease should be vaccinated as occurrence of hepatitis A can lead to risk to life. The immune system is extremely important in an individual's system.

Here are a few reasons as to why vaccination is very important: Vaccines are not just for kids; the human body can be vulnerable to viruses during any time period of life. It is important for an adult to get vaccinated regularly, else there are always chances that some virus or infection may attack you in a severe way. Let's look at some of the vaccines adults should get for a healthy and ensured life:Pneumococcal Vaccine - This vaccine protects the human body from diseases like Pneumonia and Meningitis. Who should get this vaccine? How many vaccine shots should I get? PCV 13 and PPSV23 is prescribed to the elderly over the age of 60. PCV13 is to be taken at first and PPSV23 to be taken one year after the first shot. Hepatitis Vaccine - Strains of Hepatitis Viruses like A, B and C attack the Liver and can cause Liver failure in adults. There are vaccines to prevent the human body from Type A and Type B. However, there's no vaccine for hepatitis C yet. Who can get it? When to get it? Hepatitis vaccine can be taken during any time of the year. Vaccine options for Flu: Vaccine options for Typhoid: Vaccine options for Pneumococcal: Vaccine option for Hepatitis A: Vaccine for Hepatitis B: Human body is vulnerable throughout its life. Deadly viruses can attack our body anytime, and we must stay prepared and ahead of them. The vaccines mentioned above would help in avoiding some of the common but dangerous diseases. [Hepatitis C](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/hepatitis-c) is a [Viral Infection](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/viral-infection) That is Little Talked About, But Can Be As Dangerous As [Hepatitis B](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/hepatitis-b) Most people have head or what became in the 1980s and '90s the dreaded AIDS virus. With time and the availability of medicines, it ceased to be a killer. However, the knowledge of it helped stem its spread. Most people, unfortunately, don't realize that hepatitis C is also a killer, simply because not much has been said about it. In fact, it is also a virus, but is 10 times more [infectious](https://www.lybrate.com/lab-test/infectious-panel/health-feed) than [HIV](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/h-i-v). Hepatitis C is transmitted through the blood, and is usually passed on to women through infected needles and sex. At-home glucometers are often shared, or sometimes a woman's own lifestyle or her partner's lifestyle before marriage may put her at risk, because the virus can stay in the blood for years. It is also transmitted through blood products, like in the case of a transfusion, though in the case of pregnant women, this is not so common. The dangers The virus affects 1 in every 100 people in India, while globally 180 million are infected with it. Sometimes, it may just pass through the body, like many other viruses do, but sometimes, it can remain. If detected quickly, within six months or so, cure rates are high. the problem is that it is often not easy to detect, as symptoms resemble those of a regular seasonal viral infection: [fatigue](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/fatigue), [nausea](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/nausea), [loss of appetite](https://www.lybrate.com/treatment-of-loss-of-appetite). If it remains in the body, becoming chronic, then it may progress to [liver disease](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/liver-disease). But the hepatitis C virus ( [HCV](https://www.lybrate.com/lab-test/anti-hcv-detection/health-feed)) doesn't have to be a killer. You can conquer it with these moves. What you should do before A number of couples who come to me have planned pregnancies-they opt for a baby, rather than the baby just 'happening' to them. This not only helps [family planning](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/family-planning), but it also helps us rule out infections or treat them if present. Usually, in the first trimester, your gynecologist will ask you to do a simple blood test for HIV, hepatitis B and C. In the case of a planned [pregnancy](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/pregnancy), visit your doctor beforehand and ask if you need to take these tests before you conceive. However, there is no vaccine for HCV yet. What you should do after If a woman find out in the first trimester that she is hepatitis C positive, there's nothing much that can be done, as anti-viral medications cause [birth defects](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/birth-defects), so a mother can only be put on them after [delivery](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/delivery). She is advised to continue the pregnancy. A baby's chance of acquiring the infection in utero is between 5 and 7%. While this is not high, parents may like to avoid the risk. However, co-infection with HIV (if the mother is HIV positive) pushes the risk up to 19.4%. The pregnancy itself will not be hampered by the HCV infection. Nor does the risk of transmission to the child have anything to do with the mode of delivery-either vaginal or C-section. In India, there is little data on HCV transmission from mother to child. However, once the baby is born, the [pediatrician](https://www.lybrate.com/pediatrician) may not do an immediate test to check for the virus, as it generally clears out from the baby's system in a year or so. Testing may only be done at 18 months. In case you have a concern or query you can always [consult an expert](https://www.lybrate.com/gastroenterologist) & get answers to your questions!
