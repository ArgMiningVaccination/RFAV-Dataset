This study aimed to prove Moringa oleifera Lam. leaves extract's effect on reducing the eosinophil count and mast cells in asthmatic mice. Twenty BALB/c mice that met the inclusion criteria were divided into four groups of standard control (K1), negative control (K2), dexamethasone (K3), and M. oleifera leaves extract (K4). On days 0 and 7, intraperitoneal ovalbumin (OVA) was sensitized. On days 14, 16, and 18, mice were re-sensitized by inhalation using 1% OVA in sterile 0.9% NaCl. On days 18 to 25, K1 and K2 groups were given Na-CMC, the K3 group was given dexamethasone 1.3 \u00b5g/day, and the K4 group was given M. oleifera leaves extract 3.9 mg/day. On the 25 th day, the mice were terminated to analyze the eosinophil count and stable bronchiolar mast cells. In conclusion, M. oleifera leaves extract was proven to decrease the eosinophil count with a p-value <0.05 and could stabilize bronchiolar mast cells with a p-value <0.05.", "sitename": "Borneo Journal of Pharmacy -", "date": "2018-05-01", "cleaned_text": "Themes by Openjournaltheme.com Novelty OJS 3 Theme by openjournaltheme.com theme Quick jump to page content Main Navigation Main Content Sidebar Borneo Journal of Pharmacy Register Login Online ISSN : 2621-4814 Toggle navigation Home About About the Journal Abstracting and Indexing Publication Frequency Journal History Citedness in Scopus Citedness in Web of Science Article Statistics Journal Diversity Subscribers Sponsorship Journal Policy Aims and Scope Publication Ethics and Malpractice Statement Retraction, Withdrawal, and Correction (R-W-C) Policy Editorial Policies Peer-Review Policy Open Access Policy Licensing Policy Archiving Policy Plagiarism Policy Study Ethics and Ethical Clearance Policy Informed Consent Policy Conflict of Interest Policy People Editorial Board Acknowledgment for past Peer-Reviewers Publisher Contact Issue Current Archives Accepted Manuscripts Author Index Submit Article Submissions Author Guidelines Article Processing Charge Copyright Notice Privacy Statement Announcements Search "}
