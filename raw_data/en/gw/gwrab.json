Many experts recommend this to soothe arthritis pain. The National Health Service said, \"Acupuncture is often used to treat other musculoskeletal conditions (of the bones and muscles) and pain conditions including chronic pain, such as neck pain, joint pain, dental pain and postoperative pain.\" * Massage Massages have been shown to reduce joint pain and stiffness as well as a range of motions. But the Arthritis Foundation warns to listen to your body and perhaps avoid getting a massage when joints are especially tender and sensitive. * Weight loss Losing one pound removes four pounds of pressure on swollen, painful joints. You can maintain a healthy weight by combining a balanced diet with regular physical activity. * Tai Chi Another Chinese practice, this combines gentle flowing movements, deep breathing and meditation, and has been shown to not only reduce joint pain, but also improve range of motion and function. * Eat plenty of fish Certain types of fish are full of inflammation-fighting Omega-3 fatty acids, and for that reason, experts recommend you eat at least three to four ounces of fish twice a week. Fish, which falls under this category, include salmon, tuna, mackerel and herring. Follow [@htlifeandstyle](https://twitter.com/htlifeandstyle) for more "}
