Now what?Quite possibly, you have never even heardofthis disease before. In fact, most people are unfamiliar with Crohn's disease, and now youare coping with your diagnosis.You probably have lots of questions. Some of the most commonly asked questions are: What is Crohn's disease?Is there a cure for Crohn's disease, and whatis the outlook (prognosis)? How did I get it?Will I be able to work, travel, or exercise?Should I be on a special diet?What are my treatment options?Will I need surgery?How will Crohn's disease change my life,both now and in the future?The purpose of this brochure is to provide helpfulanswers to these questions, and to walk youthrough the key points about Crohn's diseaseand what you may expect in the future. You won'tbecome an expert overnight, but you'll learnmore as time goes on. The more informed youare, the better you can manage your diseaseand become an active member of your ownhealthcare team. 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 9 9 0 1 24 9 00 1 4 5 6 6 9 0 3 r 195006_WF1_BK_R1_Layout 1 5/25/10 7:00 PM Page 1What is Crohn's is named afterDr. Burrill who pub-lished a landmark paper withcolleagues Oppenheimer andGinzburg in 1932 that de-scribed what is known todayas Crohn's disease.Crohn's disease (CD) belongs to a group of con-ditions known as inflammatory bowel diseases(IBD). Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatorycondition of the gastrointestinal tract. Symptomsinclude diarrhea (sometimes bloody),as well ascrampy abdominal pain, nausea, fever, loss ofappetite, weight loss and fatigue, and, at times,rectal bleeding. When you have Crohn's disease,you will not have the same symptoms all of thetime. In fact, sometimes you may have no symp-tomsat all. When you have no symptoms, thisis called remission. When reading about inflammatory bowel dis-eases, you need to know that Crohn's disease isnot the same thing as ulcerative colitis, anothertype of IBD. The symptoms of these two illnessesare quite similar, but the areas affected in yourbody are different. Crohn's disease may affectany part of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, fromthe mouth to the anus, but ulcerative colitis islimited to the colon\u2014also called the large intes-tine. CD most commonly affects the end of thesmall bowel (the ileum) and the beginning ofthe colon. Crohn's disease can also affect theentire thickness of the bowel wall, while ulcera-tive colitis only involves the innermost lining ofthe colon. Finally, in Crohn's disease, the in-flammation the intestine can \"skip\"\u2014leaving2norma p havin freque thing condiChron can 5/25/10 7:00 PM Page 23 r ub- with and ay f con- ases atory ptoms ell as ss of imes, ease, f the symp- this dis- ase is other esses your ffect rom is is intes- f the of the lcera- ng of n- avingnormal areas in between patches of diseasedintestine. In ulcerative colitis this does not occur.In only 10 percent of cases are there overlappingfeatures of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn'sdisease, a condition called indeterminate colitis.Will it ever go away?No one knows exactly what causes Crohn's disease. Also, no one can predict how the dis-ease\u2014once it is diagnosed\u2014will affect a partic-ular person. Some people go for years withouthaving any symptoms, while others have morefrequent flare-ups, or attacks. However, onething is certain: Crohn's disease is a chroniccondition.Chronic conditions are ongoing situations. Theycan be controlled with treatment, but not cured.This means that the disease is a long-term condition. In fact, many medical illnesses suchas diabetes, high blood pressure, and heartdisease are successfully treated but not cured.Occasionally, people may develop severecom-plications that can be serious\u2014such as colorectalcancer\u2014but this occurs in a very small numberof people a/uniFB04icted with IBD. Studies show thatpeople with IBD usually have the same life ex-pectancy as people without IBD. It is importantto remember that most people who have Crohn'sdisease lead full, happy, and productive lives. 195006_WF1_BK_R1_Layout 1 5/25/10 7:00 PM Page 3passe small of our tine le conne The p exces (what also s and ex When are af As a r sympt Who Appro either That n the tw and Abo and On dia age occ CD and 10 p age Ma equWh bac oth the 4A brief introductionto the gastrointesti-nal (GI) tractMost of us aren't very familiarwith the GI tract, even thoughit occupies a lot of \"real estate\" in our bodies.Here's a quick overview:The GI tract (see gure1) actually starts at the mouth. It follows atwisting and turning course and ends, manyyards later, at the rectum. In between are anumber of organs that all play a part in process-ingand transporting food through the body.The rst is the esophagus, a narrow tube thatconnects the mouth to the stomach.

This is the section where mostof our nutrients are absorbed. The small intes-tine leads to the colon, or large intestine, whichconnects to the rectum.The principal function of the colon is to absorbexcess water and salts from waste material(what's left after food has been digested). Italso stores solid waste, converting it to stool,and excretes it through the anus. When inflammation occurs, the primary functionsare affected, including the absorption of water.As a result, diarrhea can be a very commonsymptom during flares of Crohn's disease.Who gets Crohn's disease?Approximately either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.That number is almost evenly split between the two conditions. Here are some quick factsand gures: About 30,000 new cases of Crohn's diseaseand ulcerative colitis are diagnosed each year.On average, people are more frequently diagnosed with Crohn's disease between theages of 15 and 25, although the disease canoccur at any age.CD can occur in people who are 70 or olderand in young children as well. An estimated10 percent of those affected are under theage of 18.Males and females appear to be affectedequally.While CD can affect those from any ethnicbackground, Caucasians develop it more thanother groups. It is especially prevalent amongthe Eastern European Jewish population. 5 n ti- liar ugh gure ny a cess- y. hat US CHASERSENEM 195006_WF1_BK_R1_Layout 1 7:00 PM Page 56Both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitisare diseases found mainly in developedcountries, more commonly in urban areasrather than rural ones, and more often innorthern climates than southern ones. How-ever, some of these disease patterns aregradually shifting. For example, the numberof cases of IBD is increasing in developingparts of the world, including China, India,and South America.The genetic connectionResearchers have discovered that Crohn's dis-ease tends to run in families. In fact, the risk for developing IBD is between 5.2 percent and22.5 percent for rst-degree relatives of an affected person. It is also dependent on whichfamily member has IBD, ethnicity, and the typeof IBD\u2014either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Your genes clearly play a role, althoughno specic pattern of inheritance has yet beenidentied. That means that right now there isno way to predict which, if any, family memberswill develop Crohn's disease.Wh Cro No o cau One th you ge anyon drank a stre don't What think mean in com The th ingto 1)Env2)Gen3)An imm It's lik genes 195006_WF1_BK_R1_Layout 1 5/25/10 7:00 PM Page itis as n How- e mber ng a, dis- sk and n hich e ough been e is mbers What causesCrohn's disease?No one knows the exactcause(s) of the disease.One thing is certain: Nothing that you did madeyou get Crohn's disease. You didn't catch it fromanyone. It wasn't something that you ate ordrank that brought the symptoms on. Leading a stressful lifestyle didn't cause it. So, above all,don't blame yourself!What are some of the likely causes? Most expertsthink there is a multifactorial explanation. Thismeans that it takes a number of factors workingin combination to bring about Crohn's disease.The three leading factors suspected of contribut-ingto it are:1)Environmental2)Genetic3)An inappropriate reaction by the body's immune systemIt's likely that a person inherits one or moregenes that make him or her susceptible toCrohn's disease. Then, something in the environ-menttriggers an abnormal immune response.(Scientists have not yet identied this environ-mental \"trigger\" or \"triggers.\") Whatever thetrigger the person's immune sys-tem to \"turn on\" and launch an attack in the GIsystem. That's when the inflammation begins.Unfortunately, the immune system doesn't\"turn off,\" so the inflammation continues, dam-aging the digestive organs and causing thesymptoms of Crohn's disease. 195006_WF1_BK_R1_Layout 1 5/25/10 7:00 PM Page 78Beyo In add some sympt with C the di eye mo join skin and bon kid live and All of festat occur peopl Crohn the bo cide w Type The sy Crohn of the types Cro colo Gas sto sma Ilei What are the signs and symptoms?As the intestinal lining becomes more inflamedand ulcerated, it loses its ability to absorb waterfrom the waste material that passes throughthe colon.That, in turn, leads to a progressive looseningof the stool\u2014in other words, diarrhea. Thedamaged intestinal lining may begin producingexcess mucus in the stool. Moreover, ulcerationin the lining can also cause bleeding, leading tobloodystool. Eventually, that blood loss maylead to a low red blood cell count, called anemia.Most people with Crohn's disease experienceurgent bowel movements as well as crampy abdominal pain. These symptoms vary fromperson to person and may change over time.Together, these may result in loss of appetiteand subsequent weight loss. These symptoms,along with anemia, can also lead to fatigue.Children with Crohn's disease may fail to develop or grow properly.Symptoms may range from mild to severe. Be-cause Crohn's is a chronic disease, patients willgo through periods in which the disease flaresup(is active) and causes symptoms. In betweenflares, people may experience no distress at all.These disease-free periods (known as \"remis-sion\") can span months or even years, althoughsymptoms typically do return at some point. Inflammation may also cause a stulato develop.A stula is a tunnel that leads from one loop ofintestine to another, or that connects the intes-tine to the bladder, vagina, or skin. Fistulas occurmost commonly around the anal area. If thiscomplication arises, you may notice drainage of mucus, pus, or stool from this opening.Other conditions that may occur in some patientsinclude strictures, narrowing of the intestines;ssures, tears in the lining of the anus; and abscesses. An abscess is a tender mass lledwith pus from an infection.195006_WF1_BK_R1_Layout 1 5/25/10 7:00 PM Page 89Beyond the intestineIn addition to having symptoms in the GI tract,some people also may experience a variety ofsymptoms in other parts of the body associatedwith Crohn's disease. Signs and symptoms ofthe disease may be evident in:eyes (redness, pain, and itchiness)mouth (sores)joints (swelling and pain)skin (tender known as extraintestinalmani-festations of Crohn's disease because theyoccur outside of the digestive system. In somepeople, these actually may be the rst signs ofCrohn's disease, appearing even years beforethe bowel symptoms. In others, they may coin-cide with a flare-up of intestinal symptoms.Types of Crohn's diseaseThe symptoms and potential complications ofCrohn's disease differ, depending on what partof the GI tract is affected.

This pattern is refers to Crohn'sdisease causing inflammatory changes in thelumen, or tube of the intestine. Approximately55 percent of patients with luminal Crohn'sdisease are symptom-free or in remission inany given year. Another 15 percent have lowactivity of disease, while about 30 percentexperience high activity. A patient who remains in remission for one year has an 80percent chance of staying in remission for an additional year, while those experiencingactive disease in the past year have a 70 percent chance of recurrent symptomatic flareduring the next year. Fistulizing Crohn's diseaseAnother is knownas disease. Fistulasareabnormal channels between two loops of in-testine, or between the intestine and anotherstructure (such as the vagina, bladder, orskin).

A physical examination is alsoperformed. Since a number of other conditions can producethe same symptoms as Crohn's disease, yourdoctor relies on various medical tests to ruleout other potential causes for your symptoms,such as infection.Tests may include:Stool tests:Used to rule out infection or to reveal blood.Blood tests:May detect the presence of inflammation, antibodies, or anemia.Colonoscopy and upper endoscopy:Used to look at the lining of your gastrointestinaltract with a scope or a tube with a cameraand a light at the end. Biopsies can be ob-tained through these scopes. There is also a special miniaturized camera that can beswallowed by the patient and specically195006_WF1_BK_R1_Layout 1 5/25/10 7:00 PM Page 1112used to evaluate the nine feet of small bowelthat is not accessed easily by the endoscopes.CT Scan(computerized tomography) or MRI(magnetic resonance imaging) proceduresmay be used to look at either the thicknessof the bowel wall and/or evaluate for stulasand collections of infected fluid in the abdomen known as abscesses.Computed tomographic(CT) colography(vir-tual colonoscopy) is a relatively new techniquefor imaging polyps. The use of this techniquein Crohn's disease is not supported by re-search and is controversial as of this writing.For further information about diagnosing Crohn'sdisease, please see our fact sheet, \"DiagnosingIBD,\" available at www.ccfa.org.Questions to askyour doctorIt is important to establishgood communications withyour doctor.Patients will need to establish a teamwork rela-tionship with all their healthcare providers, especially their gastroenterologist, for the bestlong-term results.It is common to forget to ask some critical ques-tionsduring your o/uniFB03ce visit. Here is a list ofquestions that may be helpful for your next visit:Could any condition other than my diseasebe causing my symptoms?What tests do I need to have to get to theroot of my symptoms?

If so, which ones?Should I change my diet or take nutritionalsupplements? If so, can you recommend a di-etitian or any specic nutritional supplements?195006_WF1_BK_R1_Layout 1 5/25/10 7:00 PM Page 1314Do I need to make any other lifestyle changes?When should I come back for a follow-up appointment?What are my options if I can't afford my medications?TreatmentThere are very e/uniFB00ective treat-mentsavailable that may con-trol your Crohn's disease andeven place it into remission.These treatments work by decreasing the abnormal inflammation in the GI system. Thispermits the system to heal. It also relieves the symptoms of diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and abdominal pain.The two basic goals of treatment are to achieveremission and, once that is accomplished, tomaintainremission. If remission cannot be established, then the next goal is to decreasethe severity of disease in order to improve thepatient's quality of life. Some of the same medications may be used to accomplish this,but they are given in different dosages and fordifferent lengths of time. There is no \"one size ts all\" treatment foreveryone with CD. The approach must be tailoredto the individual, because each person's diseaseis different. Medical treatment can bring about remission,which can last for months to years. But the dis-ease will flare up at times from the reappearanceof inflammation or from a particular trigger. Adisease flare may also be triggered from a com-plicationsuch as a ssure, stula, stricture, orabsce that a or Physic for the years most categAm tha Exa olsa not Adm eve of t The mil eas in p wor larl sma Cor the infl to k 195006_WF1_BK_R1_Layout 1 5/25/10 7:00 PM Page 1415 nges? p at- con- and n.

Physicians have been using some medicationsfor the treatment of Crohn's disease for manyyears. Others are recent breakthroughs. Themost commonly prescribed fall into ve basiccategories:Aminosalicylates:These include medicationsthat and drugs arenot specially approved by the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) for use in Crohn's. How-ever, they can work at the level of the liningof the GI tract to decrease inflammation.They are thought to be effective in treatingmild-to-moderate episodes of Crohn's dis-ease and useful as a maintenance treatmentin preventing relapses of the disease. Theywork best in the colon and are not particu-larly effective if the disease is limited to thesmall intestine.Corticosteroids:These medications affectthe body's ability to launch and maintain aninflammatory process. In addition, they workto keep the immune system in check. 195006_WF1_BK_R1_Layout 1 5/25/10 7:00 PM Page 1516Corticosteroids are used for people withmoderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. Theyare effective for short-term control of flareups;however, they are not recommended forlong-term or maintenance use because oftheir side effects. If you cannot come offsteroids without suffering a relapse of yoursymptoms, your doctor may need to addsome other medications to help manage yourdisease. With steroids it is very importantnot to stop abruptly.Immunomodulators:This class of medicationsmodulates or suppresses the immunesystem response so it cannot cause ongoinginflammation. generallyare used in people for whom aminosalicylatesand corticosteroids haven't been effective orhave been only partially effective. They maybe useful in reducing or eliminating the needfor corticosteroids. They also may be effec-tive in maintaining remission in people whohaven't responded to other medicationsgiven for this purpose. Immunomodulatorsmay take several months to begin working.Biologic therapies:Also known as anti-TNFagents, these represent the latest class oftherapy used for people suffering from mod-erate-to-severe Crohn's disease. Tumornecrosis factor (TNF) is a chemical producedby our bodies to cause inflammation. Anti-bodies are proteins produced to attach tothese chemicals and allow the body to destroythe chemical and reduce the inflammation.Antibiotics:Antibiotics may be used wheninfections\u2014such as abscesses\u2014occur inCrohn's disease. They can also be helpfulwith stulas around the anal canal and vagina.For further detailed information about treat-ment options, view our \"Understanding IBDMedications and Side Effects\" brochure atwww.ccfa.org.Ma symThe Cro med by y hea Howe rid of You m cramp Even w minim to be suppo ber, th can si Crohn feel q 195006_WF1_BK_R1_Layout 1 5/25/10 7:00 PM Page 1617 h ey eups; of f our d e your nt ations mune going rally ylates ve or may need ors ng.

However, medications may not immediately getrid of all the symptoms that you are experiencing.You may continue to have occasional diarrhea,cramping, nausea, and fever.Even when there are no side effects, or justminimal ones, it may still seem like a nuisanceto be on a steady regimen of medication. Seeksupport from your healthcare provider. Remem-ber, though, that taking maintenance medicationcan signicantly reduce the risk of flares inCrohn's disease.

These may include Lomotil\u00aeor loperamide (Imodium\u00ae) taken as needed to control diarrhea. Most anti-gas products anddigestive aids may also be safe to use, but youshould ask your doctor about these rst. To re-duce fever or ease joint pain, speak with yourhealthcare provider about taking acetamino-phen (Tylenol\u00ae) rather medications canhave adverse effects on the Crohn's disease itself or interact with some of the medicationsprescribed to treat your Crohn's disease. Thesafest way to handle over-the-counter medica-tions is to follow the guidelines and instructionsof your doctor and pharmacist.For further information about managing thesymptoms of Crohn's disease, please read ourbrochure, \"Managing IBDSymptoms.\"Other considerationsSurgeryMany individuals with Crohn's disease respondwell to medical treatment and never need to undergo surgery. However, between 66 and 75percent of people will require surgery at somepoint during their lives.Surgery may become necessary when medicaltherapies no longer control the disease well. Italso may be performed to repair a stula or s-sure. Another reason for surgery is the presenceof an intestinal obstruction from a stricture(narrowed segment of bowel), or another com-plication such as an abdominal abscess. Inmost cases, the diseased segment of boweland any associated abscess are removed.

It or s- sence e com- n el This is called a resection. Usually, the two ends ofhealthy bowel are then joined together in a pro-cedure called an anastomosis. While resectionand anastomosis may allow many symptom-free years, this surgery is not considered a cure for Crohn's disease because the diseasefrequently recurs at or near the site of repair.A stomaalso may be required when surgery isperformed for Crohn's disease. After surgeonsremove the segment of bowel, they re-route thesmall bowel to the skin so that waste productsmay be emptied into an external pouch at-tached to the abdomen. This procedure may beneeded if the rectum is diseased and requiresremoval. Without a rectum present, an anasta-mosis cannot be performed. In this situation,the stoma is permanent. A stoma may also beformed if the amount of infection or inflamma-tion is severe and immediate anastamosis isnot safe. Under these circumstances, the stomais usually temporary and may be closed in sev-eral months once the severe inflammation orinfection is controlled. The overall goal of surgery in Crohn's disease is to conserve bowel and return the individualto the best possible quality of life. However, unlike surgery for ulcerative colitis, surgery forCrohn's disease does not offer a cure.For more information on surgery in Crohn's disease, see CCFA's website at www.ccfa.org.Diet and NutritionYou may wonder if eating any particular foodscaused or contributed to your CD. The answer is \"no.\" However, once the disease has devel-oped, paying attention to your diet may helpyou reduce symptoms, replace lost nutrients,and promote healing.There is no single diet or eating plan that willwork for everyone with Crohn's disease. Dietaryrecommendations must be tailored specicallyfor you\u2014depending on what part of your intestine195006_WF1_BK_R1_Layout 1 5/25/10 7:00 PM Page 2122is affected and what symptoms you have. Crohn'sdisease varies from person to person and evenchanges within the same person over time.What worked for your friend may not work foryou, and even what worked for you last yearmay not work for you now. There may be times when modifying your dietcan be helpful, particularly during a flare. Somediets may be recommended at different timesby your physician, including:Low-salt diet- Used during corticosteroid therapy to reduce water retention.Low-ber diet- Used to avoid blockages inCrohn's patients with strictures and to avoidstimulating bowel movements in CD.Low-fat diet- Typically recommended during a flare in Crohn's when fat absorption may become an issue.Lactose-free diet- For those who have an intolerance to dairy products.High-calorie diet- For those who experienceweight loss or growth delay.Some in cer min B zinc, a enoug health these tional Keepi you to eat an foods to avo worse diseas the sy Red you Eat If yo of d lact to b Avo is a Res as c Bla tha Res foo ma if yo Maint mana is esse for Cro loss o 195006_WF1_BK_R1_Layout 1 5/25/10 7:00 PM Page 2223 rohn's even . for ar diet Some mes oid s in avoid uring may an ience Some patients with IBD may become decientin certain vitamins and minerals (including vita-min B-12, folic acid, vitamin C, iron, calcium,zinc, and magnesium) or have trouble ingestingenough food to meet their caloric needs. Yourhealthcare provider can identify and correctthese deciencies through vitamin and nutri-tional supplements. Keeping a food diary can be a big help. It allowsyou to see the connection between what youeat and the symptoms that may follow. If certainfoods are causing digestive problems, then tryto avoid them. Although no specic foodsworsen the underlying inflammation of Crohn'sdisease, certain ones may tend to aggravatethe symptoms. Here are some helpful tips:Reduce the amount of greasy or fried foods inyour diet, which may cause diarrhea and gas.Eat smaller meals at more frequent intervals.If you are lactose intolerant, limit the amountof dairy products in your diet. If you are notlactose intolerant, dairy products do not needto be limited.Avoid carbonated beverages if excessive gasis a problem.Restrict caffeine when severe diarrhea occurs,as caffeine can act as a laxative.Bland, soft foods may be easier to toleratethan spicy foods, although not always.Restricting your intake of certain high-berfoods such as nuts, seeds, and raw vegetablesmay decrease your symptoms, especially if you have a narrowed segment of bowel. Maintaining proper nutrition is important in themanagement of Crohn's disease. Good nutritionis essential in any chronic disease, but especiallyfor Crohn's. Abdominal pain and fever can causeloss of appetite and weight loss. Diarrhea and 195006_WF1_BK_R1_Layout 1 5/25/10 7:00 PM Page 2324rectal bleeding can rob the body of fluids, min-erals, and electrolytes. These are nutrients inthe body that must remain in proper balance forthe body to function properly. That doesn't mean that you must eat certainfoods or avoid others. Most doctors recommenda well-balanced diet to prevent nutritional de-ciency. A healthy diet should contain a varietyof foods from all food groups.

If you have Crohn's disease,you're bound to have questions about the rela-tionship between stress and emotional factorsand this disease. Although flares are sometimes associated withstressful events or periods, there is no proofthat stress causes Crohn's disease. It is muchmore likely that the emotional distress peoplesometimes feel is a reaction to the symptomsof the disease itself. Individuals should seekunderstanding and emotional support from theirfamilies and caregivers. As depression can beassociated with chronic illness, a doctor mayrecommend medication and/or a referral to amental health professional. Although formalpsychotherapy usually isn't necessary, somepeople are helped considerably by speakingwith a therapist who is knowledgeable about IBDor about chronic illness in general. In addition,CCFA offers local support groups to assist pa-tients and their families in coping with Crohn'sdisease and ulcerative colitis. Please review the list of other resources CCFAoffers in the \"Knowledge and Support arePower\" section at the end of this brochure. 195006_WF1_BK_R1_Layout 1 5/25/10 7:00 PM Page 2526General health maintenanceIt is important to continue general health main-tenance.

It isa very exciting time in the development of newtherapies. With many experimental treatmentsfor IBD in clinical trials, experts predict that a wave of new therapies for Crohn's disease is on the way. With an ever-increasing number of clinical trialsof potential new IBD therapies, there is an evengreater need for patient participation to see ifthese experimental therapies work. To locateclinical trials for Crohn's diseasetherapies inyour area, go to the CCFA web site atwww.ccfa.org/trials/ or call 888.MY.GUT.PAIN(888-694-8872).Genetic studies also are expected to yield im-portant insights that will drive the search for newtherapies. The hope is that new therapies maybe capable of reversing the damage caused byintestinal inflammation, and even prevent thedisease process from starting in the rst place. It is becoming increasingly clear that a person'simmune response to normal intestinal bacteriaplays an important role in CD and UC. A greatdeal of research is currently directed at under-standing the composition, behavior, and preciserole of intestinal bacteria in the symptoms of IBD.Hopefully this new knowledge will uncover newtreatments to control or prevent the disease. CCFA-sponsored research has led to huge stridesin the elds of immunology, the study of thebody's immune defense system; microbiology,the study of microscopic organisms with the 195006_WF1_BK_R1_Layout 1 5/25/10 7:00 PM Page 2930power to cause disease; and genetics.
