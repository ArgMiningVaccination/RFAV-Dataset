America's response has not been passive. During the past half decade, we have given the highest priority to eliminating this threat to the very fabric of our society. Our enforcement programs, undertaken with the cooperation of 60 other nations, are aimed at stamping out the drug trade at all levels, from the growing process to street sales. We are also rendering special Federal assistance to local law enforce- ment agencies. As a result, drug arrests are up, major traffickers have been jailed, and supplies have been reduced. But too many Americans still are victimized by drug abuse. We must redouble our efforts to cut supplies and punish suppliers. Wnd we must make a National commitment to rehabilitate former users. NOW, THEREFORE, I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week of October 20- 26, as Drug Abuse Prevention Week, 1974. An important focus of our effort should be on the community accept- ance of former drug abusers. For without a way back into society, the former addict still is prey to the pressures and pointlessness that con- tributed to his abuse in the first place. Let us begin, this week, to search out the techniques and resources we will need to help former drug abusers find their place in productive society-techniques and resources that will complement the work presently being carried out at the 1,240 Federally funded treatment centers and service points in more than 350 com- munities across the Nation. I call upon officials at every level of government, upon educators, medical professionals, and communicators, upon the business commu- FMEAL REGISTER, VOL 39, NO. 205-TUESDAY, OCTOBER 22, 1974 THE PRESIDENT nity and the civic groups of our Nation, upon the churches and clergy, and upon all who bear the special trusts of community leadership, to rededicate themselves during this week to the total banishment of drug abuse from American life. I again urge every American to commit himself wholeheartedly, be- ginning now, to this supremely important humanitarian cause. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-ninth.

Title 7-Agriculture CHAPTER I-AGRICULTURAL MARKETING SERVICE (STANDARDS, INSPECTIONS, MARKETING PRACTICES), DEPART- MENT OF AGRICULTURE SUBCHAPTER C-REGULATIONS AND STAND- ARDS UNDER THE AGRICULTURAL MARKET- ING ACT OF 1946 PART 52-PROCESSED FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, PROCESSED PRODUCTS THEREOF, AND CERTAIN OTHER PROC- ESSED FOOD PRODUCTS Basis for Charges The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 authorizes official inspection and certification of processed fruits and vegetables, processed products thereof, and certain other processed food prod- ucts.' Such inspection and certification Is voluntary and is made available upon request of financially interested parties and upon payment of a fee. The Act re- quires such fees to be reasonable and, as nearly as possible, to cover the cost of rendering the service. Statement o1 consideration leading to amendment of regulations. The rising costs of maintaining the inspection serv- ices has made it necessary to adjust in- spection fees. The rising costs are due to adjustments in the salaries of employees as authorized by the Congress and pay- ment of rent to General Services Admin- istration for space In Federal buildings aswell as other increases such as the in- creased cost of supplies, services and equipment. Accordingly, .\u00a7\u00a7 52.42 and 52.52- charges for inspection services on a con- tract basis-are being amended to re- cover increased costs.- Pursuant to the authority contained in the Agricultural Marketing Act of IAmong such other processed food prod- ucts are the following: Honey, molasses, ex-cept for stockfeed; nuts and nut products, except oil; sugar (cane, beet, and maple);srups (blended), except \u00a7\u00a7 52.42 and 52.52 (c) (1) and (2) and (d) (1), (3) and (4) are hereby revised to read as follows: \u00a7 52.42 Schedule of fees. Unless otherwise provided in a writ- ten agreement between the applicant and the Administrator, the fee for any inspection service performed under the regulations in this part, including analyses specified in \u00a7 52.47, shall be at the rate'of $14.80 per hour. \u00a7 52.52 Charges for inspection services on a contract basis: (C) * * * (1) For personnel assigned on a year- round basis: -Per ------------- 6. 10 (2) For personnel assigned on than a year-round basis:Per perbour.

In addition to the above charges, 8 hours will be charged for each person assigned each holiday whether or not work is performed. An additional 50 percent, not to exceed $6.35 per hour, will be charged for each hour worked up to 8 hours. The regular rate will be charged for all hours worked over 8 hours.(4) Night differentiaL A 10 percent differential, not to exceed $1.27 per hour, will be charged for all work performed between the hours of 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. Notice of proposed rulemaking, public procedure thereon, and the postpone- ment of the effective time of this action later than November 10, 1974 (5 U.S.C. 553), are impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the publlo interest in that (1) the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 provides that the fees charged shall be reasonable and, as nearly as possible, cover the cost of the service rendered, (2) the increases in fee rates set forth herein are necessary to more nearly cover such cost including, but not limited to, Federal employee salary adjustments, and (3) additional time is not required by users of the Inspection service to comply with this amendment.

FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 39, NO. 205-TUESDAY, OCTOBER 22, 197437476 RULES AND REGULATIONS - Notice-of proposed rule making with respect to a proposed handling regulation to be made effective under Marketing Agreement No. 125 and Order No. 966, both as amended (7 CFR Part 966), regu- lating the handling of tomatoes grown in the-production areA, 'vaspublished in the F7DxazAL REGISTER September 25, 1974 (39 FR 34418). This program is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agree- ment Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). Interested persons were afforded an opportunity to file written data, views, or arguments pertaining thereto not later than October 11, 1974. Comments were received from the South Florida Tomato and Vegetable Growers, Inc. and the Ruskin Vegetable Corporation, both of which supported the proposal primarily on the basis that extra small or 7 x 8 size tomatoes have never returned the cost of picking and packing to growers and thus should not be permitted to be shipped under the marketing order regulation. Findings. After consideration of all relevant matters presented, including the aforesaid proposal which was recom- mended by the Florida Tomato Commit- tee, established pursuant to said market- ing agreement and order, it is hereby found and determined that the handling regulation, as heremafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act. The recommendations of the c6mmit- tee reflect its appraisal of the composition of the 1974-75 crop of Florida tomatoes and the marketing prospects for this sea- son The requirements for containers, container net weights, and size classifi- cations are intended to standardize ship- ments in the interest of orderly market- ing and thereby improve net returns to producers. The requirements with respect to special pack and special purpose ship- ments are designed to meet the different requirements for such shipments. The minimum grade and size requirements would preclude sbipments to fresh mar- ket of tomatoes which usually 4re of neg- ligible economic value to producers. Exceptions are provided to certain of these requirements to recognize special situations in which such requirements would be inappropriate or unreasonable. The provisions for specal pack are de- signed to meet the different requirements for such shipments. Shipments may be made to certain special purpose outlets without regard to thd above requirements provided that safeguards are used to pre- vent such tomatoes from reaching unau- thorized outlets. Tomatoes for canning are so exempted because the act prohibits regulation of such tomatoes. Likewise shipments for relief or charity are ex- empt from all requirements; to do other- wise would serve no useful purpose.

Since this con- dition islikely to exist or develop in other engines of the same type design, an air- worthiness directive is being issued to require inspection of bearing oil passages on certain Teledyne Continental 6-285-B engines. Since a situation exists that requires immediate adoption of this regulation, It is found that notice and public procedure hereon are impracticable and good cause exists for making this amendment effec- tive in less than 30 days. In consideration of the foregoing and pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator (31 FR 13697), \u00a7 39.13of Part 39 of the Federal Aviation regulations is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: TmLESYnE CoiNTINETAL MoTORs. Applies to TCM Model 6-285-B engines with engine serial numbers 700000 through 700095 Compliance required within the next 25 hours time In service after the effective date of this AD unless already accomplished. Inspect the crankcase main bearing oil supply passages In accordance with pro- cedures outlined in Teledyne Continental Service Bulletin M74-21. After compliance tith this bulletin, if it is determined that an oil passage has been omitted the engine must be removed from service. This amendment becomes effective October 28, 1974.

On May 1,1974, in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-10766 [39 FR 17867, May 21, 1974], the Commission proposed to adopt Rule 15b5-1 and to amend Rule 15b6-1 and related Form BDW in order to preserve the registration status of a broker or dealer for one year after revo- cation, cancellation, or withdrawal for purposes of the SIPC Act only. The Com- mission has considered the comments and suggestions received in response to that proposal and now adopts Rule 15b5- 1 and amends Rule 15b6-1 and Form BDW as set forth below.. As noted previously, the provisions as adopted provide for a six-month exten- sion period for SIPC Act purposes rather than a twelve-month extension period as the Commission originally proposed. The language of. the rules has also been changed to make clear that the amend- ments will allow SIPC to protect cus- tomers witlh claims which arose while a broker or dealer was registered with the Commission who assert such claims after the broker's or dealer's registration has been terminated other than for purposes of the SIPC Act. PuaPosE OF RULE 15b5-1 m AmEN- zENTS TO RULE 15b6-1 AmD RELATED Section 3(a) of the SIPC Act estab- lishes as members of the Securities In- vestor Protection Corporation (\"SIPC\") all persons registered as brokers or deal- ers under Section 15 (b) of the Act and all members of a national securities 'ex- change with certain exceptions not hereRULES AND REGULATIONS relevant. Section 5 of the SIPC Act pro- vides that SIPC may Initiate a court proceeding to protect customers of \"members\" of SIPC. The Commission deems It advisable to provide a formal period during which registration for pur- poses of the SIPC Act would be main- tained after the broker or dealer has withdrawn or has been cancelled or re- voked, although for other purposes the entity would cease to be a broker or dealer.

The amendment con- cerns the situation where a State or local entity pays contributions for coverage of Its employees to the Internal Revenue Service Instead of to the Social Security Administration, to which agency they are due under a Federal-State agreement for coverage. As a result of the error, the State under present rules Is obliged when It ascertains the error, to pay the Social Security Administration interest on the contributions unless it pays within 30 days of finding out about the error. The amendment permits the State to pay the contributions It owes the Social Security Administration without interest, regard- less of the date of ascertainment of the FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 39, NO. 205-TUESDAY, OCTOBEt 22, 1974 RULES AND REGULATIONS reporting error, if It pays such contribu-tions plus any interest received from the Internal Revenue Service within 30 days of the date of refund of the contribu- tions by the Internal Revenue Service. Interested parties were given 30 days within which to submit data, views, or arguments. A total of five letters of comment were received in response to the notice. These were submitted by the State Social Se- curity Administrators of the States of Iowa, Maryland, Utah, Florida, and New York. Three of the letters (those from the States of Iowa, Maryland, and Nev York) were addressed to the overall ap- proach of making adjustments where contributions were erroneously paid to the Internal Re'enue Service and did not deal with the substance of the pro- posed regulations. The State Social Security Adminis- trator for the State of Utah proposed that the 30-day period for makinginter- est-free adjustments be extended to 90 days. The State alleged that 30 days would be insufficient. In light of the factthat the 30-day period is presently in effect for corrections resulting from er- rors discovered by the Social Security Administration as well as for correction of reporting errors ascertained by the State, 30 days would seem to be sufficient in most cases. Further, in situations in- volving this type of reporting error, the proposed regulation has the effect of waiving interest charges in many in- stances for periods of over a year. Fur- ther extension as suggested would add an additional 60 days. For these reasons the suggestion is not adopted. The State Retirement Director for the State of Florida proposed that once a determination is made that a govern- mental entity has submitted contribu- tions in error to the Internal Revenue Service instead of to Social Security Ad- ministration, a transfer covering the en- tire period of reporting should be made from Internal Revenue to the Social Se- curity Administration. The Social Se- curity Administration has, as a matter of policy, discouraged transfers of wages for periods that are not barred for cor- rection under the Internal Revenue Code. Once a transfer was effected, the Social Security Administration could not assure that a refund of contributions would not subsequently be requested from Internal Revenue Service and granted. If the con- tributions were refunded, such would re- sult in a loss to the social security trust funds since the State would not be as- sessed for contributions in a transfer situation. The second matter raised by the State of Florida in Its comments was one which is solely under the control of the State and not within the purview of the proposed regulation. Accordingly, the regulation as proposed Is hereby adopted and is set forth below. (Sees. 205, 218, and 1102, 53 Stat. 1368, as amended, 64 Stat. 514, as amended, 49 Stat. 647, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 405,418, and 1302.)

(b) Payment. The amount of each un- derpayment adjusted in accordance with this section shall be paid to the Federal Reserve Bank, or branch, thereof, serv- ing the district in which the State is lo- cated, without interest, at the time of reporting the adjustment; except that where any amounts due with respect to such an adjustment had been paid in er- ror to the Internal Revenue Service and a refund thereof timely requested from, or instituted by, the Internal Revenue Service, the amount of underpayment adjusted in accordance with this section, plus any interest paid by the Internal Revenue Service on the amount of such underpayment, shall be paid to the Fed- eral Reserve Bank, or branch thereof, serving the district in which the State is located, at the time of reporting the ad- justment or within 30 days after the date of issuance by the Internal Revenue Service of the refund of the erroneous payments, whichever is later. Except as provided in the preceding sentence of this paragraph, if an adjustment is reported on a form OAR-S1, pursuant to subpara- graph (1) of paragraph (a) of this sec- tion, or on a form OAR-S4, pursuant to subparagraph (2) of paragraph (a) of this section, but the amount thereof Is not paid when due, interest thereafter accrues.

In accordance with 39 CPR 111.3 no- tice of these changes is hereby published in the FEDERAL REGISTER as an amend- ment to that section and the text of the changes is filed with the Director, Office of the Federal Register. Subscribers to the Manual will receive these amend- ments automatically from the Govern- ment Printing Offic8. (For other avail- ability of Chapter I of the Postal Service Manual, see 39 CFr 111.2). Description of these amendments to Chapter I of the Postal Service MAnual follows: - PART 121-PACKAGING 1. Section 121.324 is amended to pro- vide size and weight limits for letter- style envelopes, to specify material re- quirements for envelopes which exceed these limits, and to expand on the limi- tation for enclosure of odd-shaped items. Section 121.52 is amended to provide that publications and stationery exceeding one inch in depth or one pound in. weight should not be accepted in letter-style envelopes. PART 132-SECOND CLASS 2. Section 132.12 is amended to update rates in conformance with step 3 of the phasing requirements of the law. Notice of these increased rates, which previously b6came effective, appeared in the FEDERAL REGISTER on June 25, 1974 (39 FR 22987), July 8,1974 (39 28621). PART 134-THIRD CLASS 3. Section 134.12 is amended to update rates in conformance with step 3 of the phasing requirements of the law. For ef- fective date of these increased rates, see FEDERAl' REGISTER notices listed in para- graph 2 above. 4. The Postal Service published a notice of proposed rulemaking on August 13, 1974 (39 FR 28995) proposing to amend \u00a7 134.82 of the Postal Service Manual to require that the -ords \"IThird Class\" be placed on the address side of each piece mailed at the single piece third-class rate of postage. Comments were solicited from interested persons at any time before September 11. 1974. No written objections to the proposal were received prior to the end of the com- ment periodl Although received after ex- piration of the comment period, we con- sidered the objections of one mailer who claimed that the requirement to endorse Third Class on the address side of the envelope would impose an undue burden on the promotional mailing capabilitiesof any firm mailing large quantities of third class matter, especially where a very small percentage of its mall moved at the single piece rate. Accordingly, the mailer requested that the requirement to mark Third Class on single piece third- class matter be removed entirely. We must reject this objection. At the present time single piece third-class mail weigh- ing 2 ounces or less bears the same post- age as a I ounce first-class letter. With- out an indication on the address side that such a piece is third-class matter It may- very well be given first-class handling. Furthermore, we think any fair read- ing of \u00a7 134.82 of the regulations, prior to this change, would indicate that the endorsement was supposed to be placed on the address side. The word \"prefer- ably\" was not intbnded to indicate that the back side of the envelope was a per- missible place for the endorsement, but rather to indicate that the preferred place on the address side for the endorse- ment was below the postage and above the name of the addressee. Mbreading of the regulation by some mailers and the consequent placing of the endorsement on the back side, where It would not normally be seen by mail handlers. is what made this specific change In the -regulation necessary. Accordingly, the proposed regulation is hereby adopted without change. 'PART 139-- 1IXED CLASSES 5. Section 139.S12 Is quire iayment of postaae on third-class enclosures at the appropriate third-class rate, whether bulk dr single piece rate. 6.

Sections 141.121, 141.124, 141.13, and 141.21 are amended to reflect the Mlarch 2, 1974 (39 FR 1125) increased postage rates on plain stamped envelopes, postal cards. aerogrammes and printed stamped envelopes.

PART 143-PRECANCELED STAM, PS 9. Sections 143.11 and 143.284 are amended to make clear that postage duo stamps are not to be precanceled. 10.

There appears to be no controversy on these proposed changes in our rules.For this and the other reasons outlined in our Notice, we find the changes to be in the public interest. We are, therefore, amending the rules as proposed in our notice, with one minor exception. The wording in Paragraph (c) (3) of \u00a7 81.104 Is modified to eliminate an unintended substantive change that would have limited output power to a maximum of 50 watts.

On -October 5, 1968, guidelines werepubli-hed in the FEDERAL REGISTER (33FR 14964) by which routine additionswould be made 571.109and to Appendix A, \u00a7 571.110. Under theseguidelines the additions become effective 30 days from publication in the FEDERAL REGISTER, if no objections are received.If objections are receifed, rule makingprocedures for the issuance of motorvehicle safety standards (49 CFR Part 553) are followed. Accordingly, Appendix A of 49 CPR\u00a7 571.109 and Appendix A of 49 CFRand Contract Motor Carriers of Property On May 21, 1974, the Commission pub-lished in the FEDEAL REGISTER (39 FR 17868) a notice of proposed rulemakingfor reporting changes caused by changesin The Uniform System of Accounts andfor additional disclosure of afiliated re-lationships, changes in financial position,pension funds, and compensation. Com-ments received gave general support tothe proposal or offered constructive cri-ticism of some proposed schedule formatsand content. A significant number of comments per-taining to similar objections were re-ceived for only three proposed reportchanges: (a) Use of a combined report for gen-eral freight and household goods opera-tions, (b) Reporting dollar amounts roundedto thousands, and (c) Format of Schedule 9002-Officers,Directors, Employees, Service And Com-pensation-Carriers of Freight We. disagreed with those who con-tended the combined report would beconfusing and time-consuming to pre-pare. We believe a combined report isvery useful for those carriers engaged inboth type of operations, and feel that theInitial confusion will be overcome withexperience. We concur with the objections torounding dollar amounts to thousands37489 and accordingly have deleted this provi-sion. We also concur with many of theobjections to Schedule 9002 and accord-ingly have adopted an alternate Sched- ule 9002 proposed by the American Trucking Associations, Inc. As noted in the Notice, the effectivedate for Schedules 8700 A, B and C, con-ta ning disclosure of Federal income taxinformation, was pending the outcomeof Assn. of American Railroads v. UnitedStates, Civil Action No. 540-73 (D.D.C.).The outcome of this action precluded theCommission from requiring certain taxinformation contained in similar sched-ules for railroads. Consequently, we haveeliminated these schedules from the re-port. Order.

The hearing is called pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and the applicable rules of practice and procedure govern- ing the formulation of marketing agree- ments and marketing orders (7 CFR Part 900). The purpose of the hearing is to receive evidence with respect to the economic and marketing conditions which relate to the propiosed amendments, hereinafter set forth, and any appropriate modifications thereof, to the tentative marketing agree- ments and to the orders. The proposal to combine the Boston Regional and Connecticut marketing areas under one order raises the issue of whether the provisions set forth in the proposals relative to such order would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act, if they are applied to the com- bined marketing area as proposed, and,if not, what modifications of the pro- visions would be appropriate. Issues raised by the merger proposal include whether the declared policy of the Act would tend to be effectuated by: (a) Consolidation of the Boston Re- gional and Connecticut marketing areas or appropriate modification of the sep- arate orders; and (b) The adoption of any of the pro- posed provisions, or appropriate modi- fications thereof, for separate orders or a combined order, including a review of the appropriate pricing and pooling pro- visions of the orders whether separate or in combination. The issue of consoli- dation of the Boston Regional and Con- necticut marketing areas also raises the issue of the appropriate disposition ofthe producer-settlement funds, market- ing service funds, and administrative funds accumulated under the respective orders. The proposed amendments, set forth below, have not received the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture.

The quantity re- maining in the other class thereupon shall be decreased correspondingly at the pool distributing plant and shall be in- creased correspondingly at those other pool plants involved in the adjustment. (d) The quantities assigned under this section shall be limited to the excess of the recipts from a plant over the quant~i- ties of bulk fluid milk products moved to .that plant from the pool distributing plant. \u00a7 1001.57 Additional assignments to Class I milk and Class H milk. (a) At pool distributing plants, assign to Class I milk the quantity of bulk fluid products received from the handler's pool plants located in the nearby plant zone. (b) Assign to Class I milk the receipts from other handler's pool plants of bulk fluid milk products for which classifica- tion as Class II milk has not been re- quested by both handlers. (c) At pool distributing plants which have received bulk fluid milk products from pool plants located outside the nearby plant zone, assign toClass II milk a quantity of receipts from producers and from cooperative associations in their capacity as handlers under \u00a7 1001.9(d), to the extent of the remaining Class II milk or 6 percent of the Class I route dis- position at the plant, whichever is less. (d) Assign to Class I milk the reielpts of milk from producers and from coop- erative associations In -their capacity as handlers undei \u00a7 1001.9(d) not previous- lyassigned. (e) Assign to Class I milk the receipts from the handler's pool plants of bulkfluid milk products not assigned under paragraph (a) of this section. (f) At pool distributing plants, assign to Class I milk the receipts from plants located outside the New England States and beyond zone 40 of pool milk other than producer milk, if the fluid milk products received are not classified and priced under any Federal order.(g) Assign to Class I milk the receipts from other handlers' pool plants of bulk fluid milk products for which classifica- tion as Class 3I milk has been requested by both handlers. (h) At pool plants other than pool dis- tributing, plants, assign to Class I milk the receipts of bulk fluid milk products from regulated plants or handlers under other Federal orders, If such receipts are classified and priced under the other order as Class I milk or the equivalent thereof or in accordance with their as- signment under this order. (I) Assign to Class II milk any receipts -of fluid milk products not previously as- signed. MIUaru= PRIcES \u00a7 1001.60 Basic formula price. The \"basic formula price\" shall be the average price per hundredweight for manufacturing grade milk, f.o.b. plants in Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Department for the month, ad- justed to a 3.5 percent butterfat basis and rounded to the nearest cent. For such adjustment, the butterfat- differential (rounded to the nearest one-tenth cent) per one-tenth percent butterfat shall be 0.12 times the simple average of the wholesale selling prices (using the mid- point of any price range as one price) of Grade A (92-score) bulk butter per pound at Chicago, as reported by the Depart- ment for the month. For the purpose of computing the Class I price, the result- ing price shall be not less than $4.33. \u00a7 1001.61 Class prices. The class prices per hundredweight of milk containing 3.5 percent butterfat for the month, at plans located in zone 21, shall be computed as follows: (a) Class I price. The Class I price shall be the basic formula price for the second preceding month plus $2.58. (b) Class Ir price. Subject to the ad- justment set forth below for the applica- ble month, the Class II price shall be the basic formula price for the month. Month: Amount January +e0.03February 00 \u00a7 Zonc class prices and blended prices computed under, \u00a7\u00a7 1001.61 and 1001.65 shall be subject to zone differentials based upon the zone locations of plants. The zone location of any plant and the differentials applicable to each zone lo- cation shall be determined as specifled In this section. (a) Each plant which is located In the States of Connecticut. Massachusetts (except Berkshire County), or Rhode Is- land shall be in the \"nearby plant\" zone.Mb) The zone location of each plant which is outside the \"nearby plant\" zone shall be based upon its highway mileage distance to Boston, as determined by use of Mileage GuldeNo. 10, and supplements to and revisions thereof, Issued by House- hold Goods Carriers' Bureau, Agent, Washington. D.C. The mileages used shall be those shown between designated key points In the mileage charts, and between named points on the appropriate State road maps, as published In the mileage guide. In any instance in which the map does not clearly show the mileage be- tween points Qn a road, the mileage used shall be the mileage as determined by the highway authority for the State In which the road Is located. (c) The distance for each plant shall be the mileage between Boston and the named point nearest to the plant, as shown in the mileage charts. If that named point is not listed in the mileage charts, the distance for the plant shall be the lowest mileage distance between Boston and that named point, computed as follows: (1) Determine from the charts the mileage between Boston and each of- the three key points nearest to the named point which are nearer to Boston than the named point. (2) For each of these key points, add to the result in paragraph (c) (1) of this section the mileage between the key point and the named point, measured to the greatest possible extent over roads designated as paved, all-weather roads. (d) The zone differentials for each plant shall be those applicable to its zone location as shown in the following note. NTor-: Proponents of Proposal No. 1 did not propoce a common zone differentia table. Instead. they submitted two separate tables on behalf of the group. For convenience in Identifying the specific proponents of each zone differentlal table, the two tables and the proponeata of each are set forth sep- arately as Propoals Mor. 2 and 4. (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, for any named point located in NewEngland and New York State. determine the highway mileage distance between Boston and the named point by use of the appropriate State maps contained in Mfileage Guide No. 7, issued by Household Goods Carriers' Bureau, Agent, Wash- lngton, D.C. Such distance shall be the lowest highway mileage between Boston and the named point on the map, over roads designed thereon as paved, all- weather roads. In the event that the named point is not located on a through, paved, all-weather road, such other roads shall be used to reach a through, paved, all-weather road as will result in the lowest highway mileage to Boston, except that such other roads shall not be used for a distance of more than 15 miles If It is otherwise possible to connect with a through, paved, all-weather road. In any Instance in which the map does not clearly show the mileage between points on a road, the mileage used shall be-the mileage determined by the high- FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 39, NO. 205--TUESDAY, OCTOBER 22, 197437497 37498 way authority for the state in which the road is located. The mileage so deter- mined, or the mileage determined under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, whichever is less, shall be considered to be the lowest highway mileage dis- tance between Boston and the named point. \u00a7 1001.63 Determination of applicable zone locations for priciug purposes.

The purpose of the hearing is to re- ceive evidence with respect to the eco-nomic and marketing conditions whichrelate to the proposed amendments,hereinafter set forth, and any appro-priate modifications thereof, to the ten-tative marketing agreement and to theorder. Proposal No. 1 would limit the quantity of milk a distributing plant may receivefrom a supply plant to qualify as a poolplant. In turn, a supply plant's pool plantstatus could be affected if a distributingplant failed to qualify as a pool plant be-cause of excess receipts from the supplyplant. Accordingly, evidence will be re- ceived on any modification of the supplyplant pool qualification provisions that would be appropriate if Proposal No. 1is adopted.

The proposed regu- lations implement provisions of section 137 of Public Law. 92-03, Social Security Amendments of 1972, relating to issuance of social security, numbers (SSN) to all applicants for, and recipients of benefits under Federally funded programs. The proposed regulations would re- quire that the agency obtain the social security number of each applicant, veri- fY the correctness of that number with the SSA and iuclude it in the case record. If an applicant has not previously been issued a SSN, the agency is required to assist the individual in obtaining one and in so doing shall require that the applicant provide such evidence of age and identity as is necessary under SSA regulations. Upon redetermination of eligibility the agency shall assure that the case record contains for each recipi- ent a social security number that has been verified with SSA_ If any recipient has not previously obtained a social se- curity number, the agency- shall assist such recipient in obtaining -one in the same manner as for a new applicant. As- sistance to eligible individuals would not be- delayed pending issuance or verifica- tion of the social security number. Prior to the adoption of the proposed regulations, cQnsideration will be given to any written comments, suggestion, or objections thereto which are received in writing by the Administrator, Social and * Rehabilitation Service, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, P.O. Box 2366, Washington, D.C. 20013, on or be- fore November 21, 1974.

ROGER STSELOW, Doo.74-24495 CFR Part 52 ] [FMl 2834] NEVADA Amendments to Air Quality Implementation Plan On June 14, 1074, Mike O'Callaghan, Governor of Nevada, submitted to the Administrator amendments to the No-vada Air Quality Regulations, thereby proposing to amend the approved Imple- mentation Plan. The purpose of this FEDERAL REGISTER notice is to acknowl- edge receipt of the Nevada amendments and to solicit public comment on the amendments prior to the Administrator's approval or disapproval of each of th0amendments. The contents of the Me- vada amendments are outlined below together with comments on their approvability. The amendments to the Nevada Air Quality Regulations are described in the Governor's letter of June 14, 1974, as follows: The amendments to the Sulfur mls.\"lonRegulations (Article 8) more explicitly doflnethe authority for requiring the control offugitive sulfur emilsons., to be ued In con-junction with our now Supplementary Con-trol Systems (SCS) article (Article 14).The adopted revisions to the Visible EmU.sions article (Article 4) will enable contin-uous In-otac: monitoring for particulateofrom our existing copper smelter, in lieu ofout-stach visual monitoring. This actionelimates cl] the visible emission exemp-tion for copper smelters and should removethe causes of your diapproval,of the rourcosurveillance portion of the State Imploments.tion Plan. These amendmentg should alsosatisfy the requirements of the Clean AirAct for the attainment and maintenance ofthe national secondary ambient air stand-ards for sulfur oxides. Additional amendments to Artiele 9 wereadopted to relax the sulfur emission regula-tions for medium size electrical generatingplants. These relaxed standards would allowsmnaller facilities to burn a focoll fuel witha higher sulfur content, but because of theirremoteness and limited sizo will allow theState of Nevada to maintain Its relativelyclean air, well below the national amblenbair standards for sulfur oxides. The amendments to the Mobile Equipmenb,Regulations (Article 11) were minor admia.Istrative ohanges for uniformity. The approvability of the amendmentsto \"Article 4-Visible Emissions from F DERAL REGISTER, VOL 39, NO. 205-TUESDAY, OCTOBER 22, 197437506 PROPOSED RULES Stationary Sources\" and the new \"Arti- cle 14-Supplementary Control Systems (SCS)\"' is discussed in the following paragraphs. The amendments to \"Article 8-Sulphur Emission Regulation\" are presently being reviewed by EPA in terms of the requirements of Part 51 of this Chapter. Particularly, the revised allow- able sulphur emissions for \"Indirect HIeat Transfer Fuel Burning Equipment\" (eledtrical generating plants) are being reviewed for adequacy to attain and maintain National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Preliminary review of the revisions to\"Article 4-Visible Emissions from Sta- tionary Sources\" indicates that the revi- sions are approvable. These revisions re- quire that an in-stack electronic detector be installed and operated, at existing copper smelters, to monitor visible emis- sions. These revisions replace a current exemption for existing copper smelters from visible emission requirements and provide a means for determining com- pliance with'the visible emission require- ments. Regulations of this type are re- quired by Part 51 \u00a7 51.19i:Source Surveil- lance, of this Chapter, for- the purpose of \"monitoring the status of compliance 'with any rules and regulations\". Mni- mum criteria for such regulations are also established. Specifically, \u00a7 51.19 Cc) states that the implementation plan provide for \"establishment of a system for detecting- violations through the enforcement of appropriate visible emission limitations and for, investigating complaints\". On May 31,1972 (37 FR 10878), the Adminis- trator disapproved the portions of the Nevada Implementation Plan concerning -visible emissions for existing copper smelters since these smelters, were ex- empted from visible emission limitations. On July 27, 1972 (37 FR 15106), the Ad- ministrator proposed replacement reg- ulations which, basically, removed the exemption for existing copper smelters., If, after reviewing public comment on the Nevada amendments to Article 4, the evi- dence supports approving these amend- ments, the proposed replacement regu- lations will be withdrawn and the Imple- mentation Plan disapproval will be re- voked. Preliminary review of the new article, \"Article 14-Supplementary Control Sys- tems (SCS)\", indicates that the article cannot be approved. EPA provided ex- \"tensive comment on Article 14 to the Ne- vada Department, of Human Resources and the Nevada Environmental Commis- sion during preparation and adoption of this regulation. The main point of the EPA comment was that SCS could only be used as a temporary measure until such time as further constant emission con- trols become available for application to a source. The Nevada regulation permits SCS to be used on a permanent basis and has no provision for the application of additional positive controls as they be- come available. It was further stated that Phe regulations did not contain enforce- able emission limits. Also missing were specific SCS requirements and imple- mentation procedures.In the near future, the Administrator will propose SCS regulations to replace the Nevada regulations. The regulations will be published in the FEDERAL REGISTER as a \"Notice of Proposed Rulemaking\". If, after reviewing public comment on the Nevada Article 14, the Nevada reg- ulation is found approvable, the pro- posed replacement regulation would be rescinded. Conversely, if the Nevada regulations are unapprovable, EPA will proceed as expeditiously as possible to finalize the replacement regulations. Copies of the Nevada Plan and the proposed amendments to the plan are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the EPA.

[FR Doc.74-24490 Filed [Docket No. 20205: FCC 74-1097] NEW FM AND TELEVISION STATIONS Application Procedures In the matter of amendment of t\u00a7 1.227, Commission's rules with respect to limiting the period for filing competing applications for new FM and television stations and for filing petitions to deny, and the effect of certain amend- ments to applications for construction permits for standard, Ef, and television broadcast facilities. 1. Notice of proposed rulemaking is hereby given in the above-entitled mat- ter. 2. Section 1.571 of the Commission's rules regarding the processing of stand- ard broadcast applications provides (paragraph (c)) that:* 0 0 the Commission will perldically publish in the Federal Register a Public Notice listing appllcationr which are near the top of the processing line and announcing a date (not les than 30 days after publica- tion) on which the listed applications will be consIdered available and ready for proc- ez=ng and by which all appllcations * * I must be filed if they are to be grouped (for proce=inG) with any of the listed rpplica- tions. The purpose of this rule is to permit the Commlssion's staff, in processing appli- cations, to give simultaneous considera- tion to those ap,lications which involve interference conflicts, as well as applica- tions for the same facilities, where it ap- Pears that the applications must be des- ignated for hearing in a comparative pro- ceeding. No comparable provisions exist - in the rules governing applications for construction permits for new FM and television broadcast stations or for major changes in the ex;sting facilities of such stations. 'The \"cut-of\" rule for these ap- plications is \u00a7 1.591(b), which provides, in essence, that a competing application will not be considered unless it is filed by the close of business on the day preceding the day on which the Commlson takes action with respect to the application under consideration. The effect of this rule and \u00a7 1.580, which provides that no application for a construction permit for a new FM or television station or for a major change in the facilities of such existing stations may be acted upon by this Commission less than thirty (30) days following Issuance of public notice of the acceptance for filing of such ap- plications, is to keep pending applica- tions open to the possibility of being filed against by a competing applicant for an indefinite period of time, depending es- sentially upon the size of the backlog of pending applications in the particular Eervice. 3. The purpose of the public notice and cut-off provisions for AM applications was to alleviate processing problems caused by the \"ripple-effect\" of new AML allocations and increases in authorized power. However, the rule has incidental benefits which we believe should be ex- tended to applicants for new FM and television facilities. Whether rules should be adopted to set a cut-off date for filing applications for FM and television facili- ties mutually exclusive with applications already on file is the subject we address in this proceeding. 4. The effect of the A', processing rule, as set forth above, is to identify within a reasonably short space of time those applications which are mutually exclusive with each other. This is not only convenient for the staff, but it as- sures that an application will not be filed, remain on file for a substantial period of time, be processed and virtually ready for grant,% and then plunged into a lengthy comparative proceeding by a newly filed mutually exclusive applica- tion. In the other broadcast services; es- pecially M, It is not unheard of for a new application to be filed, mutually ex- clusive with another application already partially processed and healy ready for FEDERAL REGISTEP, VOL 39, NO. 205-TUESDAY, OCTOBER 22, 197437507 PROPOSED RULES grant, and one or more additional mu- tually exclusive applications to be fled when processing of the second applica- tion is nearly ncomplete but before the ,irst two applications can be designated for hearing. 5. In the case of so-called \"buy-out\" agreements, i.e., where one f the com- peting applicants agrees to withdraw his application In exchange for reimburse- ment of' expenses legitimately and pru- Aiently incurred In preparing and prose- cuting the application, we have stated that \"[al substantial and obvious detri- ment (to the public interest) which flows from the approval of such agreements Is that the public is deprived of a choice between applicants.\" WFIWY Television Corp., et al., 33 FCC -2d 857, 857-858, 23 RR 2d 1032 (1972), aff'd sub nom. Greensboro Television Company v. Fed- eral Communications Commission, Case To. 72-2017, slip opinion issued Au- gust 16, 1974. (D.C. Cir.). However, in the case of applicants for a construction per- mit for new facilities, i.e., not involving a renewal, \"that detriment Is more than offset by the consideration that the-with- drawal permits one of the several quaIl- fled applicants to bring a needed service to the public without the lengthly delay Involved in the multi-party comparative hearing.\" National Broadcasting Co., 45 FCC 693, 698, 25 RR 67 (1963). We would add that the public interest may also be served if a permit Is awarded to a grantee whose financial resources have not been drained by a costly hearing. S. We do zot, of couse, propose to eliminate comparative hearings. We do, however, believe that an applicant is entitled to notice withir a reasonable time whether grant of his application is likely to be significantly delayed by the -appearance of a late filing applicant. For the purposes of this proceeding, we pro- pose to amend the rules concerning the processing of applications for television and FM broadcast stations (Q\u00a7 1.572 and 1.573, respectively) to incorporate lan- guage identical to that now contained' in \u00a7 1.571(c). We expect, however, that in their comments the parties will address themselves to the proper period for filing mutually exclusive applications, and the triggering mechanism to set that period running. If adopted, we expect that these measures will not only-enure to the ben- eft of applicants, but will also contribute to the orderly processing of applications by the staff, in that they will permit the simultaneous processing of applications 'which ultimately must be considered simultaneously in a designation order. If adopted, only one situation will not be -subject to a specific cut-off: applica'ipns for new transmitter locations -which do not amount to \"major changes,\" but which are mutually exclusive because of the failure of the specified transmitter locations to meet the standard spacing Tequirements of \u00a7 73207, 73.504, appropriateosections of 1.572 and 1.591) provisions dealing vith 'mu- tual exclusivity by reason of less-than- standard spacing and the general re-quirement that where no specific cut-off applies, -an application, to be considered mriutually exclusive, must be filed by the Jclose of business on the day preceding Commission action on the application under consideration, and added compara- ,ble provisions for FTA facilities. 7. The rules we propose also change-the period for filing formal petitions to deny. Presently, \u00a7 1.580(i) requires that such petitions be filed within 30 days of acceptance of the application for filing. We propose that the zut-off for petitions_ to deny be the same as that for filing mutually exclusive applications. This change vE apply to major change appli- cations (as defined in \u00a7\u00a71.571(a)(1), 1.572(a) (1), and 1.573 (a) (1)), As well as to applications for new facilities. (In the case of a mutually exclusive applica- tion filed within the cut-off period, an -additional 30 days would be provided -from the filing of the later filed applica- tion In which petitions to deny could be filed.) This may result in some slight extension of time in which applications are subject to petitions to deny. However, wt would note that despite the current 30-day period from the day the applica- tion. Is filed, late-filed pleadings under .current practice are invariably treated as informal obJectionA and dealt with on the .rerits, if they raise zignificant questions .of law or Commission policy. Thus, we xlo not believe the extension will sig- nificantly affect the rights of applicants. The rule we propose will still enable the staff to give simultaneous consideration to the processing of the application and the legal issues involved, and -will more nlosely adhere to the Intention of Con- -gress in adopting the section 309 system nf pre-grant procedure (47 U.S.C. 309) that the period for filing petitions to deny approximate the period within which the application will be reached for proc- essing. In addressing\" the merits of this proposed change, we expect the com- ments will also suggst appropriate pe- riods -for opposition and reply pleadings. 8. Because we expect this amendment will extend the period for filing formal petitions to deny, we also propose in this proceeding to extend to applications for new facilities the provisions of \u00a7 1.580 (i) concerning extensions of time within which to file petitions to deny license re- newal applications. 9. A further proposal is to amend our rules governing the processing of tele- vision, TV and standard broadcast ap- .lications, to set some limits on the ability of applicants to amend the own- ,ership sections of their applications. Section 1.571(j) (2), which applies only to standard broadcast applications, now provides that: (2) A new le =uber 'will be asslgned to an application for a new station when it is amended to specify a change in ownership as a result of Which one or more parties With an ornership Interest in the original application do not have, on a collectivebass, ' 0 percent or more omwmezhp la- ferest In the amended application. We recognize that application of this' rule, or as we propose, a somewhat simi- lar rule, to television and FM applica-tions, will constitute a departure from previous Commission policy, as codified In \u00a7 1,522(a), which permits amendment of -an application In the television and FWA broadcast services at any time pri r to designation for hearing. Cf,, Belo Broad- casting Company, 44 FCC 2d 534 (1073); St. John's Broadcasting Co., FCC 74-2, adopted June 19, 1974. However, we can- not see any reason for applying differont staindards to the different cervices, and, on reflection, believe the policy behind \u00a7 1.571(J) (2) to be the sounder of the two. For instance, we do not believe that the right to amend should amount to a license to promote the subscription of shares In a corporate applicant, partic- ularly as we now propose to give a pro- tected position on the procesing line to applications which have been on file a certain length of time. W1hile We recog- nize that an applicant may legitimately have occasion to raise capital by the sale of stock or by bringing In new part- ners, we also believe the public should ultimately be able to look for service to the same Individuals who filed the sp- plication and a.soclated their nlnrce with the application In the publiishcd local notice. Significant changes in own- er&hip may be Indhcative of chmnges In the type and quality of service to be provided, and should, therefore, be ac- companied by an opportunity for per- sons in the affected community to react, either by filing competing applications or petitions to deny. Moreover, we be- lieve that we can Improve upon the lan- guage of \u00a7 1.571j) (2) In a manner which will both better conform to other relevant sections of the Commission's rules and better serve the policy ,tatd above. It is this language (set forth in the Appendix to this Notice) which TMe propose to add to \u00a7 1.571, 1.572, and 1.573. 20. As a further measure, both in the interests of uniformity among the broad- cast services and e:pcditlng the Proce, - ing of upplications, we propose to incor- porate In the FM/ and toleviion process- ing rules provisions now applicable only to AM applications, which result In the, assignment of a new file number to any application which is the subject of (in amendment which constitute a major -change, as defined in the relevant cc- tion of the rules. We hope this change will encourage applicants to \"put their best foot forward\" In the orIginal appli- cation, and discourage uso of the prc- .deslgnation period to upg-rade a propo:e-l or jockey for tactical advantaae In thlo forthcoming comparative hearing., 11.

The following outline regarding the amendment proposed herein is included for the reader's convenience and Is sub- ject to the full description in the pro- amble as well as the specific provksons in the regulation. I. Present situation. Service corpora- tions of Federal savings and loan asso- clations may apply to the Board to provide management services for a real estate investment trust. There are no published standards regarding decisions of the Board on applications of this type.37510 PROPOSED RZULES PROPOSED RULES IL Proposed statement of policy. The proposed statement of policy would setforth the standards for Board considera- tion of applications from service corporations to act as a real estate in- vestment trust management company. I. Reasons for change. To expand the opportunity for service corporations to enter into housing related activities and to clarify the Board's standards on applications of this type. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board considers it advisable to amend Part 556 of the Rules and Regulations for the Federal Savingi and Loan System (12 CPR Part 556), entitled \"Statements of Policy\", by the addition of a new \u00a7 556.7 relating to service corporation applica- tions to engage in the activity of serv- ing as a real estate investment trust (RElT) management company. Under the proposal the Board would set forth the standards under which it would consider applications from Fed- eral savings and loan association service corporations pursuant to J\u00a7 545.9-1(a) (4) (xii) and 545.9-1(b) (2) of the Rules and Regulations for the Federal Savings and Loan System to engage in the ac- tivity of serving as an REIT manage- ment company. Each application would be considered on its merits and in the event df ap- proval the Board would impose such con- ditions as it deemed appropriate to in- sure the safe and economical operation of the applicant association's service corporation.. Every approval, however, would be subject to five conditions. First. the REIT shares could not be sold at the offices of a savings and loan association. Second, the REIT could not adopt a name identifying it with a savings and loan association or a savings and loan association service corporation. Third, management of the REIT would have to be distinct from the management of a savings and loan association or other sav- ings and loan association service corpo- ration. Fourth, not more than 10% of an REIT management-company could be owned directly or indirectly by any one savings and loan association, and the REIT management company could be owned only by savings and loan associa- tions or their subsidiaries. Fifth, the BElT management company would be subject to examination by.the Board's Office of Examinations and Supervision on behalf of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation and the cost of any such examination would be paid by the REIT management company. Accordingly, the Board hereby pro- poses to amend Part 556 by adding a new \u00a7 556.7 to read as set forth below. nterested persons are invited to sub- mit written data, views, and arguments to the Office of the, Secretary, Federal Home Loan Bank Board, 320 First Street, NW., Washington, D.C. 20552, by No- vember 22, 1974. as to whether this pro- posal should be adopted, rejected, or modified.

[IF Doc.74-24504 Filed 10-21-74;8:45 Administration lIFRA Waiver Petition Docket No. sFC--74-61 NORFOLK AND WESTERN RAILWAY CO. Waiver -of Periodic Lubrication The Norfolk and Western Railway Company (N&W) has petitioned the Fed- eral Railroad Administration' (FRA) for permission to continue a test program In which some 13,000 low mileage open top hopper cars will be operated for a period not to exceed eight years without com- pliance with the periodic lubrication re- quired under present regulations. The present regulations (49 CFR 215.99) re- quire lubrication at three-year intervals. These cars, which are all equipped with roller bearing trucks, haveobeen the subject of a test program conducted jointly by the N&W and the Association of American Railroads. The test pro- gram, portions of which were instituted in the late 1960's, was designed to evalu- ate the proper time interval for the lubrication of low mileage freight cars. The cars which are involved in this pro- gram operate an average 'of 1,000 miles per month solely on the N&W track sys- tem. This system is equipped with a net- work of 125 hot box detectors. The cars are in trains that have a maximum speed of 35 miles per hour. Under the provi- 'sions of this program a progressively larger number of bearing is removed and inspected each year. The petitioner as- serts that, to date, no defects have been detected and no indication of unusual wear has been noted. Interested persons are invited to par- ticipate in this proceeding by submit- ting written data, views or comments. If requested, an opportunity for oral com- ment will be provided. All communica- tions should identify the Docket Number (FRA Waiver Petition Docket NumberNOTICES RSFC-74-6) and should be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel, Federal Railroad Ad- ministration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, D.C. 20590. Communica- tions received before November 25, 1974 will be considered by the Federal Rail- road Administration before final action is taken.

[FR Doc.74-24532 Filed 10-21-74;8:45 am] National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [Docket No. EX74-6; Notice 1] VINTAGE REPRODUCTIONS, INC. Petition for Temporary E6emption From Federal Motor Vehicle Safety. Standards Vintage Reproductions, Inc. of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has applied for temporary exemption for its 1900 Se- ries Horseless Carriages from certain safety standards on grounds of substan- tial economic hardship. Vintage has manufactured 199 ve- hicles between the inception of the com- pany in May 1972 and lay 1 1974. It in- tends to manufacture no more than 900 units before terminating production, and therefore does not intend to achieve con- formance with standards from which it is exempted. All exemptions requested are for the statutory maximum, 3 years. The petitioner produces replicas of the 1901 Ford Runabout and several differ- ent 1901 Olds passenger car and truck body types. The company requests ex- emption from every safety standard ap- plicable to passenger cars or trucks ex- cept Nos. 107, 112, 113, 118, 205, 206, 211, and 214. The basic reason behind the request is that mcst safety standards are not reasonable, practicable, or ap- propriate for the configuration of 1901- style vehicles. For example, controls, displays, and transmission sequence dif- fer. The open-air character of the vehi- cles eilminates conformance with door strength requirements need for defrosting and defogging sys- tems. The likelihood that it will be driven in inclement conditions is small. The vehicle does not have a hydraulic brake system, and the tires and rims are outside the dimensions specified in the Federal standards. Passengers car head- lamps destroy the scale of the vehicle, which is atted with tractor headlamps.The company feels that compliance with such passenger protection standards as 202, 208, 209, and 210 would destroy the character and hence the Gales appeal of the vehicle. In support of its petition the company believes that it is not likely that Its rep- lica vehicles will present a significant hazard to traffic safety. It believes the overall concept is such that the vehicles' appeal primarily is for occasional, limited use (e.g., auto shows, resort use) rather than extensive daily use on the public roads. While the exemption Is in effect, Vintage Reproductions will attempt to find a related product to produce in the recreational field. The company has 20 full-time employees and the effect of a denial would, it believes, cause a loss of over $60,000 in the year following such denial. The company had a net loss of $142.75 in the 12-month period ending April 30, 1974. This notice of receipt of a petition for a temporary exemption is published in accordance with the NHTSA regulations on this subject (49 CFR 555.7), and doe, not represent any agency decision or other exercise of Judgment concerning the merits of the petition. Interested persons are Invited to sub- mit comments on the petition of Vintage Reproductions, Inc. described above. Comments should refer to the docket number and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Room 5108, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, D.C. 2050.

The Administrator, after evaluating available information, has determined that coal preparation plants are an ad- ditional category of stationary sources which meets the above requirements. The basis for this determination is dis- cussed in the preamble to the regulation that is published elsewhere in this issue of the FEDERAL REGISTEr. Evaluation of other stationary source ctegories is in progress, and the list will be revised from time to time as the Administrator deems appropriate. Accordingly, notice is given that the Administrator, pursuant to sec- tion 111(b) (1) (A) of the Act and after consultation with appropriate advisory committees, experts, and Federal depart- ments and agencies in accordance with section 117(f) of the Act, effective (date of publication) amends the list of cate- gories of stationary sources to read as follows: S Affctcd facflft es Thermal dryers, pneumatic coal-cleaning equipment (air tables), coal prccesing and conveying equipment (including breaker and crushers), screening (cla-mifying) equipment, coal storage and coal transfer points, coal loading facilities. cation, in order to be considered with any domestic public radio services applica- tion appearing on the attached list, must be substantially complete and tendered for filing by whichever date Is earlier: (a) the close of business one business day preceding the day on which the Commis- sion takes action on the previously filed application; or (b) within 60 days after the date of the public notice listing the first prior filed application (with which subsequent applications are In conflict) as having been accepted for filing. An application which is subsequently amended by a major change will be con- sidered to be a newly filed application.

Memorandum Opinion and Order Modifying Issues I In re applications of Belo Broadcasting Corporation, WFAA-TV, Dallas, Texas for renewal of broadcast license; Docket Nos. 19744, Fies No. BRCT-33. WADECO, INC., Dallas, Texas, for con- struction permit for new television broadcast station; Docket No. 19745, File No. BPCT-4453. 1. This proceeding involves the mu- tually exclusive applications of Belo Broadcasting Corporation (Belo), for re- newal of its license to operate a VHF television station on Channel 8 in Dallas, Texas, and WADECO, Inc. (WADECO),for permission to construct a new station for that channel. Now before the Review Board is a fourth motion to enlarge is- sues, fled July 5,1974, by Bea. 2. Background. WADECO's original application proposed to meet construc-tion and first three months operating costs by relying in part on a $2,500,000 loan from the Castle Trust Company, Limited, Nassau, Bahamas. However, in its designation Order, 40 FCC 2d 1131, 27 RR 2d 889, released May 24,1973, the Commission specified an issue (No. 1(c)) to determine whether these funds wouldin fact be available; in June 1973, WADECO informed the Commission that it was no longer relying on Castle Trust to fulfill Its commitment. Subsequently, the Review Board added an Issue (now No. 1(d)) to determine whether WADECO had misrepresented Its deal- ings with Castle Trust, and also modified issue 1(c) to inquire as to whether WADECO would have available a $2,500,- 000 bank loan. Memorandum Opinion and Order, 42 FCC 2d 520, 28 R. 2d 325 (1973) ; Memorandum Opinion and Order 44 FCC 2d 703, 29 RR 2d 238 (1974). On February 22, 1974, WADECO sought to amend Its application to reflect its receipt of a new loan commitment for $3,000,000 from one Caruth C. Byrd, and in further amendments submitted on March 6 and 27, 1974, WADECO revealed that It had given subscription rights to 15% of Its stock to Byrd and had also granted him an option to purchase up to 51% of WADECO, subject to Commisson ap- proval, after the company had operated Channel 8 for at least three years. Ad- mini trative Law Judge John H. Conlin accepted these amendments by Memo- randum Opinion and Order, FCC 74M- 437, released April 18, 1974, and Memo- randum Opinion and Order, FCC 74M- 442, released April 19, 1974. By Order, FCC 74R-234, 47 FCC 2d 447, released June 25, 1974, the Review Board refused 139 FR 2031, Jan. 16,1974.1Also before the Board are the following related pleadings: (a) Opposition, filed July 18, 1974, by WADECO; (b) partial op- position, filed July 18, 1974, by the Broadcast Bureau; and (o) reply, filed July 30, 1974. by Belo.37535 to consider Belo's petitions for review of the Judge's actions. 3. The instant motion. Belo now pro- poses to \"Insure\" that the scope of the is- sues herein will be broad enough to per- mit an examination on the merits of WADECO's February 22, March 6, and March 27 amendments. Specifically, movant requests an Inquiry: To determine in the light of the sub- misslons incident to participation by Caruth C. Byrd In the application of WADECO, Inc., as shown by amend- nents to Its application permitted by Or- ders of April 18, 1974 (FCC 74M-437), and April 19, 1974 (FCC 74M-442) of the Presiding Judge, and in light of any ad- ditional evidence which may be intro- duced; (a) whether Caruth C. Byrd should be treated as the major principal of WADE- CO, Inc.; and, If so (b) whether Caruth C. Byrd is legally, financially and otherwise qualified to bethe major principal of a prospective broadcast licensee; (c) whether the applicant will have available a $3,000,000 loan from Caruth C. Byrd, and, if so, the effect of the terms and conditions of that loan on the appli- cants financial qualifications; (d) whether WADECO, Inc. made misrepresentations in its attempt to show diligence in seeking a substitute for Cas- tie Trust Company, Limited as a source of ftnancing; and (e) whether the applicant Is qualified to receive a grant of construction permit under finnncing arrangements which in- volve (1) trafficking and/or (2) initial station operation by an ownership com- mitted to relinquish control of WADECO, Inc. to Caruth C. Byrd should its appli- cation be granted. Belo first argues that Its motion Is timely since It could not have been filed, except in contingent form, until after the Board's June 25,1974, ruling. Then, turn- Ing to the merits and citing WLOXBroadcasting Co. v. FCC, 104 U.S. App. D.C. 194, 200 F. 2d 712 (1958), Radio Associates, Inc., 32 FCC 166, 21 RR 368 1902), and Louis Vander Plate, 15 FCC 2d 747, 14 RR 2d 1012 (1968), Belo con- tends that the information contained in WADECO's three amendments, \"without more,\" requires the addition of proposedIssue (a) above. Belo further claims that, since the name of Caruth Byrd first ap- peared n this proceeding on February 22, 1974. The Commission's conclusion in its designation Order that all of WADECO's stockholders weree qualified to be licensees does not extend to Byrd; hence, movantasserts, proposed issue (b) is \"clearly required\" if Byrd is shown to be \"a major principal\" of WADECO. Projiosed issue (c), Belo contimies, is an appropriate and necessary further modification of exist- ing Issue 1(c), while proposed issue (d) would complement existing issue l(d) by permitting inquiry into the abrogation of the Castle Trust loan commitment and WADECO's subsequent attempts to ob-tain financing. Finally, In support of proposed issue (e). Belo, citing the Com- nission's 1962 assignment and transfer FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 39, NO. 205-TUESDAY, OCTOBER 22, 1974 NOTICES rules and Integrated CommunicationsSystems, Inc., 14 FCC 2d 698, 14 RR 2d 372 (1968), asserts that the requirementthat Byrd not exercise his option for 3 years after the commencement of opera-tions is an \"obvious but ineffective sub-terfuge\" by WADECO to avoid a traffick- ing charge. Indeed, Belo declares, WADECO is essentially proposing an in-terim operation, to be followed by a permanent one (that of Byrd), \"thenature of which has not been disclosed.\" 4. WADECO, in its opposition, first, contends that Belo's motion is untimely. Substantively, WADECO and the Broad- cast Bureau agree that the cases cited byBelo in support of proposed issues (a)and (b) are inapplicable to the instant circumstances since they involved ques-tions of immediate de facto control whichare not present here. In addition, the Bureau criticizes the phrasing of pro- posed issue (a) as \"totally inappropri-ate.\" \"If Belo wants an unauthorized transfer of control issue,\" the Bureau states, \"let it seek such an issue... [blut we see no merit in trying to determine ifCaruth Byrd is the major principal of WADECO, Inc.' For its part, WADECOmaintains that it has provided all the information required by the Commission as to Byrd's background and the terms of its agreement with him and assertsthat Belo has shown nothing which sug- gests any need for further disclosure. TheBureau regards proposed issue (c) as un- necessary in light of the prior clarifying actions of the Review Board and thePresiding Judge; WADECO, however, does not oppose the addition of this issue \"if the Board feels it is necessary.\" Both WADECO and the Bureau urge denialof proposed issue (d), contending that Belo has failed to allege material facts supported by affidavit, as Section 1.229 (c) of the Commission's Rules requires. WADECO also asserts in this respect thatit has fully documented its efforts to ob- tain financing in previous submissions tothe Commission. Finally, both WADECO and the Bureau oppose the addition ofproposed issue (e), contending that Belo has not shown the WADECO-Byrd agree-ment to involve any kind of trafficking or relinquishment of control. Moreover, WADECO.states, a trafficking charge is absurd since its arrangement with Byrd,far from resulting in a profit, will in-flict upon its stockholders a \"serious loss.\" 5. In reply, Belo argues that It has complied with the rules of orderly pro- cedure and defends its choice of citationswith the comment that a \"reading of the cases by the Review Board will demon- strate their applicability and preceden-tial authority.\" Belo then claims that WADECO has not, in fact, submitted fullparticulars as to the terms of its agree-ment with Byrd, and further asserts that the facts shown in WADECO's threeamendments along with WADECO's \"necessary reliance\" upon an inference of de facto con- trol which warrants the fullest explora-tion under proposed issues (a) and (b).With reference to issue (c), Belo notesthat the Bureau also opposed as unneces-sary the Board's previous modification of the financial Issue against WADECO. As for issue (d), Belo declares, WADECO's prior participation in thisproceeding indicates its \"awareness of precisely what Belo [is] charging,\" sothat its objection to the issue, like thatof the Bureau, is at best \"hypertechni- cal.\" Nevertheless, in an attempt to more fully explain the alleged misrepresenta- tion, Belo attaches an excerpt from oneof its prior submissions. And on issue (e),Belo declares that neither WADECO northe Bureau has denied any of the facts contained in its motion, and avers that \"the only legal doctrine which needs to be invoked [in support of this issue] is thatof accord-Ing to Belo, WADECO's contention thatits arrangement with Byrd would result i a serious loss \"staggers credulity.\" Without Byrd, Belo insists, WADECO's stockholders would have lost every cent of their investment, but with Byrd theystill have a chance to obtain a 49 % inter- est in Channel 8. 6. Disposition. The Review Board willdeny all but one of Belo's requests for issues.' As an initial matter, we agree with the Broadcast Bureau that proposedissues (a) and (b) appear to assume the existence of, or at least to inquire intothe existence of, an unauthorized trans- fer of control. However, viewing the is-sues in this manner or as phrased, we find that there is no support for the con- clusion that Caruth C. Byrd is \"themajor principal\" of WADECO or thatthere has been any transfer of control tohim. On the contrary, WADECO's amendments indicate that, although Byrd may eventually obtain a majorityinterest in the company, he holds sub- scription rights at present to no morethan 15% of the WADECO stock, andthere is nothing to indicate that he will exercise a degree of control over the applicant disproportionate with this stock interest. Moreover, Byrd's optionagreement expressly provides that hemay acquire 51% of WADECO only after it has operated Channel 8 for three years,and only after the Commission has ap- proved the transfer. Unlike the cases cited by Belo in support of its proposed issues, the terms of the loan arrangementare clearly set forth and it has not beenshown that Byrd will be in a position toinfluence station operations. The cases cited are therefore inapposite, and Belo'srequest to add these issues must bedenied. Turning to proposed issue (c), we note that in our earlier Memorandum Opinion and Order, supra, 44 FCC 2d at 706, 29 RR. 2d at 242, we modified thefinancial issue herein for the stated pur- pose of including \"inquiry into any bankloan which WADECO may obtain.\" In light of the facts that WADECO is nowproposing a loan from an individual andin a larger amount, we will reword the issue to encompass an inquiry into Byrd'scommitment to WADECO. We will, how- 2 Though untimely, Belo has shown good cause and we have therefore treated Its re- quests on the merits.ever, deny Belo's fourth request since we 11gree with WADECO and the Bureauthat proposed issue (d) Is totally unsup-ported by a factual showing in the man-ner contemplated by Rule 1.220 (o). Bolo'sargument in reply that the Issue shouldbe added because WADECO understandswhat it is charging is of no merit. It isalso necessary that the Board be apprisedof what Is being charged so that it canmake a reasoned analysis on the merits.Here, with Belo's motion containingnothing more than a bald assertion thatan issue is \"appropriate and necessary\",such an analysis is utterly Impossible2 Additionally, Belo's attempt in reply tobuttress its motion with material from aprevious pleading comes too late. An ap-plicant is not permitted to cure an other- wise defective motion to enlarge issues Inits reply where the information containedtherein was readily available and couldhave been included in the original mo-tion. See Industrial Business Corpora-tion, 40 FCC 2d 69, 26 RR 2d 1447 (1973).Finally, we will also deny the request forproposed issue (e). Belo simply has notdemonstrated that WADECO's arrange-ment with Byrd on Its face violates anyof the Commission's assignment andtransfer rules. 7. Accordingly, it is ordcred, that thefourth motion to enlarge issues, filedJuly 5, 1974, by Belo Broadcasting Cor-poration, is granted to the extent indi-cated herein, and is denied in all otherrespects, and that Issue I(a) Is modifiedto read as follows: 1(c) Whether the applicant will haveavailable a $3,000,000 loan fromCaruth C. Byrd, and, if so, the effect ofthe terms and conditions\" of that loanon the applicant's financial qualifica-tions. Adopted: 20207; FCC 74-1091] RCA GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

In that Order, we allowed to .be- edme effective a through-rate of $9,500 per month for leased voice-grade chan- nels between Guam and the Philippines filed by RCA.' RCA had stated that its Guam/Philippines revenue division under the- proposed rate would be $4,588 and $4,912, assuming a compositing ratio of 2:1 cable to satellite. We noted, however, that a compositing ratio of 1:1 was argu- ably the correct one, and we recalculated the revenue division on that basis, deter- mining that the revenue should be $4,408 for Guam and $5,092 for the Philippines. We relied on the policies stated in Au- thorized Entities anc. Users, 4 F.C.C. 2d 421, 434 (1966), in using this compositing -ratio, concluding that carriers should reflect the costs of available satellite facilities in calculating their costs of service even though satellites might not actually be used in-providing the particu- lar service, 34 F.C.C. 2d at 906. 3. Both ITT and WUI state in their petitions that the revenue division de- cided upon by the Commission in 1972 cannot be accomplished. They rely upon an order of the Philippines Public-Service Commission, (which IT asks the Com- mission to notice) of June 13, 1972 which states that $6,000 per month is the only authorized rate that may be used in con- nection with leased voice-grade channels to Guam through the Philippines ter- minal ITT and WU1 contend that $6,000 of the through-rate must be apportioned to the Philippines end, leaving only $3,500 to be attributed to the Guam ter- minal. Since the Commission in its 197Z order found that the costs attributable to the Guam end should be $3,761, 34 F.C.C. 2d at 906, it is argued that the $3,500 available under the through-zate would be noncompensatory. 48kHz, 2d aff'd, 29 F.C.C. 2d 943 (1971). 4.'In view of the order of the Philip- pine PSC, of which we take notice, it ap- pears that $6,000 of' the through-rate must be apportioned to the Philippines end, leaving only $3,500 for the Guam end for which-we calculated the costs to- be $3,761. It appears, therefore, that RCA will not be able to follow the rev- enue division that we accepted in our 1972 order, and that a hearing is now necessary to determine whether this through-rate is reasonable and lawful.The proceeding ordered, herein, shall be conducted on a \"paper\" basis to expedite its resolution.

Take notice that on October 2,1974 the Connecticut Light & Power Company(CIAzP) tendered for filing a Purchase Agreement with Respect to Various Gas Turbine Units. The agreement was dated as of September 9, 1974 between (1) CL&P, The Hartford Electric Light Com- pany (HELCO) and Western Massachu- setts Electric Company (W'MECO) and (2) New England Power Company (NEPCO). The proposed effective date is October 1, 1974. The Purchase Agreement provides for a sale to NEPCO of a specified percent- age of capacity and energy from the eighteen gas turbine generating units during the period from October 1, 1974 to October 31, 1974, together with related transmission service. CL&P requests that the Commission waive the thirty-day notice period and permit the rate schedule filed to become effective on October 1, 1974. CL&P states that the delay in filing was due to ques- tions raised as to NEPCG's capability re- sponsibility obligation under the terms of the New England Power Pool Agreement. HELCO and WiMECO have filed Certi- ficates of Concurrence with regard to this fling. Applicant states that copies of this fil- ing have been mailed or delivered to CL&P, HELCO, WIAECO and NEPCO. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a petition to Intervene or protest with the Federal Power Commision, 825 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with \u00a7 1.8 and 1.10 of the Commisslon's rules of practice and pro- cedure (18 CFR 1.8, 110).

Box 44, Winter Park, Florida 32789, and Transcontinen- tal Gas Pipe Line Corporation (Transco), P.O. Box 1396, Houston, Texas 77001, filed in Docket No. CP75- 109 an applicatii pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act for a cer- tificate of public convenience and neces- sity authorizing the continuation of an exchange of natural gas and the reten- tion and continued operation of related exchange facilities, all as more fully set forth in the application, which is on FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 39, NO. 205-TUESDAY, OCTOBER 22, 1974375.39 NOTICES file with the Commission and open to public inspection. The application indicates that Florida Gas has constructed, or intends to re- imburse Transco for Transco's construc- tion, at a total cost to Florida Gas of $35,143, paid for by cash on hand, a tap and measuring facilities at the inter- connection of Florida Gas' 6-inch Helen Gohlke lateral and Transco's 24-inch pipeline in Victoria County, Texas, forthe purpose of delivering daily into Transco's system 25,000 Mcf of natural gas which Florida Gas would otherwise be unable to receive because of the ca- pacity limitation upon said 6-inch pipe- line. The gas is available at the Helen Gohlke lateral, according to the appli- cation, as a result of accelerated produc- tion in the area by Sun Oil Company(Sun). Transco redelivers to Florida Gas on a simultaneous basis, unless other- wise mutually agreed,' at existing author- ize exchange points 10,000 Mcf per day at the outlet of Sun's Tijerina-Canales- Blucher Gasoline Plant in Brooks County, Texas, and 15,000 Mcf per dayat the outlet of Sun's Starr Gasoline Plan in Star County, Texas, as set forth in the application. The applica- tion states that the subject exchange ison an Mcf-for-Mcf basis, with no mone- tary compensation. Applicants state that the subject ex- change was commenced on August 8, 1974, on an emergency basis, pursuant to \u00a7 157.22 of the Commission's regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.22), in order to assure maintenance of adequate service on Florida Gas' sys- tem and 'to avoid curtailment of thetransportation service rendered by Flor- ida Gas to Florida Power & Light Corn-. pany. Applicants also state that (1) the ad- ditional quantities of gas made availableat the Helen Gohlke lateral by Sun will aid in maintaining continuity of trans- portation service by Florida Gas and compensate for reduced deliveries from Sun's gasoline plants, which reduced deliveries are the result of declining deli- verability from gas fields which servd such plants, and (2) the subject exchange will provide Transco with greater opera- tional flexibility. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before October 31, 1974, file with the Federal Power Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a petition to intervene or a protest in ac- cordance with the requirements of the Commission's rules of practice and pro- cedure (18 CFR 1.8 or 1.10) and the regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CPR 157.10).

[FR Doc.74-24518 Filed 10-21-74;8:45 am] [Docket No. RP73-102] MICHIGAN WISCONSIN PIPE LINE CO. Order Denying Application for Rehearing and Reconsideration OCTOBER 11, 1974. By order of June 26, 1974, the Com- mission approved a settlement as to most of the issues arising from a jurisdic-tional rate increase proposed by Michi- gan Wisconsin Pipe Line Company (Mich-Wis) in Docket No. RP73-102. In proposing the settlement, the partieshad, by agreement, submitted additional testimony and waived initial decision as to the propriety of the inclusion in Mich-Wis' cost of service of $1,050,000 of delay rental payments related to a coal gasification program. The Commis- sion, in its JUne 26 order approving the settlement, rejected the inclusion ofthese payments, indicating its concern,that there was no adequate assurancethat Mich-Wis will ever mine the coal or gasify it and that the benefit would be too far removed from the cost proposedto be borne by the natural gas con- sumers. On July 8,1974, Mich-Wis filed an Ap- plication For Modification of the June 26 order. Therein, Mich-Wis agreed that ifthe Commission would modify its order of June 26, 1974, to authorize the inclu- sion of delay rental payments in its cost of service, Mich-Wis will make a juris-dictional rate adjustment to reflect ex- clusion of such payments and will refundwith .interest revenues previously col-lected, if coal gas deliveries have not commence within five years from thetime such coal option payments are in- cluded in the cost of service. Mich-Wis was of the opinion that such an under-taking satisfies the Commission's con- cern in this matter in that the companyhas assumed the same obligation with re- spect to the delay coal rental payments as that provided under Commission 'orders relating to advance payments. By order Issued August 12, 1974, the Commission, among other things, denied Mich-Wis' Application For Modification stating that the company's analogy be- tween the coal payments and advanco payments fails because: Under the proposal, the ratepayeri would paytin advance part of the costs of a coal gasification program which costs would other- wise be capitalized to that program and re- couped through the rates charged for the gas produced. The ratepayers are not hero being asked to pay the carrying charges on a loan. nather the ratopayer would pay in advance part of the cost of production while no provision is made to credit the payment of these expenses to the price of the gagproduced. Thus, the analogy fails and the \"bonefit\" to the ratepayor remains incom- plete. Even if a workable crediting provision could be proposed, wo are not at this time in. clined, as a matter of policy, to permit thoadhoc inclusion In pipeline costs of service of ox-penses which would otherwigse be capitalizedto a planned coal gasilcation project. Wonote, in this regard, that the presently effec-tive advance payment program was the prod-uct of full rulemaking proceedings In which comments from interested partlea could becarefully evaluated and consistent standardscould be developed applicable to all pipollneirendering advance payments.1 On September 11, 1974, Mich-Wls filedan Application For Rehearing and Re- consideration relating to the order ofAugust 12, 1974. Insofar as Mich-Wis' pleading seeks review of this Comils- slon's findings expressed In our order ofJune 26, 1974 it is improperly filed since applications for rehearing relating tothat drder were due on or before July 26, 1974. (Section 19(a) of the Natural Gas Act.) We shall, however, consider theinstant pleading as a motion for recon- sideration of our June 26, 1974 order which denied cost of service treatment for the coal delay rental payments. Mich-Wis also requests rehearing and reconsideration of the Commission's order of August 12, 1974, which denied modification to the June 26 order as being in error in that Mich-Wis' commitment to adjust its rates and provide refunds if gas deliveries do not commence within five years protects consumers under anyand all circumstances. Mich-Wis again states in its filing of September 11, that it would agree not to seek recovery Infuture rates of any costs paid for by Its customers during the development pe- riod. Mich-Wis again argues that underthese conditions, Its proposal to collect revenues for coal delay rental payments is substantially analogous to advancepayments for ratemaking purposes. As we stated in our order of August 12, 1974, even if a workable crediting provi- sion could be proposed, we are not In- clined, as a matter of policy, to permit the ad hoc inclusion in pipeline costs of service of expenses which would other- Michigan Wisconsin Pipe Line Company, Docket No. P13-102, order Issued August 12, 1974, mimeo, pp. 2,3. FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 39, NO. 205-TUESDAY, OCTOBER 22, 197437540 NOTICES wise be capitalized* to'i planned coal gasification project. Again, the program was the product'of-fuil rulemaking proceed-, ings-in which comments from interested parties were carefully evaluated and standards -were. developed applicable to all pipelines rendering advance pay- ments. The public interest requires that we not proceed on an ad hoe basis to al- low potentially large cost items which are'Telated to non-jurisdictional facil- ities without carefully developed stand- ards for consumer protection. Mich-Wis' offers of refunds and crediting proposals which attempt to protect the ratepayers do not remedy this basic defect. Mich-Wis argues that it is entitled to rely on past indications in Commission orders that where the record in a pro- ceeding demonstrates that consumers would be benefitted these expenditures would be allowed to be recovered2 Con- -sistent with our findings in the cases cited by the company, we find the record be- fore us does not pr6vide the basis upon which we may include in Mich-Wis' cost of service, the $1,050,000 in delay rental payments. The Commission jinds: (1) To the ex- tent that Mich-Wis' instant pleading seeks rehearing of our June 26,1974 order -in this proceeding it does not properly lie. (Section 19(a) Natural Gas Act.) Moreover, upon reconsideration of argu- ments raised relating to our June 26 order, we find no facts or principlhs of law presented by the instant pleading which would provide an appropriate basis for modification of that order. (2) Mich-Wis' Application For Re- hearing and Reconsideration filed on September 11, 1974, raises no facts or principles of law which would provide an appropriate basis for modification of the Commission's- order of August 12, 1974. The Commission orders: (A) Mich- Wis' Application For Rehearing and Re- consideration of our August 12, 1974 order is denied. (B) To the exent that Mich-Wis' Application For Rehearing aiid Re- consideration seeks rehearing and recon- sideration of our June 26, 1974, order in this proceeding, itis denied.

Order Accepting for Filing and Suspending Proposed Increase in Rates, Providing for Hearing, Granting Interventions, and Granting Vaiver with Condition' OCTOBER 11, 1974. On August 30, 1974, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company Med in Docket No. BP75-13 certain revised tariff sheets1 Incorporating a proposed increase in rates of $16,036,994 annually for juris- dictional natural gas sales and services based on sales for the 12-month period ended April 30, 1974, as adjusted. Ten- nessee requests that its proposed increase in rates be made effective on October 15, 1974. In support of the requested increase In rates, Tennessee cites increases in the cost of materials, supplies, wages, serv- Ices, and taxes. In addition, Tennessee seeks a rate of return on its net invest- ment rate base of 9.75 percent. Tennessee's request for increased rates is based in part upon the fact that its deliverability of gas from connected sources is declining. The present gas shortage in this country, to which this Commission has often called attention, is a problem which is shared by most if not all major interstate transmission pipe- lines in varying degrees of magnitude. The effect upon the capital invested in gas pipeline operations resulting from inadequate and declining gas supplies as well as the uncertainties and contingen- cies inherent in possible supplemental sources of supply are of direct and pri- mary concern to us. Accordingly, we re- quest that the evidence in this proceed- ing, Including that to be filed by our Staff, give full and careful consideration to these factors in the development of recommendations on the issue of rate of return so as to enable this Commission to formulate sound regulatory policies in this area. Notice of Tennessee's filing was issued on September 10, 1974, providing for pro- tests or petitions to intervene to be med on or before September 26, 1974. The parties' listed on the Appendix med peti- tions to intervene. These petitions will be granted. Based on our review of Tennessee's proposed rate increase, including the documents, information, and studies submitted therewith as required by the Commission's regulations, and the peti- tions to intervene, we find that the re- quested increase may be excessive or 'Sixth Revised Sheet Nos. 12A and 12B of Ninth Volume No. 1 of Tennessee's FPO Gas Tariff; and Second Revised Sheet Nos. 54, 78 and 141 and Fifth Revised Sheet Nos. 11, 12, 27, 28, 44, and 45 of Sixth Revised Volume No. 2 of the tariff.NOTICES otherwise unlawful under the Natural Gas Act, and that accordingly the pro- posed increase should be suspended and set for hearing. We note that Tennessee has included in the tariff sheets proposed herein costs associated with $22,161,108 of uncertifi- cated facilities. Tennessee requests waiver of \u00a7 154.63 (e) (2) (it) of the regu- lations to permit such costs to be in- cluded in the subject rate filing. Tennes- see states that such facilities will be constructed and in service by the time the revised rates proposed in the filing become effective, subject to refund after a 5-month suspension. For good cause shown, we shall grant waiver of \u00a7 154.63 (e) (2) (ii) of the regu- lations and permit the costs associated with the uncertificated facilities to be included in the filing and to become ef- fective, subject to refund, after suspen- sion; provided, however, that if such facilities are not certificated and in service on the date the proposed rates take effect, subject to refund, Tennessee shall Me substitute tariff sheets includ- ing rates which reflect only those facil- ities which have been certificated and are in service as of that date.

(2) Good cause exists to grant waiver of Section 154.63 (e) (2) (ii) to the Regu- lations as hereinafter ordered and condi- tioned. The Commission orders: (A) Pursuant to the authority of the Natural Gas Act, particularly sections 4,, 5, 8, and 15 thereof, and the Commission's rules and regulations, a hearing shall be held to determine the justness and reasonable- ness of the rates proposed herein by Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company. (B) Pending hearing and decision thereon, Tennessee's proposed increased rates are accepted for filing, suspended for five months, and permitted to be- come effective thereafter on March 15, 1974, in the manner prescribed of the Natural Gas Act, and subject to refund: Provided, however, That Tennessee shall file substitute tariff sheets to become ef- fective March 15, 1974, reflecting ex- clusion of the costs reflected in its pro- posed rates associated with any facilities which have not been certificated and placed in service as of March 15, 1974.

Order Approving Acquisition of Bank First International Bancshares, Inc., Dallas, Texas, a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, has applied for the Board's approval under section 3(a) (3) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a) (3)) to ac- quire all of the voting shares Uess direc- tors' qualifying shares) of American Bank of Commerce, Victoria, Texas (\"Bank\"). The bank into which Bank Is to be merged has no significance except as a means to facilitate the acqusition of the voting shares of Bank. Accordingly, the proposed acquisition of shares of the successor organization is treated herein as the proposed acquisition of the shareo of Bank,Notice of the application, affording opportunity for interested persons to submit comments and views, has been given In accordance with section 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing comments and views has expired, and the Board has considered the application and all com-o ments received in light of the factors set forth in section 3(c) of the Act (12 US.C. 1842(c)). Applicant, the largest banking organi- zation in Texas, controls 18 banking sub- sidiarles with deposits of $3.1 billion, representing approximately 8.0 percent of the total deposits in commercial banks in the State. Acquisition of Bank (deposits of $59.9 million) would not- sigificantly increase Applicant's share of State deposits. Bank, with approximately 21 percent of the total market deposits, is the third largest of four commercial banks in Vic- toria County, vWch approximates the relevant market. Applicant has no sub- sidlary in the mark-et and its nearest subsidiary bank Is approximately 118 miles northwest of bank. Due to the dis- tances involved and the restrictive State branching laws, It does not appear that any significant competition will develop between Bank and any of Applicant's banking subsidinries. Approval of this proposal would not adversely affect the attractive nature of the market for de novo entry and would leave two remain- ing potential entry vehicles for the State's other bank holding companies. On the basis of the record, it appears that consummation of the proposed ac- quisition would have no significant ad- verse effects upon existing or potential competition. Considerations relating to the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of Applicant, its subsidiaries and Bank- are regarded as satisfactory and consistent with approval of the ap- plication. Bank's affiliation with Appli-cant would provide Bank with greater access to capital and added lending ca- pacity through loan participations. In addition Bank could draw upon Appli- cant's experience in the areas of trust activities, industry development and in-ternational banldngf. These considera- tions relating to the convenience and needs of the community to be served are consistent with approval of the applica- tion. It is the Board's judgment that the proposed acquisition would be In the pub- lic interest and that the application should be approved. On the basis of the record, the appli- cation Is approved for the reasons sum- marized above. The transaction shall not be made (a) before the thirtieth calendar day following the effective date of this Order or (b) later than three months after the effective date of this Order, un- less such period Is extended for good cause by the Board, or by the Federal Re- serve Bank of Dallas pursuant to dele- gated authority. 2An! bankins data are as of December 31, 1973 and reflect holding company formations and acquisstlons approved through Septem-ber 30, 1974.

Notice of-the application, affording op- portunity for interested persons, to sub- mit comments and views, has-een given in accordance with \u00a7 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing commehts and views has expired, and the Board has considered the application and all comments re- ceived in light of the factors set forth in section 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)). Applicant, the third largest banking organization in Tennessee, controls six banks with aggregate deposits of ap- -proximately $922 million, representing 8 percent of the total deposits in com- mercial banks in the State? Acquisition of Bank (deposits of $11.9 million) would not significantly increase Applicant's -share of deposits in Tennessee nor would it significantly increase the concentra- tion of banking resources within the State. Bank, with approximately 44 per cent of market deposits, is the largest of three commercial banks in Hardin County, which approximates the relevant market. Although Bank is the largest, the second largest bank in the market is only slight- ly smaller and thus, Bank does not exert a dominant force over the market. Ap- plicant has no subsidiary in the relevant market and its nearest subsidiary bank is approximately 60 miles from Bank. It does not appear that any competition presently exists between- Applicant's banking subsidiaries and Bank; nor does it appear likely that any significant com- petition would develop in the future be- tween Applicant and Bank due to the size of Bank and the distances involved. Al- though Applicant appears to have the fi- nancial resources to enter the market de novo, such entry is prohibited by state law. Therefore, the Board concludes that consummation of the proposal would not have significbnt adverse effects on exist- ing or potential competition in any area, and that the competitive considerations are consistent with approval of the ap- plication.. Considerations relating to the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of Applicant, its subsidiaries and Bank are regarded as-generally sat- isfactory and consistent with approval of the application.

Furthermore, Appli- cant is prohibited from entering the market de novo due to State branching laws. Therefore, the Board concludes that consummation of the proposed transaction would not have significantly adverse effects on existing or potential competition in any relevant area, and that the competitive considerations are consistent with approval of the application! The financial condition and mana- gerial resources of Applicant and its subsidiaries are considered generallysatisfr tory and the future prospects of each appear favorable. The managerial resources of Bank are considered satis- factory as is its financial condition in view of Applicant's commitment to inject $100,000 equity capital Into Bank within 45 days ofthis acquisition. Accordingly, Bank's future prospects appear favor- able. Thus, the banking factors are con- s1stent with approval of the application. Applicant proposes to expand the range. of services presently offered by Bank. In particular, affiliation with Applicant will provide Bank's customers with data processing services, investment and fi- nanclal advice, and trust services. Con- sequently, the considerations relating to the convenience and needs of the com- munities to be served lend some weight tdward approval of the application.

Notice is hereby given that The Co-lumbia Gas System, Inc. (\"Columbia\"), 20 Montchanin Road, Wilmington, Dela-ware 19807, a registered holding com-pqny, has filed a declaration, and anamendment thereto, with this Commis-sion pursuant to the Public Utility Hold-ing Company Act of 1935 (\"Act\"), desig-nating sections 6(a) and 7 of the Actand Rule 50 promulgated thereunder asapplicable to the following proposed transaction. All interested persons arereferred to the declaration, which is sum-marized below, for a complete statement of the proposed transaction. Columbia proposes to issue and sell,subject to the competitive bidding re-quirements of rule 50 under the Act, Upto $75,000,000 principal amount of -=% debentures. The maturity date has notbeen fixed but will be supplied by amend-ment to this declaration. The Interestrate of the debentures (which shall be FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 39, NO. 205-TUESDAY, OCTOBER 22, 197437548 NOTICES a multiple of Y. of 1%) and the price, exclusive of accrued interest, to be paid to Columbia (which shall be not less than 98/% nor more than 101Y of the prin- cipal amount thereof) ,will be determined by the competitive bidding. The deben- tures will be issued under an indenture between Columbia and Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, Trustee, dated as of June 1, 1961, as heretofore supplemented by various indentures and as to be further supplemented by a Twenty-Third Supplemental Indenture to be dated as of November 1,1974. The supplemental indenture will pro- hibit redemption of any of the deben- tures prior to November 1, 1979, directly or indirectly, with borrowed funds, or in anticipation of funds to be borrowed, having an effective annual interest cost to Columbia of less than the effective an- nual interest cost of the debentures to Columbia. The proposed debentures will be subject to a sinking fund providing for retirement of $52,500,000 (70%) thereof prior to maturity through annual pay- ments of $2,625,000 commencing in 1979. The net proceeds from the sale of the debentures will be added to the general funds of Columbia and, together with other funds then available and funds thereafter to be generated from opera- tions, will be used by Columbia to finance, among other things, the deferred portion of the 1974 capital expenditures program and part of the 1975 capital expenditures program of Columbia's subsidiary com- panies, -which involves expenditures of approximately $450,000,000. The capital expenditures program involves additions and improvements to the -properties of the Columbia system necessary to explore for, produce, receive, transport, store, and distribute the quantities of gas required by the system's customers. Columbia es- timates that additional long-term financ- ing of up to $120,000,000 may be required in 1975 to complete this program. Such additional financing, to the extent neces- sary, will be the subject of future filings with this Commission. Columbia further states that in view of the increased difficulty encountered by utilities in selling debentures under the current unsettled conditions in the se- curities market, it may not be possible to sell the debentures at competitive bid- ding. Therefore, Columbia may request, by further amendment t5 its declaration, that the sale of its debentures be ex- cepted from competitive bidding under the requirements of rule 50. It is stated that no State commission and no Federal commission, other than this Commission, has jurisdiction over the proposed transaction. A statement of the fees, comnmissions, and expenses re- lated to the proposed transaction is to be filed by amendment. Notice is further given that any inter- ested person may, not later than Novem- ber 8, 1974, request in writing that a hearing be held on such matter, stating the nature of his interest, the reasons for such request, and the issue of fact or law raised by said amended declaration which he desires to controvert; or he may re- quest that he be notified if the Commis-sion should order a hearing thereon.

Volume 39 Number 205 .7H *1934 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY U PHOSPHATE FERTILIZER INDUSTRY Proposed Performance Standards for New Stationary Sources PROPOSED RULES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY [ 40 CFR Part 60 ] [FRL 278-51 STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE FOR NEW STATIONARY SOURCES Five Categories of Sources in the Phosphate Fertilizer Industry Pursuant to section 111 of the Clean Air Act, as amended, the Administratorproposes herein standards of perform-ance for new affected facilities for fivecategories of sources within the phos-phate fertilizer industry as follows: wet-process phosphoric acid plants, super-phosphoric acid plants, diammoniumphosphate plants, triple superphosphateplants, and granular triple superphos- phate storage facilities. On December 23, 1971 (36 FR 24876),the first standards of performance werepromulgated for five categories ofsources. On March 8, 1974 (39 FR 9308),standards of performance were promul-gated for seven additional categories of sources. Since that time, several otherPublications in the FEDERAL REGISTERhave amended the standards. As prescribed by section 111, proposalof standards within the phosphate fer-tilizer industry was preceded by the Ad-ministrator's determination that thesecategories of sources contribute signifi-cantly to air pollution which causes orcontributes to the endangerment of pub-lic health or welfare and by publication of this determination elsewhere in this issue of the FEDERAL REGISTER. The phosphate fertilizer industry is amajor source of fluoride air pollution. Fluoride was the only pollutant, otherthan the criteria pollutants, specificallynamed as requiring Federal action in theMarch, 1970, \"Report of the Secretary ofHealth, Education and Welfare to the'United States (91st) Congress.\" This concluded that \"inorganic fluoridesare highly irritant and toxic gases\"which, in low ambient concentrations, damage plants and animals. The UnitedStates Senate Committee on Public Works in its report on the Clean AirAmendments of 1970 (Senate Report No.91-1196, September 17, 1970, p. 9) in-cluded fluorides on a list of contami-nants which have broad national impactand require Federal action. Even though present evidence indicatesthat fluorides in the range of ambientconcentrations encountered under worstconditions do not damage human healththrough inhalation, they do present aserious threat to public welfare. Exten- sive documented evidence is available de-scribing the injurious effects of fluorideson vegetation and herbivorous animals have consumed vegetation thatcontains fluorides. Public welfare is af-fected not only through the aesthetic im-pact of fluoride on vegetation, but alsothrough a decrease in the economic value of sensitive crops which are overtlydamaged by exposure to fluorides in the atmosphere.With the need for control of fluoride so obvious, an evaluation was made of available alternative avenues of regula- tory control. The \"Preferred StandardsPath Report for Fluorides\" (November 1972) concluded that the most appropri- ate strategy is through the authority of section 111 of the Act. This, in turn, in- vokes section 111(d) which provides for a regulatory mechanism to assure a na- tionwide strategy for control of any air pollutants which are not on lists pub- lished pursuant to section 108(a) or 112(b) (1) (A) of the Act. Fluoride has not been named on either list. Specifical- ly, section 111(d) requires that the Ad-ministrator prescribe a procedure to as- sure the subsequent development, imple- mentation and enforcement of emission standards for existing sources that would be subject to the standard of performanceif they were new sources. As a consequence of the provisions of section 111 (d), final promulgation of thisstandard of performance for new sources will require that the States develop emis-sion standards for existing plants withinthe five categories of sources. Actions toimplement section 111(d) will be initi-ated after promulgation of this regula- tion. The standards for new sources will re-quire installation of high efficiency gas scrubbers. Such scrubbers (with internalpacking to im'prove the absorption effl-ciency of the scrubbing fluid) are com-monly used on all the categories of sources except superphosphoric acid (SPA). However, based on data from theother categories, engineering judgmentindicates the standard recommended forSPA plants is achievable with the same type of equipment. The standard will permit construc- tion of both of the more common proc- esses for manufacture of SPA eventhough one also emits pollutants otherthan fluorides (i.e., SO, and hydrocar- bons). Although the vacuum evaporation SPA process is intrinsically superiorfrom an air pollution control aspect, itis unable to concentrate acid made frompoor quality rock because of the inherent contamination of that rock. If the in- dustry is restricted to the vacuum evaporation process, it would be unableto utilize the nation's increasingly poorerquality phosphate rock. This would in-crease costs and decrease the competitiveposition of the domestic industry. In thejudgment of the Administrator, the ad-verse aspects of a more stringent stand-ard that would disfranchise the directcontact system outweigh the incremen- tal improvement in air pollution control. Visible emission standards are pro-posed for diammonium phosphate plants,triple superphosphate plants, and gran-ular triple superphosphate storage fa-cilities. The effluent gas streams from these processes include particulate mat-ter (both fluoride and non-fluoride), as well as gaseous fluoride. The control sys-tems that must be installed to comply with the proposed standard for total flu- orides remove particulate matter alongwith gaseous fluorides. Improper opera-tion and maintenance of such controlsystems result In an increase In emis-sions of total fluorides as well as particu-late matter, the Increase In particulatematter resulting In an Increase In theopacity of the gas stream. Available In-formation indicates that a control sys-tem which meets the proposed limit fortotal fluorides will easily meet the pro-posed limit for opacity. However, a con-trol system which does not meet theproposed limit for opacity will clearlynot meet the proposed limit for totalfluorides. ' Visible emission standards are not pro-posed for wet-process phosphoric acidplants or superphosphoric acid plants.Effluent gas from wet-processphosphoric acid plants contain very lit-tle particulate matter; therefore, a visi-ble emission standard would not Indicateimproper operation and maintenance ofa control system. Sufficient data are notavailable for superphosphorlo acid plantsequipped with best available controltechnology to develop an appropriate visible emission standard. The proper use of and test methodsfor opacity standards are presently be-ing reconsidered by the Agency in res-ponse to remands from the United StatesCourt of Appeals for the District ofColumbia Circuit in Portland Cement As-sociation v. Ruckelshaus, 486 F.2d 375'(1973), and Essex Chemical Corp. v.Ruckelshaus, 486 F.2d 427 (1973). Theresponse to the remand In the PortlandCement case should be completed short-ly. At that time, the Agency will promul-gate or propose such revisions of Its opa-city standards or test methods as Itdeems necessary or desirable. In accord-ance with section 117(f) of the Act, pub-lication of these proposed amendment,to 40 CFR was preceded by consultation with appropriate advisory committees,indepetident experts and Federal depart-ments and agencies. In the course ofthese consulations, the Department of Commerce has questioned the establish-ment of visible emisions (opacity) stand-ards. The Department of Commerce be-lieves that opacity limits have not beensatisfactorily correlated to give rates ofparticulate concentration emissions ormass emissions to establish opacity as astandard. Further, Commerce has ques-tioned whether such standards would besubject to accurate visual determination.Commerce, therefore, recommended thatopacity limits not be adopted as a stand-ard where a particulate concentration ornass emissions standard Is established.Commerce believes such opacity llmitsshould only be used In those cases tocreate a rebuttable presumption of aviolation of the particulate or mass emos-sions standards. Commerce believes suchpresumption could, for example, be re-butted by providing a continuous opacitymonitor record showing a visual opacityobservation to be in error; and/or by ashowing that the particulate concentra-tion or mass emissions standards was notexceeded at the time the opacity limitwas exceeded. Commerce believes such ashowing could be made by a performance FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 39, NO. 205-TUESDAY, OCTOBER 22, 197437602' PROPOSED RULES test.

On January 25, 1974, regulations for con-trol of emissions from the remaining light duty category, light duty diesel- powered trucks, were proposed (39 FR 3276). Regulations for this light duty category were not proposed previously since no light duty diesel-powered trucks were being marketed in the United States. The proposal was in response to notification by one manufacturer of plansto market a light duty diesel truck for the 1976 model year. Since that time, two other manufacturers have indicated' that they may market a light duty diesel truck as early as the 1976 model year. Except for the levels of the standards, the regulations contain essentially iden- tical provisions to those already promul- gated for light duty diesel-powered pas- senger vehicles. The levels of the emis- sion standards are the same as for light duty gasoline-fueled trucks, which are slightly higher than the \"interim 1975\" standards for light duty passenger ve- hicles. These standards are expected to be met through the application of exist- Ing technology. The proposed regulations incorporated the amendments proposed on October 12, 1973, which would require that new ve- hicles to be sold at high altitudes (above 4,000 feet), be, certified for compliance with Federal emission standards at these altitudes. Those amendments are not in- corporated in this final rulemaking sincethis rulemaking is to be effective begin- ning with the 1976 model year while the high altitude amendments, although originally intended to be effective for the 1976 model year, are now planned to be effective with the 1977 model year. The high altitude amendments are expected to be promulgated shortly and will be applicable to light duty diesel trucks in addition to light duty gasoline and diesel-powered Passenger vehicles and light duty gasoline-fueled trucks. Other changes to the regulations re- flect the adoption of comments received on the proposed regulations. These changes included correcting errors in the proposal, and increasing the allowable temperature range of the heated hydro- carbon analytical system. Concern was expressed in the com- ments about the requirement for air posting data from emission tests within 24 hours. Such a requirement presently exists for foreign manufacturers of gasoline-powered light duty passenger cars and trucks as well as diesel-powered passenger car manufacturers (Mercedes- Benz and Peugeot). Few problems have been encountered in the timely and suc-RULES AND REGULATIONS cessful transmittal of data by these manufacturers. Some concern may exist due to the necessity of hand-reading and integrating the heated FM traces after a diesel vehicle has completed the driv- ing schedule. It has been the Agency's policy to not consider a test completed until final emission data, i.e., grams/ mile, exist. Thus, the time required for hand-reading emission traces is not a factor in successfully following the regulations for data transmittal as the time requirements do not apply until after the data is reduced. Question was raised in the comments regarding the flexibility allowed to the manufacturers on the durability driving schedule in Appendix IV. As a matter of practicability, the Agency is only con- cerned with the driving schedule param- eters of speeds, times, and rates of acceleration and deceleration. The 3.7 miles per lap, 11-lap durability driving course is not strictly required. Proposed durability schedules are routinely sub- mitted to the Agency by manufacturers of light duty passenger vehicles and gaso- line-fueled trucks and are approved if they meet sequential parameters. The same policy will hold for light duty die- sel-powered trucks. Comments also suggested substantial changes to the diesel fuel specifications in order to lessen the difficulty of obtain- ing such fuels and to make them more representative of fuels available in the field. Similar comments have also been submitted by heavy duty diesel engine manufacturers. A study is underway to determine what changes should be made to diesel fuel specifications. When this study is complete, changes will be made simultaneously to the diesel fuel speci- fications for light duty diesel-powered passenger vehicles and trucks and heavy duty diesel engines. The proposed regulations permitted cetane improver additives in the fuels. Comments received pointed out that most cetane improver additives are ni- trogen containing and that their use can result in N02 emissions over and above those normally produced by the engine. EPA views this as a valid concern and intends to evaluate the use of cetane im- provers during the review of diesel fuel specifications which iS in process. For the present, however, it is felt that the cetane requirements stated in the pro- posal are low enough that cetane im- provers are not normally required. Concern was also expressed in the comments over whether paragraph 376- 10(d) is restrictive of paragraphs 10(b) and 10(c) which allow the use of sub- stantially equivalent fuels. EPA addedthe provisions of paragraph (d) in order to allow the use of fuels other than tra- ditional diesel fuels if engines are de- signed for such fuels and if such fuels are indeed commercially available. The intent of this paragraph is not to preventthe vehicle manufacturer and the Ad- ministrator from reaching agreement on use of equivalent diesel fuels as allowed in 10(b) and 10(c) but is to allow addi- tional flexibility in the design of engines which use non-traditional petroleum dis- tillate fuels.One commenter objected to testing light duty diesel trucks for emissions over the same driving cycle that Is used for testing passenger cars because of differ- ences in the application and perform- ance of these vehicles. EPA does not accept this argument due to the fol- lowing considerations: (1) The application of light duty diesel truck is the same as that of light duty gasoline trucks which are tested for compliance with the standards over this same driving cycle. EPA chose to use this same driving cycle when promulgating regulations for light duty gasoline trucks last year because It Is precisely the opera- tion of cars and trucks In the city driving situation represented by this cycle with which EPA Is concerned. (2) As regards the typically lower per- formance of light duty diesel trucks com- pared to light duty passenger vehicles, exactly the same relationship also exists between diesel and gasoline light duty passenger vehicles. The light duty diesel- powered passenger vehicle Is marketed as a direct replacement for gasoline- fueled light duty passenger vehicles, also has substantially lower performance than its gasoline-fueled counterpart, and is tested over this same driving cycle. The urban driving cycle represents an average city trip and It has been recog- nized that among the broad spectrum of light duty vehicles would exist some of which would be incapable of exactly fol- lowing the driving cycle. Such a situation is allowed for In that those vehicles are required to do the best that they can, as would be the case of their operation in actual traffic. Several commenters argued that the regulations are not desirable at this time since (1) the added cost of regulations may discourage further efforts to utilize diesel engines in light duty trucks at a time when there is a need to conserve petroleum, and introduce alternative en- gines which may be able to comply with future emission requirements, and (2) EPA has not shown that the numbers of diesel-powered light duty trucks likely to be sold will cause any significant detri- mental effect upon air quality. EPA recognizes the favorable fuel economy and emissions characteristics of diesel engines. However, the difference that regulations will make in the small quantity of light duty diesel trucks likely to be sold In replacement of light duty gasoline trucks in the near future is wholly unlikely to have any significant impact on national petroleum consump- tion. In addition, the difference that reg- ulations will make in the amount of capital made available by the sale of light duty diesel trucks for research and development of an advanced light duty diesel engine is not likely to be signifi- cant especially when compared to the amount of capital that will be made available for research and development by the more voluminous sale of presently regulated light duty diesel passenger vehicles.

Each applicant for or recipient of certification is required to cause those in charge of a facility oper- ated for Its benefit to furnish such rea- sonable assistance without charge to FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 39, NO. 20S-TUESDAY, OCTOBER 22, 197437613 RULES AND REGULATIONS EPA whether or not the application con- trols the facility. (6) The duty to' admit or cause to be admitted any EPA Enforcement Officer applies whether or not the applicant owns or controls the facility in question and applies both to domestic and to foreign manufacturers and facilities. EPA will not attempt to make any inspec- tions which it has been informed that local law forbids. However, if local law makes it impossible to do what is neces- sary to insure the accuracy of data gen- erated at a facility, no informed judg- ment that a vehicle or engine is certifi- able or is covered by a certificate can properly be based on that data. It is the responsibility of the manufacturer to lo- cate its testing and manufacturing fa- cilities in jurisdictions where this situa- tion will not arise. (7) For purposes of this paragraph: (i) \"Presentation of credentials\" shall mean display of the document designat- ing a person as an EPA Enforcen'lent Officer. (ii) Where vehicle, component, or en- gine storage areas or facilities are con- cerned, \"operating hours\" shall mean all times during which personnel other than custodial personnel are at work in the vicinity of the area or facility and have access to it. (ii) Where facilities or areas other than those covered by paragraph (c) (7) (it) of this section are concerned, \"operating, hours\" shall mean all times during which an assembly line is in op- eration or all times during which test- ing, maintenance, mileage accumula- tion, production or compilation of rec- ords, or any other procedure or activity related to certification testing, to trans- lation of designs from the test stige to the production stage, or to vehicle man- ufacture or assembly is being carried out in a facility. (iv) \"Reasonable assistance\" includes, but is not limited to, clerical, copying, interpretation and translation services,the making available on request of per- sonnel of the facility being inspected during their working hours to inform the EPA Enforcement Officer of how the fa- cdity operates and to answer his ques- tions, and the performance on request of emissions tests on any vehicle which is being, has been, or will be used for cer- tification testing. Such tests shall be non- destructive, but may require appropri- ate mileage accumulation. A manufac-turer may be compelled to cause the personal appearance of any employee at such a facility before an'EPA Enforce-ment Officer by written request for his appearance, signed by the Assistant Ad= ministrator for Enforcement and Gen- eral Counsel, served on the manufac-turer. Any such employee who has been instructed by the manufacturer to ap- pear will be entitled to be accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel. No counsel who accompanies, represents, or advises an employee compelled to appear may accompany, represent, or advise any other person in the investigation. (v) Any entry without 24 hours prior written or oral notification to the af-fected manufacturer shall be authorized in writing by the Assistant Administrator for Enforcement and General Counsel. \u00a7 85.376-1 Emission standards for 1976 model year light duty diesel trucks.

(a) After a review of the application for certification and any other informa- tion which the Administrator may re- quire, the Administrator may approve the application and select a test fleet in ac- cordance with \u00a7 85.376-5.(b) The Administrator may disapprove in whole or in part an application for certification for reasons including Incom- pleteness, inaccuracy, inappropriate pro- posed mileage accumulation procedures, test equipment, or fuel, and incorpora- tion of defeat devices in vehicles do- scribed by the application. (c) Where any part of an application is rejected, the Administrator shall no- tify the manufacturer in writing and set forth the reasons for such rejection. Within 30 days following receipt of such notification, the manufacturer may re- quest a hearing on the Administrator's determination. The requests shall be in writing, signed by an authorized repre- sentative of the manufacturer and shall include a statement specifying the manu- facturer's objections to the Administra- tor's determinations, and data In support of such objections. If, after the review of the request and supporting data, the Ad- ministrator finds that the request raises a substantial factual issue, he shall pro- vide the manufacturer a hearing In ac- cordance with \u00a7 85.305 with repect to such issue. \u00a7 85.376-4 Required data. The manufacturer shall perform the tests required by the applicable test pro- cedures, and submit to the Administrator the following information: (a) Durability data on such vehicles tested in accordance with the applicable test procedures of this subpart, and In such numbers as therein specified, which will show the performance of the systems installed on or incorporated In the vehi- cle for extended mileage, as well as a .record of all pertinent maintenance per- formed on the test vehicles. (b) Emission data on such vehicles tested in accordance with the applicable emission test procedures of this subpart and in such numbers as therein specified which will show their emissions after 0 miles and 4,000 miles of operation, (c) A description of tests performed to ascertain compliance with the gen- eral standards in \u00a7 85.304 and the data derived from such tests.

(a) (1) The vehicles covered by the application for certification will be divided into groupings of vehicles whose engines are expected to have similar emission characteristics. Each group of engines with similar emission character- istics shall be defined as a separate en- gine family. (2) To be classed in the same engine family, engines must be Identical in all the following respects: FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 39, NO. 205-TUESDAY, OCTOBER 22, 197437614 RULES AND REGULATIONS (i) The cylinder bore center to center dimensions. 0i) The dimension from the center- line of the crankshaft to the centerline of the camshaft. (iii) The dimension from the center- line of the crankshaft to the top of the cylinder block head face. (iv) The cylinder block configuration (air-cooled or water-cooled; L-6, 900 V- 8, etc.).(v) The location of intake and exhaust -valves and the valve sizes (within a y- inch range on the valve head diameter). (vi) The method of air aspiration. (vii) The combustion cycle. (3) Engines identical in all the respects listed in paragraph (a) (2) of this section may be further divided into different engine families if the Ad- ministrator determines that they may be expected to have different emission char- acteristics. This determination will be based upon a consideration of the follow- ing features of each engine: (i) The bore and stroke. (ii) The surface to volume ratio of the -nominally dimensioned cylinder at the top dead center position. (iII) The intake manifold induction port size and configuration. (iv) The exhaust manifold port size and configuration. (v) The intake and exhaust valve sizes. (vi) The fuel system. (vii) The camshaft timing and Igni- tion timing characteristics. (4) Where engines are of a type which cannot be divided into engine families based upon the criteria listed in para- graphs (a). (2) and (3) of this section, the Administrator will establish families for those engines based upon the fea- tures most related to their emission characteristics. (b) Emission data vehicles: - (1) Vehicles will be chosen to be oper- ated and tested for emission data basedupon the engine family groupings. Within each engine family, the require- ments of this partgraph must be met. (2) Vehicles of each engine family will be divided into engine displacement- exhaust emission control system-combi- -nations. A projected sales volume will be established for each combination forthe model year for which certification is sought. One vehicle of each combina- tion will be selected in order of decreas-ing projected sales volume until 70 per- cent of the projected sales of a manufac- turer's total production of vehicles ofthat engine family is represented, or until a maximum of four vehicles is selected. If any single combination represents over 70 percent, then two vehicles of that combination may be selected. The vehi- cle selected for each combination will be specified by the Administrator as to transmission type, fuel system, and in- ertia weight class. (3) The Administrator may select amaximum of -four additional vehicles within each engine family based upon features indicating that th6y may havethe highest emission levels of the vehicles in that engine family. In selecting thesevehicles, the Administrator will consider such features as the emission control system combination, induction system characteristics, Ignition system charac- teristics, fuel system, rated horsepower, rated torque, compression ratio, inertia weight class, transmission options and axle ratios. (4) If the vehicles selected in accord- ance with paragraphs (b) (2) and (3) of this section do not represent each engine-system combination, then one ve- hicle of each engine-system combination not represented will be selected by the Administrator. The vehicle selected shall be of the engine displacement with the largest projected sales volume of vehicles -with the control system combination inthe engine family and will be designated ,by the Administrator as to transmission type, fuel system, and inertia weight class. (c) Durability data vehicles: (1) A durability data vehicle will be selected by the Administrator to rep- resent each engine-system combination. The vehicle selected shall bo of the en- gine displacement with the largest pro- jected sales volume of vehicles with that -control system combination in that en- gine family and will be designated bythe Administrator as to transmission type, fuel system and inertia weight class. (2) A manufacturer may elect to op- erate and test additional vehicles to rep- -resent any engine-system combination. The additional vehicles must be of the same engine displacement, transmission type, fuel system and inertia weight class as the vehicle selected for that en- gine-system combination In accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) (1) ,of this section. Notice of an intent to operate and test additional vehicles shall be given to the Administrator not later than 30 days following notification of the test fleet selection. (d) For purposes of testing under \u00a785.376-7(g) the Administrator may require additional emission data vehicles and durability data vehicles Identical in all material respects to vehicles selected in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section: Provided, That the number of vehicles selected shall not in- crease the size of either the emlsslon data fleet or the durability data fleet by more than 20 percent or one vehicle, whichever Is greater. (e) Any manufacturer whose projected sales of new motor vehicles subject to this subpart for the 1976 model year is less than 2,000 vehicles may request a reduction in the number of test vehicles determined in accordance with the fore- going provisions of this section. The Ad-ministrator may agree to such lesser number as he determines would meet the objectives of this procedure. Cf) In lieu of testing an emission data or durability data vehicle selected underparagraph (b) or (c) of this section and submitting data therefore, a mnanufac- turer may, with the prior written ap- proval of the Administrator, submit data on a similar vehicle for which certifica- tion has previously been obtained. (g) (1) Where it is expected that more than 33 percent of an engine family willbe equipped with an optional item, the full estimated weight of that item shall be included, if required by the Adminis- trator, in the curb weight computation for each vehicle available with that op- tion in th6 engine family. Where it is expected that 33 percent or less of the vehicles in an engine family will be equipped with an item of optional equip- ment, no weight for that item will be added in computing curb weight. In the case of mutually exclusive options, only the weight of the heavier option will be added in computing curb weight. Op- tional equipment weighing less than 3 pounds per Item need not be considered. (2) Where it is expected that more than 33 percent of an engine family will be equipped with an item of optional equipment that can reasonably be ex- pected to influence emissions, then such items of optional equipment shall actually be installed, unless specifically excluded by the Administrator, on all emission data and durability data ve--hiles in the engine family on which the option is intended to be offered in pro- duction. Optional equipment that can reasonably be expected to influence emis- slons are the air conditioner, power steering, power brakes, and other items determined by the Administrator. (3) Optional equipment that can reasonably be expected to influence emis- sions which is utilized on 33 percent or less of the vehicle in the engine family shall not be installed on any vehicle in the engine family unless specifically re- quired under this section. \u00a7 85.376-6 Maintcnance. (a) (1) Scheduled maintenance on the engine, emission control systen, and fuel system of durability vehicles shall be 'scheduled for performance during dura- bility testing at the same mileage inter- vals thatwill be specified In the manufac- turer's maintenance instructions fur- nished to the ultimate purchaser of the motor vehicle. Such maintenance shall be performed only under the following provisions: (i) Scheduled major engine tuneups to manufacturer's specifications may be performed no more frequently than every 12,500 miles of scheduled driving, pro- vided that no tuneup may be performed after 45,000 miles of scheduled driving. A scheduled major engine tuneup shall be conducted in a manner consistent -with service Instructions and specifications provided by the manufacturer for use by customer service personnel. A major en- gine tuneup shall be restricted to the following: (a) Adjustlow Idle speed. (b) Adjust valve lash if required. (c) Adjust injector timing. (d) Adjust governor. (e) Clean and service Injector tips. (f) Adjust drive belt tension on engine accessories. (g) Check engine bolt torque and tighten as required. (ii) Injectors may be changed If a per-sistent misfire Is detected. (I) Normal vehicle lubrication serv-lees (engine and transmission oil change and oil filter, fuel filter, and air filter FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 39, NO. 205--TUESDAY, OCTOBER 22, 197437615 RULES AND REGULATIONS servicing) will be allowed at manufac- turer's recommended intervals. (iv) Readjustment of the engine idle settings may be performed only if there Is a problem of stalling at stops. (v) Engine Idle speed may be ad- justed at the 5,000-mile test point. (vi) Any other engine, emission con- trol system, or fuel system adjustment, repair, removal, disassembly, cleaning, or replacement on durability vehicles shall be performed only with the advance ap- proval of the Administrator. (2) Where the Administrator agrees under \u00a7 85.376-7 to a mileage accumula- tion of less than 50,000 miles for durability testing, he may. modify the requirement of this paragraph. (b) Adjustment of engine Idle speed may be performed once before the 4,000 mile test point on emission data vehicles. Any other engine emission control system, or fuel system adjustment, re- pair, removal, disassembly, cleaning, or replacement on emission data vehicles shall be performed only with the advance approval of the Administrator. (c) Repair to vehicle components of the durability or emission data vehicle, other than the engine, emission control system, or fuel system, shall be per- formed only as a result of part failure or vehicle system malfunction or with the advanced approval of the Admin- istrator. (d) Complete emission tests (see \u00a7\u00a7 85.376-9 to 85.376-23) shall be run, unless waived by the Administrator, be- fore and after any vehicle maintenance which may reasonably be expected to affect emissions. These test data shall be supplied to the Administrator immedi- ately after the tests, along with a com- plete record of all pertinent mainte- nance, including an engineering report of any malfunction diagnosis and the corrective action taken. In addition, all test data and maintenance reports shall be compiled and provided to the Admin- Istrator in accordance with \u00a7 85.376-4. (e) If the Administrator determines that compenent failure or repairs per- formed have resulted in a substantial change to the engine-system combina- tion, the vehicle shall not be used as a durability or emission data vehicle. (f) The use of instruments, tools, or emission tests to identify malfunctioning, maladjusted, or defective engine com- ponents is not allowed unless specifically authorized by the Administrator. \u00a7 85.376-7 Mileage accumulation and emission measurements. The procedure for mileage accumula- tion will be the Durability Driving Sched- ule as specified in Appendix IV t; this part. A modified procedure may also be used if approved in advance by the Ad- ministrator. Except with the advance ap- proval of the Administrator, all vehicles will accumulate mileage- at a measured curb weight which is within 100 pounds of the estimated curb weight. If the loaded vehicle weight is within 100 pounds of being included in the next higher inertia weight class as specified in \u00a7 85.376-13(d), the manufacturer may elect to conduct the respective emissiondata vehicle test at the inertia weight corresponding to the higher loaded ve- hicle weight. (a) Emission data vehiclese: Each emission data vehicle shall be driven 4,000 miles with all emission coiltrol sys- tems installed and operating. Emission tests shall be conducted at zero miles and 4,000 miles. (b) Durability data vehicles: Each durability data vehicle shall be driven with all emission control systems in- stalled and operating, for 50,000 miles or such lesser distance as the Adminitrator may agre to as meeting the objectives of this procedure. Complete emission tests (see \u00a7 85.376-10 through \u00a7 85.376- 23) shall be made at the following mile- age points: 0, 5,000, 10,000, 15,000, 20,000, 25,000, 30,000, 35,000, 40,000, 45,000, and 50,000. (c) All tests required by this subpart to be conducted after 5,000 miles of driv- ing for durability vehicles and 4,000 miles for emission data vehicles must be con- ducted at any accumulated mileage within 250 miles of each of those test points. (d) (1) The results of each emission test shall be supplied to thp Administra- tor immediately after the test. The manufacturer shall furnish to the Ad- ministrator explanation for voiding any test. The Administrator will determine if voiding the test was appropriate based upon the explanation given by the manu- facturer for the voided test. If a manu- facturer conducts multiple tests at any test point at which the data are intended to be used in the calculation of the de- terioration factor, the number of tests must be the same at each point and may not exceed three valid tests. Tests be- tween test points may be conducted as required,by the Administrator. Data from all tests (including voided tests) shall be air posted to the Administrator within 24 hours (or delivered within three working days). In addition, all test data shall be compiled and provided to the Administrator in accordance with \u00a7 85.376-4. Where the Administrator con- ducts a test on a durability vehicle at a prescribed test point, the results of each test will be used in the calculation of the deterioration factor. (2). The results of all emission test results shall be recorded and re- ported to the Administrator using three significant figures. These numbers shall be rounded in accordance with the \"Rounding-Off Method\" specified In ASTMT E 29-67. (e) Whenever the manufacturer pro- poses to operate and test a vehicle which may be used for emission or durability data, he shall provide the zero mile test- data to the Administrator and make the vehicle available for such testing under \u00a7 85.376-29 as the Administrator may re- quire before beginning to accumulate mileage on the vehicle. Failure to comply with this requirement will Invalidate all test data submitted for this vehicle. (f) Once a man~ufacturer begins to op- erate an emission data or durability data vehicle, as indicated by compliance with paragraph (e) of this section, he shall continue to run the vehicle to 4,000 milesor 50,000 miles, respectivebl, and the datafrom the vehicle will cal- culations unler \u00a7 85.37e-28. DIscontinua- tion of a vehicle shall be allowed only with the written consent of tho Administrator. (g) (1) Tae Administrator may elect to operate and test any test vehicle dur- ing all or any part of the mileage accu- mulation and testing procedure. In such cases, the manufacturer shall provide the vehicle(s) to the Administrator with all information necessary to conduct thl testing. (2) The test procedures (99 85.376-9 to 85.376-23) will be followed by the Ad- ministrator. The Administrator will test the vehicles at each test point. .Tainte- nance may be performed by the manu- facturer under such conditions as the Administrator may prescribe. (3) The data developed by the Ad- minlstrator for the engine system com- bination shall be combined with any applicable data supplied by the manu- facturer on other vehicles of that combination to determine the applicable deterioration factors for the combina- tion. In the case of a significant discrep- ancy between data developed by the Ad- ministrator and that submitted by the manufacturer the Administrator's data shall be used in the determination of deterioration factors. (h) Emission testing of any typo with respect to any certification vehicle other than that specified in this subpart is not allowed except as such testing may be specifically authorized by the Admin- istrator. \u00a7 85.376--8 Special jest procedures, The Administrator may, on the basis of a written application therefor by a manufacturer, prescribe test procedures, other than those set forth in this sub- part, for any motor vehicle which he determines is not susceptible to satis- factory testing by the procedures sert forth herein. \u00a7 85.376-9 Test procedurcs, The procedures described in this and subsequent sections will be the tct pro- gram to determine the conformity of diesel light duty truckm with the stand- ards set forth in \u00a7 85.376.1. (a) The test consists of prczcrlbcd sequences of fueling, parking, and op- erating conditions. The e.%haust gazsc3 generated during vehicle operation are diluted with air and sampled continu- ously for analysis of diesel exhaust hydrocarbon and subsequent analysis of other specific components by prescribed techniques. The test applies to vehicles equipped with catalytic or direct flame afterburners, other control systems or to uncontrolled vehicles and engines. All test phases are conducted with an ambi- ent temperature range between 00' and 86' F. (b) The exhaust cmlssion test is de- signed to determine hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen mas emissions while simulating an average trip in an urban area of 7.5 miles. The test consists of engine startups and Veld- FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 39, NO. 205-TUESDAY, OCTOBER 22, 197437616 RULES AND REGULATIONS le operation on a chassis dynamometer through a specified driving schedule, as described in Appendix I to this part. Us- ing a constant volume (variable dilution) sampler, a proportional part of the -diluted exhaust gas is analyzed continu- ously for-hydrocarbons and an additional proportional part of the diluted exhaust gas is collected in a bag for subsequent analysis of the other components. (c) Except for component malfunction or failure, all emission control systems installed on or incorporated in a new motor vehicle shall be functioning dur- ing all procedures in this subpart. Com- ponent malfunction or failure shall be repaired in accordance with \u00a7 85.376-6.\u00a7 85.376-10 Diesel fuel specifications. (a) The diesel fuels employed for test- ing shall be clean and bright, with pour and cloud points adequate for operabil- ity. The fuels may contain nonmetallic improver, persant.

(e) The specification range of the fuels to be used under paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section shall be re- ported in accordance with \u00a7 85.376- 2(b) (3). \u00a7 85.376-11 Vehicle preconditioning. Vehicles to be tested for compliance with the exhaust -emission standards of this part shall be preconditioned as follows:(a) The fuel tank of the test vehicle shall be drained and charged with the specified test fuel, \u00a7 85.376-10(b), to the prescribed \"tank fuel volumeY defined in \u00a7 85.302. The vehicle manufacturer shall provide additional fittings and adapters, as required to accommodate a fuel draih. at the lowest point possible in the tank as installed on the vehicle. Test fuel, when charged to the tank shall be at ambient temperature, \u00a7 85.376-9(a). (b) The test vehicle shall be placed on the dynamometer and operated over a simulated trip, according to the appli- cable requirements and procedures of \u00a7\u00a7 85.376-12 to 85.376-17 except that the engine need not be cold when starting the run on the dynamometer and only a single trip of 7.5 miles shall be run. The test vehicle may be used to set dynamometer horsepower, if necessary. (c) The engine and cooling fan shall be stepped uiion completion of the dy- namometer operation and the vehicle permitted to soak either on or off the dynamometer stand for a period of not less than 12 hours prior to the dyna- mometer test.\u00a7 85.376-12 Dynamometer driving schedule. (a) The dynamometer driving sched- ule to be followed consists of a nonrepet- Itive series of Idle, acceleration, cruise, and deceleration modes of various time sequences and rates. The driving sched- ule is defined by a smooth transition through the speed vs. time relationships listed in Appendix I to this part. The time sequence begins upon starting the vehicle according to the startup proce- dure described in \u00a7 85.376-17. (b) The speed tolerance at any given time on the dynamometer driving schedule prescribed in Appendix I to this part or as printed on a driver's aid chart approved by the Administrator ,when conducted to meet the require- ments of 85.376-13, is defined by upper and lower limits. -The upper limit is 2 m.p.h. higher than the highest point on the trace within 1 second of the given time. The lower limit is 2 m.p.h. lower than the lowest point on the trace within 1 second of the given time. Speed varia- tions greater than the tolerances (such as occur %vhen shifting manual transmis- slon vehicles) are acceptable provided they occur for less than 2-seconds on any one occasion. Speeds lower than those prescribed are acceptable provided the vehicles is operated at maximum avail- able power during such occurrences. Further, speed deviations from those prescribed due ot stalling are acceptable: Provided, The provisions of \u00a7 85.376-17 (d) are adhered to. When conducted to meet the requirements of \u00a7 85.376-11, the speed tolerance shall be as specified above, except that the upper and lower limits shall be 4 m.ph. \u00a7 85.376-13 Dynamometer procedure. (a) The dynamometer run consists of two tests, a \"cold\" start test after a mInimum 12 hour soak and a \"hot\" start test with a 10 minute soak between the two tests. Engine startup, operation over the driving schedule, and engine shut- down make a complete cold start test. Engine startup and operation over the first 505 seconds of the driving schedule complete the hot start test. The exhaust emissions are diluted with air to a con- stant volume and a portion is sampled continuously during each test. Diesel hydrocarbons are analyzed continuously, with manual or electronic integration, during each test. The composite (flow integrated) samples collected in bags are analyzed for carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and oxides of nitrogen. A par- allel sample of dilution air is analyzed for hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen. (b) During dynamometer operation, a fixed speed cooling fan shall be posi- tioned so as to direct cooling air to the vehicle in an appropriate manner with the engine compartment cover open.

(i) Attach the NOIN3 zUpply (150-250 \"p.p.m.) at C2, the Oj supply at C1 and the analyzer Inlet connection to the efficiency detector at C3. If lower concentrations of NO are used, air may be used in place of 02 to facilitate better control of the NOj generated during step (iv). (i) With the efficiency detector variao off, place the NO converter n bypa\"s :mode and close valve V3. Open vealve MV2 until sufficient flow and stable readings are obtained at the analyzer. Zero and span the analyzer output to indicate the value of the NO concentration being used. Record this concentration. (Ill) Open valve V3 (on/off flow control solenoid valve for 0.) and adjust valve MV1 (0. supply metering valve) to blend enough O to lower the NO concentration (ii) about 10 percent. Record this concentration. (iv) Turn on the ozonator and Increase its supply voltage until the NO concen- tration of (i) is reduced to about 20 percent of (ii). NO2 is now being formed from the NO+Na reaction. There must always be at least 10 percent unreacted NO at this point. Record this concen- tration.

EQUATION2 B %Eff.=[1+ T(]-vJ X100% The efficiency of the converter should be greater than 90 percent. Adjusting the converter temperature may be needed to maximize the efficiency. Although steps (ii) and (vii) are not used in the calcu- lations, their values should be recorded to-complete the data set for the test sequence. This procedure does not de- pend on the amount of NO2 in the span gas nor the equivalence of flows In the bypass and converter modes; however, to be consistent with good operating prac- tice, flows should be nominally the same, and the NO2 concentration should be less than 5 percent of the NOx span con- centration. Efficiency checks should be made at a frequency (daily to weekly) consistent with good quality assurance provisions. (7) Check the efficiency of the sample conditioning system, if used, by the fol- lowing procedure; (i) Zero and span the CO instrument on its most sensitive scale. (ii) Recheck zero. (iii) Bubble a mixture of 3% CO2 in N through water at room temperature (68'-86' F.), through the conditioning column into the CO instrument. If the response meets the criteria-of \u00a7 85.376- 18(c) (11), then the conditioning column is functioning acceptably. If the response is higher than the specified limit, a new 'conditioning column should be installed and the test repeated. (iv) Sample conditioining systems should be checked at a frequency con- sistent with observed column life or when the indicator of the column packing be- gins to show deterioration. (b) HC, CO, CO, and NO. measure-. ment: Allow HC analyzer sample line and filter to heat to set point \u00b1100 F (between 300 and3 90 ' F), and allow a minimum of 20 ninutes warmup for the HC analyzer electronics and 2 hours for the CO, CO. and NO, analyzers. (Power is normally left on infrared and chem- iluminescence analyzers; but when not in use, the chopper motors of the infra- red analyzers are turned off and the phototube high voltage supply of the chemiluminescence analyzer is placed in the standby position.) The following se- quence of operations should be per- formed in conjunction with each series of measurements: (1) Zero the analyzers. Obtain a stable zero on each amplifier meter and re- corder. Recheck after tests.. (2) Introduce span gases and set the CO and CO2 analyzer gains, the HC an- alyzer sample capillary flow rate and electronic gain control, if provided, and the NO, analyzer high voltage supply or amplifier gain to match the calibration curves. In order to avoid corrections, span and calibrate at the same flow rates used to analyze the test samples. Spangases should have concentrations equal to approximately 80 percent of full scale. If gain has shifted significantly on the CO or CO, analyzers, check tuning. If necessary, check calibration. Recheck after test. Show actual concentrations on chart. (3) Check zeros; repeat the procedure in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section if required. (4) Check flow rates and pressures. (5) Continuously record (and inte- grate electronically, if desired) dilute hydrocarbon emission levels during test. (6) Measure CO, COs, and NO, con- centrations of samples. Care should be exercised to prevent moisture from con- densing in the sample collection bag. (7) Check zero and span points.

(a) The vehicle shall be allowed to stand with the engine turned off for a period of not less than 12 hours before the cold start exhaust emission test. The vehicle shall be stored prior to the emis- sion tests in such a manner that preclDl- tation (e.g. rain or dew) does not occur on the vehicle. The complete dynamom- eter test consists of a cold start drive of 7.5 miles and simulates a hot start drive of 7.5 miles. The vehicle is allowed to stand on the dynamometer during the 10-minute time period between the cold and hot start tests. The cold start test is divided into two periods. The first period, representing the cold start \"transient\" phase, terminates at the end of the deceleration which is scheduled to occur at 505 seconds of the driving schedule. The second period, represent- ing the \"stabilized\" phase, consists of the remainder of the driving schedule including engine shutdown. The hot start test similarly consists of two periods. The first period, representing the hot start \"transient\" phase, terminates at the same point in the driving schedule as the first phase of the cold start test. The second period of the hot start test, \"stabilized\" phase is assumed to be identical to the second period of the cold start test. Therefore, the hot start test terminates after the first period (505 seconds) is run. (b) The following steps shall be taken for each test: (1) Place drive wheels of vehicle on dynamometer without starting engine. (2) Open the vehicle engine compart- ment cover and start the cooling fan. (3) With the sample solenoid valves in the \"dump\" position connect evacu- ated sample collection bags to the two dilute exhaust sample connectors and to the two dilution air sample line connectors. (4) Start the positive displacement pump, the sample pumps, the tempera- ture recorder, and the heated hydrocar- bon analysis recorder. (The constant volume sampler heat exchanger, the hy- drocarbon analyzer continuous sample line and filter should be preheated totheir respective operating temperatures before the test begins.)

(4) (a) The exhaust emission standards in \u00a7 85.376-1 apply to the emissions of vehicles for their useful life. (b) Since it is expected that emission control efficiency will change with mile- age accumulation on the vehicle, the emission level of a vehicle which has accumulated 50,000 miles will be used as the basis for determining compliance with the standards. (c) The procedure for determining compliance of a new light duty motor vehicle with exhaust emission standards is as follows: (1) Separate emission deterioration factors shall be determined from the emissions results of the durability data vehicles for each engine-system combina- tion. A separate factor shall be estab- lished for exhaust HC, exhaust CO, and exhaust NO=. (I) The applicable results to be used In determining the deterioration factors for each combination shall be: (a) All valid emission data from the tests required under \u00a7 85.376-7(b), ex-cept the zero mile tests. This shall include the official test results as deter- mined In \u00a7 85.376-29 for all tests con- ducted on all durability vehicles of the combination selected under \u00a7 85.376-5(c) (including all vehicles elected to be op- erated by the manufacturer under \u00a7 85.- 376-5(c) (3)). (b) All em Ion data from the tests conducted before and after the mainte- ance provided in \u00a7 85.376-(a) (1) (1). (c) All emission data from tests re- quired by maintenance approved under \u00a7 85.376-6(a) (1) (vi) In those cases where the Administrator conditioned his ap- proval for the performance of such maintenance on the inclusion of such data in the deterioration factor calcu- lation. (ii) All applicable results shall be plotted as a function of the mileage on the system, rounded.to the nearest mile. and the best fit straight lines, fitted by the method of least squares, shall be drawn through these data points. The interpolated 5,000 and 50,000 mile points on this line must be within the standards provided n \u00a7 85.376-1 or the data will not be acceptable for use in calculation of a deterioration factor. FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 39, NO. 20S--TUESDAY, OCTOBER 22, 1974 37626 RULES AND REGULATIONS ('lI) An exhaust emission deterioration factor shall be calculated for each combination as follows: exhaust emissions interpolated to 50,000 miles factor= exhaust emissions Interpolated to 5,000 miles. These interpolated values shall be car- ried out to a minimum of four decimal points to the right before dividing one by the other to determine the deterio- ration factor. The results shall be rounded to three places to the right of the decimal point in accordance with ASTM E 29-67. (2) The exhaust emission test results for each emission data vehicle shall be multiplied by the appropriate deteriora- tion factor: Provided, That if a deterio- ration factor as compared in subpara- graph (1) (iii) of this paragraph is less than one, that deterioration factor shall be one for the purposes of this sub- paragraph. (3) The emissions to compare with the standard shall be the adjusted emissions of paragraph (c) (2) for each emission data vehicle. Before any emission value is compared to the standard, it shall be rounded, in accordance with ASTM E 29-67, to two significant figures. The rounded emission values shall not exceed the standard. (4) Every test vehicle of an engine family must comply with all applicable standards, as determined in paragraph (c) (3) of this section, before any vehicle of that family may be certified. ' \u00a7 85.376-29 Testing by the Administra- tor. (a) The Administrator may require that any one or more of the test vehicles be submitted to him, at such place or places as he may designate, for the pur- pose of conducting emissioL_, tests. The Administrator may specify that he will conduct such testing at the manufac- turer's facility, in which case instrumen- tation and equipment specified by the Administrator shall be made available by the manufacturer for test operations. Any testing conducted at a manufac- turer's facility pursuant to this Para- graph shall be scheduled by the manu- facturer as promptly as possible. (b) (1) Whenever the Administrator conducts a test on a test vehicle, the results of that test shall comprise-the official data for the vehicle at that pre- scribed test point and the manufacturer's data for that prescribed test point shall not be used in determining compliance with emission standards. (2) Whenever the Administrator does not conduct a test on a test vehicle at a test point, the manufacturer's test data will be accepted as the official data for that test point: Provided, That if the Administrator makes a determination based on testing under paragraph (a) of this section, that there is a lack of corre- lation between the manufacturer's test equipment and the test equipment used by the Administrator, no manufacturer's test data will be accepted for purposes of certification until the reasons for the lack of correlation are determined and the validity of the data is established bythe manufacturer: And further provided, That if the Administrator has reasonable basis to believe that any test data sub- mitted by the manufacturer is not accu- rate or has been obtained in violation of any provisions of this part, the Adminis- trator may refuse to accept that'data as the official data pending retesting or sub- mission of further information. (3) (i) The emission data vehicle pre- sented to the Administrator for testing shall be calibrated within the production tolerances applicable to the manufac- turer's specifications to be shown on the vehicle label (see \u00a7 85.376-35(a) (4) (iv)) as specified in the application for certifi- cation. If the Administrator determines that a vehicle is not within such toler- ances, the vehicle shall be adjusted, at the facility designated by the Adminis- trator, prior to the test and an engineer- ing report shall be submitted to the Administrator describing the corrective action taken. Based on the engineering report, the Administrator will determine if the vehicle shall be used as an emis- sion data vehicle. (it) If the Administrator determines that the test data developed under para- graph (b) (3) (i) of this section would cause an emission data vehicle to fail due to excessive 4,000 mile emissions or by application of the appropriate deteri- oration factor, then the following proce- dure shall be observed: (a) The manufacturer may request a retest. Before the retest, the vehicle may be readjusted to manufacturer's specifi- cations, if these adjustments were made incorrectly prior to the first test, and parts may be replaced in accordance with \u00a7 85.376-6. All work on the vehicle shall be done at such location and under such conditions as the Administrator may prescribe. (b) The vehicle will be retested by the Administrator and the results of this test shall comprise the official data for that prescribed test point. (4) If sufficient durability data are not available, at the time of any emission test conducted under paragraph (a) of this section, to enable the Administrator to determine whether an emission data vehicle would fail, the manufacturer may request a retest in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) (3) (i) (a) and (b) of this section. If the manu-facturer does not promptly make such request, he shall be deemed to have waived the right to a retest. A request for retest must be made before the man- ufacturer removes the vehicle from the test premises. \u00a7 85.376-30 Certification. (a) (1) If, after a review of the test reports and data submitted by the manu- facturer and data derived from any ad- ditional testing conducted pursuant to \u00a7 85.376-29, the Administrator deter- mines that a test vehicle(s) conforms tothe regulations of this subpart, he Nil issue a certificate of conformity with re- spect to such vehicle. The certificate will state which vehicles are certified for sale at high altitude. (2) Such certificate will be issued for such period not to exceed one model year as the Administrator may determine and upon such terms as he may deem ncce,- sary to assure that any new motor ve- hicle covered by the certificate will meet the requirements of the Act and of this subpart. Each such certificate shall con- tain the following language: This certificate covers only theo now motor vehicles which conform, in all mate- rial respects, to the design specifieationo that applied to thozo vehicles dezerlbcd In the application for certification and which aro produced during the ---- mbdol year produc- tion poriou of tho raid manufacturer, as do- fined n 40 O; 85.302 (a) (3). It is a term of this certificate that the manufacturer shall coent to all Iupectiono described In 40 Cvn 85,306 (0) which concern either the vehicle certified, or any production vehicle covered by this certificate, or any pro- duction vehicle which when completed will be claimed to be covered by this certificate. Failure ot comply with all the requirements of \u00a7 85.306(c) with respect to any such ve- hicle may lead to revocation or suponion of this certificate as specified In 40 O1M 85.376(c). It Is also a term of this certlfl- cate that this certificato may be rovoled or suspended for the other reason stated in 85.376-0(c). (b) (1) The Administrator will deter- mine whether a vehicle covered by the application complies with applicable standards by observing the following re- lationships: (I) A test vehicle selected under \u00a7 85.376-5(b) (2) or (4) shall represent all vehicles In the same engine family of the same engine displacement-exhauit emission control system combination. (11) A test vehicle selected under \u00a7 85.376-5(b) (3) shall represent all vehicles in the same engine family of the same engine displacement-exhautst emis- sion control system-transmission type- fuel system combination. (ill) A test vehicle selected under \u00a7 85.376-5(c) (1) shall represent all vehi- cles of the same engine-system combination. (2) The Administrator will proceed as in paragraph (a) of this section with re- spect to the vehicles belonging to an engine family all of which comply with applicable standards. (3) If, after a review of the test re- ports and data submitted by the manu- facturer, iata derived from any addi- tional testing conducted pursuant to \u00a7 85.175-29, data or Information derivedfrom any nspection carried out under \u00a7 85.106(c), or any other pertinent data or Information, the Administrator deter- mines that one or more test vehicles of the certification test fleet do not meet applicable standards, he wil notify the manufacturer in writing, setting forth the basis for his determination, (4) The manufacturer may, at his option, proceed with any of the following alternatives with respect to any engine family represented by a test vehlclo(s) determined not in compliance with ap- plicable standards: - FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 39, NO. 205-TUESDAY, OCTOBER 22, 1974 RULES AND REGULATIONS (I) Request a hearing under \u00a7 85.305, or (ii) Delete from the application for certification the vehicles represented by the failing test vehicle. (Vehicles so de- leted may be included in a later request for certification under \u00a7 85.376-32.) The Administrator will then select in plbce of each failing ve]cle an alternate vehicle chosen in accordance with selection criteria employed in selecting the vehicle that failed, or (ii) Modify the test vehicle and dem- onstrate by testing that it meets appli- cable standards. Another vehicle which- is in all material respects the same as the first vehicle, as modified, shall then be operated and tested in accordance with applicable test procedures. (5) If the manufacturer does not re- quest a hearing or present the required data under paragraph (b) (4) of this section, the Administrator will deny certification. (c) (1) Notwithstanding the fact that any certification vehicle(s) may comply with other provisions of this subpart, the Administrator miy withhold or deny the issuance of a certificate, of conformity (or suspend or revoke any such certifi- cate which has been issued) with respect to any suchvehicle(s) if: (i) The manufacturer submits false or incomplete information in his appli- cation for certification thereof; or (ii) The manufacturer renders inac- - curate or invalid any test data which he submits pertaining thereto or otherwise circumvents the intent of the Act. or of this subpart with respect to such ve- hicle; or (iii) Any EPA Enforcement Officer is denied access on the terms specified in \u00a7 85.306(c) to any facility or portion thereof which contains any of the following: (A) The vehicle, or (B) Any components used or consid- ered for use in its modification or build- up into a ceritfication vehicle, or (C) Any production vehicle which is or will be claimed by the manufacturer to be covered by the certificate, or (D) Any step in the conastruction of a vehicle described in paragraph (c) (1) (iii) (C) of this section, or (E) Any records, documents, reports and histories required by this part to be kept concerning any of the above. (iv) Any EPA Enforcement Officer is denied \"reasonable asistance\" (as de- fined it \u00a7 85.306(c) of the -items listed in paragraph (c)(1) (iii) of this section. (2) The sanctions of withholding, denying, revoking, or suspending of a certificate may be imposed for the rea- sons in paragraphs (c) (1) (i), (!i), (1i), or (iv) of this section only -when the in- fraction is substantial. (3) In any case in which a manufac- turer knowingly submits false or inac- curate information or knowingly renders inaccurate or invalid any test data or commits any other fraudulent acts and such acts contribute substantially to the Administrator's decision to issue a cer-tifieate of conformity, the Administrator may deem such certificate void ab InItio. (4) In any case in which certification of a vehicle is proposed to be withheld, denied, revoked, or suspended under paragraph (c) (1) (111), or (c) (1) (iv) of this section, and in which the Adminis- trator has presented to the manufac- turer involved reasonable evidence that a violation of \u00a7 85.306(c) In fact oc- curred, the manufacturer, if he wishes to contend that,'eyen though the viola- tion occurred, the vehicle in question was not involved in the violation to a degree that would warrant withholding, denial; revocation, or suspension of certification under either paragraph (c) (1) (ii) or (c) (1) (iv) of this section, shall have the burden of establishing that contention to the satisfaction of the Administrator. (5) Any revocation or suspension of certification under paragraph (c) (1) of this section shall: (I) Be made only after the manufac- turer concernde has been offered an op- portunity for a bearing conducted in accordance with \u00a7 85.306(c) hereof. (1i) Extend no further than to forbid the \"ntroduotion into comerce of ve- hicles previously covered by the certifi- cationwhich are still In the hands of the manufacturer, except in cases of such fraud or other misconduct as makes the certification invalid ab Initio. (6) The manufacturer may request in the form and manner specified in para- graph (b) (3) of this section that any determination made by the Administra- tor under paragraph (c) (1) of this sec- tion to withhold or deny certification be reviewed in a hearing conducted in ac- cordance with \u00a7 85.305. If hte Adminis- trator finds, after a review of the request and supporting data, that the request raises a substantial factual issue, he shall grant the request with respect to such Issue. \u00a7 85.376-31 Separate certification. Where possible a manufacturer should include in a single application for certifi- cation all vehicles for which certification is required. A manufacturer may, how- ever, choose to apply separately for cer- tification of part of his product line. The selection of test vehicles and the compu- tation of test results will be determined separately for each application. \u00a7 85.376-32 Addition of a vehicle after certification. (a) If a manufacturer proposes to add to his product line a vehicle of the same engine-system combination as vehicles previously certified but which was not described in the application for certifica- tion when the test vehicle(s) represent- Ing other vehicles of that combination was certified, he shall notify the Admin- istrator. Such notification shall be in ad- vance of the addition unless the manu- facturer elects to follow the procedure described in \u00a7 85.376-34. This notificaion shall include a full description of the vehicle to be added. (b) The Administrator may require the manufacturer to perform such tests on the test vehicle(s) representing thevehicle to be added which would have been required if the vehicle had been Included in the original application for certification. (c) If, after a review of the test re- ports and data submitted by the manu- facturer, and data derived from any testing conducted under \u00a7 85.376-29, the Administrator determines that the test vehicle(s) meets all applicable stand- ards, the appropriate certificate will be amended accordingly. If the Administra- tor determines that the test vehicle(s) does not meet applicable standards, he will proceed under \u00a7 85.376-30(b). \u00a7 85.376-33 Changes to a vehicle cov- ered by certification. (a) The manufacturer shall notify the Administrator of any change in produc- tion vehicles In respect to any of the parameters listed in \u00a7 85.376-5(a) (3) or \u00a7 85.376-5 (b) (3), giving a full description of the change. Such notification shall be in advance of the change unless the manufacturer elects to follow the pro- cedure described in \u00a7 85.376-34. (b) Based upon the description of the change, and data derived from such test- ing as the Administrator may require or conduct, the Administrator will deter- mine whether the vehicle, as modified, would still be covered by the certificate of conformity then in effect. (c) If the Administrator determines that the outstanding certificate would cover the modified vehicles, he will notify the manufacturer In writing. Except as provided in \u00a7 85.376-34, the change may not be put into effect prior to the manu- facturer's receiving this notification. If the Administrator determines that the modified vehicles would not be covered by the certificate then in effect, then the modified vehicles shall be treated as ad- ditions to thi product line subject to \u00a7 85.376-32. \u00a7 85.376-34 Alternative procedure for notification of additions and changes. (a) A manufacturer may, in lieu of notifying the Administrator in advance of an addition of a vehicle under \u00a7 85.- 376--32 or a change in a vehicle under \u00a7 85.376-33, notify him concurrently with the making of the change if the manu- facturer believes the addition or change will not require any testing under the appropriate section. Upon notification to the Administrator, the manufacturer may proceed to put the addition or change into effect. (b) The manufacturer may continue to produce vehicles as described in the notification to the Administrator for a maximum of 30 days, unless the Admin- istrator grants an extension in writing. This period may be shortened by a notifi- cation in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. (c) If the Administrator determines, based upon a description of the addition or change, that no test data will be re- quired, he will notify the manufacturer in writing of the acceptability of the ad- dition or change. If the Administrator determines that test data will be required, he will notify the manufacturer to re- 7- FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL 39, NO. 205-TUESDAY, OCTOBER 22, 19743-769-7 RULES AND REGULATIONS scind the change within 5 days of receipt of the notification. The Administrator will then proceed as in \u00a7 85.376-32 (b) and (c), or \u00a7 85.376-33 (b) and (c) as appropriate. (d) Election to produce vehicles under this section will be deemed to be a con- sent to recall all vehicles which the Ad- ministrator determines under \u00a7 85.376- 32(c) do not meet applicable standards, and to cause such nonconformity to be remedied at no expense to the owner. \u00a7 85.376-35 Labeling. (a) (1) The manufacturer of any light duty motor vehicle subject to the stand- ards prescribed in \u00a7 85.376-1 shall, at the time of manufacture, afx a permanent, legible label, of the type and in the man- ner described below, containing the in- formation hereinafter provided, to all production models of such vehicles avail- able for sale to the public and covered by .a certificate of conformity under \u00a7 85.376-30(a). (2) A plastic or metal label shall be welded, riveted, or otherwise per- manently attached in a readily visible position in the engine compartment. (3) The label shall be afxed by the vehicle manufacturer, who has been is- sued the certificate of conformity for such vehicle, in such a manner that it cannot be removed without destroying or defacing the label, and shall not be af- fixed to any equipment which is easily detached from such vehicle. - (4) The label shall contain the follow- ing information lettered in the English language in block letters and numerals, which shall be of a color that contrasts with the background of the label: (I) The label heading: Vehicle Emis- sion Control Faull corporate name and trade- mark of manufacturer; (Ill) Engine displacement (in cubic inches) and engine family identification; (iv) Engine tuneup specifications and adjustments, as recommended by themanufacturer, including, but not limited to, low and high idle speeds, initial in- jection timing, and valve lash, as well as other parameters deemed necessary by the manufacturer. These specifications should indicate the proper transmission position during tuneup and what acces- sories (e.g., air-conditioner), if any, should be in operation; (v) The statement: \"This Vehicle Conforms to U.S.E.P.A.
