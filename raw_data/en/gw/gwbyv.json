[Factors associated with intention for revaccination among patients with adverse events following immunization.](/articles/cmedm__37666696) Sadarangani M, Bettinger JA, Tapi\u00e9ro B, Morris SK, McConnell A, Noya F, Halperin SA, and Top KA Vaccine[Vaccine] 2023 Sep 02. Date of Electronic Publication: 2023 Sep 02. - Abstract - Objectives: Individuals and healthcare providers may be uncertain about the safety of revaccination after an adverse event following immunization (AEFI). We identified factors associated with physician recommendation for revaccination and participant intention to be revaccinated among patients with adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) assessed in the Canadian Special Immunization Clinic (SIC) Network from 2013 to 2019. Methods: This prospective observational study included patients assessed in the Canadian Special Immunization Clinic Network from 2013 to 2019 for an AEFI who required additional doses of the vaccine temporally associated with their AEFI. Participants underwent standardized assessment and data collection. Physician recommendations regarding revaccination and participant intent for revaccination were recorded. AEFI impact on daily activities and need for medical attention was captured as low, moderate, high impact and serious (e.g., requiring hospitalization). Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified factors associated with physician recommendation and participant intention for revaccination, controlling for province of assessment. Results: Physician recommendation was significantly associated with the type of AEFI and AEFI impact. Compared to large local reaction, physician recommendation for revaccination was reduced for immediate hypersensitivity (aOR: 0.24 [95% CI: 0.04-0.69). Compared to low impact AEFIs, was reduced for moderate (aOR: for revaccination was significantly associated with AEFI impact, with reduced odds for high versus low impact AEFIs (aOR: 0.12 [95% CI: 0.04-0.42]). Conclusion: Physicians appear to use AEFI type and impact to guide recommendations while patients use primarily AEFI impact to form intentions for revaccination. The findings may help inform counselling for patients with AEFIs.

[Immunological effects and safety of live rotavirus vaccination after antenatal exposure to immunomodulatory biologic agents: a prospective cohort study from the Canadian Immunization Research Network.](/articles/cmedm__37390832) [2023] - Fitzpatrick T, Alsager K, T, Vanderkooi OG, Top KA, and Constantinescu C The Lancet.

However, concerns regarding potential immunosuppression in infants exposed to biologic agents have led to recommendations to avoid live vaccines in the first 6-12 months of life. We aimed to examine whether live rotavirus vaccine could be administered safely to infants exposed to biologic agents, assessed in the Canadian Special Immunization Clinic (SIC) Network. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, infants exposed to biologic agents in utero were referred to one of six SIC sites in Canada for rotavirus vaccination recommendations. Children with other contraindications to rotavirus vaccination or older than 15 weeks were excluded. Clinical and laboratory evaluations were conducted according to a standard clinical pathway. Data were collected for relevant medical history, pregnancy outcomes, biologic agent exposure history, physical examination, laboratory results of the child, SIC recommendations for rotavirus vaccination, rotavirus vaccine series completion, and adverse events after immunisation. After parental consent, deidentified data were transferred to a central database for analysis. Children recommended for rotavirus vaccination were followed up for 8 months after series initiation to ascertain severe and serious adverse events, including severe diarrhoea, vomiting, and intussusception. Findings: Between May 1, 2017, and Dec 31, 2021, 202 infants were assessed and 191 eligible infants were enrolled (97 [51%] were female and 94 [49%] were male). When including those exposed to multiple agents, the most common biologic agents to which infants were exposed were infliximab (67 [35%] of 191), adalimumab (17 [9%]). Biologic agent exposure continued into the third trimester for 178 (93%) infants. No clinically significant abnormalities in lymphocyte subsets, quantitative immunoglobulins, or mitogen responses were detected. After SIC assessment, rotavirus vaccination was recommended for 187 (98%) of 191 infants, all of whom were followed up. By end of follow-up on Aug 19, 2022, 168 (90%) infants had initiated rotavirus vaccination; 150 (80%) completed the series. No serious adverse events after immunisation were reported, but three (2%) infants required medical attention, one for vomiting and change in stools who was subsequently diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease, one for rash on labia unrelated to vaccination, and one for vomiting and diarrhoea associated with a milk allergy. Interpretation: Findings from this study suggest that lymphocyte subsets and the safety of live rotavirus vaccination are generally not affected by in-utero exposure to biologic agents. Rotavirus vaccination can be offered to infants exposed to anti-TNF agents in utero.

Date of Electronic Publication: 2023 Jun 13. - Abstract - This study aimed to synthesize the available evidence on the immunogenicity, safety, and effectiveness of live-attenuated varicella vaccine in solid organ transplant recipients. Medline and EMBASE were searched using predefined search terms to identify relevant studies. The included articles reported varicella vaccine administration in the posttransplant period in children and adults. A pooled proportion of transplant recipients who seroconverted and who developed vaccine-strain varicella and varicella disease was generated. Eighteen articles (14 observational studies and 4 case reports) were included, reporting on 711 transplant recipients who received the varicella vaccine. The pooled proportion was 88.2% (95% confidence interval 78.0%-96.0%, 13 studies) for 0.8% (0%-4.9%, 9 studies) for varicella disease. Most studies followed clinical guidelines for administering live-attenuated vaccines, with criteria that could include being at least 1 year posttransplant, 2 months postrejection episode, and on low-dose immunosuppressive medications. Varicella vaccination in transplant recipients was overall safe in the included studies, with few cases of vaccine-strain-induced varicella or vaccine failure, and although it was immunogenic, the proportion of recipients who seroconverted was lower than that seen in the general population. Our data support varicella vaccination in select pediatric solid organ transplant recipients.

[Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome and role of SARS-CoV-2 linkage.](/articles/cmedm__37277605) [2023] - El Tal T, Morin MP, Morris SK, Farrar DS, Berard RA, Kakkar F, Moore Hepburn Beaufils Bennett Benseler Finzi A, S, Giroux R, Kang KT, King M, TM, McCrindle Orkin J, Papenburg JP, Purewal R, Sadarangani M, Salvadori MI, Thibeault R, Top KA, Viel-Th\u00e9riault I, Haddad E, Scuccimarri R, and Yeung RSM Pediatric research[Pediatr Res] 2023 Jun 05. Date of Electronic Publication: 2023 Jun 05. - Abstract - Background: Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS) is a rare condition temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using national surveillance data, we compare presenting features and outcomes among children hospitalized with PIMS by SARS-CoV-2 linkage, and identify risk factors for intensive care (ICU). Methods: Cases were reported to the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program by a network of >2800 pediatricians between March 2020 and May 2021. Patients with positive versus negative SARS-CoV-2 linkages were compared, with positive linkage defined as any positive molecular or serologic test or close contact with confirmed COVID-19. ICU risk factors were identified with multivariable modified Poisson regression. Results: We identified 406 children hospitalized with PIMS, including 49.8% with positive SARS-CoV-2 linkages, 26.1% with negative linkages, and 24.1% with unknown linkages. The median age was 5.4 years (IQR 2.5-9.8), 60% were male, and 83% had no comorbidities. Compared to cases with negative linkages, children with positive linkages experienced more cardiac involvement (58.8% vs. 37.4%; p < 0.001), gastrointestinal symptoms (88.6% p 0.001), and shock (60.9% vs. 16.0%; p < 0.001). Children aged 6 years and those with positive linkages were more likely to require ICU. Conclusions: Although rare, 30% of PIMS hospitalizations required ICU or respiratory/hemodynamic support, particularly those with positive SARS-CoV-2 linkages. Impact: We describe 406 children hospitalized with paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS) using nationwide surveillance data, the largest study of PIMS in Canada to date. Our surveillance case definition of PIMS did not require a history of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, and we therefore describe associations of SARS-CoV-2 linkages on clinical features and outcomes of children with PIMS. Children with positive SARS-CoV-2 linkages were older, had more gastrointestinal and cardiac involvement, and hyperinflammatory laboratory picture. Although PIMS is rare, one-third required admission to intensive care, with the greatest risk amongst those aged 6 years and those with a SARS-CoV-2 linkage. (\u00a9 2023.

Date of Electronic Publication: 2022 Aug 29. - Subjects - Humans, Child, SARS-CoV-2, Canada, Disease Progression, Oxygen, and COVID-19 - Abstract - Purpose: The objective of this study was to describe the clinical course and outcomes in children with technology dependence (TD) hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Seventeen pediatric hospitals (15 Canadian and one each in Iran and Costa Rica) included children up to 17 years of age admitted February 1, 2020, through May 31, 2021, with detection of SARS-CoV-2. For those with TD, data were collected on demographics, clinical course and outcome. Results: Of 691 children entered in the database, 42 (6%) had TD of which 22 had feeding tube dependence only, 9 were on supplemental oxygen only, 3 had feeding tube dependence and were on supplemental oxygen, 2 had a tracheostomy but were not ventilated, 4 were on non-invasive ventilation, and 2 were on mechanical ventilation prior to admission. Three of 42 had incidental SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two with end-stage underlying conditions were transitioned to comfort care and died. Sixteen (43%) of the remaining 37 cases required increased respiratory support from baseline due to COVID-19 while 21 (57%) did not. All survivors were discharged home. Conclusion: Children with TD appear to have an increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalization. However, in the absence of end-stage chronic conditions, all survived to discharge. (\u00a9 2022.

This is a revision of the 2007 BC case definition for anaphylaxis. Recently, the BC definition has been widely used for evaluating reports of suspected anaphylaxis following COVID-19 vaccination. This has led to debate about the performance of the BC definition in comparison with those from the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Food Allergy Anaphylaxis Network (NIAID/FAAN) and the World Allergy Organization (WAO). BC convened an expert working group to revise the case definition based on their usual process of literature review and expert consensus. This manuscript presents the outcome of this process and proposes a revised case definition for anaphylaxis. Major and minor criteria have been re-evaluated with an emphasis on the reporting of observable clinical signs, rather than subjective symptoms, and a clearer approach to the ascertainment of levels of certainty is provided. The BC case definition has also been aligned with other contemporary and international case definitions for anaphylaxis.

This prospective, multicenter, active-surveillance cohort study examined the short-term safety of COVID-19 vaccines in adults with a prior history of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Canadian adults vaccinated between 22 December 2020 and 27 November 2021 were sent an electronic questionnaire 7 days post-dose 1, dose 2, and dose 3 vaccination. The main outcome was health events occurring in the first 7 days after each vaccination that prevented daily activities, resulted in work absenteeism, or required a medical consultation, including hospitalization. Results: Among 684 998 vaccinated individuals, 2.6% (18 127/684 998) reported a prior history of SARS-CoV-2 infection a median of 4 (interquartile range: 2-6) months previously. After dose 1, individuals with moderate (bedridden) to severe (hospitalized) COVID-19 who received BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, or ChAdox1-S vaccines had higher odds of a health event preventing daily activities, resulting in work absenteeism or requiring medical consultation (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: for ChAdox1-S compared with no infection). Following dose 2 and 3, the greater risk associated with previous infection was also present but was attenuated compared with dose 1. For all doses, the association was lower or absent after mild or asymptomatic infection. Conclusions: Adults with moderate or severe previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were more likely to have a health event sufficient to impact routine activities or require medical assessment in the week following each vaccine dose.

Prelicensure clinical trials are limited in their ability to detect rare AEFIs that may occur in less than one per thousand individuals. While postmarketing surveillance systems have shown COVID-19 mRNA vaccines to be safe, they led to the identification of rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination that were not initially detected in clinical trials. In this narrative review, we highlight concepts of vaccine pharmacovigilance during mass vaccination campaigns and compare the approaches used in the context of myocarditis and pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination to historical examples. We describe mechanisms of passive and active surveillance, their strengths and limitations, and how they interacted to identify and characterize the safety signal of myocarditis and pericarditis after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. Articles were synthesized from a PubMed search using relevant keywords for articles published on vaccine surveillance systems and myocarditis and pericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination, as well as the authors' collections of relevant publications and grey literature reports. The global experience around the identification and monitoring of myocarditis and pericarditis after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination has provided important lessons for vaccine safety surveillance and highlighted its importance in maintaining public trust in mass vaccination programmes in a pandemic context.

[Vaccine regulation should require and enforce the inclusion of pregnant and breastfeeding women in prelicensure clinical trials.](/articles/cmedm__35880903) Langley JM, McClymont E, MacDonald SE, Top Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics[Hum Vaccin Immunother] 2022 Nov 30; Date of Electronic Publication: 2022 Jul 26. - Subjects - Female, Humans, Infant, Pregnancy, Pandemics prevention control, Pregnant Women, Vaccination, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, COVID-19 prevention control, and COVID-19 Vaccines - Abstract - Exclusion of pregnant and breastfeeding women from the pivotal randomized controlled trials for COVID-19 vaccines that led to emergency regulatory approval created gaps in data needed for vaccine policy, healthcare provider recommendations, and women's decisions about vaccination. We argue that such knowledge gaps increase potential for vaccine hesitancy and misinformation relating to the health of women and infants, and that these gaps in evidence are avoidable. Over several decades, ethical and scientific guidance, scholarship, and advocacy in favor of pregnant and breastfeeding women's participation in clinical development of vaccines has accumulated. Guidance on how to include pregnant and breastfeeding women in vaccine trials ethically and safely predates the COVID-19 pandemic but has yet to be routinely incorporated in vaccine development. We highlight the important role regulatory authorities could play in requiring that pregnant and breastfeeding women be eligible as volunteer participants in prelicensure vaccine trials for products that are expected to be used in this population. Inclusion of pregnant and breastfeeding populations in clinical trials leading to market approval or emergency use authorization should be undertaken early or concurrently at the time of trials in the general population. 17.

The Canadian Immunization Monitoring Program ACTive (IMPACT) conducts active surveillance for KD following immunization across Canada. We characterized KD cases reported to IMPACT between 2013 and 2018. Cases admitted to an IMPACT hospital with a physician diagnosis of complete or incomplete KD with onset 0-42 d following vaccination were reviewed. Cases meeting the Brighton Collaboration case definition (BCCD) levels of diagnostic certainty levels 1 a/b, 2a/b or 3a-e were defined as KD cases. Demographic and vaccination characteristics were compared between KD cases and non-cases. Of 84 cases reviewed, 58 met the BCCD: 47 (81%) cases met level 1a (Complete KD), 8 (14%) met level 1b (Incomplete KD), 2 (3%) met level 2a, and 1 (2%) met level 2c (Probable KD). Median age at admission was 13 months (interquartile range 7-26 months). A median of 9.5 cases were reported per year (range 4-14). Thirty-one (53%) KD cases were temporally associated vaccinations, followed by 21 (36%) cases with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Symptom onset was 0-14 d after vaccination in 32 (55%) cases. Echocardiogram results were available for 43 (74%) cases with 22 reported as abnormal. Age, sex, interval to symptom onset, and vaccines received were similar between KD cases and non-cases. No safety signals were detected in these data. 18.

Date of Electronic Publication: 2022 Aug 07. - Subjects - Child, Humans, Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems, Canada, Vaccination adverse effects, Hypersensitivity etiology, Hypersensitivity, Immediate chemically induced, Immunization adverse effects, Immunization, Secondary adverse effects, and Vaccines adverse effects - Abstract - Objectives: To estimate the risk of recurrence of adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) upon revaccination and to determine among patients with suspected vaccine allergy whether allergy skin test positivity was associated with AEFI recurrence. Study Design: This prospective observational study included patients assessed in the Canadian Special Immunization Clinic Network from 2013 to 2019 with AEFIs who required revaccination with the vaccine temporally associated with their AEFI. Participants underwent standardized assessment and data collection. Special Immunization Clinic physicians used guidelines to inform their recommendations. Participants were followed up after revaccination to capture AEFI recurrences. Data were transferred to a central database for descriptive analysis. Results: Overall, 588 participants were assessed for 627 AEFIs; 570 (91%) AEFIs occurred in children age. AEFIs hypersensitivity to 513 of 588 (87%) participants. Among participants recommended and due for revaccination during the study period, 63% (299/477) was 10% local reactions, and 7% (5/66) for immediate hypersensitivity. No recurrence was serious. Among 92 participants with suspected vaccine allergy who underwent skin testing and were revaccinated, the negative predictive value of skin testing for AEFI recurrence was 96% (95% CI 92.5%-99.5%). Conclusions: Most individuals with AEFIs were safely revaccinated. Among those with suspected vaccine allergy, skin testing may help determine the safety of revaccination.

Infectious diseases[Lancet Infect Dis] 2022 Nov; 22 (11), pp. 1553-1564. Date of Electronic Publication: 2022 Aug 11. - Subjects - Female, Humans, Pregnancy, Cohort Studies, BNT162 Vaccine, SARS-CoV-2, Vaccination adverse effects, Ontario, COVID-19 Vaccines adverse effects, COVID-19 epidemiology, and COVID-19 prevention control - Abstract - Background: Pregnant individuals have been receiving COVID-19 vaccines following pre-authorisation clinical trials in non-pregnant people. This study aimed to determine the frequency and nature of significant health events among pregnant females after COVID-19 vaccination, compared with unvaccinated pregnant controls and vaccinated non-pregnant individuals. Methods: We did an observational cohort study, set in seven Canadian provinces and territories including Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, Alberta, Nova Scotia, Yukon, and Prince Edward Island. Eligibility criteria for vaccinated individuals were a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine within the previous 7 days; an active email address and telephone number; ability to communicate in English or French; and residence in the aforementioned provinces or territories. Study participants were pregnant and non-pregnant females aged 15-49 years. Individuals were able to participate as controls if they were unvaccinated and fulfilled the other criteria. Data were collected primarily by self-reported survey after both vaccine doses, with telephone follow-up for those reporting any medically attended event. Participants reported significant health events (new or worsening of a health event sufficient to cause work or school absenteeism, medical consultation, or prevent daily activities) occurring within 7 days of vaccination or within the past 7 days for unvaccinated individuals. We employed multivariable logistic regression to examine significant health events associated with mRNA vaccines, adjusting for age group, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and trimester, as appropriate. Findings: As of Nov 4, 2021, 191 360 women aged 15-49 years with known pregnancy status had completed the first vaccine dose survey and 94 937 had completed the second dose survey. 180 388 received one dose and 94 262 received a second dose of an mRNA vaccine, with 5597 pregnant participants receiving dose one and 3108 receiving dose two, and 174 765 non-pregnant participants receiving dose one and 91 131 receiving dose two. Of 6179 included unvaccinated control participants, 339 were pregnant and 5840 were not pregnant. Overall, 226 (4\u00b70%) of 5597 vaccinated pregnant females reported a significant health event after dose one of an mRNA vaccine, and 227 (7\u00b73%) of 3108 after dose two, compared with 11 (3\u00b72%) of 339 pregnant unvaccinated females. Pregnant vaccinated females had an increased odds of a significant health event within 7 days of the vaccine after dose two of mRNA-1273 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4\u00b74 [95% CI 2\u00b74-8\u00b73]) compared with pregnant unvaccinated controls within the past 7 days, but not after dose one of mRNA-1273 or any dose of BNT162b2. Pregnant vaccinated females had decreased odds of a significant health event compared with non-pregnant vaccinated females after both dose one (aOR 0\u00b763 [95% CI 0\u00b755-0\u00b772]) and dose two (aOR 0\u00b762 [0\u00b754-0\u00b771]) of any mRNA vaccination. There were no significant differences in any analyses when restricted to events which led to medical attention. Interpretation: COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have a good safety profile in pregnancy. These data can be used to appropriately inform pregnant people regarding reactogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy, and should be considered alongside effectiveness and immunogenicity data to make appropriate recommendations about best use of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy.

Americas[Lancet Reg Health Am] 2022 Nov; Vol. 15, pp. 100337. Date of Electronic Publication: 2022 Aug 01. - Abstract - Background: Children living with chronic comorbid conditions are at increased risk for severe COVID-19, though there is limited evidence regarding the risks associated with specific conditions and which children may benefit from targeted COVID-19 therapies. The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with severe disease among hospitalized children with COVID-19 in Canada. Methods: We conducted a national prospective study on hospitalized children with microbiologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection via the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) from April 2020-May 2021. Cases were reported voluntarily by a network of >2800 paediatricians. Hospitalizations were classified as COVID-19-related, incidental infection, or infection control/social admissions. Severe disease (among COVID-19-related hospitalizations only) was defined as disease requiring intensive care, ventilatory or hemodynamic support, select organ system complications, or death. Risk factors for severe disease were identified using multivariable Poisson regression, adjusting for age, sex, concomitant infections, and timing of hospitalization. Findings: We identified 544 children hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 60\u00b77% with COVID-19-related disease and 39\u00b73% with incidental infection or infection control/social admissions. Among COVID-19-related hospitalizations (n=330), the median age was 1\u00b79 years (IQR 0\u00b71-13\u00b73) and 43\u00b70% had chronic comorbid conditions. Severe disease occurred in 29\u00b77% of COVID-19-related hospitalizations (n=98/330 including 60 admitted to intensive care), most frequently among children aged 2-4 years (48\u00b77%) and 12-17 years (41\u00b73%). Comorbid conditions associated with severe disease included pre-existing technology dependence requirements (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 2\u00b701, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1\u00b737-2\u00b795), (aRR 1\u00b790, 95% CI 1\u00b710-3\u00b728), neurologic conditions (e.g. and select chromosomal/genetic conditions) (aRR 1\u00b784, 95% CI 1\u00b732-2\u00b757), and pulmonary conditions (e.g. bronchopulmonary uncontrolled asthma) (aRR 1\u00b763, 95% CI 1\u00b712-2\u00b739). Interpretation: While severe outcomes were detected at all ages and among patients with and without comorbidities, neurologic and pulmonary conditions as well as technology dependence were associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19. These findings may help guide vaccination programs and prioritize targeted COVID-19 therapies for children.
