CHANCELLOR AND CEO, PALMER COLLEGE OF CHIROPRACTIC The past six months have been a time of change and upheaval and have underscored a comment recently shared by a Board of T rustees member: chiropractors always adjust. I'm so proud of our Palmer College students, faculty, staff and alumni as they've risen to meet the challenges of recent uncertain times. Our students quickly acclimated to online learning in the spring. They used technology to stay connected, study together, read, and learn, and even seized the opportunity to return home and spend extra time checking on family. They're now back on campus and full of energy, and we're thrilled to be around our students again. Our faculty, staff and board leadership worked tirelessly to transition our program from 100% in-person to nearly 100% remote delivery in the span of days. Their creativity and dedication enabled us to continue student learning, research, patient care, and the essential business functions of the organization through this crisis. Their work is not over as we continue to creatively explore and modify past practices to meet current challenges and advance our mission. We are incredibly Palmer proud of our alumni who have continued to serve essential roles in their communities, providing care to those who need it the most. Alumni shared stories of launching telehealth, providing in-home chiropractic visits, and developing educational videos to help their patients in different ways. And as a movement against racial injustice rose in our country, our alumni and campus communities spoke up, calling on our profession to be inclusive as we provide health care to the people around us. Later in this issue, you'll read perspectives from students who aspire to grow our profession by ensuring that chiropractic is accessible and broadly known to individuals of all races, genders and economic backgrounds. As the 125th anniversary of the first adjustment of chiropractic nears, we reflect on the doctors of chiropractic who came before us, each playing their part in growing the profession. It's the story of chiropractic pioneers who solely laid the groundwork for our profession; chiropractors who ventured to introduce chiropractic to a country for the first time; researchers who, for the past 25 years, have used science to demonstrate our art and philosophy; and leaders who continue to give back to the profession year after year. We will not be hosting the in-person campus event we hoped, but I invite everyone to celebrate with us on Friday, September 18 during a virtual celebration of the 125th anniversary of the chiropractic profession, and then September 15-17, 2022 for the 125th anniversary of Palmer College of Chiropractic.

The new academic building will offer a larger anatomy learning environment, optimize learning through a low student-to-faculty ratio, and allow students to study with the best available technology. The new labs will be designed specifically for students to apply what they're learning about movement science and rehabilitation in an ideal, technologically-advanced setting. The $12 million, 33,000 square-foot academic building will feature four high- tech classrooms, four technique rooms, and two anatomage tables, creating space for 130 students. \"Palmer is chiropractic. Here, I know everyone wants me to succeed. We also push one another to be our very best. It's awesome to know my college wants to invest in my future through new academic spaces,\" says Avalon Liscio, Palmer Florida student. When not learning hands-on technique in the classroom, or meeting with their instructors, students will be able to relax and study on the extended patio alongside the pond. There will be a ceremonial groundbreaking in October. A large celebration will take place when the building is completed.Palmer College confronts injustice Palmer students, employees and alumni spoke up about racial injustice following the death of George Floyd. In the weeks that followed, Palmer College leadership listened and worked alongside students to develop steps that can be taken to ensure all students feel welcomed and included in the Palmer community. We're also working with stakeholders and authorities in the area of diversity and inclusion on recommendations.

Now, as the Palmer Center for Chiropractic Research (PCCR) celebrates its 25-year anniversary, she can uniquely reflect on the rise of chiropractic research and its role in advancing the profession. \"Before 1995, Palmer and a number of colleges were conducting chiropractic research, but Palmer's leadership decided to invest more heavily in research to expand and strengthen our work,\" Dr. Long says. \"What's unique about Palmer is that we took the most sustainable approach. Today we can look back and see that chiropractic research has influenced many realms of the profession, from curriculum, to practice, to the rise of multidisciplinary care settings and even policy. Palmer pushed the envelope by collaborating with high-level research institutions outside of chiropractic to grow and expand our research. Today that research is used profession-wide and beyond.\" Dr. Long was hired by then-director Iftikhar Bhatti, Ph.D., under the auspices of The Palmer Institute of Graduate Studies and Research. Shortly thereafter, William Meeker, D.C., M.P .H., now campus president at Palmer West, became the director of what is now known as the Palmer Center for Chiropractic Research.\"Chiropractic is a science, art and philosophy,\" says Dr. Meeker. \"Up until the early 90s, there was no ability for the profession to do research. Science is everybody's tool and we should use it. We believed research would grow credibility toward our profession, and it has. It also impacted how we teach students so when they graduate, they understand how research impacts clinical care.\" Robert Vining, D.C., D.H.Sc., has worked for Palmer College for 12 years and now serves as the associate dean of clinical research. He leads research designed to inform practicing doctors of chiropractic, and most recently published a series of articles offering research-based tools that can help standardize language and 25 YEARS OF INFLUENCE We Reflect on the Rise of Chiropractic Research as We Celebrate the 25th Anniversary of the PCCR streamline clinical assessment and care for low-back pain. \"The Palmer Center for Chiropractic Research is the most highly-funded chiropractic research center in the U.S.,\" Dr. Vining continues. \"The funding we've received is a direct indicator that researchers in other disciplines value the science we're interested in and consider us capable of rigorously conducting studies and transparently reporting results. It also means that funding bodies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) understand that Palmer as an institution has dedicated, on an ongoing basis, financial, administrative, and logistical support necessary for conducting such research.\" The Palmer Center for Chiropractic Research has experienced many historical firsts. It became the first chiropractic institution to receive a grant directly from the federal government to establish a formal research center, was the first and only chiropractic institution to be awarded developmental center grants funded by the NIH, and was the first to receive NIH administrative supplement awards to support post-doctoral research training. \"Our alumni should be proud of their alma mater for being one of only a few colleges to have supported a critical mass of people to do basic science and clinical research,\" says Dr. Meeker. \"It takes money and support of a large, competent organization, and Palmer has done that consistently for the past 25 years.\"\"Our team has worked tirelessly to conduct research to address important policy questions and provide doctors of chiropractic and their patients with the information needed to make evidence- based clinical decisions.\" \u2014Christine Goertz, D.C., Ph.D., professor at Duke University, former vice chancellor for research and health at Palmer CollegeMILESTONES IN PCCR HISTORY Grants awarded in the early days enabled PCCR to build the foundation to conduct research. 1997: PCCR secured its first grant from the NIH. 2002: The NIH awarded PCCR a building grant, giving it the space, laboratories, and a dedicated research clinic needed to conduct high-level, relevant research, and accommodate requisite staff. 2007: PCCR was awarded the R25 grant which provided 10 years of funding to develop the faculty at Palmer's three campuses. This grant was instrumental in providing the training and resources to incorporate evidence-based curriculum at Palmer. Growing Chiropractic Research After a decade of foundational research, PCCR developed increased capacity to conduct clinical research. The PCCR began to receive large-scale, multi- year grants to conduct research among larger populations. This research would ultimately influence curriculum, policy, and the growth of multi- disciplinary care. 2010: The assessment of Chiropractic T reatment for Low Back Pain, Military Readiness, and Smoking Cessation in Military Active Duty Personnel (ACT I, II, III) study was a collaborative project between the Samueli Institute, the RAND Corporation and PCCR, funded by the Department of Defense with $5.1 million granted to PCCR. This project spanned eight years and presented far-reaching implications for the health and productivity of our troops and the general public. 2019: PCCR is leading a $7 million, six-year study called VERDICT, in collaboration with the Yale Center for Medical Informatics, The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy & Clinical Practice, and the University of Iowa. VERDICT is part of an $81 million federally-funded NIH-DoD-VA Pain Management Collaboratory, which is an initiative designed to support large- scale pragmatic clinic trials focused on the use of non-drug pain management approaches among active-duty and veteran populations. VERDICT will be carried out within four Veteran Administration clinics across the country. PCCR COLLABORATIONS\u2014LOCAL AND NATIONAL Projects are often a collective effort between scientists at the PCCR and collaborating investigators including physicians, chiropractors and scientists. During the past 10 years, the PCCR has collaborated with the following institutions: HOSPITALS: Crotched Mountain Specialty Hospital and Genesis Health SystemDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE: Active military at bases in Florida, California, Maryland, and KentuckyCOLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES: University of Iowa, Dartmouth College, Loyola University, Thomas Jefferson University, Yale University, Harvard University, Miami University, University of Kentucky, University of Pittsburgh VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION: Iowa City, Iowa; West Haven, Connecticut; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Los Angeles, CaliforniaANYTHING BUT A SUNSET After 25 years, Palmer continues to push forward in the field of chiropractic research at the PCCR.10 11ON CAMPUS ATHLETICS ON CAMPUS ATHLETICSFALL 2020 PALMER.EDURUGBY PAST AND PRESENT Q & A with Student Athlete Claire Tomashek and Alumnus Bobby Rendina, D.C. TO COMMEMORATE Palmer Rugby's 60th anniversary, 6th trimester student Claire Tomashek, a member of the nationally-ranked women's team, joined Robert \"Bobby\" Rendina, D.C. (Main, '84), member of the men's team from 1978-84, for a Q&A about rugby past and present and the impact it's had on their lives as a student and chiropractor. What drew you to chiropractic and rugby? CLAIRE: My doctor of chiropractic was a Palmer graduate and always had great things to say about Palmer. I played rugby during undergrad (at UW-LaCrosse) so that gave me the extra push to attend Palmer. BOBBY: I came out to visit my brother, who was enrolled at Palmer, in the early 70s, and it looked like something I would enjoy. I enrolled in the local junior college in 1978 and that fall started playing rugby as the only guy from the junior college. When I enrolled at Palmer there was a nine-month waiting list to in. What similarities or differences do you see in rugby, then vs. now? CLAIRE: We always hear that women's rugby is the fastest growing sport in the U.S., and as a high-school coach, I see so many opportunities that women rugby players have now, playing on regional or college teams. BOBBY: It's been 36 years, and it's more organized now. We thought it was big because we were always around it, but back then people outside didn't know much about it. Now we see how much the popularity of rugby has grown not only at Palmer, but also across the country. How has/did rugby impact you as a student? As a chiropractor? CLAIRE: Leadership is important in rugby. At Palmer, you have people leaving and joining the team every three months, and there are always people who step up in those leadership roles. Players who are in their 8th or 9th trimester have set great examples of what a leader should look like. BOBBY: Back then, there were several rugby scholarships. We were fortunate to go to school, play rugby, and have part of our tuition taken care of. I was able to see so many places that I may never have seen because of rugby. Rugby also gave us real-time chiropractic experience. After Palmer, I went through the CCSP (Certified Chiropractic Sports Physician) program, and they talked about injuries that most people had only read about. Through rugby, I already had first-hand knowledge. Claire, what is one thing you'd like Bobby to know about rugby as it is now on Palmer's campus? CLAIRE: I don't think rugby alumni know how much we appreciate the connections we have with them. It means a lot to us when alumni come out to watch our games. We also shadow with alumni in practice. Our relationship with rugby alumni is so important and appreciated. Bobby, what is one piece of advice you'd like to give Claire? BOBBY: Enjoy your time playing at Palmer. Any team you're on and any sport you play, you'll never have the camaraderie that you'll experience with your teammates at Palmer. The environment is fulfilling because you're \"I don't think alumni know how much we appreciate the connections we have with them. It means a lot to us when alumni come out to watch our games.\" \u2014Claire Tomashek, 6th trimester studentaround people whose goals are to become chiropractors and play rugby at the same time. What do you hope for the future of rugby? CLAIRE: It's grown a lot recently because of great leadership and coaches who've created a culture where everyone has a common goal and I hope it continues to grow. BOBBY: We want to make sure rugby continues to grow, and we need support from our alumni to make that happen. Consider what you may charge for two or three adjustments and give that back to the College monthly. We don't want alumni to forget how much the program gave to them. What does rugby mean to Palmer College? CLAIRE: It's a great way to showcase the College. We travel to other cities where we can demonstrate our sportsmanship, our leadership, and our values. Other teams always seem to take an interest in chiropractic, and it makes for pretty cool conversations.BOBBY: Palmer rugby teams always show up prepared. Opponents notice that. We play like we practice, on the field and in the clinic. Our goal was always to win, to promote chiropractic and to promote Palmer. Claire, what can alumni do to help the players through school and on the team? CLAIRE: We'd love to have alumni lead workshops when they're in town so we can learn more about chiropractic and what it's like to be in practice. It's a great way to strengthen the connection. Bobby, what have you learned from Palmer rugby that has carried over into practice? BOBBY: Put your head down and work hard, like you're doing a penalty play five yards out, you've got to push through. That's what you have to do in practice. You have to do your thing, care for your patients, and show them what it means to be a Palmer- educated chiropractor. ALL FOR ONE AND ONE FOR ALL A look back at Dr. Rendina's team photo from 1982.12 13 The Mrs.ARVELOUSL ABELLMMTIRELESS RESOLVE Throughout her life, Mable Heath Palmer, D.C. demonstrated that the role of women in chiropractic not only could be\u2014but was\u2014 equal to men. Her name was Mabel. Working mother. World traveler. Witty and wonderful. Well-mannered and always gracious. But, these are the early 1900s. Scroll your index finger down a guest list just before the local Lion's Club luncheon that Mabel Heath Palmer, D.C. is attending, and you won't find her name. You'll find her listed as Mrs. B.J. Palmer, D.C. It's time for her moment in the spotlight. 14 15 S W E TSHE STANDS CONFIDENT. After all, speaking in front of people isn't anything new for Mabel. Our heroine has traveled the world three times over\u2014exploring the Sphinx of Egypt, the Taj Mahal of India, even the grassy plains of North Dakota. Everywhere she goes, welcoming gifts are bestowed upon her. They aren't just gifts to Mabel, though. They represent moments that make up a life: moments of listening, of learning, and yes, of championing people and causes she believes in. Our First Lady of Chiropractic is ever-curious and always intentional. Abroad, she is met with enthusiasm and inquisitiveness. At home, she is sometimes met with skepticism and wonder. This is more than a century ago, and chiropractic is still new, after all. But Mabel doesn't have time for pithy doubters. With her quick wit, she'll just captivate them instead. \"When one has attained perfection, why bother to try again?\" she asks. She is talking about her first and only son David Daniel. She loves him so dearly. She loves being a mother\u2014a working mother, that is. There is a roar of laughter from the crowd, and a sly smile on Mabel's face. She has their attention, which is good, because she has a powerful message for them. Those that have gathered are here to hear Mabel talk about chiropractic, but she has other objectives too. There's a national dialogue bubbling up about the role of There she is, at the podium. In front of her, a sea of people eager to hear from this woman who was among the first to graduate from the Palmer School of Chiropractic. Ewomen in society, and she's going to use her platform to talk about gender roles\u2014and a woman's right to vote. \"My life is very busy, being a working wife and mother,\" she adds. But if you think she's going to follow that up with an excuse, you're wrong. \"Knowing that the young women scholars at our school of chiropractic are following in my footsteps, I believe that a woman can do anything a man can do. They just need to be given a chance to try.\" SWEET, AND SMART A chance to try is something Mabel worked to offer women throughout her life and travels: a chance to study, a chance to have a voice, a chance to lead, a chance to serve, and eventually, a chance to vote. Born just outside the Village of Milan, Illinois, in 1881, her father William studied chiropractic. Mabel's kind demeanor earned her the nickname \"Sweet Mabel\" (well-intentioned, certainly, even if it neglected to acknowledge her fierce intellect). As a young woman, she watched with a keen sense of curiosity as her father learned the hands-on technique that D.D. Palmer had discovered and developed right across the Mississippi River just 14 years after her birth. \"My interest in chiropractic was first piqued by my father,\" she recalls. \"I found the idea of natural health care centered on the spine and nervous system to be very intriguing.\" And so at the start of the 20th century, Mabel pursued an education during a time that professional school wasn't the norm for women and girls. No, Mabel was never one to follow traditional gender norms. She enrolled at Augustana College just across town, where she studied elocution and sang in the chorus. It was during this time that she caught the eye of B.J. Palmer, D.C. They courted, quickly married, and soon found themselves immersed in the growing world of the then-Palmer School of Chiropractic. The early 1900s was a turbulent time at Palmer\u2014the school and the profession were under constant threat. But Mabel was driven. She was daring. She was determined. SWEET MABEL Mabel's kind demeanor earned her the nickname \"Sweet Mabel.\" But don't be fooled, her intense intellect and curiosity was a force to be reckoned with.\"When one has attained perfection, why bother to try again?\" \u2014Mabel Heath Palmer, D.C.16 17CARRYING THE BANNER FORWARD As the United States celebrates the centennial of the 19th amendment guaranteeing and protecting women's constitutional right to vote, Palmer College alumni\u2014and Mabel's own granddaughter Vickie Anne Palmer, H.C.D. (Hon)\u2014continue the legacy of fortitude and service that Mabel was known for. \"Mabel was a strong woman\u2014a fascinating woman\u2014who didn't accept the status quo,\" remembers her granddaughter, who carries on the Palmer legacy as The Refiner of Chiropractic and a member of the Board of T rustees. \"She was a champion for the profession, and a trailblazer for women. I often think about the conversations that Mabel provoked and the example she modeled to ensure that anyone\u2014no matter of gender\u2014 could receive a chiropractic education.\" To honor and continue her legacy, Palmer College established the Palmer Women's Institute in 2018 to advance and inspire female chiropractors through education, mentoring and professional development. Participation is open to any chiropractor\u2014regardless of gender\u2014interested in supporting women in their studies, careers and civic life. \"Yes, men are welcome too,\" notes Barbara Melbourne J.D., vice chancellor for institutional advancement who has worked alongside other women to form the institute. \"Thanks to the generosity of alumni, we have already been able to establish scholarships for female students and hold a series of lectures on topics women tell us are important to them. There is great momentum for it, and of course, we seek to do more.\" \"Every year, we see more and more women entering the field of chiropractic,\" says Anita Wubbena, D.C. (Main, '95), \"and yet, we haven't reached the cusp of what's possible yet.\" Dr. Wubbena's own story is one that other women can\u2014 and do\u2014relate to. After working under trusted mentors and friends, she realized early in her career that she was both capable and energized by the prospect of going into business for herself. \"Women need to learn, and have support, with getting financing and negotiating business loans. The list goes on and on,\" she says. There is silence for a moment. \"And that's why we need this institute\u2014and we need women and men to support it,\" Dr. Wubbena says. \"It can be a safe place to talk and learn about, and act on issues that support women\u2014and our whole profession. That excites me.\" She continues. \"You know, I have had this extraordinary life\u2014and that is in large part because of my Palmer education. I often wonder where I would be without my Palmer education. Let's just say, I'm proud to have it.\" Mabel Heath Palmer, D.C.'s book \"Stepping Stones,\" and interviews and resources provided by Vickie Anne Palmer, Roger Hynes, D.C., and Alana Callendar, Ed.D. contributed to this story.

A TRAILBLAZER Along with her love of chiropractic, Mabel used her platform to speak confidently on feminist issues of the time, like a woman's right to vote. S M A R T \"Why are women prevented from voting or sitting on juries? Are we not citizens of this country?\" she posits from the podium. \"Because I feel this so strongly, I had 'Equal Rights' and 'Votes 4 Women' painted on all sides of the exceedingly tall smokestack on our campus. Since this landmark is so tall, perhaps it will inspire all Davenport women.\" Mabel's commitment to women went beyond public acts like painting smokestacks. When Quota Club, the first international women's service organization promoting gender equality was formed in 1919, she quickly joined\u2014and then started a Davenport chapter of her own. She was so dedicated to the mission that she became the international organization's president in 1927 and started chapters in Australia and England. She also created the Lend-a-Hand Club in Davenport, which provided a safe place for women in the early 1900s. It was the pamphlet \"A Woman's Appeal to Women\" she sat down to write 100 years ago this year, however, that truly She became one of the first women to become a doctor of chiropractic, a close adviser and confidant to B.J., and a fierce champion of a woman's place in a profession that was dominated by men. \"At Palmer, we have had women working beside men almost from the beginning,\" Mabel notes\u2014her tone denoting an asterisk on her comment. (There could always be more women in chiropractic, she believed.) While raising her son and serving as the business manager and treasurer for the school, Mabel continued to learn. At Rush Medical College in Chicago, she dove deep into studying the anatomy of the human body. \"I am trying to live my life to demonstrate what I feel a woman can be\u2014intelligent, capable, an inspiration to men and women alike, but never to sacrifice kindness and caring,\" she says from the podium. Upon returning to Palmer, she became the school's first anatomy instructor. \"In fact, I literally wrote the book on anatomy,\" she notes to the Lion's Club crowd. They are clearly impressed (and yes, even the men). STEPPING OUT While Mabel was evangelizing chiropractic\u2014and the role of women in the profession\u2014so too were women all across the land raising their voices for equal rights and protections under the law. This not only energized Mabel\u2014but it also provoked her into action. opened the door for women to consider a career in chiropractic. \"Never before has there been such wonderful opportunities for women to practice service, and in my opinion, there is not another profession in the world so splendidly adapted to women as chiropractic,\" she writes. Indeed, Mabel's tireless resolve demonstrated that the role of women in chiropractic not only could be\u2014 but was\u2014equal to men. In fact, she demanded that women engage in service to their profession and to their community. Matilda Reinhardt was one of her students in 1923, and the young woman sat on the edge of her seat in a Palmer classroom taking in every word Mabel said. \"So clearly did she hold the cause of chiropractic before us, and our privilege of living it, that we were carried to the heights of desire for service, and left pledged stronger than ever to chiropractic,\" the student later recalls. It was a pledge that thousands of women chiropractors have taken since. \"Mabel was a strong woman who didn't accept the status quo\u2014a champion of the profession.\" \u2014Vickie Anne Palmer, H.C.D.

(MAIN '15)20ALWAYS ADJUSTING LEARNING CREATING SOLUTIONS FOR UNPRECEDENTED TIMES Becoming a chiropractor wasn't part of the master plan for Richard Yu. Nor was attending Palmer West in California. Nor was attending Palmer during a worldwide pandemic that has made his final quarters at Palmer a whirlwind of life adjustments. \"Nearly every day has been unpredictable,\" the 12th quarter student says from his apartment in San Jose, where he's spent more time than expected over the past five months. \"My years at Palmer have been an invaluable learning experience. And recently, well, I've learned more about chiropractic\u2014and life\u2014than I ever NUMAD GROUP22 23IT WAS FRIDAY THE 13TH, and Cole had a weekend ahead of him that would balance studying and playing with his 11-month-old son at home. \"We had just started another trimester and hadn't gotten through two weeks of classes before life upended,\" the eighth trimester student recalls. \"One day we were studying in- person, and the next day I was learning at home\u2014with a toddler crawling at my feet.\" As that mid-March week was coming to an end, academic administrators at colleges in the United States\u2014and around the globe\u2014were discerning the information they had at-hand about the novel coronavirus and making the best decisions they could for their students. Every news channel and talk show had something different to say about it. Information from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed by the hour. Some states shut down\u2014others remained open. The world was in a heightened state of always learning, and as a result, always adjusting. At Palmer College, the one constant in the ever-changing environment was its focus on the students\u2014and the education it was committed to continuing, no matter what. \"This was unprecedented\u2014the very concept of the entire country shutting down was historical, and certainly not something any of us were expecting,\" Cole says. \"How long will this go on? What will this mean for students, or for potential jobs someday? Will I graduate on-time? It was very easy to be anxious.\" As Cole sought answers, so too did administrators at Palmer College. \"The truth is that we were monitoring COVID-19 very closely prior to March\u2014and we started to look at what we needed to do to continue to educate students and the patients we care for safely,\" says Ron Boesch, D.C. (Main, '91), executive dean of clinics for all three of Palmer's campuses in California, Florida and Iowa. \"Sure, we've had to \"Nicholas \"Cole\" Phillips was looking forward to the St. Patrick's Day weekend. No matter what decade a graduate attended Palmer's Main campus in Davenport, alumni will recall the festive shenanigans and revelry every March at Mac's Tavern or Kilkenny's Pub at the bottom of Brady Street hill. Cole didn't necessarily have plans to meet his classmates this year for a green brew, though\u2014he's a new father. pivot before due to consecutive snow days or hurricanes\u2014but this had the prospect of being monumental. It would require a 180-degree shift in how we educate.\" While in-person classes and labs continued in early March, faculty and clinicians were already preparing to move to an online format should local, state or federal directives require it, or the school determined it was best for the safety of students and patients. \"I think the calves of a lot of our faculty grew three or four inches because everyone was stepping up to do what we needed to do so that we could continue to educate,\" says Dr. Boesch. By day's end on that fateful Friday the 13th, a worldwide pandemic had been declared by the World Health Organization and hotspots in northern California and central Florida meant the cancellation of in-person instruction at Palmer West and Palmer Florida. T wo days later, the same was true at Palmer's Main campus in Iowa. \"It was as if a machine had come to a grinding halt,\" Dr. Boesch recalls of that mid-March weekend. \"And, here we were rearranging all of those gears so we could take an interactive, hands-on approach to our students' education and move it online so that the commitment we made to our students could continue.\" Down in Florida, Reinier \"R.J.\" Cinco was in his seventh quarter at Palmer Florida. \"We were at the disposal of our emails,\" R.J. says, now a 9th quarter student. \"First, we were told only certain aspects of our education would be online, and then hours later, all of it would be. It kept changing.\" Now nearly seven months later, it's a hot and humid day in Florida and R.J. is heading toward the student union. He's just completed his first day in the student clinic\u2014something he wasn't sure would happen months earlier. \"You know, there was so much change starting in March, but one thing that didn't change was our expectations: the expectations students had for the education they would receive, and the expectations faculty had for our learning. I take my hat off to the faculty for pivoting online so quickly.\" Indeed, the weeks and months ahead would not be easy for anyone\u2014for students, faculty, clinicians and the nation. \"At first, I stayed in my apartment here in Port Orange,\" R.J. says. \"After I figured out that our 8th It was as if a machine had come to a grinding halt\u2014and here we are rearranging those gears so that the commitment we made to our students could continue.\" \u2014Ron Boesch, D.C. (Main, '91) Executive Dean of Clinics\"SPRING OF UNCERTAINTY College administrators around the globe were forced to make the tough decision to close down campuses during the height of the pandemic, leaving our grounds feeling curiously empty. A CHANGE OF SCENERY One day Cole Phillips was studying in-person at Palmer College, and the next he was learning at home with a toddler crawling at his feet.24 25 quarter was likely going to be online, I headed home to shelter-in-place with my family in Virginia. I left Florida not knowing what was going to happen.\" At home, R.J. found himself immersed in evening conversations with his father\u2014a nurse working on the frontlines caring for patients with COVID-19. \"He was seeing what the virus was doing to people, and was seeing the death it caused, and we both understood how important his work as a nurse, and mine as a future chiropractor, is to living with optimal health.\" While nothing can replace the hands- on instruction and clinical experience Palmer students have received for nearly 125 years, investments the College made in technology over the past two years allowed faculty and clinicians to continue their work educating students and caring for patients as COVID-19 continued to dominate the airwaves\u2014and national dialogue. \"There is little upside to what Palmer College, and the world, is going through still today,\" says Dennis Marchiori, D.C., Ph.D., chancellor and CEO. \"However, the innovation and creativity and sheer will to deliver the best education possible that has been exhibited by our faculty and academic staff is extraordinary. Our decisions have changed as necessitated, and our community has adjusted with us.\" For students in their first quarters and trimesters, this meant lectures being delivered online\u2014and small-group study sessions among classmates on Zoom. For students learning technique, this meant that fellow classmates became stand-in patients as faculty instructed technique courses in real-time. Students starting their clinical experience gave routine physicals or check-ups to their spouses or children as faculty assessed online. Clinics in all three states were deemed essential, and students were welcomed back into the clinic as soon as safety protocols were put in place and patients resumed care. One plus to emerge out of this moment: a new digital library full of hours and hours of instruction and case studies is now available online\u2014a resource for students whenever they seek additional support. Now in the seventh month of the pandemic, students continue to adjust to learning in the age of COVID-19. Richard, who'll graduate from Palmer West this winter, is getting used to the routine of putting PPE on and the additional safety protocols that have been put in place. A resident of Canada, where chiropractic was not deemed essential, he intends to stay in the United States after graduation and practice on a work visa. He is worried about being able to sit for national boards, because canceled examination dates with the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners have created a backlog. Until then, he'll continue to study. \"My parents remind me that my education is still important\u2014and it is still 100% in my hands. I cannot become complacent, just because the world around me is changing,\" he says. For Cole, the pandemic has been an extreme lesson in being adaptable. \"I'm lucky to have learned most of the hands-on technique we are taught before the pandemic hit,\" he recognizes. \"We're trained to assess what a patient needs, and to use the toolbox we have been given to help them achieve their health goals. The same applies to life: we're presented with a situation, and it's up to us to make the best of it for ourselves, and those we come in contact with.\" R.J. has been reminded how valuable in-person instruction is, and how important it is to make the most of the time he has been given from his professors. \"It can be easy to take advantage of the hands-on time we are given, but I've learned not to take that for granted anymore. While there are limitations to technology, there are not limitations to learning. This is a unique time\u2014and how we move through it now will shape how we practice in the clinic, and live outside of it.\" Back in his office in Davenport, Dr. Boesch is hopeful because of the lessons learned. \"It's the defining moments that move us forward,\" he says. \"When we stress any system, there will be failure\u2014or there will be adaptation. We haven't done everything perfectly, but we've done everything with the intention of delivering the best education we can for our students and remaining open for patient care. There's a big world out there, and all of us have to learn how to adapt to work and live in it if we're going to get back to normal.\" It's time for his next appointment, but before he turns to go he has one other thought. \"We love what we do. We love educating students. We love what Palmer stands for,\" he says. \"There's a lot of opinions out there\u2014and every single one of them helps us continue to be the very best chiropractic college. You better believe we're continuing to listen and continuing to learn.\" \"The one thing that didn't change was our expectations: the expectations students had for the education they would receive. I take my hat off to the faculty for pivoting online so quickly. \u2014Reinier \"R.J.\" Cico (left) 9th quarter student, Palmer Florida THE NEW NORMAL As we adjust to the new normal (wearing masks and practicing social distancing) one thing is certain: Palmer will continue to deliver the very best chiroptractic education for its students.26 27CREATING A MORE INCLUSIVE PROFESSION Palmer Students Want to See Success at All Levels Across the ProfessionMICHAEL AGYEI is a first-generation Palmer student and a first-generation American. He grew up in Aurora, Colorado, and wasn't exposed to chiropractic until he started his undergraduate education. Now, Michael is excited to graduate and go somewhere he can \"make a difference.\" \"Ultimately I want to have a community center focused on inclusivity, where I can also provide chiropractic care to the community,\" he says. \"I think chiropractic is a good way to reach many different groups of people.\" Growing up, he and many people he knew hadn't heard of chiropractic. \"I've had a lot of friends and family members who could have been helped by chiropractic care instead of getting surgery. There are a lot of gaps of people not knowing about chiropractic.\" This can change, but it will take time, he says. \"If people haven't heard of chiropractic, how can they know it's available to them as a health- care option; how can they know it's something they can study as a profession?\" Now in his third trimester at Palmer's Main campus, Michael is the vice president of the Student American Black Chiropractic Association (SABCA). \"I'd like to see more faculty who are of color, of different sexuality and more gender diversity. It all starts with more people being exposed to chiropractic.\" Alecia Stewart, Palmer West SABCA president, says \"having at least one person who looked like me was a very big factor on deciding to come to Palmer West.\" For Alecia, that's only the start. \"I want the profession to have that diversity as well. And I think it would be amazing to be able to say that this person is a great doctor\u2014 not this is a great Black doctor, or this is a great female doctor. I want to see success at all levels.\" Remi Jeffries is the president of the Palmer Florida SABCA chapter. \"I'd like to see more doctors who look like the patients they want to bring in. And for their children to see that doctors can look like them,\" she says. SABCA Florida is growing, and the group is actively working to make Remi's dream a reality. \"SABCA actively goes out to historically black schools such as Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona (Florida) and Edward Waters College in Jacksonville. We want them to know we're here and that they should really consider a career in chiropractic.\" Every generation of Palmer chiropractors has been a part of growing the profession. As we mark the 125th anniversary of chiropractic, we're Palmer proud of our students for taking their own steps toward serving more people and spreading the word about the health benefits of chiropractic. FALL 2020 PALMER.EDUADJUSTMENTS STUDENT PERSPECTIVE I always knew health care was the career goal and that helping people with a hands- on approach was my passion. When I reflected on all the doctors I've encountered in my life that helped and provided the most guidance and care, chiropractic was at the top of the list and I haven't turned back since.My chiropractor got me back to playing golf after I was involved in a car crash my senior year of high school. I suffered a bad lower-back injury a month after signing my letter of intent. She was able to help me in ways my physical therapist and orthopedist had not. Not only did my back pain start to resolve, I felt better as a whole. After that I knew I wanted to be able to give that to someone else.Once I was exposed to chiropractic during my freshman year of college, I realized the importance of preventative and conservative health care, both of which are underutilized in society. I witnessed the amazing benefits chiropractic patients had and realized this career would be the perfect way for me to make a difference in the world. IMPROVING CARE THROUGH DIVERSITY \"It's important for people of color to be in this profession and to be represented in our communities. I think sometimes people of color are more comfortable and more willing to prioritize their health if they can go to a doctor who looks like them,\" says Remi Jeffries. ALICIA STEWART PRESIDENT, SABCA SABCA PALMER MAIN CAMPUSREMI JEFFREIS PRESIDENT, SABCA PALMER FLORIDA PALMER FLORIDA SABCA'S EXECUTIVE BOARD From left to right: Morgan Pough, Sherdane Laura 2020 MEXICO CITY, Enrique Benet-Canut, D.C., CCSP (Main, '66) enrolled in Palmer College in 1963, set on returning to his home country, bringing the healing art of chiropractic with him. When he returned after graduation, there were less than 10 chiropractors in the country. Yet with his wife Patricia Gregg, a practicing attorney, by his side to devote her knowledge of the law to chiropractic, they would leave an indelible mark on the profession. \"In the 1970s there was no official recognition of chiropractic,\" says Dr. Benet-Canut. \"I practiced without a license from 1966 until 1976 and had a lot of patients\u2014artists, politicians, medical doctors, and entrepreneurs. I always found that when I explained logically what chiropractic is, most people understood it.\" A major turning point happened in 1970. While volunteering for a social program called the Institute of Protection to the Infancy, one of Dr. Benet-Canut's patients referred a 10-year-old girl who had been deaf and mute since birth. \"After receiving care, her hearing was restored. The local news media ran a story on her recovery from chiropractic care, and from that point chiropractic began to get attention in the country,\" Dr. Benet-Canut says. \"I continued to work with kids for nine years, and people never forgot what chiropractic has done for children.\" This program eventually led to Dr. Benet-Canut, along with a small group of chiropractors, gaining the support of the Governor of the State of Mexico to start the first chiropractic program within an official university in Mexico. Over his 50-year career, with his wife, Patricia Gregg, he led the effort to institute three chiropractic colleges within Mexico, was essential in the development of three professional chiropractic organizations\u2014the Mexican Sports Chiropractic Association, Scientific Chiropractors of Mexico, and the Latin American Federation of Chiropractic\u2014 the first chiropractic association to be officially recognized by the Mexican government; and served within the World Federation of Chiropractors. \"People ask me, 'why do you keep working so hard?' I say, it's because it's my duty to keep growing chiropractic. Like B.J. Palmer says, this is history in the making. We're very proud of what we've done.\" Despite the growth over the years, Dr. Benet-Canut urges there is more work to be done. \"Chiropractic is still the minority. We have to understand how chiropractic has evolved from one person, D.D., then B.J. We have to work together to grow the profession, feel proud of and not lose its basic principles,\" also adding, \"I cannot thank enough professors like Dr. Galen Price, Dr. Virgil Strang and Dr. Dave Palmer who taught me the Principles of Chiropractic. I think all chiropractors should go to Palmer at least once, because it's the Fountainhead of chiropractic.\" \"People ask me, 'why do you keep working so hard?' I say, it's because it's my duty to keep growing chiropractic.\" \u2014Enrique Benet- Canut, D.C., CCSP WE HAVE TO GROW THE PROFESSIONTHE WORLD NEEDS MORE HEALERS Dr. Benet-Canut Makes a Mark in His Home Country Dr. Bruhl Left His Practice to Provide Care in Under-served CountriesGLOBAL REACH Daring and Driven Alumni Giving Chiropractic to the World IN THE 125 YEARS since the founding of the chiropractic profession, students have traveled from more than 75 countries to study at the Fountainhead and have gone on to practice in 60 countries around the world. Through these students, the original work of D.D. Palmer has had a global impact.\"THE BEST THING a chiropractor can do when they feel burned out by people not getting what chiropractic is, or dealing with insurance, is to provide care in an under-served country. People in under-resourced countries are so appreciative.\" In 2011, Warren Bruhl, D.C. (West, '86), sold his practice after 25 years. He was burned out and thought chiropractic was behind him. Then he joined his mother, a missionary, on trips that would change his life: first to the Dominican Republic, and then to Kenya. \"That's when I realized I wasn't done,\" says Dr. Bruhl. \"It's easy to get stuck in a routine unless you're willing to go out and see the world in a new way. It taught me that I want to serve and provide this care. This must be how B.J. felt.\" Dr. Bruhl was one of the first doctors of chiropractic to provide care in Kenya. His first adjustment was done in front of an audience, because they'd never seen an adjustment done before. His first patient was a 16-year-old girl who suffered from frequent headaches following a fall from a motorcycle. The medical doctor working alongside Dr. Bruhl wanted to give the patient aspirin and Tylenol, but Dr. Bruhl refused, recognizing that she needed an adjustment. However, it was against the culture for a male to put his hands on a young, married woman. The medical doctor explained to the patient and her husband what Dr. Bruhl was going to do. The girl felt immediate relief from the adjustment and spread the word to everyone she knew. Newly inspired, Dr. Bruhl has since become the executive director of the non-profit Dreamweaver International located four hours from Nairobi. The organization is building the first multi-disciplinary hospital in Kenya, and it will offer chiropractic, emergency medicine, dentistry, mental health, infectious disease treatment and osteopathy. They hope to attract doctors from the United States to work alongside African doctors. \"Since my first mission trip in 2012, the awareness of chiropractic has grown tremendously in Kenya. There are 7.5 billion people in the world, and this experience has taught me that the world needs more chiropractors.\" WORDS OF WISDOM Warren Bruhl, D.C. says there are 7.5 billion people in the world, and the world needs more chiropractors.RENOWNED CAREER Over his 50-year career, Enrique Benet-Canut, D.C., CCSP and his wife have made essential developments in Mexico.30 31From Canada to South Africa, Three Generations of Haldemans Push Passed Boundaries to Care for Patients WHEN ALMEDA HALDEMAN'S HUSBAND was diagnosed with diabetes around 1904, there was no medical intervention available. Determined to do everything in her power to help him, she went to the Minneapolis School and Cure, and educated herself in the new healing art of chiropractic, receiving her degree in 1905. Then, following the advice to move her husband to a cold, dry climate, they relocated to Saskatchewan, Canada and Almeda Haldeman, D.C. became the first chiropractor in Canada, and one of the first female chiropractors in the world. While little is known about her career, these choices began a chiropractic family legacy that would span multiple countries and generations. When her son, Joshua Norman, began to lose his eyesight following a head injury, he wrote to B.J. Palmer for help. With B.J.'s encouragement, Joshua attended Palmer College of Chiropractic and graduated in 1926. \"He (Joshua Norman) became a mover and shaker within the profession in Canada,\" says Scott Haldeman, D.C., M.D., Ph.D. (Main, '64). LIKE MANY CHIROPRACTORS, Willard Smith, D.C. (Main, '60) was drawn to chiropractic after experiencing its healing powers firsthand. The Oklahoma native dealt with migraine headaches at a young age, and after a \"few accidents along the way,\" decided to seek help from his neighborhood chiropractor. He was 28 years old. The care he received and the chiropractors he met piqued his interest in the chiropractic profession. Accompanied by wife, Marguerite, Dr. Smith made the trip to Davenport, IA, where he enrolled at Palmer College of Chiropractic in 1957. The rest, as they say, is 63 years of history. Following his graduation, Dr. Smith set up shop in Rock Island, Illinois, but his chiropractic experience extends beyond the 55 years he spent in practice. There are his thirty-plus mission trips to countries like Ethiopia and Russia. Not to mention 40 years as a faculty member at Palmer, spending most of his time in technique classes. But his greatest legacy may be the students who've benefited from Dr. Smith's generosity. In 1974, Dr. Smith and Marguerite made their first gift to Palmer College and have continued to make gifts in 53 of the last 56 years. The last year missed was 1998, the year that Marguerite passed. That's when Dr. Smith established the Marguerite E. Smith Memorial Endowed Scholarship for Christian Chiropractic Students to honor Marguerite, and support students who have a passion for chiropractic and share the Smith's value of the Christian faith. Over the last 22 years, the fund has awarded more than $60,000 in scholarship support for students. This December, Dr. Smith will turn 95 years old. And he will continue to give because he \"wants to see the College progress and the students be successful.\" His words of wisdom about alumni giving back? \"If they can, they should. When you consider yourself successful, you should share that with others. When you recognize a need, you do what you can to help. That's what a doctor does.\"ADJUSTMENTS ALUMNI PROFILE STEPHEN PAXTON, D.C. (Main, '20) Thank you for leaving a legacy in honor of your wife and in support of Palmer students.

Dr. Almeda Haldeman's legacy continued when Dr. Joshua Haldeman moved his family and his practice to South Africa in 1950, built one of the largest chiropractic clinics and actively pursued legislation to recognize chiropractic in the country. He then encouraged his son, Dr. Scott Haldeman, to attend Palmer College. Following graduation from Palmer, Scott Haldeman, D.C. went on to earn a degree in physics and physiology followed by master's and doctorate degrees in neurophysiology based on chiropractic theories he had studied at Palmer. \"That's when I realized someone had to do clinical research in chiropractic, so I enrolled in medical school. This was in the 1970s when medical doctors weren't allowed to refer to or take referrals from chiropractors. I had a classmate who liked to crack jokes and he asked the professor, 'what if you're both a doctor and the chiropractor?' Of course, everyone knew he was referring to me.\" Through three generations, Drs. Almeda, Joshua and Scott Haldeman crossed international borders, challenged professional boundaries, and contributed to the growth of the chiropractic profession, all while caring for thousands of patients. T rue to his grandmother's legacy, Dr. Scott Haldeman ended up as one of the individuals who testified before legislative task forces considering licensing of chiropractors in Quebec in 1972, New Zealand in 1978, at the Wilke verses AMA trial in 1981 and before the U.S. Congress that established the U.S. Department of Defense Chiropractic Demonstration Project in 1995. He has supported similar initiatives in multiple countries over the subsequent years. In this way he was completing what his grandmother started two generations prior.

SEND TO ALUMNI@PALMER.EDU TO BE INCLUDED IN THE NEXT ISSUE.WHEN I WENT to interview for the archivist position at Palmer College in 1982, I thought the professional school I was applying to work at was a law school. Even so, I got the job. It was the start of a wonderful career working throughout the campus\u2014from archivist to the research department to admissions and even the foundation. The Palmer College library had begun collecting archival material just two years prior to my arrival as archivist and serials librarian. I didn't stay in the position long, leaving the archives in the capable hands of Glenda Wiese, who built the collection into the juggernaut that it is today. Fifteen years into my work at Palmer, chiropractic's centennial was celebrated across the world. Now a quarter of a century behind us, the moment brought an awareness of the necessity of preserving the profession's history. In 1997, we celebrated the centennial of the educational program and I became the first director of the Palmer Foundation for Chiropractic History, which was tasked with creating a chiropractic museum. As an aside, I took over management of the Palmer Residence from Archives. The Palmer family and subsequent executives had a sense of Palmer's place in chiropractic history and squirreled away artifacts throughout the campus. With an intrepid band of work study students which included today's historian, Roger Hynes, D.C. (Main '98), we spent three years of weekends and evenings unearthing and organizing the greatest collection of chiropractic memorabilia ever assembled. In an appeal to potential donors, I remember asking for \"stuff.\" How do you ask for a heartometer if you've never seen or heard of one? And then the obverse: How do you get people to stop donating heartometers when you have 20 of them? Using a version of the old Marine adage, \"donate them all and let us sort them out\" became our collections policy. One of the hardest concepts to communicate with potential donors was that history is being made today\u2014if items in current use are discarded, future historians will not be able to illustrate the progress made now. I'm often asked why history matters. I believe we take deep, important lessons from history to allow us to inform the future decisions and directions we take as individuals, and in Palmer's case, a college and profession. Celebrating our heritage offers a chance for learning and reflection, and an opportunity to walk confidently into the future.
