Australian consumers purchase a wide range of compleme ntary medicines (CMs) and consult a range of complementary and alte rnative medicine practitioners including naturopaths, acupuncturists and Chinese herb al medicine practitioners, who may also directly supply CMs. In 2003, the Expert Committee on Complementar y Medicines in the Health System was commissioned to report on the status of CMs and therapies in Australia. In the report 'Complementary Medicines in the Australian Health System',1 the Expert Committee identified a number of concerns and made a series of recommenda tions to facilitate safe, appropriate and effective use of CMs. One specific concern was the need for consumers and health professionals to have 'accurate, relia ble and independent information' about CMs and to have appr opriate skills to 'interpret available information' and 'discriminat e between reliable and unrelia ble information' to allow them to make informed decisions about the use of CMs.1 National Prescribing Service complementary medicine research The NPS CMs consumer research is part of a broader research program at NPS to better understand the use of CMs and the informat ion needs and preferences of consumers and health professionals around CMs. The results of this work will underpin the development of strategies to address gaps in skills and pr ovide information to assist decision-making by consumers and h ealth professionals about CMs. Methods Defining complementary medicines For the purposes of this research, CMs are also known as 'traditional or alternative medicines' and include herbal medicines, vitamin and mineral supplements, other nutritional supplements, traditional medici nes such as Ayurvedic medicines and traditional Chinese medicines, homoeopathic medicines, and aromatherapy oils (where they make therapeutic claims).2 In the CMs consumer survey a nd interviews, the terms 'natur al and herbal remedies' and 'natural medicines and health products' have been used as these terms were previously shown to be better understood by consumers th an the term 'complem entary medicines'. Research questions The research questions for this study were: What are the attitudes of consumers to CMs? How do consumers use CMs? Why are people using CMs? What do consumers know about the CMs they are using? What information do consumers want to k now about CMs and how do they acquire that information? What information sources would consumers prefer to use to find out about CMs? Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 6 Research design The research used both quantitative and qua litative methods to answer the research questions and was conducted in two phases: cross-sectional telephone surveys and in- depth interviews with a samp le of survey respondents. A computer-assisted telephone interview survey was conducte d with a random sample of respondents 18 years and over across Austra lia. Questions focused on personal use of CMs, attitudes to CMs, CMs informat ion seeking and preferences and socio- demographic information of respondents . Six hundred and twelve users of CMs completed the survey. One NPS interviewer conducted 24 in-depth semi -structured interviews with a sample of CMs users identified from the telephone surv ey who had reported using one of the CMs of interest in the last 12 months, lived in metropolitan Sydney, Melbourne or Launceston and their level of use varied from low- to high-frequency use. Inte rviews were conducted in English and lasted between 30 and 60 mi nutes. The interview technique used open- ended interviewing and partial application of the micro-mo ment time-line interviewing techniques, inviting participants to te ll about experiences around their use and information seeking for CMs. Nineteen in terviews were used in the analysis. Key findings Use of complementary medicines CMs users reported purchasing CMs from multiple sources, including pharmacies (51%), supermarkets (33%) a nd health food shops (32%). Many consumers use CMs to enhance health, support the performance of everyday tasks and enhance their capacity to cope with unusual tasks or stressors. Some use CMs to treat or manage a condition or deficiency. Consumers report using some CM s for general health, to gain more energy or feel less fatigued, or for uses that are not supported by evidence. These CMs may have evidence for use with specific conditions , but consumers are not always aware of the evidence and are using the CMs for other purposes. Only fifty per cent of su rvey respondents reported havi ng mentioned or discussed their use of CMs with a doctor. Attitudes of consumers to complementary medicines Consumers think differently about CMs compared to conventional medicines, particularly prescription medicines. Many consumers saw their CMs use as 'natural' and part of a holistic view of health and CMs were used in conjunction with, not in isolation from, other strategies for achieving and maintaining good health. Consumers believe CMs are 'safer' than conventional medicines. While this is generally true, some consumers appear unaware that CMs may have potential harms associated with side effects, exc eeding the recommended dose, allergies and interactions with conventional medicines. Many consumers appear satisfied with their use of CMs, although they may acknowledge that they are uncertain of their actual benefits. CMs users reported that their own experience is critical in asse ssing the safety and effectiveness of CMs. Another common way of assessing the effectiveness of CMs was discussions with family, friends, heal th professionals and complementary and alternative medicines practitioners. Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 7 Information needs and preferences around complementary medicines CMs users responding to th e NPS survey most often seek information on the potential benefits (56%) and reasons for use (41%) of CMs. They less frequently seek information on side effects or risks (24%), dose (16%), and effects if taken with other medications (12%). The consumer in-depth interviews revealed that consumers also acquire information without actively seeking it. CMs inform ation is communicated during informal conversations with family, friends and acquaintances about staying healthy and health problems. Consumers surveyed report seeking out information about CMs actively from a variety of sources. Consumers most co mmonly reported seeking CMs information from family and friends (55%), the Intern et (51%), health food shop workers (38%), pharmacists (37%), doctors/general practitioners (34%), and inserts/labels/pamphlets (30%). Almost one third of CMs users (31%) also reported seeking information about CMs from one or more complementary therapists. The Internet was an important CMs info rmation source, particularly for younger users and for those who used multiple CMs. Consumers reported finding all the sources of CMs information, including magazines, newspapers, and the Intern et, as useful or very useful. Consumers appear to often accept and act on existing sources of information on CMs and then evaluate the effects of the CMs through trial and error. CMs users would prefer to get CMs inform ation from doctors (30%), the Internet (25%) and pharmacists (24%). Those who used multiple CMs prefer consul ting their naturopath, reading books, or consulting other natural therapists. Implications of the research This research provides a comprehensive pict ure of what Australians think about CMs, how they use CMs, how they gain information about CMs, and from whom they would prefer to receive CMs information. As with all research based on su rveys and interviews, it represents the attitudes, knowledge and behaviours of those who agreed to participate. The results raise many important issues a bout the attitudes of consumers to CMs and the way they use information about CMs, and how this impacts on their decisions to use these medicines. It will help us develop the approaches that are needed to address gaps in the quality use of CMs, and reveal what else we need to know to ensure that Australians are using CMs sa fely and effectively. Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 8 Implications for the quality use of complementary medicines The quality use of CMs means making wise decisions that promote health or treat conditions, choosing suitable CMs when necessary, and using CMs safely and effectively. Although most CMs are safer th an conventional medicines, they are still medicines and can cause side effects, allerg ic reactions and interact with conventional medicines. This research showed that many consumers: are using some complementary medicines fo r general wellbeing or to prevent illness despite a lack of evidence for this are not aware of the side effects of some CMs and their potential interaction with conventional medicines and this may put so me users at unnecessary risk of harm do not always discuss the use of CMs with their doctors are reliant on sources of information a bout CMs that are of variable quality, reliability and authority In order to address these gaps in the qualit y use of CMs, a number of approaches would be useful: Involvement of consumers and consumer organisations and ot her key stakeholders in the development of programs and strate gies to improve the quality use of CMs. The development of strategies to disseminate messages to promote an understanding that CMs are part of a spectrum of medicines, and have the potential for harm. CMs are low risk rather than no risk, and 'natural' is not always safe. The provision of information to consumer s about CMs that addresses their current needs and preferences. The promotion of active discussions betw een consumers and health care providers about their use of CMs. Investigation into the role of performan ce-based labelling and written consumer information in improving quality use of complementary medicines The availability of independent and reliabl e resources that would help to meet consumer information needs around CMs. Any strategies to provide information to consumers about CMs should focus initially on areas where consumers may be at risk or may benefit from the use of CMs. Implications for further research The consumer research shows that many users take both CMs and conventional medicines together but view CMs as natura l and safe and conven tional medicines as chemical and having greater risks. Further research is needed to better understand how the use of CMs intersects wi th the use of conventional me dicines and how to ensure that consumers balance the risks and benefits of both. CMs users gain information about CMs from a range of resources both actively and passively. It will be important to further investigate how to best present relevant, independent and ba lanced CMs information to consum ers and identify the skills they need to support their decisions about the use of CMs. Another significant area for further resear ch is to gain an understanding of the knowledge and information needs of other health care workers, including pharmacy assistants, health food stor e workers, naturopaths a nd other complementary and alternative medicine practitioners, to ensure that Australian consumers are adequately supported in their decisions around the use of CMs. Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 9 Background The changing face of complementary medicines Throughout the western world, the health care environment is rapidly changing and the past decade has seen increasing attenti on given to complementary and alternative medicines and therapies. Australian cons umers can now purchase a wide range of complementary medicines (CMs) from a va riety of outlets including pharmacies, supermarkets and health food shops. Many Australians also consult complementary and alternative practitioners including natur opaths, acupuncturists and Chinese herbal medicine practitioners, who may also directly s upply CMs. It is esti mated that Australians spent $1.31 billion on CMs in 2004.3 There has been an increase in the use of CMs by Australians. In recent years a series of population-based surveys conducted in South Australia found 48.5% of people reported using at least one CM in the last 12 months in 1993.4 By 2004, 52% (n=3015) of people had reported taking one CM in the past 12 months3. A national consumer survey conducted by the National Prescribing Service (NPS) in 2005 found a similar prevalence of CMs use (52%).5 However, the 2006 NPS national consumer survey showed a significant increase in the proportion of people taking CMs (67%).6 Self-prescribed vitamins, herbal medicine s and mineral supplements are the most common CMs used. The South Australian studies found an increase in the use of herbal medicines from 9.9% in 1993 to 20.6% in 2004.3 These medicines comprise a large part of the complementary medicines product mark et, and their popularity is reflected in other Australian surveys.7,8 Review of complementary medicines in Australia The Office for Complementary Medicine s was established in 1999 within the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) a nd it created a world first regulatory framework for CMs.1,9-11 In 2003, the Expert Committee on Complementary Medicines in the Health System was commissioned to re port on the status of CMs and therapies in Australia. In the report 'Complementary Me dicines in the Australian Health System',1 the Expert Committee identified a number of concerns and made a series of recommendations to facilitate safe, appr opriate and effective use of CMs. The Committee identified the need for cons umers and health professionals to have 'accurate, reliable and indepe ndent information' about CMs and to have appropriate skills to 'interpret available informati on' and 'discriminate between reliable and unreliable information' to allow them to make informed decisions about the use of CMs.1 The lack of research about consumer and health professional CMs information needs and skills was also identified in the report. Recommendation 25 in the report recommended that \"the Department of He alth and Ageing commission a study to determine the compleme ntary medicines information a nd skill needs of health care professionals and consumers, options for c onveying this information to stakeholders, and the costs and resources necessary to meet these needs.\" Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 10 Why is the National Prescr ibing Service conducting this research? The National Prescribing Service Ltd (NPS) is an independent, non-profit organisation funded by the Australian Gove rnment Department of Health and Ageing. NPS aims to improve quality use of medicines (QUM) in Au stralia by giving people information, skills and knowledge so they can choose if, when a nd how to use medicines to attain better health and wellbeing.5 The CMs consumer research is part of a broader research program at NPS to better understand the use of CMs and the informat ion needs and preferences of consumers and health professionals around CMs. NPS conduc ted this research primarily to inform its own programs. This research also sought to address the research needs outlined in Recommendation 25 of the 'Complementary Me dicines in the Australian Health System' report.1 Other current and past CMs rese arch, conducted by NPS includes: Preliminary research . The preliminary research was conducted in 2005 and 2006 and drew on a range of sources and activi ties, some of which were part of larger NPS activities or projects. It consiste d of a review of the literature on CMs, qualitative research to understand if consum ers view CMs as medicines, reviews of calls to the NPS medicines information tele phone services, the inclusion of questions about CMs in NPS surveys, and a review of other relevant data. Health professional CMs research . The focus of the NPS health professional research has been on general practitioners and pharmacists as these are currently the primary audiences for all NPS work. Review of electronic CMs information sources . The review is currently underway and examines the scope and quality of CM s information resources using accepted criteria and how useful resources are to consumers and health professionals. More information on the NPS CMs research is available at: http://www.nps.org.au/research_and _evaluation/research/current_res earch/complementary_medicines Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 11 Research methods Aim and research questions The research aimed to provide a better understanding of current Australian consumer attitudes to CMs, and their information needs and preferences. The research questions for the CMs consumer study were: What are the attitudes of consumers to CMs? How do consumers use CMs? Why are people using CMs? What do consumers know about the CMs they are using? What information do consumers want to k now about CMs and how do they acquire that information? What information sources would consumers prefer to use to find out about CMs? Defining complementary medicines For the purposes of this research, CMs are also known as 'traditional or alternative medicines' and include herbal medicines, vitamin and mineral supplements, other nutritional supplements, traditional medici nes such as Ayurvedic medicines and traditional Chinese medicines, homoeopathic medicines, and aromatherapy oils (where they make therapeutic claims).2 In the CMs consumer surveys and interviews the terms 'natural and herbal remedies' and 'natural medicines and health products ' have been used as these terms were previously shown to be better understood by consumers than the te rm 'complementary medicines'. Research design Overview The research used both quantitative and qua litative methods to answers the research questions and was conducted in two phases: cross-sectional telephone survey and in- depth interviews with a samp le of survey respondents. The research was approved by the Departmen t of Health and Ageing's Health Ethics Committee. Phase 1: Cross-sectional survey We conducted a cross-sectional survey via telephone to gain a broad understanding of what consumers know about their CMs, wher e they get their information and how they would like to gain this information in the future. Selection of survey respondents The survey was conducted by telephone in June and July 2007, using a computer- assisted telephone interview (C ATI) system, by a market re search organisation with relevant experience in conducting large populat ion health surveys. The target population for the survey was all Australians 18 years and over with a landline telephone. Random Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 12 digit dialling was used to select phone num bers to be contacted, ensuring that individuals with both listed and silent residential numbers were included. The research organisation used a randomly generated phone number database. Features of the database included: the ability to draw a sample on the basis of state or postcode numbers that are randomly ge nerated using complex algor ithms to maximise data quality numbers that cover virtually all current exch ange prefixes in Australia, with nearly 100% Australian coverage including new housing developments, and the removal of most busine ss and non-operational numbers. When the phone was answered, one responde nt from each hous ehold was randomly selected using the CATI system and invited to participate by the interviewer. A multiple callback procedure was used to ensure that harder-to-reach respondents were included. Quality control measures were implemen ted to ensure relia bility of the data. Sample Size We aimed to interview a random sample of 600 users of CMs. A sample size of 600 would have allowed us to be 95% confident that a result showing 45% of the sample population agreeing with a particular statem ent meant that between 41% and 49% of the whole adult population of CMs users would agree with that statement. Survey questionnaire (See Appendix 1) The questionnaire contained questions on: Personal use of CMs (9 questions) Attitudes to CMs (9 questions) Information seeking and preferen ces about CMs (12 questions) Sociodemographic information (8 questions). The questionnaire included questions that ha d been used and/or validated in other surveys where available. The survey included questions on 13 CMs of inte rest to NPS. The CMs of interest to NPS were those which are commonly used by Australian consumers and are associated with increased risk of side effects or interactions, or have evidence that they are effective or are not effective. They include: black cohosh, coenzyme Q10, echinacea, glucosamine, St John's wort, valerian, vitamin A, vitamin B, oral vitamin E and zinc. Respondents were also asked a bout their use more generally of Chinese herbal medicines, homoeopath ic medicine, natural wei ght loss products and other western herbal medicines. The questionnaire was circulated to th e Complementary Medicine Implementation Reference Group for comment. NPS staff conducted preliminary testing of the questionnaire to ensure validity. The mark et research organisation conducted further piloting of the questionnaire with 20 randomly selected survey respondents to ensure that questions were easily understood and question flow was logical. Data analysis The market research organisati on provided the de-identified raw data to NPS researchers in an SPSS format. NPS researchers cleaned the data, recoded any 'other' fields and analysed the data using SAS v9.1. 12 Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 13 The NPS research team hypothesised a priori that the level of use of selected CMs may reflect different attitudes a bout CMs and different informat ion needs and preferences. In order to examine this, CMs users were clas sified by the number of selected CMs used into high users (those who used 6 or more di fferent selected CMs or used 5 or more plus consulted a complementary health practitioner in the last 12 months) and low/moderate users (thos e who used fewer CMs). A post hoc subgroup analysis was also conducte d by NPS researchers to understand if those who used CMs with conventional me dicines (CMs-conventional medicines users) and those who used CMs alone (CMs only users) differed in their attitudes and information needs and preferences. Univariate and bivariate analyses explored CMs use, attitudes and behaviours around CMs and CMs information seeking behaviours and preferences of all respondents, high and low/moderate CMs users, and CMs-co nventional medicines users and CMs only users. Results are expressed as percentages with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) where relevant. Statistical differences between groups have been test ed using chi square tests. A p-value of <0.01 was used to define statis tical significance due to the number of tests conducted. Phase 2: In-depth interviews One interviewer conducted in-depth semi-struct ured interviews with a sample of CMs users identified from the telephone survey. This research aimed to provide a more detailed understanding of consumer attitude s to CMs, especially around safety and effectiveness of CMs, and their information seeking practices and information needs. Selection of interview participants The CATI system used a complex algorithm to randomly select one hundred survey respondents who had used one of the CMs of interest in the last 12 months, lived in metropolitan Sydney, Melbourne or Launcest on and whose level of CMs use varied from low (used 1 selected CMs), through modera te (used 2-4 selected CMs) to high- frequency use (used > 5 selected CMs). At the end of the telephone interview, the interviewer briefly explained Phase 2 of the study to the eligible respondents identified by the CATI system. The interviewer invited th em to participate in the in-depth personal interviews. Respondents were offered a $50 Coles Myer voucher to reimburse them for their time and travel. If the respondent agreed to participate in Phase 2 of the study and gave permission to use their c ontact details, then the survey interviewer recorded their name and phone number in the CATI system . Each week, the market research organisation supplied a list of e ligible respondents, who had ag reed to participate in the interview study, to the NPS researchers. NPS researchers re-contacted these respondents by telephone within two weeks of their names being received and asked if they were still willing to participate in Phase 2 of the study and if they were av ailable to participate during the study time frame. If they agreed to participate and were available, the NPS researcher determined a convenient time to visit them and conduct the personal interview. An NPS researcher (MT) conducted and audio -taped the interviews in July and August 2007. Participants used a pseudonym during the interview to further ensure anonymity. Prior to the interview, the participant was given an information statement on the project and a consent form to sign if they still agre ed to participate. Inte rviews were conducted in English either in the participant's home or at an agreed local public venue, which was convenient for the participant. Interv iews lasted between 30 and 60 minutes. Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 14 The interview technique used a partial a pplication of the micro-moment time-line interviewing techniques used in Sens e-Making. The Sense-Making methodology, developed by Dervin,13,14 has been used extensively in the information science field to investigate how users access and use inform ation in a variety of contexts, including health contexts, in order to inform the design of information systems.15,16 The interview guide used open-ended quest ions, inviting participants to tell about experiences around their use and information seeking for CMs (See Appendix 2). The interviewer practiced minimal disruption dur ing the interview, although clarifications were sought when participants offered little detail or 'closed' re sponses. Participants were also prompted to discuss their inform ation needs as they discussed other aspects of CMs. The interviewer also followed up re levant issues that participants raised spontaneously; and requested that particip ants make comparisons between different situations. Examples of these techniques are in Table 1 below. These techniques helped to elicit additional information about the research questions during the interview. Preliminary testing and piloting of the guide were conducted with a small convenience sample to ensure that the guide was usable and provided information relevant to the research questions. Table 1. Interviewing techniques used to elicit additional information about complementary medicines information needs and seeking, NPS complementary medicines user in-depth interviews, 2007 Questioning technique Examples Extension Requesting further information, or other examples Used when the participant gives little detail or a 'closed' response, the researcher probes for more information \"Have you sought information anywhere else other than your wife going to the Chinese doctor?\" \"Have you sought information about the skin rash from anywhere else, have you talked to anyone - looked on the Internet.\" \"And so how did you originally hear that the fish oil was preventative?\" Linking/returning to topic Used when a participant is discussing a relevant process, event or experience but with reference to an off-topic issue, the interviewer brings the participant back to the research topic \"Have you ever used the Internet for health information?\" \"Is there anything you particularly ever wanted to know or find out to understand more about the fish oil itself?\" Making comparisons Used when a participant gives a particularly lucid explanation of a phenomenon, process or experience, the researcher asks them how that compares for another topic of interest. This prompts them to give a similarly detailed explanation \"So tell me [name], how do you find out information about natural medicines like the fish oil that you do take?\" Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 15 Analysis method The analytical method employed for the analysis of the in-depth inte rview data is based on Miles and Huberman's techniques for early steps in the thematic analysis and presentation of data,17 Taylor and Bedford's variation for identifying themes in the data and intersections between the themes,18 and Bazeley's techniques for refining themes and for using displays in anal ysis and reporting of results.19 This method parallels grounded theoretical methods of open and axial coding.20 However, unlike traditional grounded theoretical method, no attempt was made to generate new theories from their data. In-depth interviews were transcribed ve rbatim, with the exception of personal information, which was de-identified. Transcri pts were imported into the qualitative data software program NVivo 721 for project management, data organisation and analysis. A different NPS researcher analysed and reporte d on the data. The NPS researchers met on a number of occasions during data analysis to discuss new codes to ensure data validity and methodological rigour. Figure 1 illustrates the steps taken in the analytical process, which are described in the following sections. In practice, these step s were undertaken co ncurrently, as new themes can and did emerge at every stage of the project. For example, while conducting confirmatory coding of identified them es, new themes emerged. 'In Vivo' nodesa would be created for these new themes so that they could be re-visited at a later time. The analytical method involved both descript ive and higher order analyses. Descriptive analysis in this sense means analysis of answ ers participants gave as direct responses to questions asked by the interviewer. They can be found in the analysis of individual cases (within-case analyses), as well as when an alysing across cases (between-case analyses). Given the circular nature of this kind of qualitative method, results are presented and discussed thematically rather than as results of discreet analytical phases. a 'In Vivo' coding is an NVivo7 procedure where nodes are created from the data verbatim. It is essentially a 'drag and drop' way of creating new nodes and is useful when interesting findings are made when in the middle of another task that cannot be interrupted. Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 16 Approaching the data: Annotation Transcripts were initially annotated broadly to familiarise the researcher with the data. The questions asked of the data to guide annotating included: What people, events or situ ations were described? What were the main themes or i ssues raised by the participant? Which research questions and which variable s in the initial framework does the data address? What new ideas, speculations, impressions or hunches about the research topics are suggested by the interview? What should I focus on when annotating the next interview?17 Answers to these questions informed the order in which annotation proceeded. For example, the issues for a respondent who is juggling two jobs a nd a young family may be very different from those of an older re tired participant with no resident children. Thus, annotation of interviews sought to reveal the diversity of the information from the respondents: each interview was selected to yield very different initial ideas to the previously annotated interview. The annotation process also initiated the coding framework. Building a coding framework via this method, rather than pr e-designing it around the research questions, avoided 'forcing' the data. Figure 1. Overview of the in-depth interview analytical process Describing interview participants Gender, geographic area, category of CM use, seeking an alternative practitioner Determining and coding themes Descriptive coding within cases Approaching the data Annotate broad concepts, ideas, and intuitions Confirming, disconfirming, developing and refining key themes Coding between cases and higher order analyses Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 17 Determination and coding of themes Themes were inferred from the annotated material and coded within cases, i.e. individual transcripts were coded in their enti rety with the intention of identifying the widest possible range of themes. Data was coded in such a way as to preserve meaning (such as larger paragraphs, rather than small selections of particular words) this also enabled multiple coding of text. This meant that exploration of thematic intersecti ons would be possible at later stages of the analysis.19 A team meeting was held when a sizeable number of codes had been developed to discuss interim findings, how they answered the research questions and which divergent themes were important to accommodate in the study to contribute to the broader body of CMs knowledge. Further coding of new th emes and 'coding on' of existing themes followed. Codes were repeatedly reviewed and refined in this way to challenge analytical conclusions, generate new approa ches when analytical techniques were not working and to maintain transparency of the analytical process so that it could be checked by others. This process aimed to confirm the 'trustworthiness' of the coding and analysis process. Confirmatory analyses and development of emergent key themes The same theme was coded across transcripts (between-case coding) to confirm emergent themes from the first stage of analysis. All transcripts were examined for evidence of new themes. Team meetings and writing progressive results formed important components of this stage of the analysis. This stage of the analysis focuses on developi ng and refining hierarchic al categories. This involves reviewing emergent ideas of what is 'going on in the data' as a project team and confirming or refuting the themes wi thin the data. This often led to the identification, development and/or refinement of other themes. Intersectional analyses were performed in NVivo by conducting matrix queries. 19 Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 18 Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 19 Results: Cross-sectional survey of complementary medicine users Study Population Response rate A total of 947 people agreed to participate in the survey. The overall response rate for the survey was 42%. Respondents were initia lly asked the following question to assess whether they were complementary medicine users: 'Which of th e following CMs have you used in the last 12 months'. Table 2 presents the categories of CMs used and the number and proportion of the respondents using each category of these CMs. The five most common responses were: vitamins not prescribed by a doctor (46.3%) followed by other natural medicines from fish or animals (29.5%), herbal teas (29.1% ), mineral supplements not prescribed by a doctor (26.3%) and other herbal medicines (19.4%).

The remaining 612 (64.6%) respondents were considered to be 'complementary medicines users' and completed the survey. The characteristics of the 612 CMs users who completed the survey were compared with the Australian population 22 in Table 3. CMs use is more likely among Australian women. There were no other statistically significant differences between the demographics of the survey respondents and the Australian population, except for language spoken at home. More users reporte d their health to be excellent or very good, although this was not statistically significant (Table 4).

The vast majority of users (85%) had taken at least one of these products in the last 12 months. The five most common selected CM s taken were fish oil (48.9%), vitamin B (39.1%), zinc (27.8%), glucosamine and St John's wort (7.7%) were the CMs used least commonly by respondents (Table 6).

CMs were most commonly purchased in pha rmacies (51.3%), supermarkets (32.5%) or health food shops (32.2%) (Table 9). Table 9.

Around two-thirds of CMs users had used a compleme ntary medicine on the same day as having either a prescription medication and/or an over-the-counter medicine. Respondents who used CMs with either a pres cription medicine or an over-the-counter medicine on the same day (referred to in this report as CMs-conventional medicines users) differed from those who did not use CMs with these other medicines (CMs only users) in the following ways: CMs-conventional medicines us ers were more likely to be female (75% vs. 55%, p<0.001) than CMs only users. Although not statistically significant, mo re CMs-conventional medicines users reported fair or poor health (13% vs. 6%, p= 0.018) compared to CMs only users. One-third of CMs-conventional medicines us ers were high users of CMs (i.e. used five or more CMs), while only around 20% of CMs only users were high CMs users. CMs-conventional medicines users and CMs only users had similar perceptions for three of the four safety questions aske d. More CMs-conventional medicines users agreed or strongly agreed th at CMs can 'cause dangerous side effects' than CMs only users (45% vs. 34%, p<0.01). CMs-conventional medicines users also sought information about CMs more frequently than CMs only users (53% vs . 35%, p<0.001) and more often reported looking for information about risks and side effects (28% vs. 16%, p<0.01). More CMs-conventional medicine user s reported seeking information from conventional health professionals: docto rs (38% vs. 24%, assistants (26% vs. 12%, p=0.001) than CMs only users. Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 26 Discussing the use of complementary medicines with a doctor Only 50% of respondents reported having me ntioned or discussed their use of CMs with a doctor. The majority of respondents (86. 8%) stated that they were either very or somewhat confident discussing CMs with their local doctor or GP (Figure 2). Figure 2. Confidence in discussing complementary medicines with GPs, NPS Complementary Medicines Consum er Survey, 2007 (n=612) What users know about the complementary medicines they were using The survey asked users about the reasons or conditions for which they used selected CMs. General health was a common reason for using many of the selected CMs: (78.7%); oral vitamin E (73.2%); and zinc (61.2%). Many CMs users gave specific reasons for using their CMs. Most users were taking CMs for conditions where there is some evidence to support their use. See Table 10 for details about the reasons for the use of selected CMs. Around 70% of people using black cohosh, 54% of people using gingko biloba and 55% of people using echinacea reported usi ng them for reasons where there is some evidence. However, 18% to 50% of people reported using these three CMs for general health, or for reasons where there is no evid ence, or that they were uncertain about the reasons for their use. 010203040506070 Very confident Somewhat confident Not confident Level of confidence% of respondentsInformation Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 27 Table 10.

Most users actively used CMs. When read the following statement 'I only use natural medicines and health products as a last resort', 71.1% of respondents disagreed or strongly disagreed with this statement, 20. 5% agreed or strongly agreed and 7.2% neither agreed or disagreed. Advantages and disadvantages of using complementary medicines Respondents were asked what they thought th e main advantages and disadvantages of using natural medicines and health products were. The five most common advantages of using CMs were: 'natural', better than taking drugs/fewer chemicals, effective/seems to work/helps general health and wellbeing and not many side effects/gentle for the body (Table 11). Only three percent of respondents thought that CMs had no advantages. Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 29 Table 11.

When asked what the disadvantages of CMs were, only 3% of CMs users reported side effect s and 5% mentioned 'problems mixing with other medicines' (Table 12). Conversely, when directly asked about their perceptions of the safety of CMs over 40% of CMs users supported statements about CM s being 'risky' or having dangerous side effects and 15% to 20% were uncertain (F igure 3). More than 40% of CMs users thought CMs were safe to give to children and almost half thought that CMs were less risky than prescription medicines.

Perceptions of the safety of co mplementary medicines, NPS Complementary Medicines Consumers Survey 2007 Perceptions about testing of complementary medicines More than half of respondents (52%) thought that CMs were independently tested by a government agency such as the TGA. Of those who thought they were tested, one-quarter thought they were tested for quality, three-quarters thought they were tested for safety, and one-third thought th ey were tested for efficacy or for what they claim to do (Table 13).

Table 20 provides a full list of CMs user preferences for information sources. Although almost 30% of CMs users used la bels, package inserts and pamphlets for information about CMs in the last 12 months, only a very small proportion (7%) preferred these as a source of CMs information.

These numbers refer to the number of parti cipants who had one or more responses coded to that item theme (the first num ber) and the number of different ways participants reported the finding (the second number). For example, 'how CMs work (2, 4)' means that two participants mention that they wanted to know how CMs work and there were four different res ponses that were coded. These figures provide the reader with an understanding of how themes developed. Participants Twenty-four participants were interviewed; one interview was interrupted and was not completed but was included in the analysis; fi ve interviews were later excluded from the analysis due to poor quality of the audio recordings. Of the remaining sample of 19, six participan ts had used one or more CMs over the last 12 months ('low users'), six had used betwee n two and four CMs over the same period ('medium users') and six had used five or more ('high users'). One participant was uncertain as to how many she had used, but would have been categorised as either a low or medium user (Table 31). Of the 19 participants where data was availa ble, six were male and 13 female. Seven participants lived in Sydney, nine in Mel bourne and three in Launceston. Participants were evenly distributed by age, ranging from 24 to 80 years. Of the six high users, four were currently seeing a complementary therapist and two had seen one in the past. Half of the me dium users and low users had seen a complementary therapist in the past; the ot her half of both groups had never seen a complementary therapist. The high level themes identified during the analysis were: Information needs. Information seeking strategies. Information sources. Safety and harmlessness. Purpose of CMs. Evidence of effectiveness. Enhancing the effectiveness of CMs: combinations. Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 46 Table 31.

No information needs Nine participants reported having no information needs regarding CMsb. Of particular interest were the ways in which they desc ribed why they did not need information (9, 15). These included the trus t in professional opinion: No, to answer your question, no. Because it 's prescribed by a qualified person, so I'm no expert on it. So I leave it in the hands of the expert. (69-yr-old, male, low user) b However, participants may have raised information needs in topi cal discussion, such as in the context of current CMs. Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 47 Really, it's a matter of the chemist has got the knowledge, I don't. Do what the person with the knowledge says. It's not a sheep station but you know, it if works that's good, if it doesn't work, I gotta do something else. But it's worthwhile giving it a try. (47-yr-old, male, low user) For some, their responses appear ed to relate to their trust in CMs in general (which is corroborated by intersectional findings): I don't ever question what the quantity is or anything . (40-yr-old, female, high user) One participant mentioned not requiring a sophisticated depth of information: I haven't had the need to get right into it and do searches on the computer. (39- yr-old, male, low user) (investigator emphasis) Information needs Responses from those who had informat ion needs about CMs related to both information content and information format. Participants were directly asked 'What do you want to know about complementary medicines?' The findings for this theme were derived mainly from descriptive analyses, i.e. what participants said in response to the questioning by the interviewer. The interviews reiterated some of the types of information reported in the survey. These included: contra-indications and interactions (3, 4); side effects (1, 1); expense (1, 1); how to manage lethargy (1, 2); and educat ion and information about CMs generally (2, 2). The qualitative research also found additiona l types of information participants needed. These included: how CMs work (2, 3); ingredients or origins (2, 3); long-term impact (1, 1); and new research about getting th e most benefit from CMs (1, 1). Two participants were interested to know how CMs worked . This included how they might interact with other health-related factors to produce the desired outcomes: So if there was that information like, you know eat broccoli and have this calcium, that will give you more concentration or help with your healing or whatever. (24-yr- old, female high user) One respondent was interested to know what new research there was about the best dose of Vitamin C to use: I think I would want to know more detaile d research that might suggest that ... you might be able to absorb and use 1000mg of vitamin C and ... that might be doing you more good. So by taking more it's something that is better than taking the minimum amount and the recommended daily intake . (41-yr-old, male, high user) (investigator emphasis) Information format Information about preferred format of in formation was elicited through spontaneous responses from a small number of participants and in discussions of what they wanted to know about CMs. One respondent noted wanting information in a paper form that she could find at a reliable source - in her case, the pharmacy - a nd take it home to be read at her leisure (1, 2). Three participants described need ing more information on labels and the packaging of complementary products (3, 4). Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 48 Information seeking strategies Participants were asked about how they find information about CMs in three ways: how they find out about CMs in general; how they had found information about the CMs they currently used, or had used in the pa st; and via a hypothetical question asking how they would seek information about the use of CMs for migraines. The involvement of other people is critical in locating information about CMs. Participants most often approached other people (8, 15) when seeking information on CMs: I always talk to people. Definitely talk to people. That would be something like finding out say from neighbours, friends, family. (56-yr-old, female, medium user) How participants sought information from ot her people depended on the nature of the information they were seeking. Actively approaching other people (as the above example demonstrates) most often occurre d when people had specific information needs. Now that you ask me these questions, there was a bottle that I bought that made me feel depressed and I'm not a depressi ve person. And when I asked the chemist about it he said that particular brand had so mething in it - I can't think of the word at the moment, and it was like - almost like a sleeping pill. (69-yr-old, female, medium user) So I actually asked a GP about these multivitamin tablets. (69-yr-old, male, low user) When describing their past and current expe riences of using CMs, participants most often reported learning about CMs through a more 'passive' process . 'Word of mouth' featured in a number of repo rts (8, 15), particularly in relation to recommendations of particular CMs: Oh, just usually word of mouth. That [t ea for general wellbeing] was one that was recommended to me from my boyfriend's moth er who's very much into herbal teas. (24-yr-old, female, high user) I just heard about it somewhere. (25-yr-old, female, medium user) Participants who regularly consulted a natu ropath were more active in seeking information and usually sought advice from their naturopath first. The presence of a naturopath appeared to largely 'cancel out' the need to consult other sources: Interviewer: Is there anywhere else other than the naturopath that you've sought advice or information on that area specifically? No. I've found her. She's my source. (35-yr-old, female, high user) Some participants (4, 11) described seeking in formation from a variety of sources and in an almost step-wise progression that involved seeking out several sources : ...you know like the reference found at the internet, and then you go to someone who knew something about eating, diet. (24-yr-old, female, high user) (investigator emphasis) ....if there's something in the newspaper I'll have a squiz at it, and next time I see the naturopath I'll ask her about it. (35-yr-old, female, high user) Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 49 Information sources Participants were asked directly where and/ or from whom they had sought information about CMs and information was also elicited when discussing other aspects of CMs. As with survey respondents, in-depth interview participants reported seeking information from friends and family, health food shop workers, pharmacists, GPs, the Internet, magazines, newspapers, books , packaging labels, TV and radio. Additional information sources raised by participants in the qualitative component include: catalogues and other company pr oduced information, company websites, formal study in related areas, letterbox drops, their own professional experience, and written information from health professiona ls (both conventional and complementary practitioners). Consistent with findings throughout the in-depth interviews and the survey, ' other people ' were found to be a common source of information (8, 21). This included family, friends, pharmacis ts and GPs: People tell me... (80-yr-old, female, low user) All the grandmothers would tell you what to do. And we'd use them. (65-yr-old, female, medium user) From a friend ... just at the club where I work. (47-yr-old, male, low user) I think a lot of it is family knowledge, what she [mum] has learnt from her mother. (24-yr-old, female, high user) I have a good friend who's a dietician and she talks me through a lot of the combinations of certain minerals and that sort of thing. (24-yr-old, female, high user) Interviewer: How do you decide who to talk to about various conditions? Word of mouth is a really big thing. (35-yr-old, female, high user) Qualitative data illuminated the ways in which print media (magazines and newspapers) were source d for information (10, 21). For the most part, this source of information provided general information that participants did not actively seek. While some made a point of reading regular altern ative health supplements, they generally did not seek information from print media when looking for specific information on a complementary medicine that ha d current relevance to them. When participants were asked a scenario question about what they would do to find information for migraines, the vast majority said they would go to the Internet first. Participants reported accessing Google, blogs , government sites and natural therapy association sites: The first thing that I would do, I would go to the Internet and look for information. It's the biggest source of information . (24-yr-old, female, high user) Packaging labels were another commonly mentioned source of information (7, 15): ...the dosage is on the packet and ... you don't really need to go and talk to someone if you have that. (24-yr-old, female, high user) I have a look at the information on the packet , the fish oil I look for what sort of fish oil, whether its genetically modified, if its or ganic and all that sort of stuff. So I get as much information as I can from the packaging. (35-yr-old, female, high user) Well I think, certainly if you self medicate you've got to be aware of reading the labels of products that you're consuming. (56-yr-old, male, medium user) Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 50 Assessing the reliability a nd credibility of website information When participants stated that th ey used the Internet as a source of information on CMs, they were asked how they asse ssed the reliability and credib ility of the information they find. While five participants gave 13 res ponses, no pattern was evident in how they assess the reliability of websites - although a ll five were able to give a ready answer. One theme, repetition of the information ac ross different websites, was repeated by four respondents. Responses included: the provision of links to other, reliabl e sources such as journals, well-known organisations and a range of other prof essionals (24-yr-old, female, high user) a government website (56-yr-old, female , medium user; response to direct prompting) reputation of the organisation (25-yr-old, female, low user) the presentation of the website ( 41-yr-old , male, high user; 25-yr-old, female, low user) published research found through Google and a 'repetition' of information (41-yr- old, male, high user) detailed accounts on blogs and foru ms (41-yr-old, male, high user) having heard about the content of the webs ite previously (25-yr-old, female, low user) repetition of information across sites: si tes are reputable (40-yr-old, female, high user) Australian sites (40-yr-o ld, female, high user). The perceived safety and harmlessness of complementary medicines No respondent reported having concerns a bout the safety of CMs when directly questioned. Participants genera lly regarded CMs as being safe to use. When asked their reasons for believing CMs to be safe, many responses reflec ted a perception that there were few, if any, risks associated with dosage (7, 19). While there was some awareness of potential problems, participants generally considered overdoses to be impossible or rare. When discussing dosage, potential problems ra ised related to the 'potency' of the medicine and official sanction. CMs are consid ered to be 'less potent' than conventional medicines (5, 6), particularly if taken in limited amounts: Well I mean, well like anything else you have to be very careful but they're not as concentrated. They're on a, more a long-term basis and they're taken and natural medicines going to be six months be fore you really get any good result. (80-yr-old, female, low user) ...but otherwise you take just in moderation so they're okay. (35-yr-old, female, high user) Some participants assumed that an official body of some kind would control or prevent the entry of CMs into the market if they were not safe (4, 4): Well I think to myself if it wasn't sa fe they wouldn't be selling it you know. (64-yr- old, female, low user) A number of participants mentioned the reputati on (4, 8) and quality (5, 9) of a brand of CMs in response to questions concerning sa fety and harmlessness. During analysis, Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 51 responses concerning 'reputation' and 'qualit y' appeared to reflect similar underlying values. Intersectional analyses also show ed these were linked to well-known brand names (7, 13) or being sold in a majority of stores: I didn't go by price because I didn't get the lowest one. I think I just got the one that looked like a decent brand. (56-yr-old, female, medium user) No I think I just bought Blackmores because they're a well known brand. (65-yr-old, female, medium user) Probably what it was and I just thought it's a known brand, yeah it was the Myadec and they've got a good name. (56-yr-old, female, medium user) Oh look, I think the fact that there's a majori ty of shops that sell it and have it on the shelves. So therefore, if it's on the shelf and it's a reputable brand, they wouldn't be allowed to sell it if there were side effects or people were having problems from it. (39-yr-old, male, low user) Many participants expressed a number of reasons why they felt that CMs were safe . One participant had experiences with CMs that served as a basis for her 'misconception'of the safety of CMs: And it's quite difficult to overdose on things like ironc and I know Vitamin C can give you a bit of an upset tummy because when I was six, I ate a cup full them. (38-yr- old, female, medium user)d When a health professional advises that a higher dose can be taken than the one recommended on the label, then this can imply that CMs are safe: I don't think it's got here if you can have t oo much of it .... it says on this you can only have one a day but my doc tor told me to have two. (56-yr-old, female, medium user) Participants consider CMs to be 'natural' and thus safe: Interviewer: ... How do you think you'd know if you were taking too much? I don't know but I would think I would proba bly be alright because they're natural. (56-yr-old, as above) Interviewer: ... any concerns there about them interacting? Not really, I don't really think about it when they're natural things. (25-yr-old, female, low user) Some participants who reported having ha d side effects from CMs were not as confident in these preparations. Three olde r female, medium users had all experienced side effects, including blurred vision and depressive symptoms. One reported discontinuing use on the advice of her GP . One male low user reported experiencing reflux with a particular brand of fish oil, but solved the problem by finding a brand that did not have this side effect. Another wa s aware of potential harmful interactions between CMs and conventiona l medicines, although most respondents who discussed combinations felt this was positive in that it enhanced their effectiveness (this is discussed later in this report). c Iron if taken in excess is toxic. d Interestingly, this pa rticipant reported that the cup of Vitamin C pills did, in fact, make her \"really ill\". It would appear that merely feel ing ill is not a sign that the CM is unsafe. Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 52 One older, male, low user reported that if he was on any conventional medications, he would ask his doctor about taking CMs. No other participant spontaneously discussed using complementary and convention al medications simultaneously. The reasons for using complementary medicines Participants were not questioned about the purpose of CMs per se ; this aspect of CMs emerged as an important area for investigation as the research progressed. Some participants reported resorting to CMs when conventional medicine had failed them in some way (5, 7): I think I might have had a few reactions to certain drugs so I tend to trust the natural things more. (56-yr-old, female, medium user) When I had my accident the medical profe ssion wrote me off and gave me a very depressing future. And I got seriously de pressed about that because there was no hope. So I had to explore an alternative. I was so depressed I couldn't get out of bed.... Luckily, I tried everything and f ound some things that helped. People had written me off. (41-yr-old, male, high user) Other participants used CMs to treat or manage a condition and described numerous ways in which they did this (6, 16): The reason why my husband went on to na tural medicines is because he's an epileptic. (60-yr-old, female, high user) I was lacking iron ... the doctor said to me , 'you don't eat red meat' so I was lacking in Vitamin B. (65-yr-old, female, medium user) Some participants described CMs as providi ng a 'back-up' where their otherwise healthy lifestyles may be temporarily lacking: You know that fact that if we have a me al with no nutrition in it, you know that you've had your multivitamin or had your B Complex for the day. (39-yr-old, male, low user) Similarly, CMs could also 'make up for' their lifestyle practices that may be permanently lacking in some way (4, 7): Fish is a good brain food. So I take the oil, because I don't like fish. (69-yr-old, female, medium user) But again reading it because Australians ar e very deficient in fish oil because we don't eat enough fish. So, and I think there' s a strong recommendation in all this and articles I've read that people actually should be taking fish oil supplements. We don't eat enough fish. (56-yr-old, male, medium user) Three participants discussed CMs as supporting their overall, day-to-day functioning . This was particularly the case for one participant who worked two jobs and had young children. He described a numbe r of purposes in this respect, such as being able to get things done, supporting memory and working effectively (3, 8): Functioning. Day-to-day chores (39-yr-old, male, low user) Helps with getting by as well as working a normal job. (39-yr-old, male, low user) Vitamins just get you through. (25-yr-old, female, medium user) A similarly holistic perception of the purpose of CMs can be described as general health and/or wellbeing , including how they made participants 'feel' (4, 4): You just feel clearer and energised. (41-yr-old, male, higher user) Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 53 One participant, a 56-yr-old, female, medium user, who worked with children, reported using CMs to prevent illness: Well I don't know I'm just assuming it work s I mean with my job ... I'm hoping it will keep the germs away you know with the ki ds sort of close to you, and for physical wellbeing but I haven't had a lot of time off work so it must be working. Three participants described using CMs in particularly busy or stressful times , where they required peak performance from themselves (3, 7): ...there's been long days we stand on our feet... so we do get tired and we find that the vitamins help get you through. (39-yr-old, male, low user) A number of participants described CMs as supporting their already healthy lifestyles (3, 4), effectively giving them an ex tra boost in terms of their health: That means that these are things that you would take in addition to what you would normally be eating or what normally would be prescribed for you by a doctor. It would support your general health regime. (56-yr-old, male, medium user) Evidence of effectiveness Participants did not specifically report n eeding information on 'effectiveness'. When asked directly how they decide a CM wo rks or when spontaneously describing it themselves, the only information source that figures is to 'talk to other people'. Results for this section have been drawn fro m participants' open descriptions of the CMs they currently use and CMs they have used in the past. They spoke in depth about how they assessed and determined effectiveness; what constitutes evidence of effectiveness; and who is involved. Assessing effectiveness Participants often assessed the effectiven ess of the CMs they took by their own experience. This most often involved a process of 'trial and error' (8, 10): Some things you don't mind giving a go, $15 or 20 bucks. Fish oil, well, OK I'll try that. (41-yr-old, male, high user) ... we both have the same problem so we both try it and see how it works. (69-yr- old, male, low user) Some participants ceased taking CMs they had been taking for some time (4, 6): Well, we have run out befo re and we haven't bought them and you sort of tend to feel that, you notice things more or less sort of seize them up. (39-yr-old, male, low user) One participant, reported undertaking a personal 'systematic trial', which appeared to be a more considered and formalised approach to trial and error: I think that you've got to, you've really got to conduct your own clinical trial. You've got to take them over a period of time and then you make an assessment over a period of one month, three months and ev en six months and beyond and see when you feel better. (56-yr-old, male, medium user) Effectiveness: who is involved and how? 'Talking to people' was a common form of assessing effectiveness (11, 37), and was undertaken with a variety of people. Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 54 Informal networks figured strongly as a sour ce of information, they also appeared prominently as a means for assessing the effe ctiveness of CMs (3, 11). However, health care professionals (both c onventional and alternative) were also predominant in assessing effectiveness (8, 19): Well for starters this was a qualified doctor and he's practicing in Chinese medicine - he had all the qualifications so I put my faith in them otherwise you would not use them. (69-yr-old, male, low user) Well I ask whoever has recommended any pr oduct, and I ask the chemist and I don't buy any old thing. (80-yr-old, female, low user) Through a good naturopath who will give you a good product, like the echinacea I don't just buy off the shelf. I get the prac titioners echinacea in a bottle which they mix up themselves. (41-yr-old, male, high user) What constitutes 'evidence'? Participants primarily consider their own experience as evidence of the effectiveness of CMs. Evidence includes the absence of illne ss (1, 2), such as not getting a cold over winter; results of medical tests (2, 2), such as iron tests; and havi ng had previous success with a CM (4, 5). Visible evidence (5, 7) was another source of evidence, which could mean a reduction in swelling, a family memb er telling them they were 'looking better', or having stronger nails. However, participant s had many more ways to describe how they noticed an improvement in the way they felt (8, 27): I think it did. Yeah. There were significa nt differences every day I woke up I was feeling better. (80-yr-old, female, low user) It wasn't this swollen, it wasn't as red and it wasn't as sore. So for me that's successful. (69-yr-old, female, medium user) I'll find that it might not take all the sympto ms away but it will at least alleviate it and psychologically it help s as well. So it works on the sort of relaxing. (40-yr-old, female, high user) One participant (24-yr-old, female, high user) also reported judging the effectiveness of a particular CM by its condition - its taste, 'fre shness' or age - and also its origins (local or Australian products were c onsidered more trustworthy). A number of participants had faith in the long histories of use of particular CMs (4, 7): I have a lot of belief in the old-fashioned use of medicines . (69-yr-old, male, low user) We call them primitive people - but I don't th ink they are primitive at all and I think China too - don't forget China has had a hi story or culture that goes back further than our own culture so there must be some truth in some of these things.... would not have happened over night. (69-yr-old, male, low user) And they've been doing that for hundreds of years so it can't be much wrong with it. (80-yr-old, female, low user) And that was, we're talking, you know more than 35 years ago. So there was evidence then about the importance of ce rtain vitamin supplemen ts then. So, yeah, I'm sure that there must be a store of know ledge that those sorts of things do in fact work. (56-yr-old, male, medium user) Two participants discussed media reports as being evidence of CMs effectiveness. One participant discussed hearing good reports on ginseng on talk-back radio, which positively influenced her decision to use the preparation. Another participant felt that stories in print about the effects of CMs ne eded to be supported by a research study: Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 55 Yeah, I'm always looking for some, there's got to be some credibility to what I'm reading. I'll be attracted to a headline in a magazine or in a newspaper and I'll read further and read with intent and purpose but unless there's something that sort of verifies the study then, you know, you're rather dismissive of it. (56-yr-old, male, medium user) Another participant mentioned research as a s ource of evidence for effectiveness, albeit briefly: And again it's a company self-promoting but they do have a lot of research to back up. (40-yr-old, female, high user) Evidence of ineffectiveness Results presented thus far could give the impression that participants had complete confidence in CMs. However, some partici pants expressed some reason to doubt CMs. Again, this was based on their personal ex perience. For these participants, a CM had resulted in no apparent improv ement or change (4, 7), or the experience of a side effect (4, 8). One respondent gave an interesting and clear reason as to why she sees a naturopath; for reasons very different to those for which she would need evidence of effectiveness: Interviewer: Is it a concern for you that this isn't evidence based? I get my comfort from the naturopath, and in some respects that's what I'm paying for. It would be nice to have it (the evidence). (40-yr-old, female, high user) Enhancing the effectiveness of complementary medicines: combinations Participants often talked about taking CMs 'in combination' with other CMs, with conventional medicines, with diet or lifestyle ac tivities or taking CMs with multiple active ingredients. Higher order analyses showed th at participants often gave these responses in answer to questions about quality or 'how they work'. Such combinations were nearly always viewed as being positive and believed to enhance the effectiveness of CMs. Combinations of active ingredients, or taking different CMs together, were nearly always believed to add to the effectivene ss and/or the 'potency' of a CM (5, 12): I think it's one of those ones where you' ve got to have it in combination with something or I don't think it's been developed to its full potential yet. (24-yr-old, female, high user) Apparently zinc works well with vitamin C. If you have the flu there is a synergistic effect there where you need the two, much better to get a combination sometimes. (41-yr-old, male, high user) Yeah and that seemed to ... the combination of the echinacea and that was fantastic. ... I could feel a noticeable difference. (24-yr-old, female, high user) Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 56 However, some combination products were se en to be ineffective because of the low doses of some constituents: Sometimes those multivitamins are just useless because they have the wrong combination of things. The iron count is so low that there's no point in taking them. (24-yr-old, female, high user) One high CMs user mentioned that combinati ons of active ingredients may be most effective when tailored to the individual by a professional: They can also tailor the product to you, wher eas if you go to the shelf it's a bit more hit and miss. Whereas they can look at you a little bit more and make an assessment to what combination. (41-yr-old, male, high user) A combination of CMs and lifestyle factors, pa rticularly diet, was also a strategy that a number of participants believed enhanced CM s. This was also something that two participants wanted to know more about: So if there was that information like, you know eat broccoli and have this calcium, that will give you more concentration or help with your healing or whatever . (24-yr- old, female, high user) It seems to be working okay along with th e other things that you use you know the physio and the orthotics . (56-yr-old, fema le, medium user) Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 57 Discussion This study used a multi-method approach to understanding the use of CMs and the information needs and preferences of cons umers who used CMs. Participants were randomly selected both to participate in the su rvey and also in the in-depth interviews, thus providing a snapshot of the use of CMs across the Australian adult population. This study differed from many previous CMs st udies using open-ended interview methods, which have narrowly focused on consumers with serious illnesses, or samples of hospital inpatients or emergency department attendees. 8,24-26 Use of complementary medicines International studies report that CMs users ar e more likely to be female, aged 25 to 44 years and have higher inco me and education levels.27-29 Although more females than males used CMs in our study, other socio-de mographic characteristics appeared similar to Australian population, suggesting that CM s use is growing among a broader range of the population. A significant proportion of consumers survey ed may be taking CMs inappropriately. Almost two-thirds of CMs users have used them with conventional medicines on the same day. Many appear to be unaware of the potential interactions that may occur. Some report being uncertain about why they are using them, say they use them for general health, to gain more energy or f eel less fatigued or for uses that are not supported by evidence. Consumers do not appear to adequately disc uss the use of CMs with their doctor or pharmacist. Thus health professionals may be unaware of CMs use when recommending treatments that may interact with some CMs. Attitudes to complementary medicines Postmodern values are thought to play a significant role in the attraction of individuals to CMs and therapies.30,31 These values encompass a range of beliefs around the concepts of holism, 'natural', indi vidual responsibility and consumerism.26,30-35 This research found similar beliefs and atti tudes among the Australian participants. The in-depth interviews demonstrated how this holistic view of health is intertwined with everyday practices and incidents. CM s were used in conjunction with, not in isolation from, other strategies for ac hieving and maintaining good health. Some participants described CMs as providing a 'back-up' where their otherwise healthy lifestyles may be temporarily lacking, while others disc ussed CMs as supporting their overall day-to-day functioning, particularly wh en life is pressured, such as working two jobs and raising young children. Thirty percent of CMs users surveyed reported that one of the advantages of CMs is that they are 'natural' and another 30% reported they are 'better than taking drugs' or 'had fewer chemicals'. This perception was also found in the in-depth interviews, where the perception of CMs being 'natural' was equa ted with a perceived safety of CMs in overdose and lack of interact ions with other medicines. Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 58 Consumerism may also play a role in the i ndividual's choice to use CMs. The in-depth interviews found that the reputation and qua lity of particular brands were linked to participants' perceptions of the safety a nd harmlessness of CMs. The brands that participants felt were 'good' or 'reputab le' were well-known, having large advertising budgets. This reputation appeared to infl uence the purchasing decision of many participants. Perceptions of the safety of complementary medicines As reflected by the different way CMs are regulated in Australia compared to conventional medicines, most CMs are safe to use in the recommended dose. However, CMs are medicines and consumers using some CMs may experience side effects and/or interactions with other medi cines. Harm may also arise when people delay the use of effective conventional treatmen ts for a serious medical c ondition, or have allergic reactions to CMs. CMs are low risk, not no risk. Forty percent of Australian CMs users su rveyed thought that CMs were tested independently by the government for safety or side effects. Some participants in the in- depth interviews assumed that an official body of some kind would control or prevent the entry of CMs into the market if they were not safe. When asked what the disadvantages of CMs were, only 3% of CMs users reported side effects and 5% mentioned 'problems mixing wi th other medicines'. When directly asked about their perceptions of the safety of CMs, 40% to 50% of CMs users supported statements about the safety of CMs and 15% to 22% of users were uncertain about their safety. Of concern is that more than 40% of CMs users thought it was safe to give CMs to children. Although this may be true fo r most CMs marketed to children, it may not be true for other CMs or where higher doses than recommended are used. Participants in the in-depth interviews genera lly regarded CMs as being safe to use. CMs were not considered as 'potent' or strong as conventional medicines, particularly if taken in limited amounts. These results are in keeping with previous research showing that many users have a limited knowledge of the risks of some CMs, including potential interactions with other medicines and do not consider that they may have adverse effects. 3,36-38 Perceptions about the effectiveness of complementary medicines One in six CMs users believed that CMs were independently tested by the governments for effectiveness. Twenty-four percent of Au stralian CMs users reported that advantages of CMs included that they 'were effective ', 'seemed to work' or 'were helpful'. High users of CMs more frequently report their effectiveness (34%) compared with low/moderate users (24%). Whe n asked about the disadvantages of CMs in our survey, only 12% of CMs users reported 'l ack of research', or c linically tested' 'less effective' or 'not enough information'. Australian and overseas research indicates that concerns around the effectiveness of CMs do not appear to correlate with dissatisfaction with or discontinuation of CMs use.25,26,39-41 The in-depth interviews showed that 'talking to people' was the most common form of assessing the effectiveness of CMs, and was undertaken in a variety of ways. Participants said they also assessed the effectiveness of the CMs through their own experience. This could involve a process of 'trial and error '. This finding suggests that effectiveness is important to consumers but that many cons umers conceptualise it differently to a clinical trial evidence for effectiveness. Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 59 Consumer Information seeking about complementary medicines Passive vs. active info rmation gathering An important finding from the in-depth interv iews was that much CMs information is not actively sought by consumers, but ac quired without necessarily having specific information needs. How participants sought information from other people depended on the nature of the information they were seeking. Actively approaching other people most often occurred when people had specific information needs, particularly if they had experienced a negative outcome when using a CM. However, when describing their previous expe rience of CMs and their current CMs use, participants most often reported learning a bout CMs through a more passive process. 'Word of mouth' featured in a number of reports, particularly in relation to recommendations of particular CMs. Much of the use of media sources reported by in- depth interview participants follows a si milar pattern: reading of newspaper supplements and magazine articl es and listening to radio segments are part of a regular pastime, rather than a direct way of obtaining answers to particular questions. Those who currently had a regular naturopath were more acti ve in seeking information, and sought advice from their naturopath fi rst. Consumers who see a naturopath use them as their pre-eminent source of in formation. Additionally, some participants described seeking information from a variet y of sources in an almost step-wise progression that involved se eking out several sources. Type of complementary medici nes information looked for Of the survey respondents who looked for in formation, the most common things they wanted to find out were: benefits (56.4%), re ason for use (41.1%), side effects or risks (24.2%), dose, e.g. how much or how often to take it (15.6%), and effects if taken with other medicines (11.5%). In-depth intervie w respondents also wanted to know about costs, how CMs work, ingredients or origins, and long-term impact and how to get the most benefit from CMs. US consumers repor ted similar types of information were important in making a decision to use herbal supplements: indications, side effects, content, dosage, interactions, and safety. However, consumers in the US mentioned clinical trials and effectiveness more fr equently than consumers from Australia.42 Sources of complementary medicines information used Over 50% of respondents reporte d talking to family and friends (54.9%) or using the Internet to find information about CMs. Around one-third of respondents had talked with a health food shop worker, pharmacist, or doctor/general practitioner or read a magazine or package insert/label/pamphl ets to find information about CMs. Almost one third of CMs users also reported seeking information about CMs from a range of complementary th erapists including: naturopaths/western herbalists; chiropractors/osteopaths; the information prov ided by these practitioners was highly regarded by CMs users, we know little about the CMs knowledge and information needs of these groups of practitioners. Magazines were a common source of information, while TV and radio media were rarely mentioned (1.6%). In previous studies in Au stralia and overseas, the media was noted as the second, third or fourth most common source of information.25,42,44-48 Wilkinson et al reported newspapers (22%), television/radi o (22%), and magazines (21%) were the types of media used in a survey of 300 consumers in rural New South Wales in 2000.45 Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 60 Most respondents who used an information source rated it as very or fairly useful. This included magazines, newspapers, and the In ternet, suggesting that not all users may have the skills to discern or assess the quality of the information from such sources. The in-depth interviews identified that th e print and radio media provided general information of interest that CMs users could draw upon as needed. For example, a favoured health-related ra dio segment or newspaper supplement on health and wellbeing may be accessed regularly. The Internet as an information source for complementary medicines Easton et al found only five studies about In ternet use for CMs and reported only a small percentage of consumers were access ing CMs information from this source.49 The NPS CMs survey revealed that more than 50% of CMs users who sought CMs information in the last 12 months have accessed the Intern et for CMs information, and one-quarter of them have searched for this information seve ral times a month or more often. Most sites reported as favourites for information on CM s were industry sponsored sites, raising concerns about the quality and independence of the information provided. Preferred sources of complementary medicines information Overall, CMs users most often reported docto rs, the Internet and pharmacists as their preferred sources of information. Although almost 30% of CMs users used labels, package inserts and pamphlets for informati on about CMs in the last 12 months, only a very small proportion of survey respondents (7%) preferred these as a source of CMs information. Package labels were a common source of information for the in-depth interview participants. Many reported that they looked at the label to gain most of the information they needed. Strengths and weaknesses of the study This is the first Australian study to us e a mixed method approach to assess the information needs and preferences of Au stralian consumers who use CMs. This approach allowed for a large random sample of CMs users across Australia to be contacted and surveyed and the collecti on of more detailed information from a randomly selected sub-sample of thos e with varying levels of CMs use. Information could then be triangulated to gi ve a richer understanding of how a range of CMs users seek or gain information and how th ey make decisions about the use of CMs. As with all telephone surveys, some people cannot be contacted or may be unwilling or unable to participate, and may differ in CMs us e from those included in the survey This may be due to not having a landline telephone , language difficulties, being very ill, being institutionalised or not being interested in the survey topic or in participating in surveys generally. When the socio-demographic characteristics of the survey participants were compared with the Australian populati on, they were very similar except for language spoken at home and gender. This ma y be explained in part by the survey only being conducted in English, a nd women being more likely than men to participate in surveys generally. Another limitation of the study is that it focussed on CMs users and did not canvas the attitudes, information needs of those who do not use CMs. This is an important area for further research. Information Use and Needs of Compleme ntary Medicines Users - December 2008 61 Conclusions This report shows that those who use CMs think differently about CMs compared to conventional medicines, particularly prescrip tion medicines. Many consumers saw their CMs use as 'natural' and part of a holistic view of health. CMs were often used in conjunction with other strategies for ac hieving and maintaining good health and supporting the performance of everyday tasks. The research reveals that many users associ ated 'natural' with CMs being harmless and unlikely to cause any advers e effects. However, although most CMs have few risks, some consumers may experience the potenti al harms of some CMs including allergic reactions, side effects and possible inte ractions with conventional medicines. CMs users apply both passive and active me ans to seek information about CMs. CMs information is often communicated passive ly through informal conversations with family, friends and acquaintances and print media. They also reported actively seeking CMs information from a variety of sources in cluding family and friends, the Internet, health food shop workers, pharmacists, ma gazines, doctors/general practitioners, package inserts/labels/pamphlets and a va riety of complementary therapists. Respondents reported that the CMs information resources they used were fairly useful or very useful. This included magazines, ne wspapers, and the Internet where the quality of the content and independence of the in formation may vary substantially. Users appeared to often accept information from th ese sources and then evaluate the effects of the CM through trial and error. In most ca ses this may be appropriate, but it may not necessarily mean that CMs are being used in the most safe and effective manner. Strategies to improve deci sions by consumers about CMs should focus on enhancing CMs information resources preferred by cons umers including doctors, the Internet and pharmacists. The information available must be able to meet consumers' needs and provide independent, balanced and high qualit y information in an easily accessible format. Strategies are also needed to impr ove consumer skills in assessing the risks and benefits of using CMs. Further research is needed to better unders tand how the use of CMs intersect with the use of conventional medicines and how to en sure that consumers balance the risks and benefits of both. It will also be important to further investigate how to best present relevant, independent and balanced CMs in formation to consumers and identify the skills they need to support their decisions about the use of CMs. Another significant area for further research is to gain an under standing of the knowledge and information needs of health care wor kers who provide information to consumers about CMs to ensure that consistent and a ccurate information is availabl e to support the quality use of complementary medicines.
