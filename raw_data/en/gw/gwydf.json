Vaccines are the new ray of hope as of now, it gives you a certain level of protection. But do they prevent you from contracting the virus? Definitely no, the reason is that there exists a clear misunderstanding as to how vaccines work and what do you actually mean by efficacy. Vaccination vs Immunization. The primary difference to understand how vaccines work shall be understood by knowing the difference between Vaccination and Immunization. Vaccines are nothing but an simulated environment created in your body. Your body is injected with a virus similar to COVID but it shall be inactivated and not the actual virus itself, this fakes a COVID in your body and your immunity system starts fighting against such inactive virus. Memory cells in your body will remember this fight and create antibodies and keep your body prepared for similar upcoming viruses. Now when the actual virus enters your body, your body will use the antibodies already generated to fight against the actual ones. Vaccination is a process of getting the vaccine, immunization is building volunteers to fight against actual virus in your body. Booster Dose. Booster doze is similar to Sachin Tendulkar practicing a day before his match even though he is star of the game to warm up and be on toes to win the match with his skills. The second shot of vaccines are generally called as \"Booster Doses\", These doses boosts your immunity makes the generated antibodies stronger and reminds those antibodies to fight against viruses if at all. Currently in India, All the three vaccines, Sputnik V, Covisheild and Covaxin requires a booster dose to fight against the virus. Efficacy. Efficacies are decided based on the study. That is after simulating a virus in your body how does your body react what percentage do they keep your protected. As and when the vaccines are given to people, studies on the same improve and changes between the interval of the dose or the quantum of doses to be provided Does taking Vaccines protect you from virus? Definitely No, you are still prone to COVID, it is just that your body is ready to fight against the virus if at all it enters your body. Vaccines also provide certain degree of protection from complications in one's body due to the virus. Therefore, even after taking the vaccine you are prone to contract with COVID. It might not be lethal to you but it shall be to the one's around you who haven't got the shot yet Thus it is hereby suggested to take vaccines, wear a mask and sanitize your hands, maintain social distancing even after the vaccination. Do not belive in hearsay, take those doses and follow COVID appropriate behaviour all the times, help India flatten the curve again "}
