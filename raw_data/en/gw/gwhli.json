To learn more about hormone imbalance, call the practice or schedule your consultation online today. Hormones are your body's chemical messengers. Made by your endocrine system, hormones travel through your blood and direct various body functions like mood, digestion, and sleep cycle. These tiny chemicals work in small amounts to make big things happen. A hormone imbalance means your hormone levels are too high or too low. Your body has more than 50 hormones and each has a job. An imbalance may affect any hormone. Some hormonal imbalances are short-term, while others are chronic. Hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone levels) and Type 1 diabetes (little to no insulin production) are conditions that develop from a hormone imbalance. Though not everyone develops hypothyroidism or diabetes, most people experience changes in sex hormone levels as they get older. Declining sex hormone levels, including testosterone (male sex hormone), estrogen (female sex hormone), and progesterone (female sex hormone), cause symptoms many people dismiss as part of the aging process. Hormone imbalance symptoms vary and depend on the hormone affected. Symptoms might include: With a change in sex hormones, you may also have a low libido, hot flashes, vaginal dryness in women, or erectile dysfunction (ED) in men. Your provider at Ignite One conducts a full assessment before making any treatment recommendations. They ask questions about your health concerns and symptoms and medical history, then review your usual diet, exercise routine, and stressors. If they suspect you have a hormonal imbalance, they may request you have lab work done to check levels. Your provider gathers information during your assessment to create an integrative wellness plan. Though focused on hormone balance, Ignite One wants to help improve your whole health. For low hormone levels, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the primary treatment. Your provider talks to you about HRT and the types of hormones you need and the methods of delivery (pill, cream, or pellet). Your plan may also include a nutrition and fitness program, as well as behavioral health counseling. Ignite One provides all the tools and support you need to achieve improved health.
