Irrefutable evidence exists that these systems are learning moral choices and prejudices from these same creators. As companies tackle the ethical problems that arise from the widespread collection, analysis, and use of massive troves of data, join us to discuss where the greatest dangers lie, and how leaders like you should think about them. In this session we will explore how top executives can create a business framework where ethical innovation and data dignity come first, if A.I. should be governed, and what an artificial intelligence Bill of Rights might look like.

Such patients tend be at risk for more complicated and costly health events. According to the CDC, 90% of the nation's $3.8 trillion in annual health care costs are for people with chronic and mental health conditions. These individuals, of course, are also more vulnerable to severe cases of COVID. In this session we will explore how the pandemic has affected people suffering from chronic diseases. How much will 'Long COVID,' deferred care, stress and other pandemic effects complicate or worsen these conditions? Join us for a discussion with healthcare leaders who will share how they are applying lessons learned during the pandemic to re-invent chronic care for a more resilient future.

Over the past three decades, those exchanges have helped lift more than a billion people out of poverty. And yet, in recent years, the idea of open borders has come under attack. In Western countries, many middle-class workers blame globalization for lost jobs and increased income inequality. The U.S., once an unreserved champion of the idea of unfettered markets and shared knowledge, has withdrawn from trade agreements, imposed tariffs, and restricted the export of key technologies especially to China, which it increasingly regards as an economic and strategic rival. China, while defending the idea of an open global economy, has stepped up calls for economic self-reliance. The COVID-19 pandemic has led even the most ardent advocates of the free market to question the reliability of global supply chains\u2014and brought the cross-border exchange of businesspeople, students, and tourists to a standstill. Is globalization worth saving? And if so, what is to be done? Confirmed speakers include: - Craig J. Burchell, Senior Vice President Global Trade Affairs, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd - Keyu Jin, Professor of Economics, London School of Economics and Political Science - Pascal Lamy, President, Paris Peace Forum and Chair, Brunswick Europe - Kishore Mahbubani, Distinguished Fellow, Asia Research Institute, National University of Singapore - Moderated by: Clay Chandler, Executive Editor, Asia, FORTUNE FOSTERING THE NEXT GENERATION OF UNICORNS In Partnership with Huawei Technologies Friday, July 23, 2021 9:00AM London/4:00PM Hong Kong Southeast Asia, after a late start, is fast emerging as one of the world's most dynamic and innovative venture capital scenes. The region boasts a dozen unicorns, with many more startups poised to cross the U.S. $1 billion valuation threshold. The COVID-19 pandemic hasn't diminished investor interest in Southeast Asian ventures: in 2020, the region's start-ups raised $8.2 billion, an amount equivalent to pre-pandemic funding levels. For entrepreneurs, Southeast Asia poses unique challenges\u2014not least the difficulty of achieving scale in a region with 11 different nations and a dizzying diversity of cultures, languages, religions, and income levels. But it also offers new possibilities. Southeast Asia, like no other marketplace, has attracted investors from nearly every corner of the globe with high-profile backers from the U.S., China, Japan, India, and South Korea. And because most of the region's economies are still developing, there is relatively little legacy infrastructure to inhibit experimentation and innovative technologies. - Edwin Chow, Assistant CEO, Innovation & Enterprise, Enterprise Singapore - Leo Jiang, Chief Digital Officer - APAC, Huawei Cloud & AI - Ee Ling Lim, Head of APAC Business Development, Global Innovation, 500 Startups - Moses Lo, CEO & Co-Founder, Xendit - Moderated by: Clay Chandler, Executive Editor, Asia, FORTUNE GONE DIGITAL: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT HEALTH PASSES Presented by IBM Watson Health Tuesday, June 15, 2021 With almost half of Americans vaccinated and the CDC loosening mask restrictions, the last step to reopening the economy completely might be verifying everyone's vaccination status.

Join us as we explore the benefits and the challenges of implementing these tools. Our discussion will explore the issues of standardization and privacy that need to be considered.

The slowdown in global airline travel amid the COVID-19 pandemic created a $1.8 trillion hole in the world's GDP. Now, as more of the world gets vaccinated, pressure is rising for governments and businesses to recoup some of those losses and vaccine passports provide the quickest and surest way to help restart travel. But even as important questions remain in ensuring that vaccine passports are safe, do not increase social inequalities, or expose personal information, the economic benefits of creating a vaccine passport system are quickly outpacing potential shortcomings. Europe is opening its doors this summer to vaccinated foreigners, China recently launched a COVID-19 digital health passport for its 1.4 billion citizens, and airlines in places like Hong Kong and Singapore are testing how to make a truly international digital passport system. Join FORTUNE for a virtual conversation with industry experts to find out the latest on digital immunity passports.

Presented by IBM Watson Health Tuesday, March 30, 2021 While the COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally disrupted our health care system, it also opened our eyes to better ways to manage everyday health. In this discussion, we'll explore the ways in which we have rethought how health care works, from wellness visits and checkups to elective surgeries and chronic disease. We'll also explore changes in the ways patients use technology to monitor and take control of their health and use and share their health care data to make better decisions. But even as telemedicine continues to displace many in-person visits to the doctors' office\u2014saving time for patients and presumably lowering costs\u2014there are unanswered questions about the critical knowledge that may be missed.
