People are offering all sorts of diet schemes, avoidance plans, nutritional supplements, options for detoxing, etc. yet no real solutions. At Be in Health\u00ae, we offer real and lasting solutions so that you can get healing from food allergies and healing from gluten intolerance. No more avoidance! God wants you to enjoy the food that He blessed. He designed your body to be able to process it without adverse reactions. We recently received this sweet note from a grateful woman who had received healing from a food allergy to gluten through what she learned at our ministry. Hello from Richmond VA I attended the For My Life\u00ae conference the first part of August. I originally found out about Be in Heath's ministry when I attended a 2-day convention in Nov. 2018 in my home town. I purchased some CDs and the book, A More Excellent Way\u00ae, and began to learn more about the principles. A few weeks ago at the conference, I was delivered and healed of many things! One, in particular, was food allergies to gluten. I had been gluten intolerant for approximately 12 years. I have now eaten it several times and have not had the digestive issues. I'm still in the process of overcoming other things but I felt the healing take place so I have no doubt that in time I will be sanctified WHOLLY and fully as the bible says. I love Psalm 103, Exodus 23:25 and Mark 5:34. I look forward to rejoicing with all of you overcomers and hearing each of your stories! God bless ~ Nicole What does God think about food? The Bible has a lot to say about food but it might not be what you would think. In fact, how God thinks about food may be contrary to what most mainstream dietitians will tell you today. The question is: Whose report are you going to believe? Here are 7 Scriptures that will lead you to healing from food allergies: 1. All food is good if... 1 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; ...3 Forbidding to marry, [and commanding] to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. 4 For every creature of God [is] good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving: 5 For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer. 1 Timothy 4:1-5 KJV From the original Greek the word 'meat' actually means 'that which is eaten; food' and not just 'meat.' We are taught that certain foods are evil and should be avoided at all costs but this verse tells us that all food was created by God to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe Him and know the truth. This scripture concludes by saying that our food must be sanctified by the Word of God and by prayer. It is essential that we know what the Bible says about food, believe it, and then submit it to God. 2. Is food your enemy? 11 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. ... 17 Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught. Matthew 15:11, 17 KJV The truth is that God designed our bodies to be able to take food in, process it, retain the nutrients, and expel the waste. So our bodies were not designed to retain toxins nor any other harmful trace elements that may be found in our food. Our bodies weren't even designed to reject food. According to this scripture, we were designed to expel what isn't necessary and retain the nutritional benefits of it. 3. Why do some people react adversely to their food? 22 Hast thou faith? have [it] to thyself before God. Happy [is] he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth. 23 And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because [he eateth] not of faith: for whatsoever [is] not of faith is sin. Romans 14:22-23 KJV When a symptom comes up do we immediately think, \"Oh no! What did I eat?\" The scripture tells us it's the fear or lack of faith that causes food to become a curse to our bodies instead of a blessing. When we eat something in fear, rather than faith, this scripture says we are eating in sin. What is the sin? The food that we just ate or the thoughts we are listening to? Fear is sin because it is opposed to God's truth and His faith. If we eat with fear of food, we are not trusting God that He made all food good and blessed it. We are also not trusting Him that He designed our bodies to be able to process food properly. How does this work? Let's say a person is in a prolonged state of fear or stress - there is something unresolved in their life that is bothering them. Then, when they eat, they experience indigestion. Their first thought might be, \"Oh no, what did I eat?\" But what they don't realize is that fear and stress is their real enemy that just fed them that thought. There was nothing wrong with the food. In fact, in a fight or flight situation where your body has to redirect energy into your muscles and other parts of your body to help protect you from impending danger. In that state, your digestive system and your immune system are temporarily set on standby. So if a person remains in prolonged, low-grade stress, their digestive system and immune system will begin to suffer and not function the way they are designed to. Back to our scenario. What happened was the person's body wasn't properly processing their food because their digestive system was reacting to their stress. The food wasn't the problem, the stress was. But what comes next? Avoidance! The person will decide that because they reacted adversely to that food they should avoid it. Now they've given their immune system a signal to flag that particular food and reject it. From then on, their reactions to that food may strengthen. And over the progression of time, they may lose more and more foods to this process of elimination.

Recognize your thoughts 18 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man. 19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: 20 These are [the things] which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man. Matthew 15:18-20 KJV This verse tells us that it's not food or what goes into our mouth that defiles us but what is on the inside. What are we thinking - or rather what thoughts are we agreeing with that are not from God? We need to take our thoughts captive (2 Corinthians 10:5 KJV). Rather than wondering what food we just ate that caused the symptoms that we are feeling, the better question is, \"What was I just thinking?\" or, \"What has been bothering me that I have not dealt with?\" Learn to identify stressful thought patterns then take them to God and talk to Him about it. That way He can help you overcome. Don't make your food, your circumstances, your environment, or even another person your problem. What you are struggling with is between your own ears. It's the voice of fear and stress projecting the worst into our future. It eats us up on the inside, robs our peace, and eventually, it robs what should be a blessing to us too - our food. Make fear your enemy, not food. 5. Get your focus off your food. 25 Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? ... 32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. 33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. Matthew 6:25-33 KJV Food does not need to control your life anymore. God wants you to get your focus off of what you can and cannot eat, what you're going to eat next, or what possible effects it might have on your body and get your focus back on what matters. A spirit of fear would want to keep you distracted from God's will and purpose in your life by diverting your attention to trivial things. Take your life back, get your focus back on the Kingdom of God and His righteousness. 6. God wants you to enjoy the food that He provides And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this [is] the fruit of it. Numbers 13:27 KJV Isn't it interesting that the Promised Land that God had prepared for His people was said to be \"flowing with milk and honey\"? God wants to give us good food to enjoy, and guess who wants to take that blessing from us? For many people, the first thing that fear steals from their diet is milk and sugar. Is that a coincidence? We think not! 7. Moderation 22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, 23 Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. Galatians 5:22-23 KJV Here is the [ most nutritious fruit](https://www.beinhealth.com/gods-character-in-us/) that you could possibly eat and you can only receive it by submitting to the divine influence of the Holy Spirit on your heart. We hear people all the time saying that things like gluten and sugar are evil. No, they are not evil but there is a Biblical principle called moderation or temperance. Temperance is one of the fruits of the Spirit. From the original Greek, it means: the virtue of one who masters his desires and passions, especially his sensual appetites. So in every area of our lives, we can grow in temperance to moderate our choices whether that be in quantity of food or time spent in front of a screen, or whatever might try to divert our attention and appetite. We can submit it all to God and trust Him to help us walk according to wisdom and not by fear. Take Him at His Word. Take God at His Word and choose to believe Him over the other voices that you hear condemning food, and the other things that God created. Then you will find peace and stability not only for your spirit but for our body as well. We are very [chemical in our physiology](https://resources.beinhealth.com/products/fspy?_pos=1&_sid=7946e0bc1&_ss=r), our thoughts do affect our body physically. The Word says that there are many voices in the world and none without signification. If we allow ourselves to be swayed by those voices we will find ourselves being washed all over the map. One day this food is good, the next day they say avoid it like the plague. The only rock that is higher than us is our [Heavenly Father](https://www.beinhealth.com/the-fathers-business/). If we keep our eyes and our focus on Him and search out His heart, His will, and His ways we will have a sure foundation under our feet so that [we cannot be swayed by every new wind](https://www.beinhealth.com/strength-in-adversity/) that comes our way. We will also be able to recover what the enemy stole from us, our foods, and whatever else we may have avoided out of fear. God wants you to find healing from food allergies, including healing from gluten allergies. He truly does care about every little thing!
