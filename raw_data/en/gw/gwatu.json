They range fromsmall playgroups to major foundations allocating massive budgets to medicalresearch. In 2000-01, the 185,000 or so registered charitable organisations hadan estimated gross income of \u00a325 billion, and net assets of some \u00a370 billion. 2 Registered charities are publicly accountable to their donors and beneficiaries through, for example, their annual reports and accounts. However, oversight ofthe charitable sector depends primarily on the expertise and time contributedby several million trustees who sit on the boards of charitable bodies. For thevast majority of charities, therefore, effective oversight starts within the charityitself, through its trustees and the quality of information it makes available tothe public. 3 The Charity Commission for England and Wales [the Commission] has statutory responsibility for promoting the effective use of charity resources and has setitself the aim of maintaining public confidence in the integrity of charity. In2000-01, it had an annual budget of some \u00a321 million which has remainedconstant in cash terms since 1996-97. It employs 547 staff in three offices,London, Taunton and Liverpool. 4 The Committee of Public Accounts has taken evidence from the Commission on three occasions, in 1988, 1991 and 1998. On each occasion it was criticalof the Commission's performance and, in its 1998 report, the Committee maderecommendations for improvements in: management effectiveness; theaccuracy of the Register of Charities; submission of accounts and monitoring ofcharities; and support and investigation of charities. 5 We found that the Commission had made welcome progress in addressing the concerns raised in previous reports including: meeting more of its key businesstargets; reducing the number of inactive charities on its Register of Charities;and improving the accuracy of the Register. However, weaknesses remain,particularly in the Commission's investigation work, a fact recognised by theCommission itself. 2execuitve summaryGIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES Key findings !Compared to the size of the charitable sector, proven cases of maladministration or abuse amongst registered charities are rare.Investigations are being completed more quickly but our examinationidentified weaknesses in the Commission's approach to deciding the scopeof investigations, in its approach to monitoring the progress of investigationcases and in its arrangements for ensuring that effective remedial action istaken by the charities. In October 2000, the Commission produced a newInvestigations Manual which seeks to address these issues. In 2002-03, theCommission plans to spend an additional \u00a31 million on investigative work,an increase for this work of 31 per cent on its 2001-02 budget of \u00a33 million. !The Commission is scrutinising applications for registration for charitablestatus more rigorously. As a result, the percentage of applications whichprogress to full registration has fallen. The Commission has also improvedits procedures for checking whether prospective trustees of new charitiesare disqualified from acting as trustees, for example because they areundischarged bankrupts or disqualified directors. However, theCommission has no equivalent procedures for checking trustees appointedto existing charities. !The Commission has faced an increasing volume of requests for advice andsupport from charities - up from nearly 26,000 in 1996-97 to over 35,000 in2000-01, a rise of 35 per cent. A survey of charities on behalf of theCommission in March 2000 found that 83 per cent of respondents weresatisfied with the assistance given. Difficulties in dealing with this increasehas meant that the number of cases carried forward from one year to the nexthas risen from 4,500 in 1996-97 to 8,900 in 2000-01. The difficulties havebeen compounded by staffing shortages, particularly in the Commission'sLondon office. As at October 2000, the office was 13 per cent belowcomplement and half of its staff had less than two years' experience. TheCommission told us it is addressing these staffing difficulties in a variety ofways, including training, mentoring and management support. Unless it issuccessful in this, it may find it difficult to reduce the backlog of cases andsustain year on year increases in case numbers. !Following recommendations by the Committee of Public Accounts in theirlast report, the Commission has made a significant effort to improve thequality and timeliness of the annual information it collects from thecharitable sector. And the Register of Charities is now accessible via theCommission's website. The design of the website compares well withpractice elsewhere in government and the site currently receives up to eightmillion hits a year. The Commission has strengthened its arrangements formonitoring the financial performance of charities and examining whethercharitable funds are being properly used, for example by focusing greaterattention on the five per cent of charities which account for some90 per cent of the charitable sector's income. However, the Commissionneeds to develop further its monitoring procedures to collect indicators ofpossible weaknesses in the governance of charities and encourage charitiesto do more to demonstrate that they are using charitable funds efficientlyand effectively. The detailed findings and conclusions from the study are set out below. A summary of the actions taken by the Commission to follow-up the Committee of PublicAccounts previous recommendations is at Appendix 2.3executive summaryGIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES On investigating and remedying serious weaknesses in charities 6 In 1998, the Committee of Public Accounts expressed concern that the Commission was not devoting enough attention to investigation work. Sincethen, the number of formal inquiries it has carried out into charities hasdeclined from 272 in 1997-98 to 212 in 2000-01. However, the proportion ofinquiries resulting in substantiated weaknesses increased from 76 per cent to90 per cent. This rise reflects, in part, the increased emphasis the Commissionnow places on evaluating cases before deciding to proceed with a formalinquiry. In the four years between 1997-98 and 2000-01, the number of casessubject to evaluation rose from 1,067 to 1,152, an increase of eight per cent.In 2000-01, maladministration accounted for the majority of substantiatedweaknesses amongst charities (41 per cent) followed by malpractice(22 per cent) and fundraising problems (21 per cent). More investigations arenow being undertaken because of causes for concern identified by theCommission itself rather than by others. 7 The Commission generally acts quickly when someone brings a potential cause for concern to its attention. It is completing investigations more quickly, andbetween January 2000 and January 2001 made significant progress in reducingits backlog of inquiry cases. However, there is scope for improved monitoringof the time taken to complete individual cases. 8 We found that the scope of an inquiry was usually driven by the original cause for concern and that the Commission did not always carry out an appraisal ofthe potential risks to identify if a broader examination was needed. Practices inclosing inquiries varied across the Commission. While some caseworkers keptcases open until it was evident that problems had been resolved, others closedcases before this position was reached but did not carry out any follow-up toconfirm the weaknesses were addressed. In general, we found that inquiriescarried out by more experienced staff were better planned, scoped anddocumented. The Commission's new Investigations Manual aims to strengtheninvestigations, for example, by the better use of risk analysis. The Commissionnow also puts the outcome of inquiries on its website so that charities can learnfrom the problems of others. Recommendations !The Commission should ensure that all inquiries have a written plan setting out the scope and objectives of the investigation based on a formal assessmentof the risks to be tackled. All inquiry plans should be reviewed by experiencedcaseworkers at the start of the inquiry and at regular intervals during itsprogress. !The Commission should follow-up all inquiry cases which identify serious weaknesses to ensure that remedial action has been taken. This follow-upmight involve trustees reporting back on progress against an agreed actionplan at specified intervals. !The Commission should ensure that less experienced investigation staff receive adequate supervision and training from more experienced colleaguesto ensure that investigations are appropriately scoped, properly carried outand fully documented. It might, for example, consider assigning experiencedstaff as mentors to newer staff to help provide advice and guidance. !The Commission should draw upon the results of its inquiries to alert charities and their trustees to the key risks that might typically affect their organisationsand how these might be managed.4execuitve summaryGIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES On registering and supporting charities 9 Following the Committee of Public Accounts' concerns, the Commission has introduced more stringent checks of applications from organisations seeking toregister as charities. As a result, the proportion of applications which progressto full registration fell from 88 per cent in 1996-97 to 73 per cent in 2000-01.The Commission received applications from some 8,000 organisations in2000-01 and registered around 6,000. The quality of registration work variesconsiderably in the Commission. In 2000-01, for example, its internal qualityreviews assessed 79 per cent of cases handled by the Taunton office asacceptable or better compared with 66 per cent in the Liverpool office. 10 When a charity seeks registration, the Commission checks whether the proposed trustees are disqualified from acting as trustees because, for example,they are undischarged bankrupts. The Commission does not check trusteesappointed by charities that are already registered. This would be a significanttask as there are close to two million trustees of registered charities. In June2001, the Commission issued a consultation document inviting views on whatinformation it should collect on trustees preparatory to deciding how best totackle this issue. 11 Charities contact the Commission requesting advice and assistance on a wide range of sometimes complex legal and other issues, for example, changes to acharity's constitution. The Commission does not charge charities for theseservices. Due to the large rise in the volume of such requests the number beingcarried forward from one year to the next is increasing. And the average timeto clear individual cases has increased from 80 days in 1996-97 to 112 days in2000-01. Nevertheless, 83 per cent of charities remain satisfied with theservices provided. The Commission is considering, however, what action it cantake to influence and control the demand upon it for support, including thepossibility of closer co-operation with charities' representative bodies. 12 The Commission has taken steps to strengthen its complaints mechanisms. Between April 2000 and March 2001, the Commission investigated 121 complaintsconcerned with all aspects of its business. 22 per cent were upheld, most on thebasis that the Commission had failed to meet its target response time. TheCommission has not fully analysed these complaints to identify lessons which couldbe learned for the future. Since January 2000, complainants who are not satisfiedwith the outcome of the Commission's internal review procedures have had theoption of asking an Independent Complaints Reviewer to consider their case. In2000, the Independent Complaints Reviewer investigated eight complaints andupheld one. 5executive summaryGIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES Recommendations !The Commission should investigate the difference in the quality of registration work in its Taunton and Liverpool offices and issue good practice guidance asappropriate. !To help protect the interests of donors and beneficiaries, the Commission should, in close consultation with charities: - Issue guidance to trustees on good practice in identifying, recruiting and appointing new trustees, including checking eligibility to act as a trustee;and - Establish arrangements for ensuring that these practices are followed, for example by annually checking the eligibility of a sample of newlyappointed trustees, and checking during visits that charities are carryingout appropriate checks on prospective trustees. !The Commission should further review its arrangements for providing advice and support to charities to determine how rising demand can best bemanaged and organised, for example, by closer co-operation with charities'representatives and umbrella bodies so that charities can learn from theirpeers. !The Commission should fully analyse complaints from charities and others to see if there are any lessons to be learnt for the future. On making charities transparent and accountable On collecting information from registered charities 13 The Commission has a statutory responsibility to keep a Register of Charities and this can be viewed at the Commission's three regional offices or on itswebsite. The Commission has improved the accuracy and coverage of theRegister since the Committee of Public Accounts' last examination in 1998.Each year charities are expected to make a return to the Commission updatinginformation kept on the Register. Whilst there is no statutory deadline, theproportion of charities submitting updated information within 10 months of theend of their financial year rose from 49 per cent in 1997-98 to 66 per cent in2000-01. 14 The Commission pursues outstanding update forms and by June 2001 had obtained 85 per cent of all forms. While this was up from 79 per cent at31 March 1998, around 500 charities with income and expenditure of \u00a3250,000or more had not provided information to update their entries on the Register. 15 In September 1999, the Commission estimated that some 18,800 charities out of a total of 185,000, had been out of contact with the Commission for overfour years at which point they are referred to a specialist monitoring team. ByMarch 2001, the Commission had re-established contact, or removed from theRegister, all but some 700 of these charities. At present, the website version ofthe Register of Charities does not record when individual charities last updatedtheir entry. 6execuitve summaryGIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES 16 Since 1997, the Commission had also required all charities with an annual income or expenditure over \u00a310,000 to submit annual returns, along with theirannual accounts and reports. In 2000-01, the Commission obtained62 per cent of annual returns by the due date but some charities remain slowin submitting the required information. As at March 2001, the Commission hadobtained returns from 96 per cent of charities with an annual income orexpenditure greater than \u00a3250,000, leaving 339 still being pursued. TheCommission has established an Enforcement Unit to chase up the late returnsfrom larger charities. Recommendations !Now that the backlog of charities failing to update their entry on the Register of Charities is being reduced, the Commission should take earlier action topursue those charities failing to provide updated information on time. !The Commission should explore other options for encouraging charities to submit their annual returns on time, for example, by identifying defaultingcharities on the Commission's website, so that this information is available tolocal authorities responsible for granting charities licences to carry out streetcollections and others. !The Commission should measure its performance against the number of charities that submit their returns by the due date, as well as the number thatfinally make a return. On scrutinising the performance of charities 17 Effective scrutiny of charity performance depends, in the first instance on the ability of trustees, donors, beneficiaries and others to scrutinise how wellcharitable funds are being used. In October 2000, the Charity Commissionpublished a revised Statement of Recommended Practice (SORP) on the way inwhich charities should report annually on their stewardship of charitable funds.This Statement strengthens earlier guidance issued in 1995 and was effectivefrom 1 January 2001. 18 The SORP recommends that the reports and accounts of charities should enable the reader to understand the charity's objectives, structure, activity andachievements. Such transparency was not always present amongst the annualreports and accounts of charities examined by us, although there were someexamples of good practice where the activities funded by charitable incomewere described and quantified. 19 The Commission has strengthened its arrangements for monitoring the performance of charities by, for example targeting areas of known risk, such asfundraising and by more detailed scrutiny of larger charities. Informationcollected from charities is analysed and potential causes for concern followedup. The Commission is examining the scope for developing financial measuresfrom data in a charity's accounts, which may prove helpful in comparing theperformance of different charities, for example the ratio of managementexpenditure to expenditure on direct charitable activities. 7executive summaryGIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES 20 The information received and analysed by the Commission from charities focuses primarily on financial issues, including fundraising, trading activitiesand trustee benefits. While the Commission has issued guidance on goodgovernance, it does not collect information that might point to governance riskswithin individual charities, for example a high turnover of trustees might beindicative of internal disputes and a higher risk of maladministration. 21 Since 1997, the Commission has carried out visits to a sample of the 16,000 charities with an annual income of over \u00a3100,000. Currently some300 charities a year are visited. The Commission's review of the visits'programme has identified the need for it to be more focused on risk and morerigorous. Our examination corroborated the Commission's findings. It alsohighlighted other areas where improvements could be made including usingthe visits to validate information appearing in a charity's annual returns,establishing clearer protocols on what charities could expect from visits andliaising with other regulators. With the additional funding available to it fromApril 2002, the Commission plans to double the number of visits and adopt amore structured and forensic approach. Recommendations !The Commission should monitor the compliance of charities with the revised Statement of Recommended Practice. In particular, it should encourage largercharities to provide in their annual reports more information on the efficiencyand effectiveness with which they have used charitable funds; making it clearwhat was achieved against what was planned and explaining any significantvariance. !Now that the Commission is obtaining financial information from charities in a standardised form, it should analyse the financial performance of similargroups of charities, using agreed financial ratios, for example, the ratio offundraising costs to funds raised, and make the results of these analysespublicly available. This would enable individual charities to compare theirperformance against other similar groups of charities. !The Commission should monitor closely the risks to good governance by requiring charities to include in their annual returns information on theturnover of trustees, the number of full trustee meetings, the averageattendance at meetings and the number of inquorate meetings. !The Commission should ensure that its programme of visits to charities is focused on those where the risk to charitable funds and beneficiaries isgreatest, ensuring a lighter touch for those with a history of compliance inproviding, for example, annual returns and accounts. Where appropriate, theCommission should consult with other inspection and regulatory bodiesbefore carrying out visits. !The Commission should develop service standards for informing charities what they can expect from a visit and disseminate evidence of good practiceand lessons learned.Part 1GIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES Introduction 9part oneContext What is the charity sector? 1.1 Charities play a major role in the social and economic well being of our society and in one way or other touchthe lives of most people. They range from small playgroups operating out of rented rooms in parish halls tomajor foundations allocating massive budgets tomedical research. Some are household names, whilemany others are known only to small groups of localvolunteers and beneficiaries. 1.2 In March 2001, there were some 185,000 charitable organisations registered with the Charity Commissionfor England and Wales (the Commission), theoverwhelming majority with an annual income of\u00a310,000 or less a year (Figure 1) . Charities employ an estimated 500,000 paid workers and draw on thegoodwill and voluntary efforts of huge numbers ofpeople. An estimated two million unpaid trustees serveon the governing bodies of charities and many millionsof others help deliver services, serve in charitable shopsor rattle tins on street corners. In 2000-01, the sectorhad an estimated gross income of some \u00a325 billion(around 3 per cent of UK Gross Domestic Product) andnet assets of some \u00a370 billion. 1.3 In recent years, the sector has continued to grow; between 1996 and 2001 the annual income ofregistered charities rose by a third. While still reliant ondonations and legacies, the sector has expanded thesale of goods and services, entered into contracts withlocal and national governments to deliver a wide rangeof public services, and obtained grants from differentfunding sources including the European Union and theNational Lottery. What is the role of the Charity Commission? 1.4 The Commission is a non-ministerial government department, accountable to the Home Secretary for itsefficiency and to the Courts for its decisions. It wasestablished in 1853 but its current functions, powersand duties are set out in the Charities Act of 1993. This Act introduced measures aimed at making charities more publicly accountable and provided for theCommission to play an increasingly active supervisoryrole, in particular, setting a clear framework formonitoring charities. 1The charity sector in England and Wales: numbers and income Source: Charity Commission 2000-2001Over \u00a3250,000Under \u00a310,000 \u00a310,000-\u00a3100,000\u00a3100,000-\u00a3250,000Some five per cent of charities account for 89 per cent of the sector's annual income.

The Commission's keyobjectives are to: !ensure that charities are able to operate with an effective legal, accounting and governanceframework; !improve the governance, accountability, efficiency and effectiveness of charities; and !identify and deal with abuse and poor practices. 1.6 The Commission's specific statutory functions include maintaining a Register of Charities, obtaining accountsand reports from larger charities and making themavailable for public inspection, authorising changes tothe powers and constitutions of individual charities, andoversight of controls which apply to charities' assets,investments and land. It has a general statutoryresponsibility to promote the effective use of charitableresources by encouraging better administration,providing information and advice to trustees andinvestigating abuses. The 1993 Charities Act introducednew reporting and accounting requirements, andprovided the Commission with new powers toinvestigate charities and to safeguard charitableresources. Where, for example, there is evidence ofabuse or maladministration, the Commission haspowers to require the release of documents, freeze bankaccounts and appoint receiver managers. Legislationprecludes the Commission from acting in theadministration of charities. How is the Commission managed? 1.7 The Commission is managed by a salaried board, comprising a full-time Chief Commissioner, a full-timelegal commissioner, three non-executivecommissioners, all appointed by the Home Secretary,and three senior directors. It operates through threeregional offices, Taunton, Liverpool and London withmost central functions divided between Taunton andLondon. Between 1996-97 and 2000-01, theCommission's annual budget has remained at\u00a321 million (Figure 2) , a reduction in real terms of 11 per cent, and staff numbers have fallen over the sameperiod from 583 to 547. However, following thegovernment's spending review announced in July 2000,the Commission's budget is set to increase by some20 per cent from April 2002 to \u00a325 million a year. 1.8 The Commission's increased budget is intended to enable it to: redevelop and expand its programme of regulatoryvisits to charities; update its IT strategy to enable charitiesto send electronic returns to the Commission; devote anadditional \u00a31 million a year to investigations; anddevelop thematic studies of key regulatory issues to helpstrengthen the charitable sector.What are registered charities? 1.9 Registered charities are one part of the voluntary or non-government sector. To be considered for registrationas a charity an organisation must be non-profitdistributing (any surpluses should be retained and usedfor charitable purposes) and must be set up entirely forwider public benefit, and not for personal benefit. Thecourts in the nineteenth century classified charitablepurposes as the relief of poverty or sickness, theadvancement of religion, the advancement of education(where in all areas the courts held public benefit to beassumed, unless it could be demonstrated otherwise),and other areas of public benefit. Thus politicalorganisations, trade unions, some sports clubs andcampaigning bodies may be part of the voluntary sectorbut are ineligible to register as charities. The criteria fordetermining charitable status are complex and based oncase law, and periodically the Commission has toredefine what types of purposes are deemed charitable.Any organisation with charitable purposes that meetsthe criteria indicated in Appendix 1 must register withthe Commission unless it is statutorily exempted orexcepted from registration. 1.10 Registration brings a range of tax benefits not available to commercial organisations. Registered charities havecertain relief from income and corporation tax andbusiness rates, and can usually claim back the basic ratetax paid on donors' incomes where gifts are made bydeed of covenant or under the government's gift aidschemes.

Registration alsobrings certain duties including meeting the Commission'srequests for information. Regulating charities Why are charities regulated? 1.11 Each charity has a governing document which sets out, among other things, the charitable objects that it existsto pursue. Donors, large and small, are entitled to theassurance that charities actually pursue these objects,that they do not spend charitable funds in ways that theobjects do not authorise, that charities operate for publicrather than private benefit, and that any private benefitthat does arise is purely incidental and kept to aminimum. The Charity Commission exists to monitor,and where necessary to ensure, that the charities'trustees meet these requirements, and to promote theeffective use of charitable resources by various means,including making advice and information aboutcharities widely available. 1.12 Registered charities receive public support in many ways through donations, the time and effort of volunteers,funding from governments and charitable foundations,and through the tax system. In February 1999, MORIsurveyed some 1,600 adults in England and Wales, on behalf of the Commission, and found that 92 per centhad donated money or time to charities in the precedingtwo years. While responsibility for ensuring that charitiesare well run resides primarily with trustees, thecomplexity of the sector and the rapid growth of somecharities has made it more difficult for voluntary trusteesto exercise full control. Individual donors and volunteersare not always in a position to judge the quality ofcharities which approach them for donations or for theirtime, and vulnerable people may not be able to questionthe adequacy of the services they are being offered. 1.13 As the sector has grown and diversified, it has become exposed to a wider range of risk. While there is a lack ofquantified evidence on the extent of the risks, those weinterviewed from the charity sector believe that risks areincreasing. The National Council for VoluntaryOrganisations told us, for example, that whilst the futurelooks buoyant, with more outsourcing of public servicesand the favourable tax regime, \" this brings with it greater risk of fraud, contract problems, cash flow difficultiesand growth issues\". Figure 3 summarises some of the major risks facing the charitable sector and the ways inwhich the Commission's advisory and regulatoryactivities address these risks.

Our report, Charitable Funds Associated with NHS Bodies (HC 516) published inJune 2000, concluded that the NHS Executive and theCharity Commission had worked closely together toensure that there was no significant duplication of effortand to avoid imposing additional burdens on trustees . What does the Charity Commission do? 1.15 The Commission seeks to work with charities to prevent problems emerging, and to detect problems before theybecome serious. When problems are identified, theCommission acts to protect the charity's assets andprovide for its future administration. The Commission'smain operational divisions involved in regulation andtheir key activities are shown in Figure 5.What previous examinations have there been of the Commission? 1.16 The Committee of Public Accounts (PAC) has taken evidence from the Commission on three occasions, in1988 (HC116), 1991 (HC85) and 1998 (HC28). All threereports were critical and in its 1998 report theCommittee made recommendations for improvement inthe following areas: !management effectiveness; !the accuracy of the Register of Charities; !the submission of accounts and the monitoring of charities; and !the support and investigation of charities. The recommendations made by the Committee of Public Accounts in its 1998 report are detailed in Appendix 2 andthe Commission's reported progress against its performancetargets are contained in Appendix 3.Other bodies regulating charities4 Companies House Regulates the activities of public and private limited companies (including charities with limited liability status) Inland Revenue Monitoring of charity tax returns Inspectorates e.g. Office for Standards in Education, and the Social Services Inspectorate, which inspect charities in their respective sectorsFunding bodies e.g. The National Lottery Commission and charitable foundations, which monitor the use of resources they provideto charitiesHM Customs and Excise Monitoring of VAT returns Charity self regulation by trusteesOther bodies e.g. The Housing Corporation,for charities that operate in thehousing sector, and the police Source: National Audit OfficeCharities are regulated by many different regulatory bodies.13 part oneGIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES What issues did we examine? 1.17 Our report examines the progress made by the Commission since the Committee of Public Accounts'1998 report and considers, in particular, thearrangements for: !investigating and remedying serious weaknesses in charities; !registering and supporting charities; and !making charities transparent and accountable.1.18 The study involved an analysis of management data kept by the Commission on its operations over the past fiveyears and an examination of Commission files on50 charities. We held interviews with a cross section ofCommission staff, staff from key governmentdepartments in regular contact with the Commissionand 12 national organisations involved in the charitysector. We drew on two surveys commissioned by theCommission, a NOP survey of 600 charities inJanuary 2000, which sought charities' views on theCommission's performance, and a MORI poll of some1,600 adults in February 1999 on public attitudes tocharities and the Commission. In examining theCommission's internal systems for regulating charitieswe placed reliance on the work of the Commission'sinternal auditors, Bentley Jennison.

This part of the Reportexamines whether the Commission has addressed theCommittee's concerns and is investigating andremedying serious weaknesses in charities effectively. Whether the Commission investigates and remedies serious weaknesses in charitieseffectively In recent years, the number of formal inquiries hasdeclined but the proportion of substantiated cases hasincreased. More investigations are now beingidentified by the Commission itself. 2.2 When the Commission has concerns about a charity, its Investigations Division carries out a preliminaryevaluation. This may be sufficient to resolve matters,identify that the charity needs advice from elsewherein the Commission or clarify that there is no weaknessto resolve. However, when the evaluation points to asubstantial weakness or problem then the Commissionwill launch a full inquiry. 2.3 The evaluations and inquiries handled by the Investigations Division originate from a wide variety ofsources (Figure 6) . In 2000-01, complaints from members of the public account for the largestproportion of cases (41 per cent), but since it introduceda computerised monitoring system in 1998, anincreasing proportion of cases are identified by theCommission itself, up from 22 per cent in 1998 to39 per cent currently. The Commissioners are alsoprescribed persons under the Public Interest DisclosureAct 1998 which established a new framework ofstatutory protection for employees making disclosuresrelating to defined instances of malpractice in the workplace. Whistle-blowers, as defined by the 1998 Act,accounted for seven investigation cases in 2000-01. 2.4 Compared to the size of the sector, proven cases of maladministration or abuse amongst registered charitiesare rare. In the four years from 1997-98 to 2000-01, thenumber of evaluations carried out by InvestigationsDivision rose from 1,067 to 1,152, an increase of eightper cent. The number of formal inquiries declined from272 to 212. However, the proportion of inquiries whereweaknesses were substantiated increased from anestimated 76 per cent of cases to 90 per cent (Figure 7) . In part, the increase in the number of substantiatedcases reflected the Commission's efforts to ensure that,before an inquiry was launched, a thorough evaluationwas carried out first. Maladministration accounts for thelargest proportion of substantiated inquiries rather thandeliberate malpractice (Figure 8) . The largest charities account for a high proportion of investigations.In 2000-01, the five per cent of charities with annualincomes over \u00a3250,000 accounted for 22 per cent of theCommission's investigations.6Evaluations and inquiries may be prompted from a number of sources Source: Charity Commission 2000-2001Others 7% Staff and trustees in charities 13% Commission monitoring 39%Information from the public, charities and the Commission's own analysis of data may prompt an evaluation and possibly an inquiry. Members of the public41%16part twoGIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES The Commission is completing investigations more quickly but there is scope for improved monitoring ofthe cumulative time taken to complete individual cases. 2.5 The Commission acts quickly to open an investigation when a member of the public or someone involved in acharity brings a potential cause for concern to itsattention. While it was not always possible to identifythe precise date when a complaint had been made,particularly for older cases, in 13 out of the15 investigations we examined, where the complaintdate was evident cases were opened and complainantswritten to within two weeks. 2.6 The Commission is completing a higher proportion of its evaluation and inquiry cases on time. In 2000-01, it justmissed its target that 80 per cent of evaluations shouldbe completed in two months, achieving a figure of77 per cent compared with 69 per cent in 1996-97. In1998-99, it set a target that 75 per cent of inquiriesshould be completed in 12 months and met this for thefirst time in 2000-01. In January 2001, the Commissionaccepted the recommendations of an internal review tostrengthen the effectiveness of its investigations,including the need for a sharper focus on completinginquiries. The review recognised that cases needed to bemore actively managed and, in this respect, theCommission told us it plans to make direct contact withcharities at an earlier stage in the investigation, ratherthan allowing time to be lost waiting for documents tobe sent. 2.7 The Commission has also made progress in reducing its backlog of inquiry cases. Between April 2000 andMarch 2001, the number of cases which had been openfor more than 18 months fell by 23 per cent from52 to 40. During the same period, the number of thesecases which had been open for more than three yearsfell by six per cent from 17 to 16. 2.8 While the Commission has overall targets for the completion of cases, it does not set deadlines for thecompletion of individual cases as they arise. Suchtargets might be very tentative initially and requireadjustment as the case unfolds but they would providea focus for internal monitoring and reviewing progress.The duration of the 20 inquiry cases we examinedranged from one week, for enforcement officers to chasemissing annual returns, to almost seven years for aninquiry that resulted in the recovery of more than\u00a3250,000 for a charity. In this case, the inquiryconcluded after two years, but it took another four andhalf years to take the principals to court for restitution,underlying the fact that the final resolution of cases canlie outside the Commission's control (Case 1) . Trends in the number of inquiry cases - 1997-98 to 2000-01 Source: Charity CommissionBetween 1997-98 and 2000-01, there has been a decrease in the number of inquiry cases but an increase in the proportion where causes for concern were substantiated.

Although the governing body consists of 14 Governors, the Chairman of the Governors and theMaster of the charity dominated the administration of the charity for a period of 10 years until there was a rift between them in 1992. Key dates Major activities May 1993 The Commission opens an inquiry because of allegations of theft from the charity. The causes for concern were: misuse of charity funds by the Chairman of Governors;diversion of funds to commercial companies; charity funds used to purchase propertyabroad; and police inquiries taking place on all of the above. November 1993 A further cause for concern emerges - the improper establishment of an executive pension scheme for an employee. May 1993 to August 1995 In the course of the inquiry a number of restraining orders are made, access sought to bank accounts into which charity funds seem to have been applied and orders anddirections served on various individuals to compel them to provide documents or togive evidence. August 1995 The Commission concludes the inquiry, revealing that conflicts of interest, patronage and nepotism had developed over a period of years. The inquiry: ! concludes that the Chairman of the Governors of the charity and the Master ofthe charity had used their positions to obtain benefits from the charity's funds forthemselves and their wives; ! recommends that Charity Support Division should take forward theestablishment of a new scheme reconstituting the governing body of the charity;and ! recommends that the Governors should consider taking legal advice with a viewto their seeking restitution from the Chairman of Governors and the Master forthe benefits they and their wives had obtained from the charity. March 1996 Solicitors acting for the Governors of the charity seek permission from the Commission to take proceedings against the Chairman and Master. May 1997 The Commission informs the charity's solicitors that permission is refused and that the Commission, with the approval of the Attorney-General, is going to take proceedingsagainst the trustees instead. August 1998 The commission approves a scheme to re-structure the charity's governing body. June 1997 to December 1999 Commission prepares case for trial. January 2000 High Court hearing agrees out of court settlement with defendants exceeding \u00a3250,000. Case closed. Commentary This was a thorough, well run investigation which amassed a substantial body of evidence and resulted in the restitution of significant funds to the charity. However, there was significant delay in deciding who should take the case to court, includingconsiderations of likely cost of legal proceedings and the likelihood of recovering money from the defendants. The charitycomplained that the Commission should have consulted the Governors about the decision to settle outside court, and the sizeof the settlement agreed. 17 part twoGIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES18part twoGIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES Case 2 Poor scoping and planning resulting in a failure to carry out a thorough investigation of a charity's fundraising. Background A regionally based charity founded in the 1980s to provide services to people with a physical disability. From a small beginnin g it grew rapidly, mainly through its fundraising efforts, and by the late 1990s had a turnover over \u00a3700,000. The charity had ahistory of complaints, particularly in respect of unauthorised street collections, dating back to the early 1990s and was thesubject of a Commission inquiry in 1993. Key dates Major activities October 1996 The Commission carries out an evaluation of the charity following a series of complaints by police, local authorities and the public of unauthorised streetcollections. June 1997 After initial correspondence and telephone conversations with the charity, the Commission visits the charity to talk to the Chief Executive. Following the meeting aninquiry is opened. The Commission uses its statutory powers to restrict the use of apost office box by a person suspected of defrauding the charity. August 1997 Restrictions on use of the post office box lifted when the Commission's lawyers consider that the restriction may have been unlawful. September 1998 Following intermittent investigations, telephone and fax contacts with the local authorities, complainants and the charity, a second meeting is arranged with thecharity. July 1999 The charity's annual return shows high fundraising costs. Monitoring staff do not follow up because they believe that these concerns are being examined as part of theinquiry. August 1999 The Commission apologises to the charity because it had not informed the charity that an inquiry had been opened and closes the case indicating that it is satisfied with theexplanations provided by the charity. Within ten days of the case closure, a Commission staff member is approached by a collector claiming to be collecting for the charity. Subsequent checks reveal that nocollection licence had been granted to the charity for that day. Commentary This case ran for nearly three years without clear objectives and planning. Given that the causes for concern related to street collections, there was a risk of fraud and yet no detailed accounts work was undertaken to compare expected cash receipts fromstreet collections with actual receipts nor to check that controls were operating as intended. From the charity's annual report , it was not possible to gain a clear impression of the charity's work but no contact was made with beneficiaries and other localorganisations involved with people with disability. The Commission relied, almost exclusively, on the word of the ChiefExecutive, and did not meet with trustees and other key stakeholders. When the Commission used its statutory powers, thecaseworker did not seek proper legal advice and subsequently had to rescind the order. The case was closed by the caseworkerwithout being counter-signed by senior management. Since our examination, the Commission has decided to conduct afollow-up review of the case.to September 199919 part twoGIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES 2.9 Although the Commission checks the amount of time cases spend in its different divisions, it did not review thecumulative time taken to resolve cases, nor thecumulative cost of cases. For example, in one case weexamined where the Commission had concerns abouttrustees benefiting financially from a charity, internal caserecords showed that staff monitoring of the case wascompleted in two weeks, evaluation in four months andan inquiry in four and a half months. No composite reportwas produced showing that the total time it took theCommission to resolve the case was nearly nine months.Since our examination, the format of investigation reportsplaced on the Commission's website makes the durationof cases - from the time a cause for concern is identifiedthrough to resolution - clearer. The Commission does not systematically review the scope of inquiries before launching an inquiry. 2.10 We examined 10 evaluation cases and 20 inquiry cases which had been closed between April 1999 andDecember 2000 and which involved charities with anannual income ranging from \u00a335,000 to \u00a34.8 million.We found that the scope of inquiries was largelydetermined by the original cause for concern and thatthe Commission did not always carry out an appraisal ofthe potential risks to identify the need for a broaderexamination. In Case 2 , for example, the Commission's staff followed up a series of fundraising problems as theyarose but did not consider the risk that they might besymptomatic of wider, more significant weaknesses inthe charity. 2.11 In general, we found that inquiries carried out by more experienced staff were better planned, scoped anddocumented and that there was a need for closersupervision of the less experienced staff. This view wassupported by the Association for Charities who told usthat \"Investigations needed to be staffed with people with greater experience - possibly through more secondmentsfrom the sector\" . Arising from the Commission's internal review into its investigations (paragraph 2.6) it has issueda new Investigations Manual with the aim of providingstaff with clearer guidance on planning and monitoring ofinvestigations. The Commission has recognised the needto improve its approach to assessing and managing riskand the Manual includes key criteria to be used inassessing risks (Figure 9) . Initial decisions on the priority and handling of cases will be based on this riskassessment and there will be monthly case reviews byline management. Commission's risk assessment criteria and sources of information The Commission has access to a variety of information sources to help assess risk.9 Risk assessment criteria MoneyBeneficiariesComplexity Profile History Concerns about trusteesIndicator of risk Level of funds involvedDirect risk to vulnerable peopleNumber of issues and level of difficulty Likely level of external interest Prior problems with the charity Degree to which it is suspected that the trustees are implicatedSources of information Annual accountsRegistration documents and annual reportsOriginal cause for concern and professional judgement Expertise of Commission staffCommission databases of past cases or failure to provide annual returns on time Nature of accusations, annual reports showing either a very high turnover oftrustees or a small group of trustees with nochanges Source: Charity Commission and National Audit Office20part twoGIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES The Commission's inquiries rely heavily on the submission of written evidence by charities, meetingswith their officials and telephone interviews. Fewinquiries involve systems checks within charities ordetailed financial examinations. 2.12 Commission staff are expected to establish the aims of an inquiry before it is approved. Until October 2000, theywere not required to develop a detailed plan or specifywhat methods they will use or who they expect tocontact. Our case examination found that the majority ofinquiries were conducted through correspondence,telephone calls and meetings with officials of the charitiesconcerned. When inquiries included visits to charities,they were generally confined to meetings with trusteesand other key personnel and in only a very smallproportion of cases did they also carry out checks ofcontrol systems and file searches. For example, in Case 2 Commission staff did not examine the charity's recordseven though the causes for concern pointed to a possibleproblem with records of cash receipts. 2.13 When conducting inquiries, Commission staff make contact with a wide variety of external local andnational bodies, including others with a regulatory role.The Housing Corporation, Companies House, InlandRevenue and HM Customs and Excise told us thatliaison arrangements were working well and that theywere satisfied with the Commission's approach toseeking and sharing information. However, theCommission does not routinely notify other keyregulators when it launches an inquiry into a charity. The Commission's use of its statutory powers has continued to decline. 2.14 In 1998, the Committee of Public Accounts expressed concern that the Commission was not using fully itspowers under the 1993 Charities Act to speed up caseresolution. Since then, the Commission's overall use of itsstatutory powers has further declined, although the use ofsome individual powers increased in 2000-01. Forexample, in that year the Commission appointed sevenreceiver managers to charities to carry out tasks, such aswinding up the charity, which the trustees were unwillingor unable to undertake. This was more than it had done inthe previous three years combined (Figure 10) . Our examination identified instances where theCommission had used its powers to good effect, as inCase 3 where they were used to remove an individual from the position of trustee. And in Case 1 , where they were used to obtain access to bank accounts and compelindividuals to provide documents or give evidence. 2.15 The Commission has not used some of its statutory powers at all, for example, to appoint an externalauditor, to recover charitable trust assets from debarredtrustees, or to prosecute for failure to provideinformation. Given that weaknesses were substantiatedin 191 inquiries in 2000-01 and that 53 took more than 12 months to resolve a more assertive use of powersmight have been expected. The Commission told us thatquite often the threat of using its powers is sufficient togain co-operation from previously unco-operativetrustees but that it intends using its powers moreextensively in future to speed up closure of inquirycases. The Commission also considers that now that itpublishes the results of its inquiries on its website,charities will have the opportunity of learning from themistakes of others. The use of the website in this way isan important development. The Institute of CharityFundraising Managers, for example, told us that it was\"important that the Commission demonstrates whatcontrols are in place against fraud, dubious streetcollectors and rose sellers and that it is seen to bepolicing newer ways of collecting funds, for example,from young people or via websites\" .The Commission's use of inquiry powers 1996-20011 With few exceptions, the Commission's use of its statutory powers has declined in recent years.

Eight discharged at own request Source: Charity Commission1021part twoGIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES Case 3 Disqualifying a trustee The Inland Revenue contacted the Commission following a court case in which they had sought back tax from a trading subsidiary of a charity. An outcome of the case was that one of the directors was disqualified, making him ineligible to serve as a trustee of a charity. The Commission checked its database and found that this director was a trustee on 10 other charities. A ll these charities were notified that the individual concerned was no longer eligible to act as a trustee for their charity and he was removed. Case 4 Good follow up action on an inquiry This charity was referred to Investigations Division after routine monitoring by the Commission had picked out some cause forconcern. The caseworker visited the charity to discuss the issues causing concern and significant progress was made during thecourse of the inquiry in rectifying the problems, many of which stemmed from the poor service provided by their previousauditors. When closing the case in March 2000, the caseworker recommended that the case should be reviewed in six month's time to ensure that the charity's planned fundraising activities, together with the associated forecasted costs were acceptable. At the time that the National Audit Office reviewed the case in October 2000, a new evaluation had recently been opened, and the Commission was waiting for information they had requested from the charity. Case 5 Failure to check whether a charity had followed through required actions Background This charity, with an annual income of over \u00a3700,000, is concerned with educating children. Key dates Major activitiesAugust 1999 The Commission opens an evaluation case after the chair of the charity's trustees writes seeking advice on how to deal with allegations that the school's headmaster has misappropriated school funds. The Commission isconcerned at the laxity of the trustees' administration and their unwillingness to involve the police. It advisesthe charity to go directly to the police and to consult a solicitor. September 1999 After seeking legal advice, the charity dismisses the headmaster, withholding a lump sum, due as part of his terms and conditions of employment and recovering his car, saving around \u00a350,000. The Commission closesthe case. December 1999 The trustees write to the Commission confirming that they have withheld the headmaster's severance pay, car and pension and are waiting on a decision by the police to investigate. Commentary It was not clear from the case file just how much money was misappropriated and, therefore, when the \u00a350,000 is taken into account, how much money had been lost. The caseworker closed the case following assurances from trustees that internalauditors had been consulted about strengthening financial controls. The case, however, was not noted for follow-up action afterthe completion of police inquiries and to monitor progress in implementing revised controls.22part twoGIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES The Commission does not always check that charities have successfully carried out agreed actions aimed atremedying weaknesses. 2.16 We found that in some instances the Commission was following up its investigations to establish that charitieswere implementing agreed improvements (Case 4) and in some instances it was not (Case 5) . Of the 30 evaluation and inquiry cases we examined follow-up had not been carried out in seven of the 12 caseswhere this would have been necessary for theCommission to be certain that agreed actions had beenimplemented. We also found that the point at whichinquiry cases were closed varied across theCommission, with some staff closing them as soon asan action plan had been agreed with the charity andothers waiting until they had evidence that promisedactions had been completed. The Commission has nowlaid down a standard approach to the closure of casesin its new Investigations Manual and provided furtherguidance on the follow-up of cases. 2.17 We also found that it was not always possible to identify clearly from case files what actions a charity wasexpected to carry out to rectify weaknesses. InSeptember 2000, an internal audit report identifiedsimilar weaknesses and recommended thatinvestigation staff should produce a final reportcontaining: a summary of the work undertaken; theoutcome of the case; an action plan setting out what thecharity had agreed to do by when; and what follow upwork the Commission might need to do. TheCommission has incorporated these recommendationsin its new Investigations Manual.Part 3GIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES Registering and supporting charities 23 part threeIntroduction 3.1 This part of the report examines the adequacy of the Commission's arrangements for registering andsupporting charities, in particular: !whether charities are being properly scrutinisedprior to registration; !whether checks are being undertaken to ensure thatunsuitable people do not become trustees; and !whether requests for advice are being promptly andeffectively handled. Whether charities are being properly scrutinised prior to registration The Commission is scrutinising applications forregistration more rigorously and fewer applicationsare progressing to full registration. 3.2 Applicants to register a new charity must provide the Commission with details of the proposed charityincluding: governing documents setting out the charity'spurposes and how it is to be run; a list of trustees, withtheir signatures; and other supporting information whichexplains the charity's objectives and how it expects tobe able to finance its activities. Before registering acharity, the Commission checks that its objectives arecharitable (paragraph 1.8), and that proposed trusteesare not disqualified. The Charities Act 1993 obliges theCommission to register charities which have charitablestatus in law and it cannot withhold registration, forexample, because of any doubts it might have about thelikely effectiveness of a charity in meeting its aims.However, the Commission carries out checks on thetrustees, on the charity's proposed activities and on thefeasibility of delivering the stated objectives to ensurethe charity can realistically do what it intends. Thesechecks will help to establish whether a charity isestablished for the benefit of the public and is eligible toregister as a charity. The Commission also considerswhether the organisation's name is too similar to that ofa charity that is already registered, or is in some otherway unsuitable.3.3 In 2000-01, the Commission processed applications from over 8,000 prospective charities and registeredunder 6,000, of which some 1,200 were charitiesworking with children. The figure of 8,000 compareswith over 10,000 applications processed in 1996-97, afall of 22 per cent (Figure 11) . The reasons for this fall are not known. It is likely, however, to reflect, in part,the Commission's efforts to deter fruitless applicationsby, for example, providing potential applicants withinformation to help them determine their own eligibility.The percentage of applications which progressed to fullregistration has also fallen, from 88 per cent in 1996-97to 73 per cent in 2000-01. Since our last report in 1997,the Commission has introduced more rigorousprocedures for scrutinising applications, includingchecks to ensure that organisations working directlywith children recognise the need to have a childprotection policy in place. Comparison between the number of organisations seeking to register as a charity and the numberregistered 1996-97 to 2000-01 Source: Charity CommissionApplications for registration11 10,000 8,000 6,000 4,000 2,000 012,000There has been a reduction in the number of applications and the proportion which progress to full registration over the five years from 1996-97 to application does not proceed to registration, the Commission does not record whether the case wasdiscontinued on a voluntary basis or whether it isformally refused registration. The Commission considersthat the majority of cases were discontinued on avoluntary basis but is now planning to investigate thereasons through a customer survey. In 2000-01, theCommission dealt with 45 appeals against its refusal toregister and rejected 38. 3.5 While the Commission has progressively sought to improve its handling of registration cases, there is stillscope for further improvements. As part of theCommission's annual quality review arrangements,five per cent of cases are reviewed by Commission staffindependent of the registration process for compliancewith internal procedures. These reviews show that thequality of registration work in the Commission variesconsiderably. For example, whereas in 2000-01,79 per cent of cases handled by the Taunton office wereconsidered acceptable or better the figure for theLiverpool office was 66 per cent. The Commission hasnot fully investigated the reasons for these regionaldifferences in quality scores. In September 1998, theCommission's internal auditors highlighted significantweaknesses in the registration process including theneed for more active case management, betteroperational guidance, and better recording of decisions.In 1999, the Commission drew up an action plan toimplement the recommendations from this report. Whether checks are being undertaken to ensure that disqualified people do notbecome trustees The Commission has improved its procedures forchecking prospective trustees of new charities. It isconsulting on how to strengthen arrangements forchecking the suitability of trustees appointed toexisting charities. 3.6 One way the Commission aims to maintain public confidence in charities is by checking that theprospective trustees of a charity seeking registration arenot disqualified. In 1998, the Committee of PublicAccounts expressed concern that the Commission wasnot doing enough to establish the suitability of trustees,including making checks with relevant third parties. 3.7 We found that, in response to the Committee's concerns, the Commission had strengthened its internalchecking systems, forged links with a wider range ofexternal organisations and provided additional stafftraining. Commission staff are expected to check thenames, addresses and phone numbers of applicants andtrustees, check that they are not undischargedbankrupts, have not previously been removed as atrustee of a charity by the Commission and have notbeen disqualified under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. For charities working in highrisk areas there are more intensive checks includingchecking the lists of people barred from working withchildren, maintained by the Department for Educationand Skills. 3.8 People who have committed serious offences, particularly against children, are banned from serving astrustees and others who have been convicted of anoffence involving deception or dishonesty are ineligibleto serve as trustees unless their conviction is spent. TheCommission will be able to make checks on individualsworking with children or vulnerable adults through theCriminal Records Bureau when it begins operations.However, this will only be possible for the small numberof trustees appointed directly by the Commission. In allother circumstances information held by the CriminalRecords Bureau will only be available to the charitymaking the appointment. The Commission is alsocontinuing to seek access to the Police NationalComputer to check whether individuals are disqualifiedby their criminal records. 3.9 Our case examinations identified examples of the Commission checking applications, and, as a result,rejecting applications from doubtful sources (Case 6). We also found evidence that registration staff were usingexternal sources to check potential trustees, forexample, a check with the Insolvency Service revealedthat a care body was proposing to include among itstrustees an undischarged bankrupt. The Commission 24part threeGIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES Case 6 Checking trustees of new charities In late 1999, the Commission received an application toregister a charity offering adventure holidays overseas.The charity's aims were ill defined and the Commissionfelt uncomfortable. Checks revealed that the trusteeswere not on the electoral rolls and the companyregistration details were wrong. A check of theCommission's internal database showed that thepromoter had previously tried to register another charitythe previous year and had been rejected. InMarch 2000, this new application was similarly rejectedand all new names associated with the application wereadded to the Commission's database for futurereference.25part threeGIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES informed the applicants that this person was ineligible to serve as a trustee, the person withdrew, areplacement was found and the charity duly registered. 3.10 Following registration, a charity must notify the Commission of any changes in trustees. Theappointment of new trustees, however, is not subject tochecking by the Commission, for example, to establishwhether they are disqualified from acting as trustees. Todo so would be a significant task. It is estimated thatthere are approximately two million trustees ofregistered charities and while there are no reliablefigures on the annual turnover of trustees, even if it wasas low as ten per cent, this would require theCommission to run checks on another 200,000 peopleevery year, compared with around 24,000 currently. 3.11 The Commission expects the charities themselves to operate checks and standards to ensure that all newappointees are suitable to act as trustees, particularlywhere they may be in contact with vulnerable people,but has not yet issued guidance on the subject. TheCommission plans to do so once it has finishedconsulting on what information it should gather onindividual trustees, what should be done with thatinformation and how much of it should be madepublicly available. The Association of Chief Executivesof Voluntary Organisations acknowledged to us thatchecking new trustees was difficult, given the numbersinvolved, but considered that \"the Commission could do more to build quality into the processes charities use torecruit and select trustees\".Whether requests for advice are being promptly and effectively handled In the past four years, there has been an increase inthe number of requests from charities for advice andthe average duration of cases is increasing. 3.12 Some 155 Commission staff are involved in the provision of advice and assistance to charities. Thisinvolves, in particular, making orders or schemes toallow charities to do things not covered by theirgoverning articles. When it registers a charity, theCommission tries to ensure that it has relevant andworkable governing articles. However, the passage oftime can reduce their relevance. The Commission canuse its statutory powers to facilitate changes to articlesthereby allowing the charity's funds to be applied moreeffectively (Case 7) . The Commission is also asked to authorise one-off transactions which the trustees judgeto be in the charity's interests. Such assistance can havemajor financial implications for a charity, for example,enabling resources to be used for new more productivepurposes. Charities are not charged for these services. 3.13 Over the five financial years 1996-2001, the Commission has faced a 42 per cent increase in requestsfrom charities for advice and support, up from nearly26,000 in 1996-97 to over 36,000 in 2000-01(Figure 12) . As the number of staff involved in this work has remained at around 155, their caseload hasincreased from an average of 168 cases in 1996-97 to226 cases in 2000-01. Difficulties in dealing with this Growth in charity support cases 1996-97 to 2000-0112 Source: Charity CommissionBetween 1996-97 and 2000-01 there was a 42 per cent increase in the number of charity support cases. Charity support cases ('000s) 0540 35 30 25 yearsCase 7 Helping a charity update its governing instruments and use previously unproductive resources This case concerns a charity, comprising eleven separate charities which dates back to 1840. The charity's objectwas to maintain almshouses for the benefit of the poor.However, the charity's almshouse was demolished in1959 and when it sold its land in 1992 it was advised bythe Commission that it would need to legally alter itsobjects in order to become a grant-making body for therelief of those in need. After several years of discussionwith the trustees, the Commission used its legal powersto: amalgamate the eleven separate charities, so reducingthe requirement to account separately; amend thecharity's objects to modernise its purpose; and changethe name to reflect its revised objects. 26part threeGIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES increase have meant that the number of cases carried forward from one year to the next has risen from some4,500 in 1996-97 to 9,200 in 2000-01, whilst theaverage time taken to clear cases has increased from80 days to 112 days (Figure 13) (Case 8) . There are also substantial regional differences, with the Liverpooloffice taking an average of 146 days to clear a case butin the London office it took 89 days. Our analysisindicates that around 37 per cent of requests for adviceand assistance come from charities with an annualincome below \u00a310,000 and 18 per cent from the fiveper cent of charities with incomes over \u00a3250,000. 3.14 The Commission has been able to manage the increase in support cases without any drop in service standardsor a rise in complaints from charities. The Commission'ssurvey of charities in March 2000, for example, showedthat 83 per cent of respondents were satisfied with thehelp they had received and only two per centdissatisfied. This performance has been achieved despitestaffing difficulties, particularly in the Commission'sLondon office. In October 2000, the office was13 per cent below complement and half of its staff hadless than two years experience. For the Commission as awhole, the comparative figures were around four percent and 25 per cent respectively. 3.15 The Commission is addressing staffing issues, partly through a new pay system introduced fromOctober 2000. It is also considering other options, suchas the reorganisation of work between offices. Over time,however, the Commission may find it difficult to sustainyear on year increases in case numbers, given currentstaffing levels and the complexity of the issues on whichadvice is sought. It is difficult to predict what the likelydemand for the Commission's advisory services will be inthe future. Nevertheless, the expanded use of the web,the growth in internal referrals arising from the increased monitoring of annual returns and accounts, and theimpact of greater regulation are likely to fuel demand. The Commission's support work is often able to detect and remedy problems. 3.16 The Commission considers that its charity support function serves an important preventative role. Forexample, the Commission may advise trustees whenthey need to get legal or accounting advice of their ownto resolve disputes, make their accounts compliant withthe Commission's Statement of Recommended Practiceor verify the legitimacy of certain actions orexpenditure. In addition, while responding to requestsfor assistance or advice, the Commission may identify aproblem, or potential problem, which a charity has notrecognised. It will then help the charity resolve thematter without the need to mount a formal investigation(Case 9). The Commission collects data on support cases which show that in 2000-01 it provided advice ongovernance or administration at its own instigation in2,700 cases and on legal matters in 400 cases. The Commission makes a wide range of information available to charities through its publications andwebsite. Users comment favourably on these servicesand the website broadly complies with current bestpractice. 3.17 The Commission has produced over seventy publications to help charities and these can be viewedand printed on the Commission's website or sent onrequest. The website includes details of Commissionevents around the country, how it can be contactedincluding maps showing the locations of its offices, andlinks with other government departments and charitableorganisations. The website also provides guidelines ontopics such as registration, investigations and trustees'responsibilities, and contains a section on questionscommonly raised about registration, taxation, accounts,data update forms, annual returns and trustee payments. 3.18 The website receives up to eight million hits a year, including some one million to view the Register ofCharities. The NOP survey (paragraph 1.18) showed that65 per cent of those surveyed had used a Commissionpublication and 20 per cent had visited the website. Ofthose who had used these services, well over80 per cent considered them to be good or very good.The Commission's website broadly meets the goodpractice criteria detailed in our report Government on the Web (HC 87, 1999-2000) (Appendix 5). The website is currently undergoing a major re-design to incorporategovernment website standards and will be re-launchedlater in 2001.

Instead, the Trust set up by this charity was shown as part of the endowment of a branch o f another charity. Whilst this is allowed in certain circumstances, it can only be done with the Commission's agreement and oncea direction has been issued. The case was passed to Charity Support Division to consider whether the charity was eligible forsuch a direction.

Commentary There was a regular exchange of correspondence on this case between the caseworker and the charity's solicitor, but the nature of the case was complex, given the fact that the original bequest of land and property had been sold. It required considerableeffort to track past events and supporting documentation. Case 9 New cause for concern identified during charity support casework In 1989, a charity sold land to a County Council, authorised by a Charity Commission Order. In 1995, the charity asked theCommission's advice about the Council's plans to sell on the land. During the case, the Commission identified that the charityhad been accumulating funds rather than spending them. The focus of the case changed to addressing this issue, resulting in thecharity making several proposals for expenditure. The case ended with the Commission offering the charity a Scheme that wouldremove the need for the Commission's approval for future charitable expenditure.28part threeGIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES The Commission receives few complaints and complainants have access to both internal as well asexternal complaints procedures. 3.19 Charities or individuals who are dissatisfied with the service provided by the Commission or its decisions caninvoke the Commission's complaints and reviewprocedures. In 2000-01, the Commission investigated121 complaints, of which 22 per cent were upheld, moston the basis that the Commission had failed to meet itstarget response time. The Commission has not yet fullyanalysed these complaints so that lessons can be identifiedand passed on to staff for the future. The Commission alsoreceived 45 letters of compliment in 2000-01. 3.20 Since January 2000, complainants who are not satisfied with the outcome of the internal review procedures havehad the option of asking an Independent ComplaintsReviewer to consider their case. In 2000, the IndependentComplaints Reviewer received 43 complaints. Of the eightcomplaints that were formally investigated that year, theReviewer partly upheld one, did not uphold five andfound two to be outside her terms of reference. TheReviewer considers that the Commission \"now has better systems, it investigates complaints more thoroughly andthere is less fear about dealing with complaints\" . The Parliamentary Ombudsman received 14 complaintsagainst the Commission in 2000. He decided that threeneeded to be investigated. One complaint was partlyupheld and the other two investigations are still underway. Introduction 4.1 The Commission seeks to increase the transparency and accountability of the charitable sector by making coreinformation on all registered charities publicly available,by collecting and analysing annual returns, annualaccounts and annual reports from the larger charities,and through targeted visits. This part examines: !whether the Commission maintains accessible,accurate and up to date information on charities;and !whether the Commission has effective mechanismsfor scrutinising the performance of charities. 4.2 Each year all registered charities are expected to provide the Commission with information to help update theRegister of Charities. In addition, those with an annualincome or expenditure over \u00a310,000 must complete anannual return and provide the Commission with a copyof their annual accounts and annual report (Figure 14).Whether the Commission maintains accessible, accurate and up to dateinformation on charities The Commission has made substantial progressin improving the accuracy of its Register of Charitiesand is pursuing those charities which fail to provideit with timely information to update their entrieson the Register. 4.3 The Commission has a statutory responsibility to keep a Register of Charities. The Register provides a list ofregistered charities, their registration number, date ofregistration, name and working name, description ofobjectives, name and contact details of correspondent,date of last accounts received and annual income fromlast accounts. The Register is used by the InlandRevenue when checking whether an organisation isentitled to tax benefits as a registered charity, localauthorities when charities apply for permission to carry out street collections, and individuals looking for keyPart 4GIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES Making charities transparent and accountable 29 part four Note: 1.

The Register can be viewed at the Commission's three regional offices or, in anabridged format, on the Commission's website. 4.4 In 1998, the Committee of Public Accounts (HC 28) was critical of the accuracy of the Register. Our 1998examination had found, for example, that the date thecharity was registered was correctly r ecorded in only 83 per cent of cases and the date the last accounts werereceived was correct in only 84 per cent of cases. By2000, the Commission had improved accuracy levels inthese areas to 99 per cent and 94 per cent respectively. 4.5 To ensure that the Register is kept up to date, charities are invited - but not required by statute - to send theCommission a record update form within 10 months ofthe end of their financial year. In comparison,Companies House requires a similar return within28 days of the anniversary of a company'sincorporation. The proportion of charities submittingupdated information promptly has increased from49 per cent in 1997-98 to 66 per cent in 2000-01. 4.6 The Commission pursues outstanding update forms and by June 2001 had obtained 85 per cent of all forms.Whilst this was up from 80 per cent at 31 March 1998,around 285 charities with income of \u00a3250,000 or morehad not yet provided information to update their entrieson the Register. Charities which fail to send in a recordupdate form for four consecutive years are referred to aspecialist monitoring team to check whether thecharities are still active. In September 1999, when theteam was established, there were some 18,800 charitiesto check. By March 2001, the Commission hadestablished contact with, or removed from the Register,all but some 700 of these charities. At present, thewebsite version of the Register of Charities does notshow when individual charities last updated their entryand provided their annual reports. More large charities are submitting their annual returns, annual accounts and annual reports on timeand a specialised enforcement team has beenestablished to chase up late responses. 4.7 Charities with an annual income or expenditure of \u00a310,000 or above are legally obliged to provide theCommission with annual returns and annual accounts.In 1998, the Committee of Public Accounts was criticalof the Commission's failure to meet its target to obtain90 per cent of charity accounts; the Commission onlycollecting some 62 per cent. The Commission told theCommittee of Public Accounts that it would set moredemanding targets for larger charities including a100 per cent target for charities with an annual incomeof \u00a3250,000 or more. Since our report there has beensome progress across all income bands. For charitieswhose financial years ended between March 1998 andFebruary 1999, 89 per cent of annual returns were31 part foursubmitted by June 2001. Returns were obtained from 96 per cent of the 9,283 largest charities, leaving339 still being pursued. 4.8 While there has also been some improvement in the timeliness of submissions, for charities whose financialyears ended between March 1999 and February 2000,only 62 per cent of the annual returns were submittedon time (Figure 15) . Unlike Companies House, where 88 per cent of annual reports are provided on time, theCommission does not have the power to fine charitiesfor late submission of documents. However, if its ownenforcement action proves unsuccessful, it can refercases to the police who will decide whether or not toask the Crown Prosecution Service to prosecute. In2000-01, for the first time, the Commission referred twocases to the Crown Prosecution Service and these arecurrently being followed up as test cases. 4.9 The Commission has recognised the need to improve submission rates further and has put several strategies inplace to achieve this, particularly for the larger charities.In 1998, it established an Enforcement Unit to chase upall returns, accounts and reports over two months latefrom charities with an annual income or expenditureover \u00a3100,000. The Commission originally focused mostof its efforts on chasing up those charities which hadfailed to submit their returns for three or more Proportion of annual returns which arrived on time 1997-98 to 1999-200015 Source: Charity CommissionAlthough there has been an improvement in the number of charities submitting their annual returns on time, the proportion failing to comply is still high.

In October 2000, there were 70 charities with income over \u00a3100,000 in this categoryand in February 2001, when the Commission publishedthe names of defaulting charities on its website, therewere only six outstanding. During our examination, weraised the possibility of cases being referred to the Unitat a much earlier stage to prevent the build up of largenumbers of outstanding returns and statements.The Commission said that it planned to do so. The Commission has produced guidance to encourage greater consistency in the way charitiesreport annually but there is scope to improve theways in which charities report on their performance. 4.10 To encourage greater consistency in the way charities report, the Commission has produced a Statement ofRecommended Practice (SORP) which recommendshow charities should report annually on the resourcesentrusted to them and the activities they undertake. Thefirst Statement of Recommended Practice was publishedin October 1995 and it was revised in October 2000. 4.11 Among the changes the revised SORP seeks to achieve is the creation of a clearer relationship between costsincurred to generate income and the income raised.Charities have some discretion about how they recordfundraising costs and income, so trustees are expectedto include in their annual reports a narrative on theeffectiveness of fundraising activities undertaken duringthe year. This should make accounts more transparentthough the Commission may need to make clearer whatshould be included in the narrative, for example, if theratio of fundraising costs to funds raised is high, whetherthe charity considers this acceptable and if not whatactions it proposes to reduce the ratio. The Directory ofSocial Change, an organisation set up to provideinformation and training to voluntary organisations, toldus that \" the new SORP should make fundraising costs more transparent but guidance on what should beincluded in the narrative report appears in severalplaces and may not be accessible to busy trustees \". 4.12 Now that the annual accounts of charities are being produced in a more consistent form, it should becomeeasier for the Commission to compare performance overtime within individual charities or among similar groupsof charities and charities of similar size. In line with ourown findings, the Wales Council for Voluntary Actiontold us that the Commission needed to become a moreintelligent user of data - \" now that it collects it, it needs to analyse it better and supplement it with data fromother sources \". The Commission is examining the scope for developing financial measures, from data in acharity's account, which may prove helpful ininterpreting the financial performance of a charity, forexample the ratio of management expenditure toexpenditure on direct charitable activities. Other ratioswhich could be usefully examined include the ratio ofspending on fundraising compared to cash reserves, although, given the diverse nature of the charity sector,such analysis will have to be treated with some cautionand used only as an indicator. 4.13 For all accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2001, the SORP recommends, amongst otherthings, that charities' reports and accounts shouldenable the reader to understand their objectives,structure, activities and achievements. The annualreports of the charities we examined underlined theneed for this recommendation. While some reportsinformed the reader of what was achieved (Case 11) others were much less helpful in this respect (Case 12 ) , and it was not always possible to compare plannedperformance with actual performance or to compareperformance over time. Some information may becommercially sensitive and therefore cannot bepublished. However, compliance with the SORP'srecommendations will be a key issue for theCommission in the future. Whether the Commission has effective mechanisms for scrutinising the performanceof charities The Commission has strengthened its arrangementsfor scrutinising the performance of charities includingan electronic assessment of all returns and regulatoryvisits to a sample of larger charities. 4.14 A key objective of the Commission is to improve the governance, accountability, efficiency and effectivenessof charities. To achieve this objective, the Commissionmonitors the performance of all charities with an annualincome or expenditure over \u00a310,000 by obtaining andexamining their annual returns. It also carries out visitsto a sample of those charities with an annual incomeover \u00a3100,000. 4.15 Information from the charities' annual returns is stored on computer and compared with some 50 predetermined thresholds or responses (Case 13) . When one of these thresholds is exceeded, or responsesactivated, a report is produced showing which area, orareas, of the charity's operations may give cause forconcern. All charities whose returns generate suchreports are then scrutinised by the Commission'smonitoring staff in Liverpool. In addition, Commissionstaff monitor a stratified random sample of the charitieswhich do not generate reports - examining all charitieswith annual incomes over \u00a3250,000 and smallersamples of those with incomes below \u00a3250,000. Whenscrutinising the annual returns, monitoring staff alsoexamine annual accounts and annual reports. Thefinancial documents of large and complex charities areexamined by the Commission's accountants to ensurethat accounts are consistent with the Commission's33 part fourGIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES Case 10 Enforcement action resulting in removal from the Register In 1999, monitoring staff referred this charity to the Investigations Division as the annual return had been returned uncomplet ed. The charity had been set up in 1996 to assist people with disabilities, but had never submitted any accounts. The caseworkertried to re-establish contact with the charity but phone checks were not able to locate any of the trustees at the addressesprovided in the initial registration documents nor at any other addresses over the region. At the time the charity was register ed, Commission checks were rudimentary and no checks were made on the trustees. The caseworker tried other contacts as well asa local disability information service. They had never heard of the charity and pointed out to the Commission that the register ed address of the charity did not exist. No checks were made with the police. Having failed to locate the charity, it was then de-registered. The names of the trustees were not checked to see if they were trustees of other charities, nor were they added to the Commission's Local Information Index as a precaution should theindividuals concerned try to register another charity in the future. The Commission did not specifically notify the Inland Reve nue of the circumstances surrounding the charity's removal from the Register so that it could investigate whether the charity had b een receiving tax concessions to which it was not entitled. The Commission pointed out, however, that changes to the Register arepassed to the Inland Revenue at regular intervals. Case 11 Transparent and publicly accountable annual report The annual report of a children's charity with an annual income of some \u00a3330,000 provided a useful overview of the charity'sachievements during the year. Key activities were briefly described and quantified where practical. The reader was informed ofthe number of self-help groups formed, the number of monthly calls to the help-line and of plans for the future. The report cou ld have been further strengthened with the inclusion of performance measures and historical data enabling the reader to compareeasily what was promised with the charity's achievements and making it easier to assess the feasibility of future plans. Case 12 Failure to state publicly what has been achieved The annual report of a charity providing assistance to handicapped children provides a three-line description of the charity'sactivities. The report states only that: During the year, applications for help were received from hospitals, homes, special schools and from families and social workers on behalf of individual children. Appeals are investigated and once validity is established and approval given by thecommittee, money is allocated to purchase requirements. The charity has an annual income of some \u00a3300,000 but it is not possible from the annual report to obtain any sense of what the charity sought to achieve, what it actually achieved or what it expects to achieve in the future. Case 13 Monitoring a charity's annual return identifies weaknesses When the annual return of a large regional arts charity was computer analysed, it generated a report highlighting three causesfor concern: !fundraising and publicity expenditure was more than \u00a310,000 and greater than 40 per cent of the amount received fromfundraising; !total unrestricted funds were negative; and !current assets plus investments were less than liabilities. Monitoring staff carried out a preliminary review of the charity's annual accounts and sought internal accountancy advice. This examination confirmed that the charity was facing serious solvency issues. The case was referred to the Charity Support Divisio n, with the recommendation that a visit be carried out. Assurances were provided during the visit that a wealthy benefactor wasplanning to wipe out much of the charity's debt and continue underwriting the charity and the case was closed. Statement of Recommended Practice and that the charity is financially solvent and viable. The Associationof Charitable Foundations told us that the Commissionhad \" the basis for a sound regulatory system but could make more use of statistical and aggregate informationfrom the returns to present an overview of charityfinance and practice \". 4.16 For annual returns for the period March 1998 to February 1999, the most recent period for which allmonitoring has been completed, some 12,000 charitiestriggered some 22,000 possible causes for concern.Where monitoring staff encounter a serious cause forconcern, this is referred elsewhere in the Commission.However, the vast majority of cases (91 per cent in1999-2000) are resolved by some 25 monitoring staff.The three main reasons for referral related to concernsover fundraising, trustee benefits and tradingcompanies. Once referred, cases are not always pursuedvigorously, for example some 37 per cent of referralsrelating to the financial year ended March 1998 had notbeen resolved by August 2000. By June 2001five per cent of these referrals were still unresolved. 4.17 The Commission has collected data on the proportion of referral cases where causes for concern aresubstantiated. These data show substantial variationsbetween different categories of referrals, for example,for the financial year ended in March 1999, 48 per centof the Commission's concerns relating to trustee benefitswere substantiated compared with 60 per cent ofconcerns about trading companies. The Commission hasnot determined the reasons for these variations. Withone in five charities failing at least one trigger,examining every apparent failing generates a substantialworkload for the Commission. Although theCommission estimates that each examination costs onlysome \u00a313, the numbers involved mean that even amodest reduction in the volume of unsubstantiatedcases could produce worthwhile financial savings. The Commission's monitoring focuses on financial issues but does not yet cover governance issues. 4.18 Good governance is the first line of defence against problems emerging in charities and the Commission hasdone much to help charities strengthen the way inwhich trustees operate. The Commission supportsnetworking among trustees via the Charity TrusteeNetworks, makes guidance on governance issuesreadily available through its website and publicationsand provides advice through its website, helplines andcharity support staff. 4.19 The annual return asks charities questions which focus primarily on financial matters and the Commissioncurrently gathers little information on governanceissues. Making firm judgements about the quality of acharity's governing body is likely to require a mixture ofmeasures. However, there are quantitative indicatorsthat may help identify possible governance problemsincluding: an unusually high turnover of trustees; fewfull board meetings in a year; low average attendance atboard meetings; or a pattern of inquorate meetings. The Commission is overhauling its visit programme to make it better targeted, more risk focused andmore rigorous. 4.20 Another key element of the Commission's strategy for scrutinising charities is its visits programme. Thisprogramme was introduced in 1997 and, in general, theCommission has exceeded its target for visiting someof the 16,000 charities with an annual income over\u00a3100,000 (Figure 16) . The programme is targeted at the larger charities but smaller ones are visited ifa specific issue or problem is brought to theCommission's attention. 4.21 The Commission recognised that the visits programme needed to be better targeted, more risk focused andmore rigorous, and early in 2000, as part ofthe Government's Spending Review, it bid successfullyfor funding to bolster and refocus the programme.Further impetus was given to the need for change bythe findings of a critical internal report produced inMay 2000. 34part fourGIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES Comparison of planned and actual regulatory visits 1997-98 to 2000-01 The Commission has regularly exceeded its regulatory visit target.

Source: Charity Commission1635 part fourGIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES 4.22 Our examination corroborated the conclusions reached in the Commission's internal report that the visitsprogramme needed to include: a systematicexamination of key charity documents, for example,business plans, internal financial audit and value formoney reports, external evaluations and trusteeminutes; and interviews with, for example, volunteers orbeneficiaries. We also found that the visits were notused to validate information appearing in the charity'sannual return and there was no standard approach toproviding feedback, producing a written report, clearingthe report with the charity or developing action plans toimplement recommendations (Case 14) . No quality standards existed to inform charities about how the visitwould be managed, how long they might have to waitfor feedback nor what they could do if they were notcontent with the findings emerging from the visit.Follow-up was ad hoc and dependent on the actions of the case officer. Although the government hasencouraged regulators and inspectors to work moreclosely together, we found minimal evidence that theCommission had considered the need to involve, orliaise with, others in connection with visits. 4.23 With additional funding from April 2002, the Commission plans to: double the number of visits; adopta more structured and forensic approach; and focus oncharities with an annual income of over \u00a3250,000,ensuring that each targeted charity is visited no less thanonce in 10 years. Weaknesses identified in the currentvisits programme are being addressed during2001-02 as part of a pilot to ensure that the new visitsprogramme provides an effective regulatory tool. Case 14 Failure to properly document visit and findings A Christian mission society was visited as part of the Commission's regulatory visit programme. Preparations began wellbut the visit's execution and follow-up were not well documented. The visit was intended to examine quickly governance,financial and administrative issues though there were some specific queries made by the Commission's accountancy staff,following a detailed accounts analysis, and legal staff drawing on past contact with the charity. The visit date was notrecorded on the computerised case management system. The case file contained a brief half page of undated visit notes.There is no indication that feedback was provided to the charity nor that any action plan was drawn up for futuremonitoring by the Commission.36appendix oneGIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES A charity is required to register, in accordance with Section 3(2) of the Charities Act 1993, if it meets both the following criteria. 1. A charity is subject to the jurisdiction of the High Court. This means that it is established in England and Wales and any o ne or more of the following applies: !all or a majority of the charity trustees are resident in England and Wales; !all or most of the assets are held in England and Wales; or !if a company, the organisation is incorporated in England and Wales. 2. Any one or more of the following applies: !the organisation has permanent endowment (that is, some or all of its assets are required to be held as capital which cannot be spent as though it were income); !the organisation has a total income from all sources exceeding \u00a31,000 per year; or !the organisation has the rateable use of, or owns or occupies land, including buildings, and is responsible for paying rates to the local authority for that property, even if the local authority has agreed not to charge any rate or to charge areduced rate. Some charities (such as charities promoting the efficiency of the armed forces) are excepted from the requirement to register b y specific regulations. Others, such as friendly societies and universities, are exempt under Section 2 of the Charities Act 1993 , even if they meet the criteria above. Other charities may register voluntarily despite not meeting the minimum criteria for registration, for example, if it can be s hown that substantial funds would be lost if they were not registered.

Conclusion (ii)The Commission needs to do more to ensure that charities on the Registercontinue to merit registered status. Itshould take steps urgently to identifyinactive charities and remove them fromthe register. Conclusions (iii) and (viii) The large number of charities failing to provide annual returns and accounts andthe lack of a Commission policy fordealing with such non co-operation. TheCommission should be seeking 100 percent of accounts from all charities with anannual income of \u00a310,000 or more. Conclusions (iv) and (v) The lack of accuracy in the Commission's Register of Charities and the lack of anappropriate target for accuracy. Conclusions (vi) and (vii) The Commission needs to make better use of available information at registrationstage. Conclusions (ix) to (xii) The Commission should ensure that arrangements are in place to trackpotential causes for concern identifiedthrough monitoring. Also it should makeeffective use of its information systems toidentify charities at risk and pursuedoubtful cases vigorously using wherenecessary its powers to require charities torespond.Treasury Minute response The Commission did not accept PAC'sconclusion. It reported an achievement of21 of its 27 key targets in 1997-98 andincreased use of its powers in 1997. The Commission noted PAC's conclusion. It removed 450 inactive charities early in1997 and launched a review of theRegister of Charities in April 1998. The Commission is focusing efforts on obtaining the statutorily required accountsand returns of charities with an annualincome of \u00a310,000 or more. Whilst theCommission notes PAC's wish to see100 per cent compliance from thesecharities it considers the practicality andcost of different levels of compliance canonly be assessed on the basis ofexperience of the new arrangements. The targets for accuracy of the Register will be set on the basis of experience. TheCommission will give priority to registeredcharities above the \u00a310,000 annualincome threshold. Those charities underthe threshold will be asked to confirmtheir details under the second cycle ofannual returns and will be checked on asample basis. The Commission is setting up a local information index containing informationon known trustees with doubtful bona-fides. The Commission is also exploringmore formal arrangements for obtaininginformation from the police, InlandRevenue, HM Customs and Excise andthe Employment Service and is increasingits checks at registration stage. The Commission accepted PAC's recommendations. It promised to providea note on the progress it expects to makeover the next two years in developing aneffective monitoring relationship withcharities. In following up failures torespond to requests for information theCommission intends to tailor its responsesto non-compliance to take account of therelative risk involved.Commission's progress The Commission is now meeting ahigher proportion of its targets withoutdiminishing the level of the targets.New more outcome focused targets arein place and the Commission isexperimenting with impact targets. The Commission has made progress in removing inactive charities from theRegister. In September 1999, theCommission identified 18,800 possiblyinactive charities. By March 2001, theCommission had established contact with, or removed from the Register, all but some 700 of these charities. The Commission has made some progress receiving over 90 per cent ofannual returns and financial statementsfor charities whose financial years endedbetween March 1998 and February 1999by the latest target date of March 2000.However, 35 per cent arrived late. AnEnforcement Unit has been established to chase up late or missing returns. By 2000, audits of the Register showed a marked improvement in accuracy. Forexample the date the charity wasregistered was correctly recorded in99 per cent of cases compared with83 per cent of cases at the time of the laststudy and the date the last account wasreceived was correct in 98 per cent ofcases compared with 84 per centpreviously The Commission is performing a more systematic series of checks on theprospective trustees of new charities.More formal links have been establishedwith other relevant agencies. The localinformation index has been establishedand is being used. Arrangements are in place to track monitoring cases referred elsewhere in the Commission. However, cases aretaking a long time to resolve. TheCommission has started work on riskprofiling but it is at a very early stage.There has been no increase in theCommission's use of its statutory powers.Appendix 2Issues raised by the Committee of Public Accounts in their 1998 report: Charity Commission: Regulation and Support ofCharities38appendix twoGIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES PAC concern Conclusions (xiii) to (xvi) There is a need for effective, timely and quality support to charities. Informationcollected should be used to maximise theimpact of the substantial resources usedon charity support. The Commission alsoneeds to demonstrate that it is respondingto charities' suggestions for improvementsin charity support. Conclusion (xvii) The Commission should review the allocation of resources to investigationwork urgently in the light of thethroughput of investigations and delays,the extra cases which are likely to arisefrom better monitoring and the publicperception that this work is one of themain purposes for which the Commissionexists.Treasury Minute response Information provided through theCommission's case management systemhas added to the quality of itsinterventions and is being used to makedecisions about the allocation of workand resources. Cases are scrutinised by managers to ensure none remain unactioned for longerthan 30 days. A senior member of staffhas been nominated at each site to dealwith feedback from charities and thepublic. The Commission did not accept PAC's conclusion. The Commission considersthat all its activities, directly or indirectly,are aimed at supervising andstrengthening charities and thatinvestigations using formal inquiry powersare only part of the Commission'soversight to ensure that charities areproperly established and run. TheCommission undertakes to keep underreview the relationship betweenregistration, monitoring, preventive,remedial and investigative work and theorganisation of the resources devoted tothem.Commission's progress The Commission is handling 29 per centmore cases and polling shows thatcharities are satisfied with theCommission's advice and support but theaverage duration of cases has increasedfrom 80 days in 1996-97 to 102 days in1999-2000. The Commission has devoted additional resources to the first stage of theregulatory process - monitoring and to the initial phase of investigations -evaluation, where there was a 23 per centincrease in cases in 1999-2000. Thenumber of full inquiry cases has fallenfrom 272 to 255, although the percentageof inquiries where weaknesses weresubstantiated has increased from 76 per cent to 91 per cent.GIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES 39appendix threeObjective One: to ensure that charities are able to operate for their proper purposes within an effective legal, accounting, and governance framework 2000-01 2000-01 Target met result target Y/N Percentage of successful applications which were given guidance 53% 58% N Turnaround time for determining charitable status 117 days 95 days NPercentage of cases where legal authority exercised at Commission's instigation 10% 10% YNumber of applications for registration processed 8,157 8,000 YNumber of applications for registration admitted to register (excluding those registered via bulk registration process) 4,881 5,200 N Staff cost per application processed \u00a3105.87 \u00a3114 YTime taken for preliminary assessment of application 9 days 15 days YNumber of times legal authority exercised 3,817 4,557 NStaff cost per exercise of legal authority \u00a3242 \u00a3243 Y Objective Two: to improve the governance, accountability, efficiency, and effectiveness of charities 2000-01 2000-01 Target met result target Y/N Percentage of cases where guidance given on charity governance or administration arose at our instigation 12% 10% Y Percentage of database entries complete and accurate 98% 88% YPercentage of target group monitored per charity monitored \u00a312.73 \u00a312.46 NNumber of cases leading to guidance being given on charity governance or administration 21,549 20,000 Y Staff cost per guidance case \u00a381 \u00a384 YNumber of visits conducted 329 330 NPercentage of visits resulting in guidance on governance or administration being given or legal authority exercised 100% 95% Y Staff cost per visit \u00a3569 \u00a3582 of people attending educational cost per educational event \u00a31,096 \u00a31,000 NPercentage of date update forms obtained before close of return cycle 90% 85% YAccounts examined for basic performance 2000-200140appendix threeGIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES Objective Three: to identify and deal with abuse and poor practices 2000-01 2000-01 Target met result target Y/N Percentage of investigations completed in 12 months target 75% 75% Y Percentage of investigations where irregularity corrected 90% cost per investigation where irregularity corrected \u00a34,257 \u00a33,827 NPercentage of annual returns obtained within 1 month of referral 55% 50% YPercentage of annual returns obtained within 3 months of referral 89% 75% YNumber of evaluations completed 1,152 1,130 YPercentage completed within 2 months target 77% 80% NNumber of investigations completed 212 225 NAmount directly protected \u00a328.47 million \u00a324 million YGIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES 41appendix fourMethod Note Data analysis Based on a review of data held on the Commission's case management database, mailing and monitoring database, Register of Charities database and other corporate database, we identified a series of analyses tobe generated by the Commission's IT staff in Taunton. The reports included, for example, data on thenumber of investigation cases closed and the time taken to close such cases. Where practical, weexamined data over a four-year cycle, comparing these trends with the findings of the last NAO report.Data were analysed on a regional and national basis and by income level of charity. Case studies To check that Commission guidelines were being followed consistently and that cases were being dealt with promptly, we examined a sample of case files in two of the Commission's three offices: Commission business Liverpool London function Registrations 5 5 Monitoring 5 5 Charity support 5 5 Visits 4 3 Evaluations 5 5 Inquiries 10 10 Total 34 33 Where practical, the random sample was stratified to include two cases where a charity had an annual income over \u00a31 million, two between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a31 million and one under \u00a3250,000. The filessampled were ones closed in the financial year to 31 March 2000. Given the importance of inquiry cases,we took a larger sample of inquiry cases drawing five cases for the financial year ended in March 2000and five cases for the period up to December 2000. In addition, to check that case actions were beingfollowed up, for each case sampled we examined Commission files on that charity from April 1995. Wedid not seek to undertake a statistically valid sample of cases, but used the information derived from thecase studies to illustrate the issues examined and to corroborate the results of our data analysis. Interviews - To obtain an external perspective of the Commission's regulatory functions and links with other parties, external stakeholders interviews were conducted with the following third parties: Interviews - Following the case examinations, Commission staff were interviewed where clarification was needed. internal stakeholders Further interview work was carried out at the three regional offices to check, for example, how staff were enforcing responses where charities were not forwarding returns and the types of financial analyses being used by the Commission's accountants when monitoring the accounts of large charities. Secondary analysis Information produced by independent third parties was used where possible including data derived from: face to face interviews with over 1,600 adults conducted for the Commission by MORI in February 1999;a telephone survey of some 600 charities conducted for the Commission by NOP in February 2000; andthe work of the Commission's internal auditors, Bentley Jennison.Appendix 4 Study methodology Association for Charities Association of Charitable FoundationsAssociation of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations Bentley Jennison Charity CheckCharity Finance HouseDepartment of Trade and IndustryDirectory Social Excise HM TreasuryHome OfficeHousing Complaints ReviewerInland RevenueInstitute of Charities Fundraising ManagersLocal Government AssociationNational Council for Voluntary OrganisationsOffice of the Parliamentary and Health ServiceOmbudsmanWales Council for Voluntary Action42appendix fiveGIVING CONFIDENTLY: THE ROLE OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN REGULATING CHARITIES Criterion 1.
