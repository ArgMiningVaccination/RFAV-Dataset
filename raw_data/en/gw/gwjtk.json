Describe the principles of active and passive immunity. 2. Identify the differences in immunologic response and contraindications between live attenuated and inactivated vaccines. 3. Identify the recommended vaccines for vaccine- preventable diseases for both children and adults. 4. Develop a vaccination plan, given a patient's age, immunization history, and medical history. 5. Educate a patient or caretaker on the benefits and risks associated with vaccines. 6. Distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate reasons for deferring vaccination. 7. Recognize possible adverse reactions.VACCINES THAT WILL BE COVERED Influenzae type b Rabies OthersPREVENTING DISEASE Sanitation (PPE) ImmunizationMORBIDITY COMPARISON IN U.S. DISEASE PRE- VACCINE ERA (Cases/Year)Cases in Diptheria Tetanus 1,314 41SMALLPOX Global Eradication Program in 1966 Last case reported in U.S. was in 1949 Routine vaccination discontinued 1972 Last indigenous case reported on earth was in 1977 MUMPSTETANUSHERPES ZOSTERVACCINES AND MEDIA MYTH OR REALITY \"Vaccine-preventable diseases have been virtually eliminated from the U.S., so my child does not need to be vaccinated.\" Some vaccine preventable diseases are no longer endemic in the U.S. These diseases may still be prevalent or even epidemic in other parts of the world. Outbreaks in the U.S. are often associated with foreign travel. Without vaccination, few cases could quickly become tens or hundreds of thousands.MYTH OR REALITY \"Aborted fetuses are used to make vaccines.\" Varicella, rubella, hepatitis A, and one rabies vaccine are made in fetal embryo fibroblast cells. Obtained from therapeutic termination of two pregnancies in 1960s. These same embryonic cells are used today. Rubella vaccine prevents congenital abnormalities and miscarriages.TRUE OR FALSE The amount of aluminum found in vaccines is similar to the amount found in 1 liter of infant formula? A.True B.False True. Aluminum is used as an adjuvant in some vaccines and is closely monitored by the FDA.ADDRESSING PARENTS CONCERNS Establish rapport Be open and honest Identify concerns Identify their sources of information Be prepared to respond with evidence- based information Appeal to civic duty and riskCOMMUNITY BENEFIT Untreated children become threat to others Some individuals cannot be vaccinated and rely on 'herd immunity' Even with a fully immunized population, infection is still possible Costs on communityPHARMACISTS' RESPONSIBILITY Promote vaccination - Public Health issue Ensure proper storage and administration Observe correct timing and appropriate intervals of vaccinations Follow contraindications and precautionsRESOURCES CDC vaccine safety - www.cdc.gov/vaccines Flu info -http://www.flu.gov/ Local flu info -www.tricore.org Immunization Action Coalition -www.immunize.org American Academy of Pediatrics -www.cispimmunize.org Children's Hospital of Philidelphia -www.chop.edu Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) -http://vaers.hhs.gov/ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS) FDA and CDC Voluntary reporting (by anyone) Adverse reaction Side effect caused by vaccine Adverse event Temporal event following vaccination An adverse event can be an adverse reaction Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (1986) Routinely recommended childhood vaccinesPRINCIPLES OF IMMUNITYPRINCIPLES OF IMMUNITY * Immune System Distinguishes self from non -self. Ability to recognize and eliminate infectious agents.PRINCIPLES OF IMMUNITY Antigen: A live or inactivated substance that is capable of inducing immune response Antibody: Protein molecules produced by the B lymphocytes that assist in the elimination of antigensPRINCIPLES OF IMMUNITY Passive Immunity Transferred protection from exogenous source Maternal/ transplacental Blood products Temporary (wanes with time)PRINCIPLES OF IMMUNITY Active Immunity Produced protection by person's own immune system Exposure to infectious disease Vaccination Live attenuated vaccine Inactivated vaccine Usually more permanentACTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSE TO PRIMARY EXPOSURE Primary Response Innate immune response (rapid) Adaptive response (delayed) Antibody titers peak around 2-6 weeks post- exposure Titers fall gradually with memory B-cells being producedACTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSE TO SECONDARY EXPOSURE Secondary Response Delayed response Memory cells rapidly make antibodies Host often unaware that exposure ever occurredANTIBODY PRODUCTION FOLLOWING VACCINATION VACCINATION PRINCIPLES Successful vaccination relies on active immunity of individual Immunologic response is similar to natural infection (without risk of disease) Response and persistence of protection is determined by several factors: Live attenuated vs inactivated Host characteristics and immune status AdministrationIMMUNIZING AGENTS Immunoglobulins (acute protection) Vaccines (viral or bacterial) Live attenuated vaccine Inactivated vaccine Whole Fractional Protein (toxoid or subunit) Polysaccharide -based (pure or conjugate)IMMUNIZING AGENTS - COMPONENTS Suspending fluid Typically sterile water or saline Preservatives, stabilizers, and antibiotics Used to prevent contamination or to stabilize the antigen Includes such materials as: Mercurials (thimerosal ) Gelatin Specific antibiotics (neomycin) Adjuvants Typically Added to inactive vaccines to enhance immune responseLIVE ATTENUATED VACCINES Weakened form of infectious agent Does not cause disease Requires replication to produce a sufficient response Most resembles the immune response produced by natural infection Usually effective with one dose (unless oral) May be contraindicated in: Immunosuppressed patients Pregnant womenAVAILABLE LIVE VIRUS vaccine) Rotavirus Influenza (Intranasal Plague* *Not available in USHERPES ZOSTER VACCINE Which vaccine is used in adults and at what age is the vaccine administered?

Live vaccines For example, MMR (or MMRV), Varicella, ZosterADMINISTRATION Simultaneous administration is recommended No contraindications for any vaccines Increases likelihood of receiving all vaccines We are NOT 'overloading' the immune system If two LIVE vaccines are not administered simultaneously, they should be given at least 4 weeks apart (does not apply to inactivated)ADMINISTRATION Dosing intervals Do not administer before the minimum recommended AGE Do not administer before the minimum recommended INTERVAL Minimum interval is determined by the component with the longest required interval Increasing the interval between doses in a series does not diminish response -DO NOT RESTART SERIES SOME VACCINES CANNOT BE ADMINISTERED DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF LIFE BECAUSE: a)the infant's immune system will be overwhelmed if he/she receives too many vaccinations. b)circulating maternal antibodies inactivate the vaccine antigen. c)administration increases the infant's risk for autism. d)the infant may develop the disease from the vaccine.CONTRAINDICATIONS OR PRECAUTIONS Severe allergic reaction to vaccine or component Encephalopathy occurring within 7 days of pertussis - containing vaccine Conditions that increase chance of serious reaction or may compromise ability to produce immune response Immunosuppression Pregnancy Severe illness (Delay) Recent administration of blood product (Delay live vaccines)INVALID CONTRAINDICATIONS Antibiotic therapy Breastfeeding Premature birth Mild disease -low-grade fever, URI, otitis media, mild diarrhea Pregnancy or immunosuppression in household WarfarinADVERSE REACTIONS Local -pain, swelling, redness (common with inactivated) Systemic -fever, malaise, headache Allergic reaction Syncope most common in adolescents -have them wait 20 minA 4-YEAR OLD GIRL PRESENTS AT YOUR PHARMACY INFLUENZA CLINIC WITH A NON-PRODUCTIVE COUGH.
