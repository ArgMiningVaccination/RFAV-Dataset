This disease can lead to meningitis, which is the infection of the lining of the brain and spinal cord.

There is also a precaution for individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to latex when receiving the MenB-4C (Bexsero) vaccine. MenB-4C and MenB-Fhbp are not interchangeable, so the same product must be used for all doses. For MenB-4C: 0-2 months For disease is caused by bacteria that spreads from person to person through close and proximal contact. Pneumococcal disease can cause pneumonia, bacteremia or even meningitis. Children under the age of 2, adults over the age of 65 and others who exhibit unhealthy lifestyle habits are amongst those with the highest risk. PPSV23 protects against 23 types of pneumococcal bacteria; however, it will not prevent all pneumococcal disease.
