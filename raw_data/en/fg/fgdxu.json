Although acupuncture was developed as part of the medical system in Ancient China, research into the scientific basis of its effects is expanding rapidly. Acupuncture is very effective for analgesia on a local, segmental, and suprasegmental level. Many forms of acupuncture can be used independently or as part of a balanced multi-modal approach for the control of acute and chronic pain. In the hands of a skilled practitioner, acupuncture can be a safe and effective modality for treating pain in companion animals. This article outlines the mechanisms of action of acupuncture, its related neurophysiology and provides examples from the literature demonstrating its effectiveness.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-05-26", "cleaned_text": "Pain Management in Companion Animal Medicine [https://doi.org/10.3390/vetsci9060252](https://doi.org/10.3390/vetsci9060252) [Frontiers of Herbal Medicine and The use of veterinary acupuncture for pain relief is expanding among small animal practitioners. It is used as an adjunct to conventional practices, as an alternative when conventional treatments fail to resolve the patient's pain or when a client is seeking a drug-free way to mitigate pain [ [1](#B1-vetsci-09-00252), [3](#B3-vetsci-09-00252), [4](#B4-vetsci-09-00252), [5](#B5-vetsci-09-00252)]. The most recent canine and feline pain management guidelines, developed by the World Small Animal Veterinary Association Global Pain Council include acupuncture as a non-pharmaceutical treatment for small animal pain ( [https://wsava.org/global-guidelines/global-pain-council-guidelines](https://wsava.org/global-guidelines/global-pain-council-guidelines), accessed on 21 November 2021). [6](#B6-vetsci-09-00252)] and the majority concerned humans or laboratory animals [ [7](#B7-vetsci-09-00252), [8](#B8-vetsci-09-00252), [9](#B9-vetsci-09-00252), [10](#B10-vetsci-09-00252), [11](#B11-vetsci-09-00252)]. Nevertheless, these principles can be integrated into clinical veterinary practice. There have been some recent clinical studies in companion animals showing the effectiveness of acupuncture at mitigating pain use metaphorical language to describe patterns of disease, treatment, and pathophysiology; however, the terminology can be translated into physiological and biomedical principles that can be understood by the conventionally trained veterinarian. Acupuncture has evolved into a medically appropriate, scientifically driven treatment for pain in companion animals [ [3](#B3-vetsci-09-00252)]. 2. Acupuncture Points and Meridians [19](#B19-vetsci-09-00252), [20](#B20-vetsci-09-00252)]. Acupoints are neurovascular bundles consisting of a concentrated area of free nerve endings, lymphatics, small arterioles, venioles and mast cells. Areas that are richly innervated and areas with high numbers of somatic afferent fibers frequently contain many acupuncture points [ [19](#B19-vetsci-09-00252)]. Acupuncture points are divided into Four Types (See [Table 1](#vetsci-09-00252-t001)) and have a higher electrical conductance, lower impedance and a higher capacitance than the surrounding tissue. Many of these points are located in palpable depressions and in areas where pain and muscle dysfunctions generate myofascial trigger points [ [21](#B21-vetsci-09-00252)]. [1](#B1-vetsci-09-00252), [2](#B2-vetsci-09-00252)]. Acupuncture needles may be stimulated manually by twisting or moving the needle during the treatment or may be stimulated by the use of electroacupuncture (EA). EA involves attaching an electrode to a pair of acupuncture points and running a small electric current through them. It is thought to provide a stronger and longer-lasting stimulation [ [1](#B1-vetsci-09-00252), [2](#B2-vetsci-09-00252), [21](#B21-vetsci-09-00252)]. [22](#B22-vetsci-09-00252)]. With the variety of acupuncture points, it is important to balance any acupuncture treatment with local and remote points to address different sources of pain. [23](#B23-vetsci-09-00252)]. The blockage of Qi or nerve energy causes pain. The manipulation of one acupuncture point may cause an effect in an area remote to the site but further down the meridian. The Meridians have names such as Bladder and Gall Bladder and the acupuncture points assigned numbers along the meridian. In addition to the twelve regular Meridians, there are eight Extra Meridians, and these have specific functions. The eight Extra Meridians maintain the homeostatic balance in the body by storing, regulating, and receiving excess pathogenic Qi, balancing the metabolism and supporting blood, fluids and Qi [ [1](#B1-vetsci-09-00252), [2](#B2-vetsci-09-00252)]. [23](#B23-vetsci-09-00252)]. See [Figure 1](#vetsci-09-00252-f001)and [Figure 2](#vetsci-09-00252-f002)for examples. [24](#B24-vetsci-09-00252)]. From this perspective, meridians are thought to be consistent with the peripheral nervous system, run along fascial planes, involve the lymphatics and may involve the interstitial space [ [25](#B25-vetsci-09-00252)]. Physiologically, all acupuncture points share the same effects including fibroblast mechanotransduction, fascial interaction, neuromodulation leading to analgesia, fluid motion modulation and the manipulation of the microvascular environment. [ [23](#B23-vetsci-09-00252), [26](#B26-vetsci-09-00252), [27](#B27-vetsci-09-00252), [28](#B28-vetsci-09-00252)]. Some points may specifically cause immune modulation, affect the autonomic nervous system, visceral organs, or the brain, modulate lymphatic flow or cause neuromuscular effects [ [19](#B19-vetsci-09-00252)]. [29](#B29-vetsci-09-00252)]. 2018, Dewey C and Xie S. 3. Analgesic Effects of Acupuncture 3.1. The Pain Pathway [30](#B30-vetsci-09-00252)]. [Table 2](#vetsci-09-00252-t002)for a comparison of the different types of nerve fibers. A-beta fibers are responsible for low-threshold or non-painful information, whereas A-delta fibers are responsible for the withdrawal reflex and sharp acute pain. C fibers, which transmit their information at a slower rate, are responsible for slow, burning pain which can intensify. The stimulation of C fibers has been implicated in the development of chronic pain [ [30](#B30-vetsci-09-00252)]. [30](#B30-vetsci-09-00252)]. [30](#B30-vetsci-09-00252)]. [21](#B21-vetsci-09-00252)]. Local effects are mediated through the sensory nociceptors stimulating the afferent nerves whose cell bodies are in the dorsal root ganglia. Spinal effects are mediated by neurons in the dorsal gray matter of the spinal cord. These are second-order neurons which provide the ascending nociceptive tracts to the brain. In the brain, a descending pain-mitigating system (suprasegmental) can be stimulated to suppress the pain signal sent by the second-order neurons, thus providing analgesia [ [21](#B21-vetsci-09-00252)]. 3.2. Local Effects of Acupuncture [27](#B27-vetsci-09-00252), [28](#B28-vetsci-09-00252)]. Data suggest that the deeper the needle is inserted, the more dramatic the effects [ [31](#B31-vetsci-09-00252)]. Neuronal signalling and needle insertion are intimately connected. When the fascia and tissue matrix is deformed by the needle, the local axon reflex is triggered in the nerve endings. This response is thought to cause the De Qi sensation which humans describe as dull or achy and travels from the site of initial needle insertion to the nerves. The De Qi response is associated with the effectiveness of the treatment and leads to the release of neuropeptides such as calcitonin gene-related peptide, nerve growth factor, substance and many others [ [19](#B19-vetsci-09-00252), [32](#B32-vetsci-09-00252)]. [19](#B19-vetsci-09-00252), [32](#B32-vetsci-09-00252)]. [19](#B19-vetsci-09-00252)]. Studies in both humans and laboratory animals have shown increased levels of endogenous opioids in the plasma and CSF after acupuncture treatments [ [32](#B32-vetsci-09-00252)]. A pilot study in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomies compared dogs that received electroacupuncture for pain control versus those who received butorphanol. Both treatments were effective for pain control and the acupuncture group did not require any rescue pain control, although the butorphanol group did [ [33](#B33-vetsci-09-00252)]. [19](#B19-vetsci-09-00252)]. A cascade of local and systemic effects ultimately provides analgesia to the patient for painful conditions. Painful local clinical conditions such as burns, lick granulomas, chronic wounds and local soft tissue injuries can benefit from the local analgesic effects of acupuncture [ [19](#B19-vetsci-09-00252)]. 3.3. Spinal or Segmental Effects of Acupuncture [19](#B19-vetsci-09-00252), [32](#B32-vetsci-09-00252)]. The gate control theory proposed by Melzack and Wall in 1965 is the main theory relating to the segmental mechanism of pain relief and explains pain modulation in the spinal cord [ [34](#B34-vetsci-09-00252)]. The pain gate is located in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The substansia gelatinosa (SG) cells found in the dorsal horn control the transmission of pain impulses from the periphery to the CNS. Non-noxious stimulus can occur by needling or manual pressure, which stimulates the A-beta fibers and effectively closes the SG pain gates to painful input and prevent the pain signal from travelling further up to the CNS [ [34](#B34-vetsci-09-00252)]. The main structures in the spinal cord that are involved in segmental pain relief are the A-Delta and C-ascending pain fibers and the A-beta fibers which effectively close the pain gate. See [Table 1](#vetsci-09-00252-t001). Gate control theory says that a high volume of input from the A-Beta fibers effectively closes the gate in the SG to the pain impulses carried by the C and A-Delta fibers [ [19](#B19-vetsci-09-00252)]. [19](#B19-vetsci-09-00252), [32](#B32-vetsci-09-00252), [35](#B35-vetsci-09-00252), [36](#B36-vetsci-09-00252), [37](#B37-vetsci-09-00252)]. Increased serotonin levels in the spinal cord enhance the ability of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) to suppress the transmission of the pain signal [ [19](#B19-vetsci-09-00252), [35](#B35-vetsci-09-00252)]. Acupuncture stimulation reduces spinal glial cell activation and suppresses the release of inflammatory cytokines such as Il-1 B, IL-6, TNF a, [ [19](#B19-vetsci-09-00252)]. Substance P, which activates glial cells, is also suppressed by acupuncture while GABA release is facilitated by acupuncture. Increased GABA in the extracellular space is associated with anti-nociceptive activity. Just as in the periphery, acupuncture decreases the expression of COX-2 in the spinal cord, thereby reducing wind up pain [ [19](#B19-vetsci-09-00252), [35](#B35-vetsci-09-00252)]. [38](#B38-vetsci-09-00252)]. The spinal cord segments and vertebral column are closely related with the roots and spinal nerves distributed throughout the vertebral column. Dermatomes exist for each spinal nerve and studies have shown that there is a considerable overlap of up to three dorsal roots in the lumbosacral area as well as an overlap of the cutaneous area of peripheral nerves. When treating these segments with acupuncture, any part of one segment will treat the entire segment [ [32](#B32-vetsci-09-00252)]. Segmental dysfunction is a significant cause of pain in small animals and affects all components of the musculoskeletal system. It is not a true disease but often manifests as weakness, asymmetry, tenderness, decreased range of motion in joints, myofascial pain, and pathologic muscle tone. There is some evidence that segmental dysfunction is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system [ [32](#B32-vetsci-09-00252)]. [39](#B39-vetsci-09-00252)]. If the appropriate somatic receptors at the segmental level are stimulated, then visceral pain can be suppressed. [32](#B32-vetsci-09-00252)]. 3.4. Suprasegmental (Brain) Effects of Acupuncture [19](#B19-vetsci-09-00252), [31](#B31-vetsci-09-00252)]. According to Dewey and others, the brain segments involved include the cerebral cortex, the hypothalamus, the periaqueductal gray (PAG) matter, the pons and parts of the medulla [ [19](#B19-vetsci-09-00252), [32](#B32-vetsci-09-00252)]. [20](#B20-vetsci-09-00252)]. Human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown that when specific acupuncture points are stimulated, specific regions of the brain are activated or deactivated. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood oxygenation and flow that occur in response to neural activity. Several fMRI studies have shown that the limbic system, hypothalamus, and arcuate nucleus are all stimulated by acupuncture [ [40](#B40-vetsci-09-00252), [41](#B41-vetsci-09-00252), [42](#B42-vetsci-09-00252)]. When the hypothalamus is stimulated by acupuncture, it releases Beta endorphins and in turn activates the PAG which has been shown to be the primary CNS structure responsible for descending pain inhibition [ [19](#B19-vetsci-09-00252), [32](#B32-vetsci-09-00252)]. Needling limb points has been shown to activate the intended brainstem center without producing a segmental effect, whereas needling a dermatomal segment such as a back Shu point for thoracolumbar pain produces a mainly segmental response or a segmental and suprasegmental response (descending brainstem response) [ [19](#B19-vetsci-09-00252)]. A combination of different points can recruit local, segmental, and suprasegmental responses from the nervous system for optimum results for pain control. [19](#B19-vetsci-09-00252)]. Analgesic effects produced by EA tend to be more potent and long lasting than those produced by DN alone. Low frequency EA (2-10 Hz) causes the release of endorphins and enkephalins, which are most effective for mitigating pain. Other pain relievers such as dynorphin and serotonin are released at higher frequencies and may impart an additive effect [ [16](#B16-vetsci-09-00252), [19](#B19-vetsci-09-00252), [43](#B43-vetsci-09-00252), [44](#B44-vetsci-09-00252)]. 4. Clinical Applications of Acupuncture for Pain Mitigation [19](#B19-vetsci-09-00252)]. Pain from stifle disease is modulated through the nerves at the L4-L6 spinal segments. When this area, as well as the muscles around the stifle are treated with dry needle acupuncture (DN), the stifle experiences significant pain relief [ [32](#B32-vetsci-09-00252)]. This effect can be enhanced by the addition of electroacupuncture (EA). A retrospective study of senior dogs with cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) ruptures showed that those treated with acupuncture and Chinese Medicine recovered their stifle function within 6 to 10 months of initiating treatment, even though no surgery was performed [ [45](#B45-vetsci-09-00252)]. In another study of 40 dogs with CCL disease, half of the dogs were assigned to receive acupuncture and TCVM therapy whereas the other half received conservative therapy with pain management, joint supplements and exercise therapy. Both groups of dogs showed improvements by week 24 but those treated with acupuncture attained quicker results [ [46](#B46-vetsci-09-00252)]. [47](#B47-vetsci-09-00252), [48](#B48-vetsci-09-00252), (acupoint injection) or the implantation of gold beads or wires was commonly performed [ [37](#B37-vetsci-09-00252)]. In a Brazilian clinical study, nine dogs with confirmed hip dysplasia that had a poor response to medical therapy were injected either with the autologous stromal vascular fraction (SVF, n = 4) or allogeneic cultured adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs, n = 5) into three acupuncture points (BL-54, GB-29 and GB-30) near the affected joint. After 1 week, both groups demonstrated a marked improvement in lameness and pain scores which continued to improve up to day 30. Only one dog in the ASC group did not improve. This study showed that the acupoint injection of stems cells can be an effective therapy for the pain of hip OA [ [47](#B47-vetsci-09-00252)]. [48](#B48-vetsci-09-00252), [49](#B49-vetsci-09-00252), [ [48](#B48-vetsci-09-00252), [49](#B49-vetsci-09-00252), [50](#B50-vetsci-09-00252)] showed positive results, although a German review showed that some of the research may have been flawed [ [51](#B51-vetsci-09-00252)]. Objective outcome measures were used in one study; however, this study did not show any significant difference between the placebo group and the group treated with gold bead implantation [ [37](#B37-vetsci-09-00252)]. [16](#B16-vetsci-09-00252)]. [43](#B43-vetsci-09-00252)]. Hayashi and colleagues conducted a study on 50 dogs with thoracolumbar IVDD of various grades. The dogs were randomised to receive either conventional medical treatment or conventional medical treatment with EA. The overall success rate, as determined by their ability to walk without assistance, was significantly higher with EA and the time to ambulation was also significantly shorter in the EA group [ [44](#B44-vetsci-09-00252)]. Another study of dogs with thoracolumbar disc disease showed that when electroacupuncture was combined with Western treatment, the medium time to ambulation was shorter in those dogs that received acupuncture than in those dogs who did not [ [52](#B52-vetsci-09-00252)]. A similar result was reported by Han and colleagues for a group of 80 paraplegic dogs in which half of the dogs were treated with prednisone and the remainder were treated with prednisone combined with acupuncture and electroacupuncture. The dogs who were treated with a combination of DN, EA and prednisone had significantly less pain, recovered to ambulation at a faster rate and had decreased relapses [ [53](#B53-vetsci-09-00252)].
