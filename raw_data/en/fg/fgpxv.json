For ma ny years decisionDmakers operated based on personal networks and intuition. With the instituti on of patent analytics, and PLRs, it is possible fo r these critical decisions to be made with dataDdrive n, evidenceDbased approaches that deliver informed choices, and mitigate the associated to the decisio n risks. The insight gained from the preparation of a patent landscape report can be applied to almost any organization engaged in the evaluation of technolog y, and its impact on society. Government agencies, as well as private enterprise can gain va luable perspective on a developing, or wellD established field by generating a PLR. As an example, PLRs can be used as instruments to i nform public policy makers in strategic decisions to related to R&D investment, prioritization, techn ology transfer or local manufacturing. Patent information can and is increasingly being used as a tool to inform public policy: Policymakers who deal with innovation have increasingly focused on t he patent system. They look for clearer, more accessible and geographically more representative i nformation to support key policy processes. They seek a stronger empirical basis for their assessmen ts on the role and impact of the patent system in relation to key areas. While PLR are undoubtedly useful instruments for in formed decisionDmaking, producing one can be a timeDintensive and expensive process. An organizati on willing to devote the resources necessary to generate a PLR often does so when they are preparin g to make a significant monetary or headcount investment in developing or moving into a technolog y area. It is critically important to make certain that a PLR is prepared properly in order to ensure that the insight it provides is accurate, and direc ted towards the key issues associated with technologica l implementation. This document provides details on the stages requir ed for the preparation of a PLR. It is provided as a means for instructing new practitioners on the step s required in generating a PLR, but it is also usef ul for recipients of PLRs having such reports produced for them inDhouse or by thirdDparty service providers. It is also hoped that providing a templa te for the preparations of PLRs will help continue the development of standards, and best practices that c an be used, and built upon by the patent analysis community. By understanding the processes involved in preparin g a PLR all of the varied stakeholders, providers, and users of the information they contain will have a better understanding of what can be expected from a PLR, and how many resources will need to be involved in its creation. The present Guidelines were developed in the framew ork of the Development Agenda project \"Developing Tools for Access to Patent Information\" ( DA_19_30_31_02 ), in particular Phase II of the project which was approved by the Committee for Dev elopment and Intellectual Property at its tenth session in November 2012 1. It is also intended to be used as resource for pa tent information users in general, and in particular for capacity building ac tivities on patent analytics at WIPO's Technology a nd Innovation Support Centers (TISC) 2. 1 For the project document see http://www.wipo.int/meetings/en/doc_details.jsp?doc _id=219002 2 http://www.wipo.int/tisc/en/ 3 Chapter 2: Table of Contents for Patent Landscaping Reports Guidelines 1.

Annex Generic Terms of Reference for Patent Landscaping R eports 8 Chapter 3: Introduction Patents provide a right to exclude others from oper ating in the area the invention is being claimed fo r. Thus, they have business and legal implications ass ociated with them. Receiving a patent can be a reasonably expensive endeavor costing from $10,000 on the lowDend to five to ten times that for more complicated applications. Since there are substanti al costs associated with them, when organizations pursue a patent it is generally an indication of hi gh interest and potentially significant investment by them in the subject. Patents are also critical sources of information th at may not be found anywhere else. A paper from 1986 citing a report from 1977 3 claims that 80% of the information found in patent s is not found elsewhere. It is extremely difficult to quantify a value in this way, but it is generally accepted tha t due to the nature of novelty, associated with patents, and the general practice of most organizations to n ot publish their findings in scientific literature, th at patent information is a source of unique content , complementary to nonDpatent literature. While it can be difficult to work with, and mislead ing, if not handled correctly, patent data is criti cal to a thorough understanding of most technological areas. Jacob Schlumberger best encapsulated these feelings in 1966 4 when he wrote: \"We have the choice of using patent statistics caut iously and learning what we can from them, or not using them and learning nothing about what they alo ne can teach us.\" Due to the critical nature of patent documents and the information associated with them, they are used in a variety of different business contexts. T here are different reports affiliated with providin g information on patent data in these different envir onments. These guidelines are focused on the use of patent information, i.e. the information include d in patent documents and related to a patient's lifecycle, to generate Patent Landscape Reports (PL Rs). There is no single or universally accepted definiti on of a Patent Landscape Report; in general, one can say that it constitutes an overview of patentin g activity in a field of technology, in a specific geographical area. A landscape normally seeks to an swer specific policy or practical questions and to present complex information about this activity in a clear and accessible manner for audiences with different background. Industry has long used patent landscapes to make strategic decisions on investments, research and development (R&D) directi ons, and competitors' activity as well as on freedom to operate in introducing new products. Now , public policymakers are increasingly turning to landscaping to build a factual foundation before co nsidering highDlevel policy matters, especially in fields such as health, agriculture and the environm ent. These guidelines provide details on the stages invo lved in the preparation of a PLR. This is provided as a means for instructing new practitioners on the steps required in generating a PLR, but it is also useful for individuals who will have PLRs produced for them by thirdDparty consultants. It is hoped th at providing a template for the preparations of PLRs w ill help continue the development of standards, and best practices that can be used, and built upon by the patent analysis community. The present document begins with a primer on patent information, what portions of it are generally used for the production of PLRs, and how PLRs are d istinguished from other reports that use patent information. Patent information professionals are w ell acquainted with the majority of this informatio n, 3 http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio. jsp?osti_id=7162811 4 Invention and Economic Growth, Jacob Schmookler. Cambridge, Mass., Harvard University Press, 1966. 9 but for those who are new to the profession, or who will be receiving PLRs generated by others this section provides a starting point for understanding the nuances of patent information and analysis. The next section, covered in chapters 5D7 discusses the philosophy behind the preparation of patent landscape reports including a discussion of the mot ivations and objectives for creating them, the task s generally associated with performing patent analyti cs, and frameworks, or concepts that practitioners should consider as they are beginning a PLR project . If the first section was a backgrounder for paten t information, then these chapters can be considered as background information on performing patent analytics, as it will be applied to the creation of a PLR. Chapter 8 provides stepDbyDstep instructions for th e preparation of PLRs. It begins with a section on the planning required before a project is initiated . A section follows this on the dynamics associated with conducting a search in association with a PLR. With an understanding of what the objectives will be for the report, and with search results in hand a discussion of the preDprocessing steps associated with patent data is provided. A list of the various analytics normally included in PLRs is covered, as well as suggestions for writing, publishing and eva luating the report once the analysis work is complete and conclusions need to be shared. The final section covers chapters 9D12, and include s lists of resources, providers and literature references associated with the subject of patent la ndscape reports. There is also a chapter on additional topics related to the strategic use of p atent information other than PLRs. This Section was included to provide an introduction to additional a pplications of patent information that may be of interest to organizations that are also interested in PLRs for strategic technical planning. After reading these guidelines interested practitio ners will have the information they need to begin preparing their own PLRs in support of key decision Dmakers. During the development of this document two workshops on its contents were conduct ed with patent office practitioners from Latin America and South East Asia. The level of interest in developing patent analytics and PLRs for developing countries was extremely high, as reflect ed on the results of related surveys, and almost universally the workshop participants felt that the information in the guidelines was essential to hel p them begin preparing their own reports. 10 Chapter 4: Basics of Patent Information The primary information source for Patent Landscape Reports (PLRs) is data coming from patent documents. Additional information is sometimes used from other sources, such as the nonDpatent, scientific literature, but patent data is used most frequently for the analysis that makes up the majo rity of the insights identified for the report. A general understanding of patent information is cr itical to producing wellDresearched PLRs, since raw patent data is notoriously difficult to work with, for a variety of reasons. In particular, the variet y of publication policies applied by different jurisdict ions which partially derive from differences in pat ent prosecution. Understanding the nuances associated w ith patent information will help prevent an analyst from misinterpreting the data and come to i ncorrect conclusions. This chapter provides background on patents as a ty pe of intellectual property, as well as looking closely at the various types and parts of patent do cuments, especially those that are typically utiliz ed in the generation of PLRs, supplementary informatio n associated with each patent application and the sources of patent information (databases) that can be used to prepare a data collection to be analyzed 5. 4.1 - Why Analyze Patent Information? Patents are intellectual property rights for the pr otection of an invention in the territories of indi vidual jurisdictions which may be granted in exchange for disclosure of the invention 6. Since a granted patent represents a right to exclude others from ma king, using or selling the invention in the specifi ed jurisdiction, it has a business value associated wi th it. Patents are sometimes referred to as a \"limi ted monopoly\" based on their ability to prevent competi tors from entering a market or making use of a patented technology. Due to the potential business and legal implications, understanding which organizations own patents, and what technological a reas they cover, can have a significant impact on policymaking and corporate decisionDmaking. Obtaining a patent can be a reasonably expensive en deavor, costing from $10,000 on the lowDend to five to ten times that for more complicated applica tions. Due to the substantial associated costs, whe n organizations pursue a patent D in particular, if i n a plurality of jurisdictions D it is generally an indication of high interest and potentially significant invest ment by them in the subject. 5 General information on patent information is includ ed in the WIPO Handbook on Industrial Property Information and Documentation: http://www.wipo.int/standards/en/index.html (henceforth called the 'WIPO Handbook'). 6 The legislation of each jurisdiction usually defin es the Intellectual Property rights available for t he protection of inventions. They may include different instruments such as patents and utility models, and they may us e varying designations for such instruments, such as \"patent\" , \"petit patent\", \"inventors' certificate\", etc. Se veral international treaties deal with such Intellectual Property rights for the protection of inventions. T hey use the term patent as comprising all these rights irrespec tive of their designations in the legislation of a member states. Similarly, the term patent is used in these Guideli nes as comprising all such instruments. For general information on the patent system, see http://www.wipo.int/patents/en/ ; or the WIPO Intellectual Property Handbook (not to be confused with the Handbook ment ioned in the previous footnote): http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/freepublicatio ns/en/intproperty/489/wipo_pub_489.pdf 11 Patents are also critical sources of information th at may not be found anywhere else. A paper from 1986 citing a report from 1977 7 claims that 80% of the information found in patent s is not found elsewhere. It is extremely difficult to quantify a value like this, but it is generally agreed that du e to the nature of novelty, associated with patents, and the general practice of most commercial organizations to not publish their findings in journal literature , that patent information is a source of unique con tent. While it can be difficult to work with, and mislead ing, if not handled correctly, patent data is criti cal to a thorough understanding of most technological areas. Jacob Schlumberger best encapsulated these feelings in 1966 8 when he wrote: \"We have the choice of using patent statistics caut iously and learning what we can from them, or not using them and learning nothing about what they alo ne can teach us.\" This statement crystalizes the essence of why paten t information is analyzed. Section 4.6 below elaborates on different types of such analyses and their respective objectives. 4.2 - Types of Patent Documents and Publication Pol icies The specific rules for applying for a patent and fo r processing patent applications, including their publishing, can be different and should be consider ed on a jurisdiction to jurisdiction basis. Patenta ble subject matter is also different between various ju risdictions. Most jurisdictions have a system in pl ace with substantive examination, i.e. where the claime d technical subject matter is examined whether it meets certain conditions for patentability, such as novelty, inventive step and industrial applicabili ty. In such systems it is customary to distinguish a preD and a postDgrant prosecution phase. The below distinction between different publication stages re lated to a single application, i.e. preDgrant, gran t and postDgrant publications, applies mostly to such sys tems. Few jurisdictions have a mere patent registration s ystem in place, i.e. without regular substantive examination. Such systems are similar to utility mo del systems. For such systems the below distinction between preDgrant and postDgrant public ations does not apply. Depending on the jurisdiction, and in particular it s publication policy, there are various types of pa tent documents published at various stages during the li fecycle of a patent application. All these publications associated with an individual applicat ion constitute a soDcalled domestic patent family (see section 4.4.5 below). With most patenting authorities, patent application s are published for the first time 18 months after their priority or filing date, even if they have no t yet been granted. If they are granted another publication follows the first publication which inc ludes the claims granted by the patenting authority . Some jurisdictions publish only granted patents. In such cases, pending applications may not be known to the public until the publication of the gr ant, and in fact may never become known if the application fails during examination or is withdraw n. Some jurisdictions do not publish all parts of an a pplication or a granted patent, but rather a notification in a gazette or bulletin. In such case s, the disclosure and claims become publicly 7 http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio. jsp?osti_id=7162811 8 Invention and Economic Growth, Jacob Schmookler. C ambridge, Mass., Harvard University Press, 1966 12 accessible after the publication of the notificatio n, e.g. through file inspection (see below) or thro ugh ordering a (certified) copy. It is important to understand the difference betwee n the official publication of patent documents or o f gazettes, and the making publicly available of at l east parts of applications or other documents. Any published patent document is identified by a un ique publication number and its content is usually fixed with the publication on the particular public ation date. Subsequent publications related to the same application, i.e. being members of the same do mestic family, are usually distinguished by kind codes (see below) as parts of the publication numbe r. For some jurisdictions, these subsequent publications related to the same application are on ly distinguished by using different kind codes (e.g . publications of the European Patent Office). In oth er jurisdictions, however, these publications belonging to the same domestic family have distinct publication numbers, while the publication stage is still identified by the respective kind code (e. g. publications of the Unites States Patent Office or the Japan Patent Office). Understanding the difference in national publicatio n policies may be important for certain analyses and the conclusions drawn, e.g. if data related to pending, withdrawn or lapsed applications cannot be researched, and if only publications of grants refl ect the innovation activity. 4.2.1 - Pre-grant Publications The process of generating a patent right starts wit h the first filing of an application with a nationa l or regional patent office or with WIPO (namely, the In ternational Bureau of the PCT). This office is sometimes referred to in patent analytics as the Of fice of First Filing (OFF). Often the same invention (or an improvement thereof ) is filed subsequently with other patent offices t o obtain protection in further jurisdictions, usually by claiming the priority of the first filing. Thes e offices are called Offices of Second Filing (OSF). Such sec ond filings lead to the creation of patent families and associated relations between patent family memb ers, which are further explained below in section 4.4.5. Some patent authorities keep patent applications se cret until they are granted, but most authorities publish patent applications 18 months after their f iling date, or the priority date, if the office is an OSF 9. These documents are called preDgrant applications a nd they don't represent a granted right in their present form, but may be granted in the future. The y provide clues on investment and interest in a technological area, and how the environment around a technology may change, if the application goes on to grant. Depending on the national publication policy, preDg rant publications may also comprise separate publications of search reports or corrections 10 . Different such preDgrant publications related to the same application can usually be distinguished by th eir publication kind codes as part of the publicati on number. For the preparation of statistical analyses such publication policies may have to be taken int o account. 9 In some jurisdictions the applicant can request ea rlier publication; this option is often chosen for defensive publications. 10 For instance, that is the case of the European Pate nt Office (EPO). More information available at http://www.epo.org/applying/european/Guide-for-appl icants/html/e/ga_d_iii.html 13 Publications of OSFs are often fully equivalent to the publication of the OFF and represent mere translations. It should be noted however that this is only a rule of thumb, because the Paris Convention expressly permits additions to the discl osure of the first filing when claiming the priorit y rights of earlier filings. 11 In particular, if two or more priorities are claim ed in a second filing, it is very likely that the claimed subject matter is somehow d ifferent from the individual priority applications. It is important to recognize that preDgrant applica tions, while potentially important indicators, are not granted, and in fact, may never be granted. Applica tions can be abandoned or withdrawn during prosecution for a variety of different reasons; but the primary reason is that an examiner has stated objections in an office action. Once an application has been abandoned any subject matter disclosed within it is now part of the public domain of the j urisdiction where it was abandoned and can be used by others, assuming that other granted patents don' t exist on the same subject. Abandoned applications still represent interest on the part o f the applicant and can still provide valuable insi ghts even if they don't represent a property right. On t he other hand, large numbers of applications that d o not make it to grant may also be an indicator that there are incentives in place for filing applicatio ns. Understanding the difference between granted patent s and preDgrant applications is critical for interpreting their impact on a field. In the develo pment of analytics associated with PLRs it is good practice to separate preDgrant applications from gr anted patents when conducting an analysis, e.g. by using kind codes (see section 4.2.4 below). The imp lications of preDgrant applications are significant ly different than what can be implied from a granted p atent and they should be considered separately, or at the very least, identified as a different type o f document when visualizing a result. Some preDgrant publications can be considered as de fensive publications since they were not filed with the intention to obtain patent protection but rather to prevent others, e.g. competitors, from obtaining patents on the technical subject matter d isclosed in the application 12 . With other words, the intention of these filings is to place their techni cal disclosure in the public domain for free use by anybody. It is however not readily possible to dist inguish such preDgrant publications from others where the applicant seeks protection. 4.2.1.1 - PCT Applications While preDgrant publications of applications are us ually associated with specific jurisdictions and therefore may represent an indicator where innovati on takes place (in case of OFFs) or where patent protection is sought (in case of OSFs), there is al so a special type of patent application that facili tates the filing of applications in many jurisdictions si multaneously. 11 Article 4 (F) provides that \"No country of the Uni on may refuse a priority or a patent application on the ground that the applicant claims multiple priorities, even if they originate in different countries, or on th e ground that an application claiming one or more priorities contain s one or more elements that were not included in th e application or applications whose priority is claim ed, provided that, in both cases, there is unity of invention within the meaning of the law of the country.With r espect to the elements not included in the applicat ion or applications whose priority is claimed, the filing of the subsequent application shall give rise to a right of priority under ordinary conditions.\" 12 Before the America Invents Act (AIA), which was si gned into law on September 16, 2011, the US system knew the soDcalled Defensive Publication (DEF) , and the Statutory Invention Registration (SIR) which replaced the Defensive Publication in 1985D86. The AIA repealed these provisions because all pending applications are now published 18 after filing or p riority date. 14 The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), which has effe ct in 148 jurisdictions (as of July 2015), provides for a system that D permits the applicant to lodge a single applicati on with a Receiving Office of the PCT system; and D to obtain a search report and written opinion fro m an International Searching Authority of the PCT system, and eventually a Supplementary Internat ional Search and/or an International Preliminary Examination which assesses the patentab ility, and thereby D enables the applicant to take an informed decisio n if and for which countries he will seek protection; D grants the applicant a period of 30 months (in mo st member jurisdictions) to seek patent protection in each of those jurisdictions (national phase entry); which D allows for more time to assess the commercial via bility of the invention; and delays the considerable expenses associated with pursuing the patent prosecution in those jurisdictions (such as translation, legal representative, nationa l fees). The Patent Cooperation Treaty and the related servi ces are administered by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) which publishes respec tive PCT applications (also referred to as WO documents). WIPO is responsible for administering t he PCT system and for ensuring that PCT applicants receive an initial prior art search repo rt and a written opinion 13 regarding the potential patentability of the subject matter claimed in the application against priorDart from around the world . Based on the benefits attributed to the PCT system, WIPO is often used as an OSF on many applications where the idea of protection on a more global scale is being considered. To a lesser extent it is used as an OFF. Due to their popularit y PCT applications are an important source of paten t information for PLRs. If a PCT application enters a national phase, there may be subsequent preDgrant publications of these national phase entries (NPE), depending on the resp ective publication policy of each jurisdiction, however only with a certain delay because the NPE u sually becomes effective only 30 months after the filing or priority date of the PCT application. 4.2.2 - Granted Patents Publications of granted patents are of particular i mportance in comparison to publications of unexamined applications because the grant asserts t hat the invention disclosed in the application is indeed new and inventive over the known prior art. A grant can therefore be taken as a quality indicator for innovation activities. The time of gr ant of patents, i.e. the publication date of the gr ant, depends however very much on the pendency of patent examination and can differ considerably from jurisdiction to jurisdiction or also for certain ar eas of technology. Publications of granted patents may usually be identified by a specific kind code as pa rt of the publication number (see below). 4.2.3 - Post-Grant Documents 13 As from July 1, 2014, the written opinion is made publicly available on PATENTSCOPE in its original language as of the date of publication of the inter national application 15 There are a number of additional patent documents t hat may be published after the publication of the grant of a patent. The most important ones are publ ications following reexamination or opposition procedures that were initiated by third parties aft er the publication of the grant. If, as a result of these procedures, the scope of protection was restricted, a new publication would be made including the modified claims. That is the case, for instance, fo r the EPO, where if the patent is maintained in an amended form, a new patent specification is being p ublished. Similarly, patent documents would be reissued if th e patent owner on his own initiative wishes to restrict the scope of protection of the patent in o rder to escape an imminent reexamination or opposition procedure. A third, although less import ant, reason for postDgrant publications may be the correction of clerical or typographical errors. These postDgrant documents, while they may impact t he scope or the term of a granted patent, are normally not considered when collecting a data set for PLR related analysis. If these documents are included in a corpus it is generally a good idea to filter them out before conducting the analysis. A notable exception to this is when an analysis of cl aim language is being conducted. In this case, reissue and reexamination documents can modify the original, granted claims and under these conditions they should replace the original patent. 4.2.4 - Kind Codes It was already repeatedly mentioned that different publication stages of an application are usually distinguished by kind codes (e.g., A1, A2, A3, B1,. .) which are part of the document publication numbers. The WIPO Handbook provides the following definition for kind codes of patent document: Several countries and organizations publish patent documents for various types of protection possible within their jurisdiction. Furthermore, according t o certain laws or regulations, patent documents may be published at various stages of the procedure lea ding from the application for a given industrial property right to its final grant (or refusal). Thu s, for certain countries and organizations, various \"kinds of patent documents\" exist, which may be characteri zed by the specific type of protection to which they refer and by the stage of the administrative p rocedure at which they were published. For more details and a complete list of the kinds o f patent documents issued by each patent authority see Part 7.3.1 of the WIPO Handbook, and for an inv entory of kind codes per issuing patent authority see Part 7.3.2 of the WIPO Handbook. 14 The WIPO Standard ST.16 provides for a basic standa rdization of kind codes. It should be noted, however, that patent authorities do not use kind co des in a fully standardized manner because of differences in their publication policies. For exam ple, for the EPO and WIPO, the kind code 'A1' designates publications of patent applications with a search report; while for the USPTO, it designate s publications of patent applications without a searc h report since the USPTO does not publish search reports. For such publications of patent applicatio ns without a search report, the EPO and WIPO would use the kind code 'A2'. It should further be noted that the kind codes used by each issuing patent authority may have changed over time; for example the USPTO used kind code 'A' for the publication of granted patents 14 http://www.wipo.int/standards/en/part_07.html#7.3 16 through December 2000, and kind codes 'B1' and 'B2' as from January 2001. These changes of the use of kind codes are also described for each paten t authority in Section 7.3.2 of the aforementioned WIPO Handbook. 4.3 - Components of Patent Documents While patents documents contain a good deal of raw text, they are referred to as semiDstructured, since they have a number of sections that are found in almost every document, regardless of its country of origin. At a high level these sections o f a patent document are represented by a Front Page with bibliographic data, a Description (Disclosure) and a Claims section. Within each of these highD level sections there are subsections that provide s pecific information about the particular document. These subsections are typically segmented into indi vidual fields when the documents are processed for electronic delivery or the generation of databa ses. An additional Drawings section is facultative, but often included to illustrate the description and facilitate the interpretation of the claims. In som e jurisdictions, the publication of an application further includes a search report as a further section of a patent document when the search report is available at the time the publication is prepared. Else, the search report may be published as a separate document at a later time once it has been establish ed. 4.3.1 - Front Page and Bibliographic Data (Metadata ) The WIPO Handbook provides data: The term \"bibliographic data\" denotes the various d ata normally appearing on the first page of a patent or industrial design document or in a compre hensive entry in an official gazette concerning granted patents, industrial design or trademark reg istrations or the corresponding applications. Such data comprise document identification data, data on the domestic filing of the application, priority d ata, publication data, classification data and other con cise data relating to the technical content of the document or of the entry in the official gazette. The majority of the statistical analysis conducted on patent collections takes place using data collected from the bibliographic fields within them . Many of these fields contain categorized text or numbers and thus are readily applicable to statisti cal analysis (see also section 7.1 below). To assist with working with this data across differ ent jurisdictions and languages, an international standard for bibliographic data within patent docum ents, called INIDs has been developed by WIPO. The WIPO Handbook provides the following definition of INIDs: INID is the acronym for Internationally agreed Numb ers for the Identification of Data. The INID codes are numerical codes allotted to bibliographic data relating to industrial property documents and print ed on their first page and in corresponding entries of Official Gazettes. INID codes are standardized by the World Intellectu al Property Organization (WIPO) in ST.9 15 which includes a complete list of the INID codes. A few o f the bibliographic fields, used most frequently in the statistical analysis of patent collections, for PLRs are provided below. 15 http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/standards/en/p df/03-09-01.pdf 17 4.3.1.1 - Applicant/Assignee The WIPO Handbook provides the following definition of applicants: The applicant is the entity or person which or who presents (\"files\") an application for the grant of an industrial property right (e.g., a patent applicati on, or an application for the registration of a tra demark) in an industrial property office, or in whose name an agent (representative) files such an application . In general, the applicant is the inventor, but it m ay also be the employee or the person to who the inventor assigned his/her right to the invention (a ssignee). Ordinarily, this will be a company or organization, but can be the inventors when the rig hts associated with the invention are not transferred, or assigned, to a different entity. In the United States, an assignment is required bec ause, the Constitution of the United States provides in Article 1, Section 8, that: the \"Congre ss shall have power . . . to promote the progress o f science and useful arts by securing, for limited ti mes, to authors and inventors, the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.\" In othe r words, the inventor, and not the organization tha t employs them receives a patent right. However, corp orations can now apply for patents directly, without a formal reDassignment from the inventor un der the American Invents Act 16 . Even with the new statutes most patenting in the United States is sti ll done the traditional way; the rights are granted to an inventor, and are then assigned to the legal own er based on the stipulations of the employment agreement the inventor signed when joining the orga nization. In the context of PLRs, the Applicant/Assignee repr esents the owner of a patent and with whom negotiations for the rights associated with the inv ention will have to be conducted. Studying them identifies investors within a technical area. Netwo rk analysis is frequently applied to identify collaborations, e.g. in certain technical fields. Applicant and assignee names can change over the li fe cycle of a patent application whenever the rights in the invention are transferred. Marginal c hanges can also occur in case of clerical correctio ns of misspellings of names. A problem that frequently occurs with any names are variations of names that derive from transcriptions of names from other scriptures like Chinese if varying transcription rules are applied. One and the same person can thus be represented by slightly different spellings of his or her name. Another frequently appearing problem in search and analysis is that subsidiaries of corporations often use varying names in different countries. Analyses that wish to cover complete paten portfolios need to take this into account and utilize various tools to tackle this, such as the soDcalled corporate tr ees. These gather various variations of an entity and th eir affiliations and group them together, in a more or less automated way. 4.3.1.2 - Inventor The WIPO Handbook provides the following definition of an inventor: 16 http://www.ladas.com/Patents/PatentPractice/AIA_Fil ing_Requirements.html 18 A person who is the author of an invention. Accordi ng to Article 4ter of the Paris Convention, the inventor has the right to be mentioned as such in t he patent . The set of inventor names in the bibliographic data of an application should therefore be comprehensive, and unlike the names of applicants o r assignees, the names of inventors usually don't change over the life cycle of a patent applic ation (except for clerical corrections of misspelle d names). In an application claiming the priority of an earlier application, inventor names may however be added if additional inventive subject matter is included in the later application which involved further inventors. In the context of PLRs, the inventor represents the person or persons who are responsible for the intellectual effort associated with the invention. Studying information related to the inventors provi des an idea about potential experts and leaders in an a rea of technology. Network analysis is frequently applied to identify collaborations between differen t inventors or groups of inventors, and institution s for which they work. 4.3.1.3 - Dates Dates correspond to the timing of significant event s in the lifecycle of a patent application. The thr ee most significant patent related dates are the prior ity, the filing and the publication dates. The filing or application date is determined by the patent authority that receives the application if certain minimum requirements are fulfilled, which a ctually differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. T he filing date may therefore differ from the date the applicant lodges the application with the patenting authority. The priority date (or dates if the priorities of se veral earlier applications are claimed) corresponds to the filing date of an earlier application if the ap plicant claims the priority of that earlier applica tion. It is important because it may determine the relevant pri or art if certain conditions are met. Another important date is the publication date, whi ch is the date when a patent document is published. Patent applications are published 18 mon ths after the filing date or the earliest priority date in most patent issuing authorities. In the case of granted patents the publication date is also referred to as the grant date. It is impor tant because, in most jurisdictions, the protection prov ided by a patent enters into force with the publication of the grant. In the context of PLRs, the dates represent the tim ing associated with the development or patenting of an invention and are used for analyzing trends. Stu dying filing or priority dates provides an indicati on of when inventions were developed and how long it t ook for improvements, and modifications to start occurring. Publication dates are less useful for th is pupose. In particular, the grant date is rather an indicator for the pendency of applications until gr ant. 4.3.1.4 - Priority Data The WIPO Handbook provides the following definition of priority data: 19 The part of the bibliographic data (normally publis hed on the first page of a patent document) identifying the earlier patent application(s) on th e basis of which a so-called priority right has bee n claimed (usually based on Article 4 of the Paris Co nvention). These identification data comprise three elements: the application number, the filing date a nd the identification of the country or organizatio n where the respective earlier application was filed. Priority data belong to the basic bibliographic da ta of a patent document and may serve, inter alia, for identifying patent documents published in differen t countries and languages but referring to the same i nvention (\"Patent Family\"). 4.3.1.5 - Classifications The WIPO Handbook provides the following definition for patent classifications: In patent information and documentation matters \"cl assification\" means a specific system which subdivides technology into distinct units. A classi fication symbol is defined for each of those units. The classification symbol designating the unit into whi ch the invention falls is usually printed on the fi rst page of the corresponding patent document and recor ded in databases as part of the bibliographic data. To \"classify\" a patent document means to determine that subdivision of a classification system to which, because of its technical nature, the inventi on claimed in the said document belongs and to allo t a classification symbol to it. Sometimes, the class ification relates not only to the claimed invention but also to other disclosures contained in the patent d ocument. In the past, different national classification syst ems were developed and applied to the patent publications of each respective country. In a first attempt to harmonize these systems, the International Patent Classification (IPC) 17 was created in 1968 which is nowadays applied to p atent publications of almost all jurisdictions worldwide. Each patenting authority is obliged to classify th e applications filed in its jurisdiction. The term bi bliographic IPC was coined to address these classifications provided by the publishing authorit y and presented as part of the bibliographic data o n the front page of the official patent publications. The classification by the publishing authority doe s however not prevent other patenting authorities fro m reclassifying these publications when they add them to their search file. The IPC is regularly revised to include new technol ogies, or to divide existing classification places into several subunits with a more narrowly defined scope . Classification symbols are therefore usually accompanied by version indicators. With each revisi on, all patent publications belonging to the PCT Minimum Documentation are reclassified according to the new classification, and the updated classifications of documents are made available to database hosts. It is their responsibility to updat e the database accordingly. In October 2010, the EPO and USPTO launched a joint project to create the Cooperative Patent Classification 18 (CPC) in order to harmonize their proprietary pate nt classifications systems, the United States Patent Classification (USPC) and the European Classification (ECLA). Like the former ECLA, the CPC is based on the IPC and provides a mo re detailed classification scheme in order to meet classification requirements of the EPO and USP TO. With the entry into force of the CPC all 17 For more information on the IPC as well as revisio n and reclassification procedures see http://www.wipo.int/classifications/ipc/en/ ; the 2015 version of the Guide to the IPC is avail able at http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/classification s/ipc/en/guide/guide_ipc.pdf . 18 http://www.cooperativepatentclassification.org/inde x.html 20 patent publications of the EPO and the USPTO previo usly classified according to the former ECLA and USPC were reclassified according to the CPC. He nce, there is no need to search these older publications by using the former classifications, a lthough many databases still permit such searches. The CPC is also applied to patent publications of o ther jurisdictions either because these jurisdictio ns have opted for the CPC in addition to the IPC, or b ecause of reclassification efforts of the EPO and the USPTO which complement the bibliographic IPC as signed by the publishing patent authority with additional relevant CPC classification codes in ord er to enhance the search efficiency of their examiners. In such cases, it should be noted that o nly a certain fraction of the publications of these jurisdictions is classified according to the CPC wh ile all publications are classified according to th e IPC. Since the EPO shares this CPC reclassification data with other patent database hosts, it can be used for searches in other database provided it was included by the host. In addition to the IPC and the CPC, further classif ications still exist and may be useful: the classification system of the Japan Patent Office (J PO), comprising the File Index 19 (FI), which is based on the IPC, and the FDTerms, which represent a multiDdimensional keyword system complementing the FI; and the Derwent classificatio n system which was developed by a commercial database provider. In the context of PLRs, the classification codes re present predefined concepts for describing the technical features or attributes associated with an invention. Often these concepts have a very narrow scope to facilitate focused prior art searches. For a broader analysis, e.g. of trends in wider areas of technology, documents classified by a range of clas sifications may need to be aggregated. For statistical analyses it should be borne in mind tha t only the IPC is applied to all patent publication s of almost all jurisdictions, while the CPC is applied to some of them. It should also be noted that patent documents often have multiple classification codes assigned. In some jurisdictions one of them is considered as mai n classification that most closely describes the claimed subject matter and also determines the unit in charge of examination. Nevertheless, these main classifications are not necessarily recorded a s such in databases. They are often only highlighted as main classification on front pages o f patent publications. In databases, multiple classifications are often ordered alphabetically. T he first code should therefore not necessarily be interpreted as main classification. This may also b ias certain classificationDbased analyses if only t he first code is selected for the analysis. 4.2.1.6 - Citations During the prosecution of a patent application, an examiner will look for priorDart related to the nov elty, obviousness, or an inventive step, associated with an invention. When references of this nature are discovered they are cited within the document durin g different publication stages. Usually within a search report that accompanies the document. In the United States, there is also a duty of \"cand or and good faith\" that requires applicants to shar e priorDart with the USPTO during the examination of an application. 20 These documents are also 19 http://www.jpo.go.jp/torikumi_e/searchportal_e/pdf/ classification/fi_fDterm.pdf 20 37 C.F.R. 1.56 \"Duty to disclose information ma terial to patentability, of the Manual of patent ex amining procedure\" see http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2001.htm l for the text of the provision, http://www.patinformatics.com/blog/allDcitationsDar eDnotDtheDsameDexploringDexaminerDcitationsDfromDus DpatentD documentsDpartD1DanDintroduction/ 21 citations, and they appear on the frontDpage of gra nted US patents along with the priorDart identified by the examiner. Since they are associated with priorDart, or refere nces that are potentially covering a similar topic as the proposed application, a citation implies a shar ed technological relationship between two documents. Within this context, there is the concept of forwar d or backward citations. Any discussion of patent citations begins with a root document. This is the application being applied for in the discussion above. The references that the root document cites or references itself are referred to as backward citations, since they are references, which precede d or were published before the root document. Conversely, going forward in time from the root doc ument, any more recent document which references the root document are referred to as a f orward citation for the root document. In the context of PLRs, the Citations represent a p otential relationship between two inventions. Studying them provides a means for identifying semi nal documents that could have had a high impact on the development of a technology. 4.2.2 - Description (Disclosure) The WIPO Handbook provides the following definition : The description of the invention is one of the esse ntial parts of certain kinds of patent documents, e.g., patent applications or patents . It usually specifies the technical field to which t he invention relates, includes a brief summary of the technical background of the invention and describes the essential features of the invention with reference to any accompanying drawings. The patent system is built on the principle that pr otection of an invention is granted in exchange for disclosure of the invention in order to spur furthe r innovation. The disclosure of the invention has t o be clear and sufficient enough to enable experts in th e field to carry out the invention. In this respect , it is the complement to the claims section of a patent ap plication (see below) that defines the scope of protection. The description section of a patent doc ument is therefore sometimes simply referred to as the disclosure. Specification is a further synonym for this part of a patent document. From a patent landscaping perspective, the descript ion section is one of the most difficult portions t o interpret, since it contains information on the inv ention itself, as well as information on other inve ntions that are similar but were developed previously. Fro m a textDmining and searching perspective this dichotomy within the disclosure can be misleading s ince it is difficult to determine whether the terms being searched for, or analyzed against, are referr ing to the invention, or the background information . Generally, it is not a good idea to conduct textDmi ning or analytics on the fullDtext of a patent docu ment because of the ambiguity present in the disclosure. If possible, the disclosure is normally excluded i n analysis of this type. 4.2.3 - Claims The WIPO Handbook provides the following definition for claims: The part of a patent document which defines the matter for which protection is so ught or granted. 22 Each patent application has to include at least one claim. The first claim, the soDcalled main claim, is supposed to include all technical features of the i nvention that are essential to solve the technical problem that led to the invention and which is supp osed to be solved by the invention. The main claim is supposed to include only these es sential features. Additional features or details th at are not essential but provide certain benefits or a dditional advantages can be included in soDcalled dependent claims that refer to the main claim or an y other claim. In most jurisdictions the application or the grante d patent may also include further soDcalled independent claims in addition to the main claim, i .e. claims that do not refer to other claims. That is possible if the invention, for example, not only co vers a device or product but also a method or process that are based on the same inventive concep t. Further independent claims may also be admissible if there are alternative ways of impleme nting or carrying out the inventive concept and if they cannot be described by a single independent cl aim. Such further independent claims are however only admissible as long as the principle of unity of invention is observed. Claims determine the scope of each prior art search of the examiner since an examiner has to determine to what extent the claimed technical subj ect matter, i.e. the technical features of the invention as defined by the claims belong to the pr ior art. Technical features not included in claims but only in the description are usually not searched by the examiner. Claims may however evolve over the examination process, for example if an applicant ad ds or replaces features disclosed in the description part of the application to overcome obj ections by the examiner. The claims granted at the end of the examination procedure are usually much n arrower than the originally filed claims that are included in the preDgrant publications. There are specific rules that attorneys need to fol low, when writing claims and, as such, they are not written in conversational English, and can be confu sing to nonDpractitioners who are not familiar with how to interpret them. The uniqueness of claim lang uage can also pose a challenge when performing textDmining or analytics, since most systems are de veloped, or trained using standard, or journalistic English and not the specialized, legal language of patent claims. Regardless of the difficulties, understanding the s cope of the claims associated with a patent document is an essential requirement for understand ing what the patent covers and how valuable it could potentially be. If it can be said that, \"the devil is in the details\", then the details can be f ound in the claims. With respect to PLRs, claim analysis is normally co nducted as a follow on step, since it is sometimes done on a case by case basis, and only on documents that are identified as being in force, or of high interest based on the interpretation of the other a nalytics associated with the PLR. 4.4 - Publicly Accessible Supplementary Information Associated with Patent Applications Besides looking at the structure of individual pate nt documents, it is also important to understand th at patents exist within an infrastructure of additiona l information associated with the development of th e document, what occurs with it as it matures, and ho w it relates to other documents that are associated with it. Some of this information can be incorporat ed into PLRs, while other details are only explored if additional details on a particular asset are of int erest. 23 A great deal of this supplementary data is found in the National Registers associated with the prosecution of a patent document in a particular ju risdiction. As an example, the European Patent Office (EPO) describes the European Patent Register as follows 21 : The European Patent Register contains all the publi cly available information on European patent applications as they pass through the grant procedu re, including oppositions, patent attorney/EPO correspondence and more. This service also provides for public file inspection. Most patent issuing authorities keep all of this in formation in one place, but the United States provi des three different databases for finding this data: Public PAIR - US Case Histories - http://portal.uspto.gov/pair/PublicPair USPTO Assignments - ReDassignments D http://assignments.uspto.gov/assignments/q?db=pat US Patent Maintenance Fees - https://ramps.uspto.gov/eram/patentMaintFees.do 4.4.1 - File Wrappers and Prosecution History Patents, in the process of being examined, are pros ecuted at a patent issuing authority. During the process, Office Actions and other procedural items take place between the patent office, or examiner, and the applicant with their attorneys. The documen tation associated with the interaction between the applicant and the patent office is referred to as t he prosecution history and the paper trail associat ed with it contained in a file wrapper or dossier. The case history contains details on rejections from t he examiners, the responses from the applicants, any c hanges that are made to the language of the claims, and disclaimers and amendments, filed by th e applicant, among other details. An example of understanding patent file histories i n the United States can be found at http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/matters/matter sD0302.html . The file wrapper (dossier) becomes publicly accessi ble only after the patent application has been published (i.e. in most jurisdictions 18 months aft er the filing date oder the priority date. Not all jurisdictions however provide public file inspectio n. 4.4.2 - Maintenance Information Maintenance fees or renewal fees are fees that are paid to maintain a granted patent inDforce. Some patent laws require the payment of maintenance fees for pending patent applications. Not all patent laws require the payment of maintenance fees and di fferent laws provide different regulations concerning not only the amount payable but also the regularity of the payments. In countries where maintenance fees are to be paid annually, they are sometimes called patent annuities. 22 When conducting an analysis, for inclusion in a PLR , which examines the status of a patent document it is usually important to subDdivide granted paten ts in to those that are currently inDforce versus t hose that have been allowed to go abandoned, or found to be invalid after reDexamination. The documents in the latter two categories are no longer inDforce , are effectively in the public domain, and availab le for use by others. While status can be determined b y looking at maintenance data, calculating term 21 http://www.epo.org/searching/free/register.html 22 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance_fee_(pat ent) 24 and searching for reDexams, it can be a complicated item to determine, and a patent attorney should be consulted in matters where significant investmen t may be involved. 4.4.3 - Assignment Information An assignment involves the sale and transfer of own ership of a patent by the assignor to the assignee. The assignee is the entity that is the recipient of a transfer of a patent application, patent, tradem ark application or trademark registration from its owne r on record (assignor). 23 As discussed in section 4.2.1.2 on Inventors, in th e United States, one of the first assignments that takes place is between the inventor and the organiz ation they are employed by, assigning the inventor's rights to an invention to the organizati on that paid for its development. Since patents are a property right, they can also b e sold or licensed to other entities. While disclos ure of patent sales is not formally required in all cou ntries, unless a patent is going to be used in liti gation, some organizations will file a reDassignment to ens ure there is a record of the change in ownership. Patent licenses, on the other hand, can be more dif ficult to keep track of, since there is often not a record of the license being negotiated and between which parties. In addition, licenses are often considered as confidential or part of business inte lligence information; as a result of that, licensin g data is difficult to retrieve and is usually not in cluded in a PLR, unless it refers to specific compe titors and more limited number of patents. There are even some databases including some licensing information, based on some publicly available infor mation and M&As, nevertheless most of the times is such information incomplete. Patents can also be used as collateral against a lo an. This type of assignment is referred to as a Security Agreement, and while not a formal change i n ownership, this type of agreement will show up in databases that cover assignment data. Many electronic patent databases will incorporate a ssignment data by providing separate fields for the original, and current assignee, where the current a ssignee will reflect the impact of any changes in t he ownership of a patent right since it was first appl ied for. PLRs will typically incorporate the current owner w hen an analysis of the assignees prevalent in a particular area is being studied. 4.4.4 - Patent Infringement and Litigation Patents, by definition, are a right to exclude othe rs from making, using, offering for sale, or sellin g an invention in the jurisdiction covered by an inDforc e document. After a patent has been granted and when the patent owner believes that an organization is performing one of these acts, with an invention covered by one of their patents, they can initiate litigation in the form of a patent infringement lawsuit 24 . 23 http://inventors.about.com/od/definations/g/Assignm ent.htm 24 Additional details can be found at WIPO Handbook D Chapter 4 D Enforcement of Intellectual Property R ights http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/aboutDip/en/ip rm/pdf/ch4.pdf , WIPO IP Panorama 3 - Learning Point 3 http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/sme/en/documen ts/pdf/ip_panorama_3_learning_points.pdf 25 Organizations who believe they may be sued for pate nt infringement, and who believe that the patents involved are invalid, or that their organization do es not infringe them, may also initiate legal actio n, e.g. in the US in the form of a Declaratory Judgmen t or DJ action. The US Declaratory Judgment Act 25 provides US federal courts with the authority to \"d eclare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party\" where an \"actual controversy\" exi sts. Patent infringement and invalidation law suits are the actions most often associated with litigation involving patent assets. Litigation issues are not normally covered in the c ourse of developing a PLR, but for organizations entering a new market or technological field, under standing the litigious nature of the current player s can be a valuable competitive and strategic tool. Many patent databases have begun including litigati on data on individual patents, as well as the organizations that own them. Details on the motions involved during the court proceedings can be downloaded from the individual courts associated wi th the cases. 4.4.5 - Patent Families Due to the territorial character of the patent syst em worldwide, patents protection is sought in individual jurisdictions. The Paris Convention of 1 883 facilitates the filing in different jurisdictio ns by claiming priority rights derived from earlier filin gs (at the offices of first filing D OFF). These pr iority claims lead to relations between different national patent applications, so called patent family relations. Since the Paris convention expressly per mits the claiming of more than one priority rather complex family relations may exist depending on whe ther two applications share priorities in full, partially or only indirectly, i.e. through other on es. There is also the opportunity to file an internatio nal patent application, referred to as a PCT application, as discussed in section 4.2.1.1. Never theless, that does not lead to a patent grant, unle ss and until they enter the national phase of the indi vidual jurisdictions of interest in order to be exa mined by them at national level. PCT applications can be filed with or without claiming priority rights of e arlier filings. This creates a situation where a single in vention might have many individual patent documents associated with it, depending on the number of coun tries the applicant sought protection in, which are linked to each other through a PCT application numb er and not necessarily through one or several Paris Convention priorities. The family becomes even more enlarged when applicat ions, which are normally published separately from granted patents, and thus are discrete documen ts themselves, are also added to the collection. In order to simplify some of the dichotomy between inventions and the various patent documents that can be associated with them, the concept of a paten t family was created. There are a variety of different definitions provided for patent families depending on how tightly linked the documents are based on priority filings. According to the WIPO Ha ndbook, these are defined as: Domestic patent family D a patent family consistin g solely of a single office's different procedural publications for the same originating ap plication. 25 Act of June 14, 1934, Pub. L. No. 73-343, 48 Stat. 955 (1934) (current version at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201D2202 (2000 )). 26 Simple patent family D a patent family relating to the same invention, each member of which has for the basis of its \"priority right\" exactly t he same originating application or applications. Extended patent family D a patent family relatin g to one or more inventions, each member of which has for the basis of its priority right at le ast one originating application in common with at least one other member of the family. A detailed example of the different definitions of patent families can be found at the URL below: http://www.epo.org/searching/essentials/patentDfami lies/definitions.html In addition to the general concepts of simple and e xtended patent families, various database producers have created their own definitions of pat ent families for organizing patent documents within their collections, such as FamPat. The Intellogist wiki provides definitions for the major providers a s well as additional general definitions for patent f amilies besides simple and extended. http://www.intellogist.com/wiki/Patent_Families Organizing patent collections by some form of famil y is an essential activity, which will have a significant impact on how statistics are generated for a PLR. Determining which method will be used and consistently applying it across an entire proje ct will ensure that accurate comparisons can be made between different entities being studied. Gene rally speaking, using simple families will create larger numbers of narrowly defined collections to a nalyze while extended families will produce smaller, broader collections. Analysts must determi ne whether the use of an extended family will severely underrepresent the amount of investment ma de by an organization for instance when deciding to use that method. 4.5 - Sources of Patent Information The decision on what patent information source will be used is an important one for an analyst to consider as they are initiating a project. The cost of acquiring data to analyze should be weighed against the time it will take to work with the data , and its comprehensiveness. For convenience, a lis t of database providers who offer patent information, organized by these three categories, can be found in section 9.2 of these guidelines. While only the patenting authorities themselves gen erate authoritative patent data ( primary sources), there are a number of different secondary sources for patent documents and information that are usually used to generate PLRs because they include patent information of more than just one jurisdiction which they have obtained from differen t primary sources. When comparing patent information sources or databa ses one needs to distinguish between which data are searchable (search fields) and which are r etrievable. Namely not all data which are included in a database and which can be viewed or downloaded are also searchable. For example, many databases do not permit keyword searches in the ful ltext including claims and description. Sometimes, keywords can only be searched in title a nd abstract. Once a relevant publication is identified, e.g. through a search, claims can howev er be read. Due to their nature, secondary sources usually incl ude information regarding patent family relations. In some databases this family information is used t o perform a family reduction on the results list, i .e. 27 the search result list would include only one docum ent per family that represents the patent family. The reduction method varies from database to databa se leading to different representative patent family members. Primary sources may also sometimes include information on national patent family relations, such as continuations or continuations i n part. Since analysis is usually performed after search an d by a separate set of tools, it is particularly important whether sources permit the download of st ructured data (see Section 4.5.1). While primary sources are usually free, secondary s ources follow a continuum from free sources that provide basic bibliographic, text and/or image data , to forDfee sources that offer additional enhancements and features associated with the data, or even integrated analysis tools. 4.5.1 - Primary Sources: Patent Authorities Each patent jurisdiction defines its publication po licies and the authority in charge of producing the official patent related publications and providing access to other information like legal status data or the public part of the file wrapper. Many patent au thorities around the world have websites with data services that allow the general public to search an d retrieve the respective patent documents. These sources may be addressed as primary sources since t hey are the authoritative sources in comparison to other (secondary) databases that gather such inf ormation from many different primary sources and make them searchable through a single search interf ace. Some of the features associated with these primary sites include: These collections are generally available to searc h for no cost; very few jurisdictions permit access to full publications only for a fee. Basic b ibliographic data are generally accessible for free. Some of the offices (e.g. the United States Patent Office) separate the searching of applications from granted patents but most allow th e user to search both simultaneously. Some of the authorities maintain separate patent r egister databases that provide information on the most recent legal status of pending applicat ions or granted patents, or permit file inspection, in addition to the official document pu blication services. Many of the primary sources allow searching in an English interface, regardless of the native language of the country, although data (e.g. legal status) or documents retrieved are only in the national language. Search syntax and functionality varies from site t o site so individual search strategies need to be developed for each such source. Some primary sources allow for bulk downloading of patent documents discovered during a search, while others only allow small numbers or si ngle documents to be downloaded. While entire documents can be downloaded, most sit es do not allow individual patent data fields to be exported (structured data) or, if they do, the number of fields available is limited. Due to the limitations imposed by the National Pate nt Office sites, especially the inability to export individual data fields (structured data) and the li mitation to the authority's own publications, these collections are not normally used for generating da tasets associated with PLRs, unless the geographic scope of a report is only the one jurisd iction, or the national data are not included in an y secondary source, or if certain data like legal sta tus need to be verified. They may provide an 28 inexpensive means for exploring a topic area, but o nce that is accomplished most analysts will shift t o other patent sources to generate the data used for analysis. 4.5.2 - Free Secondary Sources A few patent authorities maintain secondary patent databases which allow searching for patents from several countries together. These are mainly PATENT SCOPE from WIPO, Esp@cenet from the European Patent Office, or DEPATISNET from the Germ an Patent and Trademark Office. There are several further patent searching services online that are available for free. Their characteristics are similar to the offerings from t he patent offices although their country coverage m ay be smaller. They offer sometimes advantages over th e patent office sites since, their user interface i s often a little more polished, and endDuser friendly . They also occasionally offer additional features that are not normally found on the patent office sites. Rudimentary analytics tools can be found on a few o f the sites but this functionality is normally left to the commercial sources. For instance, TheLens from Cambia, and PatentInspiration from CREAX, and PATENTSCOPE offer some statistical analysis and visualization features. Some of these sites have been used to generate PLRs26 and their free nature makes them an attractive source for collecting data. The balance an analyst has to strike is between the low cost of the data versus their ability to manipulate data du ring subsequent analysis. In some cases, the features and functionality available from commercia l tools justify the cost of access since they save time in the subsequent analysis stages. 4.5.3 - Commercial Sources Commercial sources of patent information have been available for over a century. What started as abstracting and indexing services covering patents from a handful of countries and, on a small variety of topics, has developed into a large business with many significant players. Some of the characteristics associated with commercial patent d atabase providers include: Enhanced content - editorial staffs create titles, abstracts and in dexes that \"translate\" the legal language used in patents into standard terms familiar to practitioners. When searching, the addition of enhanced content has a significant impact on the comprehensiveness of a patent collection. A \"one-stop-shop\" for searching, analysis and disse mination - several of the major commercial providers allow an analyst to search, re fine, review, analyze and share collections and output within the same system. Having most of t he functionality on one place can be a significant time saver. Flexibility in exporting data - Commercial sources generally have a higher limit on the number of records available for export. They also, generally, have a greater variety of fields to choose from, providing more options for an analyst to explore. Additional tools for refining data collections - as will be discussed in subsequent sections of the guidelines, patent data can contain errors, such as typos in patent assignee names, or 26 http://www.patentlens.net/daisy/patentlens/landscap es-tools.html 29 redundancies, such as the same invention being repr esented in different countries. Many services have mechanisms in place to assist users i n dealing with these items, as opposed to having to do them by manually, providing significan t time savings in preparing data to be analyzed. 4.6 - Reports Associated with Patent Information Due to the critical nature of patent documents and the information associated with them, reports related to patent information are used in a variety of different business contexts. There are differen t reports affiliated with providing information on pa tent data in these different environments. These guidelines are focused on the use of patent informa tion to generate Landscape Reports but the following definitions of additional reports that in corporate patent information are provided for reference. 4.6.1 - Patent Landscape There is no single definition or common understandi ng for a patent landscape report. There are various approaches, some of which broader, covering even Freedom to Operate elements and other, nonDpatent related data, such as market analysis, w hile others much narrower, with certain understandings being that a patent landscape is ide ntical to a patent map (for more information about that, please consult section 4.6.2). One could stat e that a patent landscape report provides an overview of the patenting activity and trends in a field of technology. A patent landscape normally seeks to answer specific policy or practical questi ons and to present complex information about this activity in a clear and accessible manner. Industry has long used patent landscapes to make strategic decisions on investments, research and development (R&D) directions, competitors' activity as well as on freedom to operate in introducing new products. Now, public policymakers are increasingly turning to landscaping to build a factual foundation before considering highDlevel policy matters, especially in fields such as health, food security and the enviro nment. 4.6.2 - Patent Map While the name patent map sounds similar to a paten t landscape, a patent map generally represents a graphical representation of a data collection tha t borrows characteristics of cartography. Maps are usually focused on a single attribute associated wi th a data collection such as the classification of documents based on the topics covered within them. A map paradigm is used to represent similarity between documents or concepts since the human mind is used to and can readily understand the use of maps to correlate distance between two items. 4.6.3 - Watch or Alerts A patent watch is a process for monitoring newly is sued patents, as well as possibly pending patent applications, to assess whether any of these patent documents might be of interest. 27 Patent alerts are also performed in order to determine if patent documents of interest undergo a change in status. For instance, a patent application of interest may be monitored to determine if it goes on to grant. Organizations also set up patent watches to monitor new patent applications coming from competing organizations in high interest technologies. 4.6.4 - Freedom-to-Operate / Clearance 27 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_watch 30 In this type of report, which involves an organizat ion asking for a legal opinion on whether a product they are planning on shipping will infringe any exi sting patents before they launch. The search involved is very specific since it is country speci fic and usually only applies to inDforce granted pa tents and their claims. There is nothing offensive about this type of report since the interested party is n ot going to assert patents against anyone else, they a re simply looking to make sure that they are not going to be infringing someone else's patents. An analyst in this case needs to identify the critical components of the product in question and search ju risdiction specific claims of inDforce patents to see if any of them cover the product components in question. In most cases a great deal of money has gone into a product launch or can be involved w ith a successful product which is generating a great deal of revenue so it is important for compan ies to know that they will be reasonably safe from future litigation before they make an even larger i nvestment. 4.6.5 - Patentability / Prior-Art This type of report is usually performed in the leg al context of determining if a new invention is eli gible for patent protection and determining how broadly t he claims for the new invention can be written. This type of report can cover both patent and nonDp atent literature and is typically looking for references that were published before the filing da te of the invention in question. In the United Sta tes inventors have up to a year from first public discl osure of an invention to file a patent so some searchers will go back an additional year with thei r searching to make sure they have found the best references. This report helps identify the boundaries of the kn own references and will help the attorneys drafting the claims to ask for the broadest coverage possibl e. Without knowing the scope of the known references it is difficult for the attorney to know how broadly they can write the claims and still ex pect the examiner to grant a patent. 4.6.6 - Validity Validity reports provide the results of the largest and most comprehensive of all patent searches. These reports are almost always associated with lar ge sums of money and critical business decisions and as such need to be as comprehensive as possible . This report shares similar characteristics to Patentability but is normally far more comprehensiv e since there is typically much more at stake when this sort of report is asked for. The object of the search involved with this report is to identify prior art references, which will all ow a granted patent to be made invalid or revoked during a particular proceeding before the particular patent office of interest or during a court proceed ing. Sometimes organizations will also initiate validity challenges for patents that they are think ing of acquiring especially if they believe these patents will later be used in some type of litigati on or another. On the flip side of this an organiz ation who is provided with a cease and desist notice will often want to make the patents in question go away by finding invalidating prior art and then ent ering into reDexamination. The prior art reference s in question can come from the patent or nonDpatent lit erature must be available in the public domain and have to have been published prior to the priority f iling date of the patent in question. In the Unite d States there is a oneDyear grace period on patents filings so some analysts will look back an additional year when they search so they can be sur e to avoid this type of situation. 4.6.7 - General Statistics 31 Reports of this nature are generated by patent offi ces 28 and other organizations to provide metrics on the performance and output associated with an area of interest. PriceWaterhouseCoopers for instance, publishes a yearly litigation study that looks at the statistics associated with patent liti gation in the United States 29 . WIPO cooperates with intellectual property (IP) off ices from around the world to provide its stakeholders with upDtoDdate IP statistics 30 . Generally, these statistics are provided as raw d ata that can be used by analysts to draw conclusions based o n their own interests and experimentation. WIPO also publishes statistical reports on worldwid e IP activity and on the use of WIPODadministered treaties in the protection of IP rights internation ally, such as the PCT Yearly Review 31 and the World Intellectual Property Indicators 32 . In addition, WIPO IP Statistics Data Center is an onDline service enabling access to WIPO's statistical data on intel lectual property (IP) activity worldwide 33 . Users can select from a wide range of indicators and view or download the latest available as well as historical data according to their needs, based on the Worldwi de Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT 34 ) data, which is administered by the European Patent Office . Moreover, patent statistics are often paired with other data and indicators to provide a more holisti c approach of innovation. An example of this is the Global Innovation Index (GII) 35 which ranks the innovation performance of 143 coun tries and economies around the world, based on 81 indicators. The GII is coDpublished by WIPO, Cornell http://www.epo.org/searching/subscription/patstat-o nline.html 35 http://www.wipo.int/econ_stat/en/economics/gii/ 32 Chapter 5: Objectives and Motivations for Generatin g Patent Landscape Reports Producing a Patent Landscape Report (PLR) can be a time intensive and expensive process. Devoting the resources necessary to generate a PLR is often tied to a business objective, e.g., where an organization is preparing to make a significant monetary or headcount investment in developing or moving into a technology area. Various types of org anizations have different objectives that need to be explored in order to make an informed decision a bout the allocation of resources to a new project or area. For the purposes of these guidelines, the types of organizations will be either governmental and interDgovernmental, or corporate. The approach taken to developing a PLR will differ depending on the business objectives that necessitated the ordering of the report for an indi vidual decision cycle. Generally speaking, PLRs support informed decisionDmaking. Regardless of the business objective, PLRs have developed a specific format, and are designed to efficiently ad dress the concerns associated with making high stakes decisions in technologically advanced areas, with a maximum degree of confidence. For many years decisionDmakers operated based on personal ne tworks and intuition. With the institution of patent analytics, and PLRs, it is possible for thes e critical decisions to be made with dataDdriven approaches that deliver informed choices, and lower risk profiles. 5.1 - Objectives behind Patent Landscape Reports The issues associated with public policy decisions, initiated by government agencies, are usually different from the decisions that are important to corporate entities, and their stakeholders. The analyses of patent information, and the generation of PLRs, are increasingly required by both types of organizations, in order to understand a technologic al area. Understanding how the decisions differ between these two types of entities allows the anal yst to tailor their report in order to most efficie ntly meet the needs of the respective audiences. In most cases, there is not much overlap between the objectives associated with each entity, but in the cases of using PLRs to explore technology transfer, and research and development questions there is sub stantial similarity in what both groups are attempting to discover for informed decisionDmaking . 5.1.1 - To Support Governmental Policy Discussions At the beginning of April 2008, the World Intellect ual Property Organization (WIPO) in cooperation with the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) o rganized a Symposium on Public Policy Patent Landscaping in the Life Sciences 36 . The stated goals for this symposium provide a suc cinct explanation of how PLRs can be used as instruments to inform public policy makers as they look to tackle technological issues. The Symposium draws together two important trends: Patent information as a tool of public policy: Poli cymakers who deal with innovation and access in the life sciences - concerned with agricu lture and food security; public health and pharmaceuticals; and environmental issues - have in creasingly focused on the patent system. They look for clearer, more accessible and geograph ically more representative information to support key policy processes. They seek a stronger empirical basis for their assessments on the role and impact of the patent system in relatio n to key areas of life sciences technology. Improved analytical tools and access to patent info rmation: Rapid growth in the use of the patent system, and in the diversity of users, has l ed to an explosion of raw data on patenting 36 http://www.wipo.int/meetings/en/2008/lifesciences/p atent_landscaping 33 activities in the life sciences. This data is progr essively being turned into useful information. Availability and quality of patent information have increased. Analytical tools and methodologies are better understood and are more wi dely available. And greater practical experience has been harvested from a range of recen t patent landscaping initiatives. This trend opens up enormous practical potential for imp roved patent information resources for public policymakers addressing the life sciences. This Symposium aims to take a first step towards mo re systematically matching the policy needs - the international policy agenda on public policy issues of concern in the life sciences - with the practic al capacities - the diverse resources that are now inc reasingly available to gather, analyze and extract key trends and findings from patent information. PLRs are designed to provide efficient access to a large collection of technologically focused data an d to answer key questions about what technologies are covered, which organizations own the patents and in which countries they are held. Where previou sly, this data might only be available to the technologically savvy, now it can be made available to individuals at all technological knowledge levels. Making technological topics available to po licy makers leads to better decisionDmaking and additional resources devoted to critical issues. Wi thin the context of Governmental Policy discussions , an examination of the activities associated with va rious jurisdictions can help identify the elements required for preparing PLRs for these agencies. 5.1.1.1 - Global Efforts WIPO is involved with several global efforts to enh ance the availability of information on patent activity. A WIPO Magazine article, Shedding Light on the Life Sciences: Patent Landsca ping for Public Policymakers provides excellent reasons for why these internatio nal efforts are necessary for informed public policy discussions 37 . Good quality information about patenting activity i s an essential input for some of the most critical international policy debates today. Yet patent info rmation is unavoidably complex, constantly evolving , and difficult to capture in readily accessible form for a non-specialized audience. There are real ris ks associated with making judgments on the basis of li mited patent landscapes without considering the full technical and legal context. Thus the demand f or reliable patent landscaping in the life sciences is strong, and there are no shortcuts to meeting that demand. A positive feedback loop is developing: patent info rmatics are delivering increasingly focused and accessible information products for policymakers, w ho in turn can sharpen and distil their demands for patent information, leading in turn to increasingly more relevant and useful support. Patent landscaping is not a substitute for the policy deba tes and deliberations on the key life sciences issu es of the day. But it can inform, support and strength en the factual basis for discussions, so assisting the policymakers in those fields to set future directio ns on health, the environment and food security. WHO's Global Strategy and Plan of Action also ident ified the need to improve access to patent information to facilitate the determination of the patent status of health products. It urges stakehol ders to: 37 http://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/en/2008/04/articl e_0005.html 34 Facilitate access to user-friendly global databases which contain public information on the administrative status of health-related patents. Th is includes supporting existing efforts for determining the patent status of health products, a nd to Promote further development of such global database s including, if necessary, compiling, maintaining and updating such global databases. To date, there was no comprehensive overview of pat enting activity and trends in the area of vaccines. In the framework of policy discussions at the World Health Assemblies on vaccine local manufacturing, WHO and WIPO jointly developed a pat ent landscape report 38 that provides an overview on what is being patented in terms of sele cted disease targets, who is doing the patenting, where patents are filed and on how patent policies change over time. This provided the factual evidence and the background to support the related policy discussions. WIPO has also worked with the World Health Organiza tion (WHO) on understanding the patent environment associated with essential medicines fro m around the world. In a summary of this work 39 , the following details were shared: For more than 30 years, the WHO has published a Mod el List of Essential Medicines, which is updated every two years. Most countries have adopte d the concept and have developed their own national lists of essential medicines. One importan t question is to what extent patents protect the essential medicines on the WHO Model List. One of t he projects presented at the symposium focused on assessing the patent status of the medicines tha t have been added to the WHO Model List in recent years. The study, based on data from the US Federal Drug Administration's Orange Book, identified relevant patent families for these medic ines in countries where patent data were available. Access to affordable generic medicines can be achie ved through licensing agreements. A new approach to increase access this way is the creatio n of a patent pool for antiretroviral medicines, undertaken by the Medicines Patent Pool, a United N ations-backed organization established in 2010 40 . This requires reliable patent information, includ ing: 1. Knowing what patents cover the products to be us ed; 2. What the patents exactly cover for these product s; 3. Who holds the patents; 4. The countries where the patent applications have been filed and where they have been granted; and 5. The current legal status of those patents. These are complex tasks. Many national and regional patent collections can only be consulted on- site. Information is often not updated or incomplet e, especially on the legal status. With the support of WIPO (among others through the preparation of two p atent landscape reports on Ritonavir 41 and Atazanavir 42 , and information collected by WIPO with the suppor t of national IP Offices), and a wide range of national and regional patent offices, the Medicines Patent Pool has identified the legal stat us 38 http://www.wipo.int/patentscope/en/programs/patent_ landscapes/reports/vaccines.html 39 http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/patents/946/wi po_pub_946_2.pdf 35 of key patents for selected antiretroviral medicine s in low- and middle-income countries 43 . A database has been launched in the meantime to allow open acc ess to this resource and the legal status information related to these medicines 44 . The discussion raised the question of whether pat ent pooling could be a general solution in cases of patent thic kets, i.e. situations involving overlapping patents , which prevent competition. In some cases, PLRs have also an awareness raising role on the importance of the IP aspect and patent information in policy discussions of various subject matters involving technology; and they can also have an impact. After WIPO's collaboration wit h IRENA 45 , the International Renewable Energy Agency, and the production of a PLR on Desalination Technologies and the use of Renewable Energies for Desalination 46 , the importance of IP and patent information becam e more clear to IRENA and its stakeholders and some years later it even l ead to the launch beginning of 2015 of IRENA's Standards and Patent Information Platform 47 . WIPO has generated several PLRs associated with the se onDgoing, global efforts. Additional details on these efforts and a list of available PLRs can b e found at: http://www.wipo.int/patentscope/en/programs/patent_ landscapes/index.html . 5.1.1.2 - Regional Efforts The World Health Organization works regionally, spe cifically in developing countries, to ensure that access to vital medicines is available to individua ls of all economic and social backgrounds. In order to understand the technology, and IP rights, associ ated with providing access to critical care, WHO has worked with WIPO and the World Trade Organizati on (WTO), and looked at the patent activity around vaccines. On February 18 th 2011, the three organizations organized a joint Te chnical Symposium on Access to Medicines, Patent Informatio n and FreedomDtoDOperate 48 that provides details on this regional effort. In the field of vaccines, WHO is monitoring the pat enting activity to identify the extent to which vaccines and production technologies are protected by intellectual property. When patents apply, in some cases WHO supports research on alternative tec hnologies or negotiates licenses with the right holders on behalf of developing country manufacture rs. For most existing vaccines, patents do not generally prevent production by competitors, but th ere are some notable exceptions, including reverse genetic engineering, a key technology for the produ ction of pandemic influenza vaccines and the human papilloma- virus vaccine. 43 The database coverage as of June 1, 2015 can be fo und at http://www.medicinespatentpool.org/wp-content/uploa ds/Patent-Status-Table-1June2015.xls 44 http://www.medicinespatentpool.org/patent-data/pat 57 48 http://www.wipo.int/meetings/en/2011/who_wipo_wto_ ip_med_ge_11/program.html 36 A major barrier to increasing the uptake of vaccine manufacturing in developing countries is the lack of know-how. Thus WHO also focuses on the transfer of vaccine production technology to these countries. The Dengue Vaccine Initiative of the International Vaccine Institute presented a global freedom to operate analysis with different candidates for deng ue vaccines. The goal was to understand how intellectual property may affect access to future v accines in developing countries and to evaluate how free developing country developers are to market th eir vaccines internationally. The analysis revealed that the sponsors of vaccine candidates seem to have intellectual property required to regulatory agency approval for their ca ndidates and to market them. However, in the future, problems might still arise from patent appl ications, which cover certain delivery mechanisms. WIPO is also working closely with various national institutions to support them in addressing issues o f interest for various regions. For instance, WIPO is working in collaboration with the Malaysian (MyIPO), the Malaysian Palm Oil Board and the Phill ipines IP Office (IPOPHIL) on a Patent Landscape Report on Palm Oil Production and Waste E xploitation Technologies, providing a general overview of related technologies globally, but also with a focus on the region whose economy is strongly active in the field. 5.1.1.3 - National Efforts Several Intellectual Property Offices have become e ngaged in the field of patent analytics, e.g., the Intellectual Property Office of the United Kingdom ( http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ ) initiated an informatics team in 2009 with the stated goal of \"using patent data to mine, reveal, and inform, for government and for industry\"49 . To date they have twelve PLRs listed on their rep orts page 50 covering topics from stem cells to 3DTVs. They list the following nation al benefits to the use of patent analytics and PLRs to both governmental and business interests in the United Kingdom: Innovation Policy - Providing evidence of the emerging trends in techn ology Investment Opportunity - Identifying the technologies that could create a w hole new market Competitor Intelligence - Profiling your competitors using their patent port folios Knowledge Transfer - Analyzing the flow of knowledge and collaborations Geographical Profiling - Comparing markets between countries and regions Looking at the specific objectives listed in the IP O study on the generation of energy from waste materials, the following rationales are given: The objectives as defined in the original project p roposal are as follows: Provide an overall patent landscape analysis in the technology area of Energy from Waste. Provide analysis of the level of UK research in com parison to the rest of Europe and rest of the world. Identify key active companies and key patent applic ations. The objectives for Phase II were designed to focus on the UK energy from waste patent landscape, covering: 49 http://www.ipo.gov.uk/informatics.htm 50 http://www.ipo.gov.uk/informatics-reports 37 Specific technology fields: biogas / biohydrogen fr om waste Emergent technologies UK patent applicant types: commercial, academic, or government The activities of individual patent applicants and the extent to which they influence the overall patterns in the UK Consolidated IPC classifications to form larger gro ups and produce more focused results Producing and interrogating a UK patent landscape m ap The objective for Phase II, in particular demonstra tes how the creation of PLRs can assist the development of high impact technologies within nati onal jurisdictions. Investing in high impact technologies helps to establish both academic and i ndustrial centers of excellence within a country that often leads to an increase in the number of or ganizations that will establish research and manufacturing facilities in the country. 5.1.1.4 - Technology transfer and licensing In order to assist industries residing in their cou ntries, several national governments have recently started purchasing patent assets on behalf of the o rganizations that manufacture products in their jurisdictions. A news story on this practice from R euters 51 provides details on this practice: France Brevets was launched in 2011 with 100 millio n euros, half from the state and half from the Caisse des Depots, a publicly managed investor in F rench economic development. Pascal Asselot, licensing director for France Breve ts, said that by assembling patent pools with intellectual property bought from French and foreig n businesses, France Brevets aims to convince other companies to sign licensing deals and pay roy alties. If France Brevets can show a healthy revenue stream, the hope is to attract sustainable private investment, Asselot said. Korea's Intellectual Discovery, which was started i n 2010 amid government fears that domestic companies were losing key patents that could be use d against them by foreign companies, has a $140 million government commitment. Prominent South Korean companies like Samsung Elect ronics Co Ltd and LG Electronics have signed up as \"shareholders,\" providing Intellectual Discov ery with additional revenue in exchange for a license to its patent portfolio. Intellectual Discovery chief general manager Chant Kim compares the company to San Francisco- based RPX Corp, which acquires patents to protect i ts members but doesn't initiate lawsuits. PLRs are often used by organizations exploring tech nology transfer, and licensing in order to understand what other organizations have invested i n a particular area. If another organization has invested in a technology, especially if the investm ent was made a few years earlier, there is a higher likelihood that they will be receptive to hearing a bout new developments, and potentially acquiring or licensing the technology. While government agencies have shown recent interes t in this area, it has been established practice for many years for technology intensive corporate e ntities. Many examples abound, including Texas 51 http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/20/patents-n ations-idUSL1N0BZ10C20130320 38 Instruments and Tessera, of companies that original ly received most of their revenue from the sales of physical products, but began to shift their busines s models to rely more heavily on revenue generated from licensing. 5.1.1.5 - Research and development (R&D) decision-m aking As was seen in the UK IPO national efforts example, the use of PLRs can influence decisions around investments in academic and nonDprofit funding for the creation of economically favorable technologies, which can increase the Gross Domestic Product of a country. Governments use PLRs to ensure that investments in R&D will be directed to technologies and industries that will ensure the ir future competitiveness in high impact areas. Understanding patent rights also have a major impac t on R&D since patents, by their nature, are a right to exclude, and this can have a significant i mpact on the ability to conduct further research in an area covered by them. Different countries allow for different Research Exemptions involving patent rights. The Wikipedia page on Research Exemptions 52 provides the following details on the International framework around this exemption: Article 30 of the WTO's TRIPs Agreement permits thi s type of exception: \"Members may provide limited exceptions to the excl usive rights conferred by a patent, provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with a normal exploitation of the patent and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the patent owner, taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties.\" PLRs are an excellent method of determining which t echnologies have patents associated with them, and in which countries those rights are inDforce. I f the initiation of R&D, in a particular region, is one of the objectives of the report, then additional discu ssion of the Research Exemption law for that region should be included. Corporate entities are also subject to the same dyn amics, when it comes to R&D decisionDmaking and PLRs are often generated in this sector as well to support management. A particularly good example of this involves the soDcalled Safe Harbor exemptio ns that allow for R&D activities in association wit h the generation of generic drugs. The Wikipedia page on Research Exemptions 53 discusses this situation as well: In patent law, the research exemption or safe harbo r exemption is an exemption to the rights conferred by patents, which is especially relevant to drugs. According to this exemption, despite the patent rights, performing research and tests for pr eparing regulatory approval, for instance by the FD A in the United States, does not constitute infringem ent for a limited term before the end of patent ter m. This exemption allows generic manufacturers to prep are generic drugs in advance of the patent expiration. In the United States, this exemption is also techni cally called \u00a7 271(e)(1) exemption or Hatch- Waxman exemption. The U.S. Supreme Court recently c onsidered the scope of the Hatch-Waxman exemption in Merck v. Integra. The Supreme Court he ld that the statute exempts from infringement all uses of compounds that are reasonably related to su bmission of information to the government under any law regulating the manufacture, use or distribu tion of drugs. 52 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_exemption 53 Ibid 39 In Canada, this exemption is known as the Bolar pro vision or Roche-Bolar provision, named after the case Roche Products v. Bolar Pharmaceutical. In the European Union, equivalent exemptions are al lowed under the terms of EC Directives 2001/82/EC (as amended by Directive 2004/28/EC) and 2001/83/EC (as amended by Directives 2002/98/EC, 2003/63/EC, 2004/24/EC and 2004/27/EC). In both governmental and corporate environments PLR s are an essential tool for understanding the competitive environment around research areas of in terest, and discovering whether groups interested in pursuing research initiatives have th e freedom to do so. 5.1.2 - Business or corporate uses While there are some overlaps between the uses of p atent analytics, and PLRs for governmental policy decisionDmaking, the circumstances under whi ch these tools are used for business, or corporate situations can be somewhat different. The methods used to generate a PLR, under both circumstances, are similar, but the implications, b oth in the short and long term, can vary significan tly. 5.1.2.1 - Competitor monitoring Competition is an inherently business related conce pt and it is nearly impossible to find a successful industry in which there is not some form of competi tion between organizations looking to gain an advantage over other companies in a space. Since bu sinesses compete against one another, understanding the capabilities, resources and exper tise associated with a competitor becomes a key component of corporate strategy. These ideas are often associated with Sun Tzu, in T he Art of War, when he said the following: \"If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle\" This thinking is often applied to business strategy and is especially the case when looking at technologically focused industries. PLRs usually an swer the first question in a strategy session; does my competitor have patent rights in any of the area s of interest? They also address the next, followDu p question; how many do they have and in what aspects of the technology do they have coverage? Patents can provide knowledge on levels of competit ive expertise, timing, and investment, in addition to providing a right to exclude. They are even more important in technology intensive industries since many of the insights contained in them are only pub lished in patents and are not described in other types of publications. 5.1.2.2 - Technology monitoring Corporate entities usually associate themselves wit h specific technological areas. In the Pharmaceutical industry, for instance, no single co mpany can excel in all therapeutic areas. Most companies tend to focus on a few areas, and concent rate their efforts on those items to the exclusion of others. There may be specific competitors, which the organization will monitor, but it is recognize d that innovation can come from unexpected sources, a nd as long as it covers an area of interest, the company will be aware of these new developments reg ardless of their source. 40 Occasionally, organizations will look to move into new markets, or enter new technological areas that they did not have direct experience in previously. When this happens a PLR can provide key intelligence on the top players, inventors, and tec hnology subDcategories associated with the area of interest. Armed with this data companies can determ ine if they will develop new technologies or seek to acquire technology from others. PLRs tend to be technologically focused in scope, a s opposed to competitor focused, and are well suited for providing a background collection of ins ights associated with a particular area. Once an initial understanding is gained, ongoing monitoring can also be established using the PLR as a foundation. 5.1.2.3 - Mergers and acquisitions Technology savvy organizations will look at innovat ive benefit and fit, in addition to the more traditional economic and market driven factors, whe n deciding on whether to acquire, or merge with another company. A technology based due diligence a ssessment is necessary to ensure that two groups will be compatible with one another, and is often used to determine how much technological overlap there is between them. It is not unusual to find that, while two organizat ions are working in the same technological area, th ey are taking different approaches to solving key issu es. In this case, the companies are complimentary to one another, and a stronger argument can be made for justifying a merger, especially when a combination will cover all major methods for deploy ing a technology. Under different circumstance, it is sometimes disco vered that an acquisition would provide redundant capabilities that are already owned by the acquirin g company. This scenario can occur with large, multiDnational and divisional companies, or ones th at become involved with several mergers, or acquisitions in a short time frame. In any of these scenarios PLRs are often generated to provide focused insight on the organizations involved and project how the combined resources wil l compare to the other companies involved in a technology area. 5.2 - Motivations for generating Patent Landscape R eports Having looked at the reasons why organizations are interested in the analysis of patent information, and its association with strategic decisionDmaking, it is also important to look at the aspects of PLR s, in particular, and how they can be maximized to ach ieve this benefit. In chapter 8, individual sections and specific anal ytics will be addressed, but in this section the va lue associated with the reports, especially to the clie nt, typically a technologically based, decision mak er, are addressed. 5.2.1 - Who is the report intended for? In order for a PLR to be impactful it has to be rea d by a decision maker in the first place. The two primary considerations in determining whether a PLR will be read, and better yet acted upon, are based on the position your client holds within the organization, and their personal information intake profile. 41 As an example, consider the following advice on pre senting to executives within an organization 54 : The biggest mistake I see people make is they prese nt to Senior Management the same way they would present to their peers or their team. Rememb er the higher up a person is in an organization, the larger the picture they have of problems and is sues. Think of moving up through the ranks of management like a helicopter that climbs h igher and higher in the air. On ground level you only see things right in front of you, but when you get very high in the air, you can see for miles an d miles. So this means that when you are presenting to upper management you need to THINK about the problems and issues from THEIR perspective, not you rs. It is your job to show how what you are talking about fits in to the corporate GOALS, VISIO N & MISSION. It is also important to recognize that there is an inverse relationship between the importance of your client's role in an organization, and the amount of time an analyst is likely going to be given to pre sent to them. Generally, as discussed in the next sectio n, the most important feature of a PLR should be about turning data into intelligence and insight, t hus saving your client the time of having to do thi s themselves. In this section a different implication of time, the time available to share the most crit ical aspects of the research, is being discussed. PLRs s hould include an Executive Summary, and if this is the only section the client reads then it needs to deliver the message, or insight the analyst want s to portray. Consider generating different versions of the PLR that are appropriate to the different roles within an organization that are likely to be intera cting with it. It is also important to consider the audience for a PLR, and think about the ways in which they process and analyze information. On one level peopl e can be consider rightDbrained or leftDbrained as discussed below 55 : According to the theory of left-brain or right-brai n dominance, each side of the brain controls differ ent types of thinking. Additionally, people are said to prefer one type of thinking over the other. For example, a person who is \"left-brained\" is often sa id to be more logical, analytical and objective, wh ile a person who is \"right-brained\" is said to be more intuitive, thoughtful and subjective. More recent research indicates that this dichotomy is overly simplistic. A more detailed theory involving Socionics, provides a more granular appro ach to methods of learning based on MyersD Briggs personality types. Additional information on Socionics can be found at the URL provided: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socionics When generating a PLR consider whether the primary client is more of an analytical thinker, someone who will want to see a logical progression leading to a conclusion, or an intuitive thinker, who is leaping ahead to the implications of the research a nd what impacts they have on their preDconceived notions. Ideally, try to address both types of thin kers but give priority to the personality type of t he primary client. 5.2.2 - How does it save the client time? The most valuable commodity a PLR can provide a dec isionDmaker is to save them time. PLRs take large amounts of raw, unprocessed data and generate insight, and intelligence based on the analysis 54 http://www.impressionmanagement.com/blog/09-24-2010 /presentation-skills-37 55 http://psychology.about.com/od/cognitivepsychology/ a/left-brain-right-brain.htm 42 conducted and, perhaps more importantly, the interp retation of the results by a skilled analyst. The analyst is responsible for applying the intelligenc e to the specific business context associated with the decision being made, and provides recommendations t hat can be acted upon by the client. Clients are looking to analysts to provide an expert opinion, a nd perspectives based on their knowledge of the topic in question, not simply data. This can sometimes be a daunting task and many PLRs simply provide summaries of data, without taking the extra step of interpreting the results, in view of the objectives that led to the ordering of the report in the first place. It is also important to recognize that the client d oes not necessarily understand the nuances of paten t information, and may likely misinterpret the data i f they are not provided with conclusions generated from the analyst. Having an analyst expertly interp ret this critical data source also saves the decisi onD maker from having to develop these skills themselve s. 5.2.3 - How does it add value to the decision makin g process? Many decisions are made without proper intelligence , or analysis, leading to higher risks associated with them. SeniorDlevel managers, in particular, te nd to rely on a network of familiar advisors, as opposed to data driven decisionDmaking, for develop ing organizational strategy. In technologyDdriven industries, the volume of information available, an d the complexity of the issues surrounding the decisionDmaking process, is such that relying on pe rsonal networks increases the risk that a suboptimal result will take place. Data analysis allows for all available options to b e explored, including allowing for historical information that might not otherwise be considered, to approach decisionDmaking in a systematic fashion. Since more options, and information, are b eing considered the risks associated with the development of a strategy, or a specific decision, are lowered. Risk cannot be eliminated completely, but when all available data is analyzed, using a va riety of complementary methods, and procedures, it provides confidence that the proposed recommendatio ns will reflect the desired outcome for the business. From the analyst's perspective the most valuable re sults are achieved when a plan for presenting the recommendations of the research is developed, and t he likely implications, and impacts to the organization, are clearly stated. Practically speak ing, this requires forming an opinion, supporting i t through interpretation of data analysis, and provid ing business perspective for acting on it. 5.2.4 - How will the user evaluate the effectivenes s of the report? As stated at the beginning of the chapter, the gene ration of a PLR is a time intensive and expensive endeavor, and it is embarked upon since an organiza tion is preparing to make a significant monetary or headcount investment. Understanding how the user will evaluate the PLR is a critical component in ensuring that the end product will be satisfactory to them. Generally speaking, in regards to PLRs, evaluation looks at whether the right questions were asked and whether they were analyzed correctly . It examines the rationale, and the justification of activities, in relationship to the decision, associated with th e questions. Finally, it eexamines the efficiency o f the results, or how the time and effort associated with the PLR was converted into results, and provided value to the decisionDmaking process. 43 Understanding these standards leads to the producti on of high value PLRs that provide excellent return on the investment, and lower the risk associ ated with technological decisionDmaking. Once a business leader is introduced to reports of this na ture, and discovers how they provide key intelligence, they are likely to want to incorporat e them frequently into critical objectives, as a ma tter of practice. 44 Chapter 6: Tasks Associated with Patent Analytics a nd Landscaping When performing data analysis, using patent informa tion, for a Patent Landscape Report (PLR), or for most patent analytics projects, there are a finite number of functions or tasks that are available for the analyst to consider using. In addition to providing analysis capabilities, some of the tasks are associated with preparing data for subsequent analy sis, while others provide means for visualizing the output from an analysis task. This chapter defines and explores the various tasks associated with patent analytics and PLRs, provides explanations of why they are used for pate nt analysis, and suggests a few tools that can be used to perform each task. By systematically lookin g at all of the tasks that are typically associated with PLRs an analyst can consider the range of opti ons available to them, and decide which elements they will include in their study. 6.1 - Data Cleanup and Grouping Data cleanup and grouping are processes for the man ual, or automatic standardization of terms or items, within a data field, to correct errors or in consistencies, or to group synonymous entries. It i s required by patent analysts in order to produce sta tistically relevant results. It is necessary since raw patent data is notoriously \"messy\" and requires cle anup or standardization to produce accurate results. Misspellings, for instance, are a common o ccurrence within certain fields, and require correction. There are also many terms with the same or similar meanings, within the English language, and these should be grouped together when analyzing concepts. Using a simple data cleanup example, 3M is listed i n most patent assignee fields in a number of different ways including: 3M, 3M Inc., 3M Inc, and by its full name, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing. All of these represent the single en tity, and have to be grouped together, or standardized, in order to perform accurate statisti cs reflecting the total impact of the organization. Grouping these terms together into a single entry i s the essence of the data cleanup task. Often, it takes more time to prepare patent data fo r analytics than it does to actually perform the analysis. That is certainly true with the data clea nup task, which depending on the method used, can take many hours if the user is working with a large data collection. In particular, data cleanup is applied to the following fields within patent analy tics: Patent Assignee Cleanup - Perhaps the most often used cleanup task due to misspellings and alternative representations of company names. T he cleaning of this particular field is accomplished by a variety of different methods incl uding bootstrapping, fuzzy logic algorithms, and manual methods such as PivotTables. Inventor Name Cleanup - Misspellings are also common in this field, but just as frequently there are issues with whether an individual uses th eir full first name, their middle name, or initial, and in the case of the last name, whether they have changed it due to marriage. Asian names, and the order in which they appear also caus e problems when cleaning this field. Besides cleaning inaccurate data, grouping is also performed in order to aggregate data in various patent analysis applications including the followin g: 45 Technology Categories - synonymous terms from text collections within pa tent data fields, such as the abstract, claims or examples, are group ed together to represent a single concept. Cancer, for instance, can be described using additi onal terms such as neoplasm. Grouping terms when creating technology categories are requi red to ensure that all relevant occurrences of a concept are captured during analys is. Up Posting Classifications - Technical subject matter is often classified by hierarchical lists of concepts but analysts may not always want to use them at their most granular, or detailed level. When this is the case, more detailed classif ication can be grouped together, and collected as part of a higherDlevel entry. Using IP C classifications as an example, an analyst may group several subgroups together, provide them with a name that represents a meaningful concept, and then processes them as a si ngle entity. Generally speaking, methods for cleaning up data li sts, or grouping concepts, in patents can essentially be divided into two categories: manual and automatic. Manual Methods These methods require the analysts to work with eac h individual entry in a data field. It requires tha t the analyst knows the relationship between one entr y and another, and to be able to decide, if they are in fact, the same entry. These methods can be v ery time consuming, and can be accomplished using Pivot Tables or by manipulating lists, one ob ject at a time. Pivot Tables - Pivot Table functionality allows a user to select o ne or more rows in a spreadsheet and group them together. Once they are grouped the new group can be renamed to reflect the desired name for the combined entry. See Figure 1 for an example of using a Pivot Table for patent assignee cleanup. Drag and Drop or Manual Grouping - Some tools provide a list of entries within a field and allow the user to either drop one entry on to the t op of another to create a grouping, or allow multiple entries to be selected, and then grouped b y rightDclicking or pushing a button. Once the entries are grouped the new group can be rename d to reflect the desired content of the combined items. 46 Figure 1 - Patent Assignee Cleanup Using Pivot Tabl e Function in Microsoft Excel Automated Methods These methods allow the processing of an entire fie ld of data based on the use of an algorithm, or an agreed upon collection of facts. While not as time consuming as manual methods the accuracy of the method is only as good as the algorithm used, or th e knowledge of the individuals who built the collection of facts. Automated methods include the use of Fuzzy Logic, and Bootstrapping. Fuzzy Logic - An algorithm looks at the string of characters asso ciated with an entry and determines the likelihood that two items represent the same entry based on how similar they are to one another. There are a variety of differen t algorithms that take this approach and many can be tuned based on the amount of similarity required to form a grouping. Bootstrapping - This method involves the collection of lists of sta ndardized items that can be used to group together entries consistently. The or ganizations that build databases will often use these lists to make certain that they consisten tly apply the same name to an entry regardless of how it may have been used in the sour ce material. Lookup tables can be used to transform raw input into standardized entries with large collections. The following tools provide for some form of data c leanup or grouping. This is not an exhaustive list but provides some suggestions for starting with thi s task. Contact information for these tools can be found in section 9.1 of these guidelines. STN AnaVist - provides manual grouping which can b e saved by user VantagePoint - allows for the creation of user def ined thesaurus and fuzzy logic grouping 47 Orbit.com - provides manual grouping which can be saved by user, online Microsoft Excel - includes Pivot Table functionali ty for manual grouping A recent blog post, covering the use of Open Refine to assist with patent assignee cleanup can be found at: http://www.patinformatics.com/blog/patentDassigneeD cleanupDusingDgoogleDrefineDopenD refineDtextDfacetsDandDclustering/ An additional resource available for grouping assig nee names is provided by the Organization for Economic CoDoperation and Development (OECD), which has developed a collection of cleaned patent assignee names that can be used with bootstr apping methods. OECD provides the following description of the HAN database 56 . The OECD \"Harmonized Applicants' Names\" database pr ovides a dictionary of applicants' names which have been elaborated with business register d ata, so that it can easily be matched by all users. The data is based on applicants for patents filed to the EPO and through PCT. The dataset is complementary to Eurostat's method for harmonizing applicant's names. 6.2 - List Generation List generation is a statistical method that provid es counts of various patent related metrics within individual data fields. Identifying the top ten inv entors, for instance, is an example of generating a list of the most frequently occurring inventors in a pat ent collection. Figure 2 provides an example of a l ist generated in Microsoft Excel. The preferred method for visualizing a list is by generating a bar chart or histogram. This is a twoDdimensional analysis with list entries typically displayed along the xDaxis a nd the number of occurrences of the entry presented on the yDaxis. Lists, and bar charts are used frequently in patent analytics, and within PLRs, si nce they allow for the statistical comparison of tw o or more entities in the same data field. In order to a ccurately account for the entries in a field, it ma y require standardization, or cleaning, as discussed in section 6.1. A great deal of list manipulation is accomplished i n a spreadsheet application, like Microsoft Excel, where each data field being analyzed is found in a column and the discrete items being analyzed are contained in the rows. Columns, or data fields can be sorted in a variety of different ways, but they are principally either in descending or ascending order . In a column containing alphabetical data, descending order would start with entries containin g the letter Z, and would work down the column to the letter A. Ascending order would do the opposite , and rows containing the letter A would be at the top and would proceed downward towards Z. In a colu mn containing numeric data, descending order would begin with the highest number and progress to wards the smallest. Ascending order in a numeric column would begin with the smallest number and move towards the largest. In some cases, the same number may appear in multiple rows, in the se circumstances there is normally a secondary sort column, which is used to order the entries tha t share the same value within the primary sort column. Be careful when working with numerical data columns since sometimes they are entered as alphabetic characters as opposed to numbers. When t his occurs the sorting will place 11 and 12 next to 1 as opposed to 2, as it should be. In most spre adsheet programs it is simple to select a column and convert it from alphabetic to numeric entries b y changing the format of the entries in the column. When sorting within a single column, it is also imp ortant to make certain that all of the other column s in the data collection get sorted along with the on e of interest. Most spreadsheet programs 56 http://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/oecdpatentdatabases.ht m 48 automatically ask the user if they want to expand t o all columns when sorting, or if they want to sort the column individually and leave the other columns as they were. It is almost always the case, when generating lists for patent analytics that the user will want to expand the sorting for all of the col umns. The number of times an entry appears in a list can be generated in a few different ways. A filter can be used to remove all of the rows in a spreadsheet except for the ones that contain a specified value. After the filtering is complete the analyst can cou nt the number of rows that remain and assign the number to that entry in a separate worksheet. This process is repeated for the other unique entries in the column, or field. A more efficient way of accom plishing this process is by selecting the rows and columns of interest and generating a Pivot Table fr om them. Once generated, usually in a separate worksheet, the application will allow the analysts to decide which data field should represent the row s in the table, and which should populate the columns . In a standard list, no additional columns are added to the table, and the sum of the field being used for the rows is used in the values portion of the table builder. This sequence will be reDvisited in section 6.3, but an additional field is added as a column for comparing the fields. Figure 2 - List of Patent Assignees Using MS Excel Once the list is generated, the rows and columns re presenting the list can be selected, and a bar chart can be created by pushing a chart button, or by selecting the appropriate menu item within a spreadsheet program. In Microsoft Excel, once a col lection of rows and columns is selected, a bar, or column chart is created by choosing the option in t he Charts portion of the Ribbon or under the Charts Menu Bar. At the beginning of this section, a bar c hart was described where the field entries were listed on the xDaxis. In Excel, this sort of horizo ntal chart is referred to as a column chart. If the field entries are listed on the yDaxis instead, this is r eferred to as a vertical chart, and called a bar ch art in Excel. Figure 3 shows a column chart visualizing th e data contained in the list from Figure 2. 49 Figure 3 - Column Chart Visualization of Data from Figure 2 Most of the analytics tools provided in section 9.1 include functionality for generating simple charts of most patent information fields associated with the systems. 6.3 - Co-Occurrence Matrices Counting or comparing entries within a single data field is accomplished by generating a list, as covered in the previous section. Frequently, an ana lyst will want to provide additional context to a comparison by incorporating an additional variable or field into their analysis. For instance, it is u seful to understand which organizations have the highest number of patent documents in a technical field, but more insight is gained by studying when those o rganizations filed the patent documents in question. It is often the case that two organizatio ns will have a similar total number of documents, b ut one of them will have filed them much earlier than the other. Using a coDoccurrence matrix, or table, this additional context can be readily represented. CoDoccurrence matrices are also referred to as tabl es, and are generated by placing data fields on an X and YDaxis, or within a table. The number of ove rlapping occurrences of shared X and Y can be seen as numbers within the matrix. This representat ion allows connections to be made between two or more fields of information and provides a measur e of how strong the connection is. This is interpreted by looking at the value provided at the intersection, the higher the value, the stronger t he correlation between the two elements. Most of the analytics tools provided in section 9.1 include functionality for generating coDoccurrence matrices using patent information fields associated with the systems, but many analysts use Pivot Tables in Microsoft Excel to generate them as well. As discussed in section 6.3, the rows and columns of interest are selected, and a Pivot Table is generated using them. Once generated, usually in a separate worksheet, the application will allow the analysts to decide which data field should represent the rows in the table, and which should p opulate the columns. In a coDoccurrence matrix, at least one data field is added as column to the tabl e, as well as a field for the rows and the sum of t he field being used for the rows is used in the Values portion of the table builder. 50 The same issues of sorting, cleaning and filtering apply to a coDoccurrence matrix as they do to a lis t. Figure 4 shows an example of a simple matrix compar ing citing assignee by publication year. Figure 4 - Building a Co-occurrence Matrix Using Mi crosoft Excel 6.4 - Clustering and Classification These methods are often used interchangeably but ar e actually quite different from one another. Clustering is normally associated with unsupervised methods of organizing document collections based on a similarity comparison between documents. With a fixed number of clusters identified at the outset, document collections that meet a threshold similarity component are grouped together. Ideally, the documents within a cluster should be similar to one another but dissimilar to documents in the other clusters. Classification, on the other hand, is usually accomplished using a supervised machine learning method that uses learning sets to identify key attributes of documents in a class. New documents are compared to the learning collections and assigned to a class based on their similarity to the documents that have already been assigned to the class. The following stackoverflow.com webpages provide ex planations of clustering vs. classification and supervised vs. unsupervised method s: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5064928/differen ceDbetweenDclassificationDandDclusteringDinDdataD mining http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1832076/whatDisD theDdifferenceDbetweenDsupervisedDlearningDandD unsupervisedDlearning When it comes to clustering, the two most often use d algorithms are kDmeans and forceDdirected placement: 51 K-means - a method of cluster analysis, which aims to part ition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster wi th the nearest mean. 57 Force Directed Placement - At the most basic level the algorithm tries to p lace similar objects close together and dissimilar objects far a part. The process is achieved by moving the objects randomly around the solution space via a te chnique similar to 'simulated annealing'. The criterion for moving a node is the minimization of energy 58 . Looking at classification, two frequently applied a lgorithms are Artificial Neural Networks and Suppor t Vector Machines: Artificial Neural Networks - In computer science and related fields, artificial neural networks are models inspired by animal central nervous syste ms (in particular the brain) that are capable of machine learning and pattern recognition . They are usually presented as systems of interconnected \"neurons\" that can compute values from inputs by feeding information through the network 59 . Support Vector Machines - supervised learning models with associated learn ing algorithms that analyze data and recognize patterns, used for classification and regression analysis. The basic SVM takes a set of input data and predicts, f or each given input, which of two possible classes forms the output, making it a nonDprobabili stic binary linear classifier. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories; an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples into one category or the other 60 . As applied to PLRs, and patent analytics, the most frequently used sources of text for both clustering and classification exercises come from patent class ification codes, or from raw, or standardized text coming from the source document: Classification Codes - Intellectually assigned classification systems p roduce standardized codes that can be used as a means of categorizing d ocuments that share similar subject matter. Raw Text - processed to identify concepts and phrases conta ined within specific sections of the source document, such as the abstract or claims . As with the clustering of structured data, concepts, instead of codes, are used to group docum ents that share a high degree of overlap. Indexing Terms - producers of \"abstract and indexing\" databases no rmally produce hierarchical lists of indexing terms that are used to classify documents based on standardized terms and phrases. Since these lists are standardiz ed and intellectually assigned they can be used for clustering exercises.

This is not an exhaustive list but provides some suggestions for starting with this ta sk. Contact information for these tools can be foun d in section 9.1 of these guidelines. Thomson Innovation - provides text clustering base d on enhanced titles and abstracts, using KDmeans, see Figure 5 for an example Relecura - clusters concepts, extracted and standa rdized from text, in Topic Map functionality Intellixir - provides clustering functions, using KDMeans Treperal - KMX product includes classification fun ction based on Support Vector Machine 53 Figure 5 - Text Clustering Example from Thomson Inn ovation 6.5 - Spatial Concept Mapping 54 Mapping is related to clustering or classification exercises, where the systems involved take the document clusters or classes and arrange them in 2D dimensional space by considering the similarity of the documents relative to one another over the e ntire collection. Documents that share elements in common are placed closer together spatially, while ones with less similarity are placed further away. The FAQ section on the INDSPIRE tool 61 , a related cousin of the ThemeScape tool, both ori ginally developed at Pacific Northwest National Laboratorie s, provides the following explanation of the process used for creating spatial maps: In brief, IN-SPIRE creates mathematical representa tions of the documents, which are then organized into clusters and visualized into \"maps\" that can be interrogated for analysis. More specifically, IN-SPIRE performs the following steps: The text engine scans through the document collecti on and automatically determines the distinguishing words or \"topics\" within the collect ion, based upon statistical measurements of word distribution, frequency, and co-occurrence wit h other words. Distinguishing words are those that help describe how each document in the d ataset is different from any other document. For example, the word \"and\" would not be considered a distinguishing word, because it is expected to occur frequently in every document. In a dataset where every document mentions nanotech, \"nanotech\" wouldn't be a distinguishing word either. The text engine uses these distinguishing words to create a mathematical signature for each document in the collection. Then it does a rough si milarity comparison of all the signatures to create cluster groupings. IN-SPIRE compares the clusters against each other for similarity, and arranges them in high-dimensional space (about 200 axes) so that sim ilar clusters are located close together. The clusters can be thought of as a mass of bubbles , but in 200-dimensional space instead of just 3. That high-dimensional arrangement of clusters is th en flattened down to a comprehensible 2- dimensions, trying to preserve a picture where simi lar clusters are located close to each other, and dissimilar clusters are located far apart. Fina lly, the documents are added to the picture by arranging each within the invisible \"bubble\" of the ir respective cluster. Spatial concept maps can also be made using classif ication methods. Arguably, the most famous of these is the Kohonen Self Organizing Map (SOM): Kohonen Self Organizing Maps - a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that i s trained using unsupervised learning to produce a low dimensional (typically twoDdimensional), discretized representation of the input space of the training s amples, called a map. SelfDorganizing maps are different from other artificial neural networks in the sense that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input sp ace 62 .

Thomson Innovation - ThemeScape, shown in Figure 6 is a KDmeans clustering, with a mapping of nDdimensions onto two dimensions STN AnaVist - uses Force Directed Placement to gen erate Concept Maps Orbit.com - provides concept map using similar pri nciples as ThemeScape Treperal - KMX product generates maps using KDmean s clustering Figure 6 - ThemeScape Concept Mapping for Wearable Fitness Bands 6.6 - Layering or Stacking Information Analyses looking at a single variable, or field, ca n be inefficient and lack context as discussed in section 6.3. Positioning two types of visualization s next to one another, or adding overlays to an analysis, allows the analyst to reference several a ttributes of a data set simultaneously without aski ng the client to refer back to previous illustrations. Providing additional context within a single visualization also allows for easier, richer compar isons to be made between different entries. Three examples of this technique are provided to demonstr ate the value of this approach. 56 A stacked chart can be used to enhance a standard b ar, or column chart when there is a need to explore a second variable with a small number of en tries. If the second variable had a large number of values then a coDoccurrence matrix would be used to explore these items. Figure 7 shows a stacked chart, where patent document type has been stacked within the patent document count by patent assignee. This information could have been provided with separate charts, but it is much more interesting to combine the variables, in a single c hart, for means of comparison. In this case, the analyst can demonstrate whether an organization's p atent documents are primarily of the utility or design type. Figure 7 - Using a Stacked Chart to Visualize Two V ariables In section 6.5, the mapping task was introduced, ta king document clustering, and adding a similarity metric between documents to produce a graphic repre sentation of how documents relate to one another based on shared concepts. As stated, these maps offer a nice way to identify technology segments that are related to one another. When addi tional information is layered on top of the maps they can be used to add an extra dimension to an an alysis involving technological concepts. Most mapping systems provide a means to highlight, with the use of different colors, two or more patent assignee or periods of time within the collection u sed to generate the map. These groupings are then laid over the existing map and can be used to provi de context on when technology subsections were investigated, or which organizations were investing in different areas compared to others. Figure 8 shows an example of a Thomson Innovation ThemeScape map where a few of the patent assignees of interest have been called out with different col ored dots. 57 Figure 8 - ThemeScape Map with Patent Assignee Call Outs Charts, as discussed in section 6.2 are used to vis ualize total interest, or number of entries in a si ngle, or at most two patent information fields. Tables, c overed in section 6.3 allow the examination of two fields, both with a significant number of entries. The two can be combined into a single visualization that expands the number of variables being studied simultaneously, and allows more complicated questions to be answered without needing to resort to multiple visualizations. In the example provided in Figure 9 the chart showing top assignees by thei r patenting type is turned 90Ddegrees, and placed next to a table showing the top assignees, and when they filed applications for the patents in questio n. In one visual the analyst can now make comparisons between which organizations are the most active patentees, when they invested in the technol ogy, and what type of protection they sought. Again, this could be provided in three or four indi vidual illustrations but it is easier to make detai led comparisons when the data is stacked or layered in a single illustration. 58 Figure 9 - Visualization Encompassing Chart and Tab le to Study Multiple Variables 6.7 - Geographic Representation On most patent documents the physical addresses of both the applicants, and the inventors associated with them are given. Geographic represen tations of this data provide the information overlaid on a city, country or world map along with relevant geographic placeholders, such as educational infrastructure, like major universities , or per capita income for the region. This process is also referred to as Georeferencing and is defined i n Wikipedia as: To georeference something means to define its exist ence in physical space. That is, establishing its location in terms of map projections or coordinate systems. 63 The process is carried out by geocoding individual patent documents so they can be placed within an established geographic framework, typically by usin g zip, or postal codes, but also by using street addresses. Various software packages are available that can take address data from individual patents, and supply a set of longitude and latitude coordinates for the document. A collection of geocoding packages can be found at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding . Once the coordinates for a patent document are iden tified, various Geographic Information Systems 64 can be used to create the actual map with the paten t documents placed on it. Google Maps 65 makes it application programing interface (API) 66 available for free thus making it a useful tool fo r distributing patents over a geographic area. 63 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georeference 64 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_informatio n_systems 65 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Maps 66 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programmi ng_interface 59 Recently, two services, UK Patents on a Map 67 and World Patents, Mapped 68 , were launched providing examples of geographic representations of patent data. The home page of UK Patents on a Map provides the following rational for providing t he service: Launched on 3 July 2013, this site maps many of the UK's innovators, specifically UK based holders of UK patents. The data includes links to the relev ant page of the IPSUM database operated by the UK Intellectual Property Office (IPO) where the lat est and most accurate data concerning any patent can be found. This is a service that I very much hope will be of help to inventors, patent applicants and owners as well as their advisors. My aim in placing this data into a map format (with the help of the lovely peo ple at eSpatial) is that it brings alive the potential for collaboration when you see how close you are as a patent holder to others, whether in your sphere of innovation or otherwise. The World Patents, Mapped service was described dur ing an introductory post from the Patent Information Users Groups (PIUG) wiki: World Patents, Mapped, is an experimental service t hat plots the locations of applicants on WIPO patent publications. Universities have long been recognized as key playe rs in innovation. For this reason, I am adding an overlay of university locations to World Patents, M apped. The overlayed map is at http://w.pat.tc/maptop.htm. This map shows locations of applicants on PCT patent applications published during 2012 and 2013. It also shows the locations of about 600 universities. Figure 10 provides an example of WO applications fi led for by inventors residing in Dublin, OH, USA. Figure 10 - WO Applications from Inventors in Dubli n, Ohio, USA Using World Patents, Mapped 6.8 - Network Analysis 67 http://www.patentsonamap.co.uk 68 http://w.pat.tc/maptop.htm 60 Borrowing from Wikipedia's discussion on Social Net work Analysis 69 and applying this idea to the analysis of networks within patent document collect ions, the following definition is proposed: Networ k analysis is the viewing of relationships in terms o f network theory 70 , consisting of nodes, representing individual actors within the network, and ties, whi ch represent relationships between the individuals, such as coDinventorship, coDassignment and coDcitat ion. These networks are often depicted in a network diagram, where nodes are represented as poi nts and ties are represented as lines. The two most common uses of network analysis, when looking at patent documents, are inventor and citation networks. Inventor networks, when also ass ociated with patent assignees, allows an analyst to discover which organization's key researchers an d thought leaders have worked with in a technological area. University Professors, for inst ance, often collaborate on patents with several different organizations and these relationships can be discovered with a network diagram. Their students can also be traced as they leave school an d potentially embark upon their own academic career, or transition into industry themselves. Thi s is a useful technique for identifying potential collaborators, or for looking for new employees, wi th experience in a technological area. The concept of citations within patent documents wa s introduced in section 4.2.1.5. When patent documents are examined, relevant prior art is menti oned on the search report, or on the front page of the documents. These citations provide a link betwe en the documents that can be analyzed and visualized in a network analysis. The simplest citation network diagram involves the use of a single patent document as a root node and displays the direct citations, both backwards a nd forward, that are associated with that documents and its descendants. Hyperbolic trees are used, in this case, to show relationships between patents that directly cite one another. Fig ure 11 provides a sample hyperbolic tree analysis. 69 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_analys is 70 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory 61 Figure 11 - Swatch Patent as Root in Hyperbolic Tre e Citation Analysis When an entire collection of patents, and their cit ations to one another are studied, a full network analysis can be graphed that identifies seminal pat ents, cited by many, over a period of time. A network approach has advantages over a hyperbolic t ree since trees only show linear relationships between documents, from one generation to another, but do not show relationships that skip a generation. They are also advantageous since there is no single root, which represents a oneDtoD many relationship, but all of the documents, in the collection, are roots, providing for the viewing o f manyDtoDmany relationships. While citation links exist between discrete patent documents, it is often useful to aggregate the patents from an assignee together, and create a cit ation network that shows the relationships that organizations have to one another via their citatio n of one another's patents. Figure 12 provides an example of a network graph of assignee citation fro m Orbit.com. 62 Figure 12 - Network Graph of Assignee Citation CoDassignment, or organizations collaborating toget her on developing an invention, can also be a useful and insightful exercise, but since most inve ntions are developed by a single entity, there are simply not many examples of this type of relationsh ip to study. This type of analysis can become more interesting when the ownership of a patent changes and the relationships between organizations buying and selling patents is added to the ones ass ociated with coDdevelopment. The purchasing of patents between organizations is arguably an even m ore interesting relationship then when two groups decide to develop an invention together. It is more common for patent analysis tools to make use of hyperbolic tress, rather than a full networ k analysis, but recently additional effort has been a pplied to the development of network analysis tools for patents. The following tools provide for some f orm of hyperbolic tree or network analysis. This is not an exhaustive list but provides some suggestion s for starting with this task. Contact information for these tools can be found in section 9.1 of these gu idelines. Thomson Innovation - provides hyperbolic trees sta rting with a single patent Orbit.com - provides a network graph of assignee c itation within its business intelligence module 63 Intellixir - provides network analysis for assigne es and inventors AmberScope - generates citation networks based on Network Patent Analysis 6.9 - Semantic Analysis While there are several semantic techniques, such a s latent semantic analysis, that are useful in the context of information retrieval, and patent search ing, the primary form of analyzing patent documents using semantic information is the study of subject, action, object (SAO) triplets. SAO triplets utiliz e parts of language, such as nouns and verbs that are used to describe the teachings that the applicant wants to share. Key SAOs, within a patent document encapsulate the technical learnings contained in it. When extracting SAO triplets from a document, objec ts and actions can be grouped together and represented as a problem to be addressed. An exampl e of this would be the treatment of asthma, where treatment is the action and asthma is the obj ect. A potential solution to this problem would be the use of an allergy shot, where the allergy shot is the subject. This triplet would be extracted fro m a sentence like; an allergy shot was used to treat th e asthma patient. Figure 13 provides a different example of the SAO triplet principle. Figure 13 - Subject Action Object Triplet Example f rom English Text The aggregation of a collection of problems gathere d from a set of disparate documents can be represented as a knowledge base, and can provide a variety of potential solutions even if they are not found within a single document. In the asthma examp le, a sentence in another document may refer to the treatment of asthma, but the solution, or subje ct, in this case, might be immunotherapy. Additional information on information extraction us ing SAO triples can be found at - https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/ nlp/entry/triple_extraction_from_unstructured_ text5?lang=en In the realm of patent analytics and PLRs SAO tripl ets can be used to summarize the key technical challenges in a specified area and provide an index of the approaches used to address those challenges. Portions of this activity are sometimes done manually, by an analyst, or can be accomplished using classification techniques, as di scussed in section 6.4. SAO triplets provide the additional benefit of providing solutions to the te chnical challenges as well as identifying them. 64 The I2E system from Linguamatics 71 and Goldfire from IHS 72 are two commercial systems that provide SAO triplet functionality specifically for working with patent documents. Information on open source approaches for extracting them can also be found at - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8063334/extractD tripletDsubjectDpredicateDandDobjectDsentence . 71 http://www.linguamatics.com/welcome/software/I2E.h tml 72 http://inventionmachine.com/products-and-services/ innovation-software/ 65 Chapter 7: Frameworks Associated with Performing Pa tent Analytics and Patent Landscape Reports When developing a patent analytics output, there ar e certain fundamental ideas, or philosophies, associated with conducting the work. These thoughts apply generally to almost any task associated with patent analysis and are provided at a higher l evel of abstraction than the tips and instructions associated with specific analysis. They are referre d to as frameworks since, as with a building scaffold, they provide a foundation on which more d etailed and specific analysis tasks can be attached. In this chapter various frameworks, or ge neral principles associated with patent analytics, and landscapes are discussed. 7.1 - Content Types for Conducting Analysis The vast majority of analytics projects can be brok en into two categories; those that work with data i n the form of exact strings in structured fields, and those that work with text or semantic content that is unstructured. Analytics utilizing these different s ources of content are referred to as data mining or analytics, and text mining or analytics respectivel y. Some data mining purists consider text as simply a more complicated form of data, but for the purpos es of this discussion they will be separated since the methods used to work with exact strings in data mining is different than how text is analyzed in text mining. 7.1.1 - Data Mining When analysts are working with numbers, or strings of letters divorced from context or semantic meaning, they are performing data mining or analysi s. The practitioner is generally conducting a statistical analysis of a list of items to identify patterns within a collection. In the most common form of this type of analysis, d iscrete items such as Patent Assignees or Application Filing Years, are counted, and potentia lly ranked within a set. Tools, such as a Pivot Tab le in Microsoft Excel, are looking for exact string ma tches to determine how frequently a specific value is found. All analyses in this category are based on e xact string matches so misspellings or inconsistencies within a set will be counted as sep arate values. For instance, when working with Patent Assignee Names, if there are entries in a da ta set for Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc., these will be treated as disc rete items, and will be counted separately. Since the collections of alphabetic strings do not match exactly the analysis will count these items separately. Clearly, these items belong together, a nd as discussed in chapter 6.1, the process of cleaning up or grouping these items together is req uired to ensure that an accurate count of the appropriate values takes place. Another important component of data mining or analy sis is that the material being analyzed is structured or fielded. When items are placed in a s pecific field, within a database, or when they are found in a specific column, in a spreadsheet, they are considered structured or fielded. This implies that they belong to a category of one type or anoth er. Inventor Names, for instance, are recognized as being data of a particular type and are segregated and organized so they are collected together in one place for analysis. Additional names might be found within a document but the analyst can distinguish these other names from the Inventor Names since the later has been structured by being collected into a specific field. Data mining is thus characterized as the analysis o f exact string matches contained in structured or fielded databases or collections. 66 7.1.2 - Text Mining Linguistic content is distinct from data strings fo r a variety of reasons. To start with, there is the concept of language, where a word can mean the same thing but is spelled differently. There is also the concept of context where the same word is used but it has a different definition depending on how it is used. Similarly, partsDofDspeech can be consi dered when analyzing text data, where a word can be used as a verb in some cases and as a noun in ot hers. Raw text is generally considered to be unstructured or semiDstructured since the content is not organized into categories. According to Wikipedia, unstructured text 73 refers to information that either does not have a preDdefined data model and/or does not fit well into relational tables. A patent abstract would be an example of a semiDstructured i tem since the patent abstract is a field in most databases, and there is an expectation on what type of content will be found there. The claims, on the other hand, while representing the legally binding portions of the text, can be very long and deal wit h a variety of concepts, and by nature is not structure d into discrete items. The methods and means for analyzing linguistic cont ent, due to the complicated nature of the source, is very different than working with data, so it is important to consider, and understand them individually. As an example, the following series o f steps might be conducted in order to prepare a collection of unstructured text for analysis: Tokenization - explaining to the computer where on e word ends and another begins Stemming - removing common suffixes and prefixes f rom words to generate the root of a word for subsequent use PartDofDSpeech Tagging - identifying words as noun s, verbs or adjectives Entity Tagging - using lists of items or linguisti c rules to identify a token as a type or person, organization or other type of object Term Filtering - reducing the number of terms or o bjects to be analyzed by removing stopwords (nonDcontent bearing terms), or frequentl y or infrequently applied terms, in a corpus or collection In general, when conducting analytics associated wi th generating PLRs, the analyst needs to understand whether a data or textDbased method is b eing performed. Since the methods involved are quite different, optimal results will depend on the analyst understanding the different approaches and applying them properly. 7.2 - Data Scale for Conducting Analysis In addition to thinking about data collections base d on their content, exact strings vs. raw text, dat a scientists also tend to think about data in terms o f the size of the collection they are working with. Generally, this is done since different methods are used depending on how large the collection of data being worked with will be. Most analysis that end u p in PLRs are concerned with larger data sets, these are being conducted on a macroDlevel, but occ asionally it is necessary to provide more detailed examinations of small subsets, a microDlevel analys is. 7.2.1 - Macro-Level Analysis 73 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_data 67 Also referred to as a globalDlevel view, analysis a t this scale if being performed for health care or other socially related data collections, would be done on a populationDwide level. In the area of patent analytics, macroDlevel data sets contain greater th an 10,000 records being studied. Since PLRs are generally broad overviews of a topic area, most of the analytics that go into them are conducted on the macro scale. When working with macroDlevel coll ections there is a greater reliance on computational methods due to the amount of time and effort it would take to analyze sets of this size manually. 7.2.2 - Meso-Level Analysis Sometimes referred to as a localDlevel review, anal ysis at this scale if being performed for social da ta, would be done on a groupDwide level. Thinking about patent analysis projects, mesoDlevel data sets contain between 1,000 and 10,000 records. Many of t he same methods used for macroDlevel analysis will also be used with mesoDlevel collections since sets this large are difficult to manage when recor ds are looked at individually. The computing resources and time required to perform these analysis are going to be less than what is done on the macroDlev el. Many PLR analytics are conducted on this level when subDcollections within a broader topic a rea are explored. The practice of working with subsets of a larger whole is sometimes referred to as \"drilling into\" a data set. 7.2.3 - Micro-Level Analysis Sometimes referred to as the individual level, anal ysis is generally conducted on a oneDonDone basis. Thinking about patent analysis projects, microDleve l data sets contain less than 1,000 records and frequently is done on collections of less than 100 documents. Many of the analysis done on this level are done manually and in circumstances where a high degree of precision and human ingenuity is needed to ensure a meaningful result. In work assoc iated with PLRs, detailed analysis of this type is performed in order to confirm trends and associatio ns discovered while conducting macro or mesoD level analysis. This is especially the case when co unterDintuitive results are obtained during larger scale analytics, and the analysis wants to better u nderstand the cause of these trends. Certain activities related to PLRs, such as patent valuatio n, is often best done on a caseDbyDcase basis. 7.3 - The Linear Law of Patent Analysis The Linear Law of Patent Analysis was proposed as a framework for performing patent analytics projects in 2002 74 . It was originally developed to assist practitione rs in understanding the importance of starting an analysis by investigating the needs of the customer for the analytics, as opposed to simply jumping in with an analysis tool. It has sin ce been used as a general method for planning analysis projects. The steps in the process are: Create a toolkit of analysis tools Understand the business need and the need behind th e need The need drives the question The question drives the data The data drives the tool This is referred to as a linear law since in this f ramework the steps have to be followed in order to provide the best results. Often companies or analys ts would start with the purchase of the tool and once that was accomplished, since a significant inv estment had been made in the tool, they would use it exclusively to conduct all of their analysis projects. In the suggested framework the choice of 74 http://www.infotoday.com/searcher/oct02/trippe.htm 68 which tool to use is left as the last step once all of the other parameters associated with the analys is have been worked out. The law starts with gathering a collection of tools or a toolkit. There is no one tool that can work w ith all sorts of data, and can conduct all types of ana lysis, so it is important for the analyst to have options. Some projects require semantic or linguist ic analysis of text, others require the study of citation patterns and networks, and others still re quire studying the changes that take place within t he text of a patent as it progresses through its life cycle. So within reason, given budget constraints, a suite of tools should be collected. The next step speaks to understanding the business requirements that will be satisfied by conducting the analysis. Under ideal circumstances, the analys t should know precisely what decision a business leader would be making with the analysis provided. They should also have a good idea about the situation the organization finds itself in, why the re is an issue with it, and have some idea how a preferred path forward might look. Analytical resul ts should be told as a narrative to have the greate st impact with the decision maker, and understanding a ll of the context will allow the analyst to craft t heir results into a compelling story that drives decisio nDmaking. Only after the needs are thoroughly understood can the analyst start suggesting questions, and potentially hypothesis that should be explored duri ng the course of the project. The questions at leas t can be confirmed with the decision maker, and provi des confidence that the analyst understands the needs and is thinking about ways to address them. D epending on the needs either one or several questions can be addressed. Now that the questions have been established, the e xperiments can be developed that will either confirm or discredit the hypothesis associated with them. In the case of patent analytics, experiments are designed by considering the data that will be a nalyzed. Finally, now that all of the other details have bee n worked out a decision can be made on which tool will provide the proper insight into the appropriat e data to either support or dismiss the hypothesis. The use of the right tool is often critical to succ ess as an analyst but their application must be app lied under the proper circumstances to provide critical insight. Additional background on the history of the Linear Law of Patent Analysis can be found at http://www.patinformatics.com/blog/theDlinearDlawDo fDpatentDanalysisDrevisited/ . 7.4 - Precision and Recall Information retrieval or searching effectiveness is traditionally described in terms of two measures, recall and precision. These items are defined as: Recall - how much of the useful information has my search retrieved? Precision - how much of the information that I have retrieved is useful? There is also a useful probabilistic interpretation of recall and precision: recall estimating the probability that a relevant document will be retrie ved in response to a query and precision estimating the probability that a retrieved document will be r elevant. Thinking about the issues in searching during the p reparation of a PLR, information retrieval methods usually look at precision and recall simultaneously and measure their methods by how techniques 69 stack up against both elements. Even though this i s the case, precision and recall are normally opposed to one another such that with an increase i n recall there is usually a subsequent drop in the level of precision. Generally speaking, as searches are designed to maximize recall, the results can suffer since more offDtopic references get included in the collection. In generating collections for PLRs it might be more productive to begin with creating sets using methods that produce high recall exclusive of preci sion. When statistical analysis is performed on large or macroDlevel sets only major trends or item s that appear frequently are going to be seen. Precision, in this instance, can suffer to some deg ree with these types of searches, since minor occurrences within these sets will not be seen in t he larger context. This can often be evaluated by examining several of the significant trends to ensu re that they are coming from reasonably precise references. If this is the case then it is general accepted to sacrifice some precision for the sake o f recall. 7.5 - General Skill Set Requirements for Analysts Proficiency as a patent analyst requires a collecti on of skill sets on the part of the individual performing the task. At a minimum a patent analyst should have experience in the following areas: Patent information - due to the idiosyncrasies and nuances of patent data it is critical that people who understand this collection intimately be the ones conducting the analysis. Patent information, perhaps more than almost any other dat a source, can be misinterpreted if the analyst is not familiar with the history and detail s of it. Data analysis and statistics - while most analysis tools and methods are semiDautomated and don't require adjustments on the part of the analys t, optimal results are obtained when the practitioner thoroughly understands the variables a nd parameters associated with an analysis and can modify them as needed. The results of an an alysis are also easier to understand and explain to a client when the analyst knows the meth od and how they manipulated it. Legal knowledge - while formal accreditation, such as passing a patent bar, is not required, a general understanding of the legal aspects of the p atent system, especially in a worldwide context is certainly helpful. This is especially th e case if interpretation of claim language is requires to conduct a PLR. Legal perspective is als o useful for understanding patent families and how they relate to various national patenting s ystems. Presentation skills - one of the key features of a PLR is its ability to collect a large amount of information and provide a concise report of the key trends and observations in the area being studied. The ability to organize large amounts of d ata into a compelling story and present the results in an engaging fashion tailored to the lear ning style of the potential readers is essential to obtain maximum impact. Deductive ability - the launch of each PLR is a bl ank page with an open question that needs to be investigated. Looking at each project as a new m ystery to solve, with its own unique challenges and outcomes, is required. Individuals w ho enjoy intellectual puzzles and discovering and exploring new topic area typically enjoy the deductive reasoning aspects of the analyst position. While it is not necessary for a beginning analyst t o have all of these skills as they get started, sin ce many can be developed as they train, there should a t least be an aptitude and interest in gaining all of them. 70 7.6 - General Thoughts on the Use of Visualizations Visualizations are sexy; they grab the eye of the r eader and can easily become the focus of a presentation or a PLR. They are an essential compon ent of telling a story during the presentation of ideas and learnings discovered while conducting res earch for a project. While there is a place for informed and wellDdesigned visualizations it is imp ortant to keep them in context as a means to an end, in the sharing of insights, and not as an end to themselves. In the early days of using thematic maps, as an exa mple, there was a tendency for users to focus on the maps themselves, as opposed to the process of g enerating the insights that the visualization is designed to share and highlight. This was caused by sloppiness in the creation of collections to be analyzed and subsequently, confusion on what insigh ts the visualization was providing. Just as the Linear Law of Patent Analysis provides a means for conducting a wellDreasoned analysis, a similar set of steps should be used to create visualizations th at are developed once analysis has led to knowledge. In a sense, visualizations can be thought of as the dessert portion of a meal. They make for a nice treat, and are something to look forward to, but th ey should not be providing the substance of the meal. Understanding the business needs of the proje ct, generating relevant data collections and using the appropriate methods to analyze the data are the protein and vegetable components of a balanced meal. These items may seem boring or pedestrian, bu t they are essential to provide valuable knowledge on trends and perspectives. Once they are provided for then the client can enjoy a treat in the form of a visualization that concisely summariz es the insights discovered. A recent Harvard Business Review article entitled, The Three Elements of Successful Data Visualizations 75 also provides useful advice on the generation of p owerful visualizations, including the fact that they need to tell a story, which is cover ed in the next section. The article also suggests t wo additional pieces of advice: 1. Understand the audience - this was covered in ch apter 5 of these guidelines. 2. Set up a clear framework - frameworks have been covered in this chapter but in this case the article is referring to the ensuring that the analy st makes sure that their data is clean and that they understand its nuances. PreDprocessing of data before analysis is covered in section 8.3. 7.7 - The Story Telling Method Humans have been telling stories as a means of comm unicating with one another for thousands of years. It is an established and wellDengrained mean s for sharing thoughts and ideas with others in an engaging fashion. One of the outcomes of a PLR is t o influence decision making by the application of relevant data and trends to the issue at hand. One means to share insights, in the context of addressing decision making, is to use the classic s tory telling method when considering how to structure a PLR, and especially a presentation that might be generated to further summarize the key takeaways from a PLR. The story telling method involves the creation of a story arc that embodies the following elements: 75 http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/04/the_three_elements _of_successf.html 71 Begin by talking about how things were in the past Move to how things are today Paint a picture of the likely future Structuring a PLR in this way creates a compelling narrative that can increase the effectiveness of th e report. Looking at what has occurred previous, usin g the analysis of patent information, and historica l contexts, helps to frame the question being pursued and provides motivation for why it is important to pursue the project. There is also something to be s aid for the old adage, \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it\", espe cially during strategic discussions. Moving to how things are currently lets the reader know where things stand in the present and allows for a comparison to what happened previously. When pursuing decision making options it is important for the reader to recognize the cause and effects t hat have transpired as an area has developed. Comparing what happened twenty years ago to the cur rent situation could provide key insights to help predict what possible outcomes of decisions made in the present will have. Finally, due to the inherent time lag associated wi th the filing of patents, it is also possible to be gin to predict the future by suggesting the direction and scale of effort being applied by existing participa nts or new entrants to a technical field. In many field s, it may take three to five years, or more, from t he time that an idea is developed, for it to be commer cialized and put into production. Patent applicatio ns are normally published after 18 months so looking a t very recently filed applications can provide a window into future plans. Building on the insights generated by looking at the historical data this additional knowledge can provide options for decisi on makers to consider and help identify the risks associated with the developing strategy. Using the story telling method is a good way to kee p clients engaged since the analyst is building to a conclusion that will be useful to them. It also pro vides a way to organize the information developed during the course of the project since it is struct ured to support decisionDmaking and the exploration of various scenarios. 72 Chapter 8: Preparing Patent Landscaping Reports To this point, the foundation has been laid for und erstanding all of the attributes and resources that are required to develop a patent landscape report ( PLR). Previous chapters have covered the basics of patent information, the rationales and tasks ass ociated with patent analysis and PLRs, and some thoughts on how to properly perform patent analytic s. Generating an impactful PLR takes more than a few charts and graphs, regardless of how well they have been done; they also require careful planning and adherence to the idea that the compone nt pieces are aligned to explore, and lead a decisionDmaker through a topic area for an explicit objective. This exploration, if done well, will le ad to an informed decision, resulting in a change in orga nizational strategy, or direction. This chapter walks through the entire process of ge nerating a PLR, starting with the planning stage, where the audience, scope, and objectives for the r eport are agreed on. Followed by the performance of searches, to provide data, the preparation of th e data, so it is in a state appropriate for analysi s, and the subsequent analysis of the data that will b e interpreted by the analyst, in order to provide insights, appropriate to the stated objectives of t he report. The writing of the report, and the subsequent publication of it along with the appropr iate, corresponding data, and potentially, interact ive visualizations, will be covered. Finally, thoughts on the evaluation of completed reports will be discussed. 8.1 - Planning for the production of a report Before any searching or analysis work can be done a n understanding between the analysts, and their client needs to be made on why the work is being co nducted, who will be influencing and ultimately, utilizing the report, and what it will be covering, including the time period that it will reflect. Th ese items, since they are of such critical importance, should potentially be explicitly stated in a Terms of Reference, or another appropriate document that cap tures the understanding, between analyst and client, of what the expectations are. Many organizations have internal resources availabl e for conducting patent landscaping, but others require the hiring of third parties, who will perfo rm the work on their behalf. The process of identif ying third party analysts, bidding on projects, and agre eing on timing and deliverables needs to be part of the planning process, and agreed to before the work can be initiated. While a bidding process generally doesn't occur when internal resources are employed, there is still, typically, an agreement about timing, and deliverables, which is associated with inDhouse projects as well. 8.1.1 - Selecting a Topic The selection of the topic for a PLR is arguably th e most important aspect of the planning process since it will be used as a means to guide the remai ning planning activities, and the execution of the project. As discussed in section 5.1, PLRs are norm ally requested in order to generate intelligence in support of an organizational decision. Since this i s the case, the topic will typically be based on an industry, or technological focus area that is criti cal to the decision. The topic needs to be expansiv e enough to encompass all of the options associated w ith the decision, but narrow enough so as to provide focused information that will be actionable . Another way of looking at the determination of the topic was covered in section 7.3 while discussing the Linear Law of Patent Analysis. In this case, un derstanding the needs of the business was required before relevant questions could be generated. Decid ing on a topic for a PLR is an analogous process, since an understanding of the needs of the requeste r is required in order to understand the questions 73 they have. Answering the most pressing or critical questions, generally, provides the topic for the PLR. An excellent example of the process, which led to t he selection of the topic of alternate energy technology, can be found in the Introduction sectio n of the PLR produced by WIPO 76 on this subject: Industrial development has led to increased prosper ity for many people around the world but has also led to a depletion of natural resources and environ mental damage. The consumption of fossil fuels, on which industrial development has been largely based , has been recognized as a major cause of climate change. The impacts on the global ecosystem resulting from climate change are in turn expected to lead to substantial economic losses. As a result, it is clear that new means of fueling industrial development must be found in order to av oid compromising the gains in human welfare that have been achieved over the past decades. The conti nued dependence of most countries on fossil fuels - primarily oil and natural gas - from a smal l number of often politically unstable regions is a lso troubling from a political and security perspective . The potential for resource conflicts and other political and social problems will only increase as oil and natural gas resources become increasingly concentrated in these regions and global demand for fossil fuels rises. People have turned increasingly to alternative ener gy sources as an answer to the environmental, political, and social problems linked to fossil fue l use. Alternative energy sources are broadly defin ed as energy sources that do not cause or limit net em issions of carbon dioxide and thus largely avoid the environmental impacts associated with the combu stion of fossil fuels. Furthermore, they are generally defined as being renewable sources of ene rgy not requiring the input of fossil fuels, which also speaks to their political and social advantage s. This particular topic embodies both corporate, and governmental policy matters, and provides intelligence that will be used to drive decisions a ssociated with solving the environmental, political and social problems connected with the use of fossil fu els. The importance of this topic, and the question s it looks to address are also clearly stated, and re levant to the stakeholders of the report. 8.1.2 - Identifying Collaborators and Partners There are three primary purposes for identifying co llaborators and partners to assist with the creatio n of a PLR; these individuals, and groups provide sub ject matter expertise, their endorsement of the project adds credibility to the importance of the t opic, and their inclusion provides confidence that the appropriate resources are being applied to it. Collaborators and partners should be recognized aut horities in the field covered by the topic of interest. In section 5.1.1.2 an example was provide d of a cooperative effort between WIPO, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the World Trade Orga nization (WTO) on worldwide access to medicines. WHO and WTO are worldDrenowned organizat ions specializing in health and economic concerns. Both organizations bring a tremendous amo unt of knowledge, expertise and authority to the topic being explored. By partnering with the organi zations WIPO was able to bring attention and credibility to a topic of great interest and import ance. 76 http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/patentscope/en /technology_focus/pdf/landscape_alte rnative_energy.pdf 74 Generally speaking, a partner should bring subjectD matter expertise to the topic being explored. Analysts should have a technical background and fee l comfortable working in the technology associated with a topic area, but they normally req uire subject matter experts to assist them with gaining a deeper understanding of the nuances assoc iated with a technological area. A collaborator can provide access to professionals that have spent many years understanding the details associated with a topic area. These individuals can help valid ate the findings and ensure that misconceptions are not propagated during the generation of a PLR. An endorsement by a collaborator will generate inte rest in a PLR for an extended collection of parties outside of the original requestors. This is especia lly critical for topics that are intended to influe nce public policy decisions since an endorsement by a w ell thought of partner will provide credibility tha t is borrowed from the reputation of the partner. A PLR generated in collaboration with a respected partner will generally be received more openly from groups that were not associated with the initiatio n of the project. Finally, recognized subjectDmatter expertise, in ad dition to assisting the analyst in researching and analyzing the project, also adds confidence that th e appropriate people have worked together to produce a highDquality product. Working with recogn ized experts leads to an initial impression that th e work conducted is superior, and held to the highest standards. 8.1.3 - Defining the Scope There is an excess of 60 million patent documents, from more than 100 patent issuing authorities, around the world. On any given topic there are like ly to be tens of, if not hundreds of thousands of, patent documents that could be relevant to a techni cal area. Trying to look at all of these documents would be like \"trying to boil the ocean\" and can le ad to a project that lacks direction and focus. The process of defining the scope for a PLR provides a means for identifying, and stating, the focus and direction of the work to be done. While patent landscapes provide an overview of a to pic, it is also important that they stay focused on the business need. Providing the scope will ensure that the analyses performed will concentrate on the critical issues that need to be addressed in th e PLR. If the scope is clearly stated, and agreed upon by all the stakeholders than it can also be us ed to ensure that the readers of the PLR will understand the constraints under which the analysis was conducted. In any given technical area there are likely to be many different approaches to addressing a particula r issue. Looking at all of them, in a single PLR, wou ld potentially lead to superficial research that wo uld not produce sufficient insight. With large, complex topics it is good practice to limit a PLR to a han dful of the most important technical approaches to deali ng with the stated issue. An example of defining the scope of the technology to be analyzed in a PLR can be found in a report generated by the Franklin Pierce Law Center on Prot ein/Peptide Vaccines for HIV 77 : Many strategies have been employed to search for a vaccine to combat the rampant spread of HIV worldwide. As research has progressed towards a bet ter understanding of the virology, pathogenesis and immunological properties of HIV, vaccine design s that incorporate subunit proteins or epitope- 77 http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/patentscope/en /programs/patent_landscapes/docum ents/itti_patent_ls_hiv_protein_vaccines.pdf 75 based peptides have emerged as viable candidates fo r developing effective therapeutic and preventative treatments for HIV. Protein subunits a nd peptides in a vaccine elicit humeral immune responses by stimulating antibodies to neutralize t he native virus. Though a high specificity related to HLA alleles decreases the universal effectiveness o f a peptide vaccine approach, many protein subunit and peptide vaccine designs incorporate con jugates or adjuvants to increase their immunogenicity. The purpose of this patent landscap e study was to search, identify and categorize patent documents that are relevant to the research, development and distribution of a subunit protein or peptide based HIV vaccine. While the scope typically identifies what will be c overed in a PLR, it is also sometimes necessary to explicitly state what will not be covered, or what is out of scope, in a particular project. Providing this information at the beginning of the PLR will set th e expectations of the readers and prevent them from looking for information and analysis that was not i ncluded since it was tangential to the stated objectives. In addition to looking at the technological aspects of scope there are a few analysis related items th at should be clearly stated, and agreed upon before th e work is started as well. These include the countries and time period that will be covered, if a patent family reduction will be conducted, and if nonDpatent literature (NPL) will be included in the analysis. 8.1.3.1 - Country Coverage Country coverage refers to the patent documents iss ued by a particular country that are going to be analyzed during the preparation of a PLR. The key i tem to consider, when deciding on the country coverage, is which countries are going to be impact ed by the conclusions made in the report, and which countries will have an impact on the issues a ssociated with the project. As stated previously, with so many countries to choose from, it is import ant to focus on the ones that are directly effected in the agreed upon objectives for the work. For example, in a PLR for a corporate customer, loo king to launch a product based on a new technology, the country coverage should include the places around the world where the company is planning on selling their product, as well as the c ountries in which they are planning on manufacturin g it. The countries where manufacturing will take pla ce represent areas that will have an impact on the generation of the product, in question. Patent clea rance in the countries where the product will be so ld will have an impact on the business, and so the pat ent environment in those areas is critical as well. The same idea can be applied to policy decisions wh ere freedom to practice is required in the areas to be served by a technology, as well as in the reg ions where the technology will be manufactured by the organizations assisting in the effort. On a practical note, it is generally a good idea to also include PCT documents in analyses conducted in association with a PLR. As covered in section 4. 1.1.1.1, PCT documents are a special type of patent application that can be applied to many coun tries simultaneously. The country of interest maybe included as a designated state in a PCT appli cation, implying that a future national stage filin g could take place, providing patent rights for a tec hnology in that jurisdiction. 8.1.3.2 - Time Period Coverage In almost all jurisdictions, the natural term of a patent document is 20 years from the date of priori ty filing. As discussed in section 4.2.1.3, the priori ty date, sometimes called the \"effective filing dat e\", is the date used to establish the novelty and/or obvio usness of a particular invention relative to other art. 76 It represents the earliest date from which an assig nee claims priority for their application. After th is 20D year term has elapsed, the patent is said to have e xpired, and the technology enters the public domain. This is germane to a discussion on time period cove rage since the objectives of many PLRs revolve around the application, or consequences, of inDforc e patents, that is patents, which are up to date on their maintenance fees, and have not expired natura lly. Under these circumstances, analysts tend to use a twentyDyear time period, from the present dat e, when generating a data collection to explore. For technologies that evolve quickly, or that have developed only recently, a shorter, more recent tim e period may be used. Shorter time periods are also u sed as a method for segmenting extremely large data collections, where analyzing the complete set would be too onerous to accomplish. Analysts, who want to provide an historical perspec tive, may decide to not impose a time frame on their analysis at all, and will generate one or mor e analyses, in order to highlight how an area has evolved over time. 8.1.3.3 - Patent Family Reduction Method The concept of a patent family was covered in secti on 4.3.5 where the definition of a basic patent family was listed as, comprising all documents havi ng exactly the same priority or combination of priorities. Priorities in this case refer to the pr iorityDfiling document. Due to the nature of the patent system worldwide, p atents must be applied for in individual countries. This creates a situation where a single idea might have many individual patents associated with it depending on the number of countries the ap plicant sought protection in. In some cases, an assignee will seek protection in dozens of countrie s, and thus there will be many equivalent documents associated with their invention. The idea behind counting patent documents when cond ucting some patent analysis projects is to ensure that a fair representation of the number of inventions, or the amount of work performed, in a particular subject, or by a specific assignee, is a dequately accounted for. For the most part, analys ts want to ensure that if the same invention is covere d by patent documents in different counties they are not counted individually. While country covera ge can be an important indicator of the value an assignee places on an invention, it can also introd uce a bias since organizations with more resources might decide to seek coverage in more countries, wh ile a lone inventor or small company might only seek protection in a single country. When comparin g different methods for solving a technical problem, if you have one approach with companies th at seek protection in a large number of countries, it might look like it has more activity than another approach where the companies involved don't seek patents in as many countries. The proces s of eliminating redundant country filings is referred to as a patent family reduction. Also covered in section 4.3.5 were alternate method s of generating patent families beyond the basic family described at the beginning of this section. One of the most popular methods of generating a patent family is referred to as an extended family, most often associated with the INPADOC database, and thus referred to frequently as an INPADOC famil y. The definition of an extended family 78 is a broader definition of a patent family that takes do mestic application numbers as additional connecting elements, and includes documents having the same sc ope, but lacking a common priority. 78 http://www.epo.org/searching/essentials/patent-fami lies.html 77 Organizing patent collections by some form of famil y is an essential activity, which will have a significant impact on how statistics are generated for a PLR. Determining which method will be used and consistently applying it across an entire proje ct will ensure that accurate comparisons can be made between different entities being studied. Gene rally speaking, using basic families will create larger numbers of narrowly defined collections to a nalyze while extended families will produce smaller, broader representations. Analysts must det ermine which method best suits the objectives of the PLR being generated. As an example, the use of an extended family may se verely underrepresent the amount of investment made by an organization, since many related, but di stinct patent filings maybe correlated into a singl e family. If one of the objectives of the PLR is to i dentify which organizations have invested the most resources into a technological approach than a basi c family, or alternative approach, would be better suited than the use of an extended family. A discus sion on the potential dangers of using extended families for PLR studies can be found at: http://www.patinformatics.com/blog/whyDiDdontDuseDe xtendedDfamiliesDwhenDcountingDpatents/ One alternative to the use of extended families is the One Document per Invention (ODPI) method. This involves the selection of a primary country wh ere all potential inventions are identified based o n eliminating redundant applications that have progre ssed into granted patents. Sorting the documents by shared application number can usually accomplish this. Once the primary country has been processed for inv entions the original corpus is reduced using an extended family making certain that the most recent document from the primary country is kept as the representative document. Once this is completed the extended family set is combined with the primary country, all potential inventions, set to p roduce a simple ODPI corpus. Additional details on this method can be found at: http://www.patinformatics.com/blog/countingDdocumen tsDwhenDconductingDaDpatentDanalysisDproject/ There are additional family member reduction method s available including the use of simple families, which is used by the European Patent Office (EPO), and is becoming increasingly popular. The EPO website provides the following definition of a simp le patent family 79 : All documents having exactly the same priority or c ombination of priorities belong to one patent famil y. Generally speaking, it is absolutely essential to p erform some type of family reduction, when putting together a PLR, but the decision on which method to use should be made by the analyst based on the message they are trying to deliver about the invent ive output, or level of investment made in association with a technology. A more comprehensive look at the types of patent family reduction methods and the impacts of using them can be found in the blog post provided below: http://www.patinformatics.com/blog/whyDiDdontDuseDs impleDfamiliesDwhenDcountingDpatentsDeither/ While the title of the post seems to downplay the u se of simple families it represents a thorough examination of the alternative methods, and explain s the requirements associated with a methods to enable its effective use. 79 http://www.epo.org/searching/essentials/patent-fami lies/definitions.html 78 8.1.3.4 - Inclusion of Non-Patent Literature (NPL) The word patent is included in the name Patent Land scape so the expectation is that patents will be the sole source of data being explored in these rep orts. Sometimes, however, the inclusion of NPL is required in order to meet the objectives of the rep ort. For instance, due to the 18Dmonth delay in the publication of patent documents, in most jurisdicti ons, truly cuttingDedge developments can only be discovered when looking at NPL. University professors tend to favor NPL, as opposed to patenting, although this has changed somewhat with recent legislation providing addition al incentives for the commercialization of patent technology from universities. Having said this, in technologies where the primary innovators come from universities, it is still often necessary to i nclude NPL to ensure that a complete picture is provided. While producing NPL can be potentially time consumi ng, and expensive, it is generally less so than generating patent documents. This is important to k eep in mind when looking at the relative number of documents being produced of each type. From a pract ical perspective, if it is necessary to include NPL analytics in a PLR, then they should be perform ed separately from one another. In a manner of speaking, they are like apples and oranges, similar , but different, so most analysts do not try to combine them to produce a single analysis. Again, include NPL analyses when they are required to achieve the objectives of a PLR, and they provided a richer view of a topic area, but keep th em separate from the analytical work being done on the patent documents. 8.1.4 - Preparing a Terms of Reference (TOR) A Terms of Reference (ToR) document is not a standa rd practice in the private sector before preparing a Patent Landscape Report. That is compre hensible; Terms of Reference may seem to be too timeDconsuming or unnecessary for a task that m ay appear to be clear and straightDforward. Nevertheless, as the experience from the WIPO Paten t Landscape Reports project has shown, drafting Terms of Reference before initiating a Pat ent Landscaping exercise is highly recommendable. And that,for a number of reasons. First of all, the drafting of a Terms of Reference allows the commissioning organization and recipient of the Report to have a clearer idea about what exa ctly he is interested in and phrasing it in a conci se manner. Often, the needs assessment for the scope o f the report is difficult to be made and the specific deliverables not always easy to predefine. The ToR may be timeDconsuming, but they help in the clear definition of the specific conditions and requirements of the work, namely the scope of the report, the expected search and analysis to be carr ied out, the geographical and historical coverage, the timelines, the deliverables and the payment pro cedure. The clear description of all these factors assists in the creation of a common understanding o f the expectations and the deliverables both for the recipient and the provider/contractor of the re port, is increasing the efficiency of the work and is ensuring a smooth delivery of the report, minimizin g the risk of unsatisfactory deliverables and unpleasant surprises. The drafting of the Terms of Reference for a PLR sh ould ideally reflect and follow discussions between recipient and provider of the report. That allows the assessment of the feasibility of certain requirements related to delivery timelines, pricing and the content of the report before the initiatio n of the projects, as often the lack of technical knowle dge on patent information from the side of the commissioning party paired with possible lack of un derstanding about the contractors limitations and 79 options in his deliverables cause misunderstandings and false expectations. As visualization plays an important role for decision makers, the profile of each report recipient and the questions each report is addressing are different, part of the discussion an d the ToR should be which types of analysis and visualization are preferred and appropriate for the specific recipient's needs. Moreover, both sides should know for a better planning the duration of t he preparation of the report, and also the human and time resources that need to be dedicated for it , along with the required technical infrastructure and access to specific databases. Depending on the questions addressed, and the level of understanding of the recipient of the report on IP and patent information, even more technical i ssues may be included in the Terms of Reference, such as the methodology to be followed, or the spec ific search or analysis tools to be used. An example of Terms of Reference can be found on An nex of the present Guidelines and are taken from a WIPO Patent Landscape Report on Vaccines for Selected Neglected Diseases. In general, the Terms of Reference may include the following points : D Introduction/Background information: descri ption of the technical problem and contextualizatio n D Scope and Objective of the Report: the desc ription of this part will facilitate the provider o f the report in the approach it is going to take and the perspective it should interpret the results and mak e its recommendations D Content of the report: o An executive summary may be required for the se nior management/patent portfolio management o A description of the technical area and/or prob lem may be necessary should the report be addressed to nonDtechnical experts o The types of patent analysis that are required should be described to ensure a minimum content an analysis o Additional, nonDpatent analysis which is needed should be requested and described accordingly o Conclusions and recommendations based on the an alysis and the background for the preparation of the report, as described in the \"scope and objec tive of the report\" section D Delivery description: o Various expected deliverables and delivery stag es o Timeline and deadline for each of the deliverab les D Payment modalities: o Timelines for payment o Penalties in case of delays 8.1.5 - Deciding on How the Work will be Conducted Patent Landscaping is an activity which can either be commissioned to an external service provider or which can be conducted inDhouse. The decision depen ds on a number of conditions and may vary case by case, based on the specific needs of a proj ect. 8.1.5.1 D Using external providers Usually smaller entities without specialized patent information resources and/or without a need for patent landscaping exercises on regular basis outso urce the preparation of a Patent Landscape Report to an external service provider/contractor. An external provider may also be deemed necessary if the inDhouse expertise does not cover the specific topic that should be researched and 80 analyzed or complementary analysis is needed with t he use of visualization or analysis tools that are not available inDhouse. The selection of the contractor is sometimes simply based on recommendations, a web search with comparison of prices and description of services, o r on previous cooperation with certain service providers. The same Patent Landscape Report can loo k completely different and follow a different approach, depending on the service provider and in some cases it may even make sense to commission the same report to two different provide rs in order to cover various approaches, but also as an additional quality check, foremost when the d ecision that the Report will support is important and the budget allows so. When also time allows, a way to ensure a wider choice among service providers for selection, based on comparable specif ications is to tender the provision of the report a nd make a call for tender or issue a request for propo sals (RFP). Request for proposals In the framework of WIPO Patent Landscape Report Pr oject the preparation of the reports has been commissioned to external providers due to the broad spectrum of topics of the reports, requiring expertise in patent search in the relevant fields. In order to ensure a broad range of offers from various service providers using different methodolo gical approaches and tools, a Request for Proposals (RFP) is issued every time that the preparation of a Report has been decided and the Terms of Reference document has been prepar ed. The RFP includes the finalized Terms of Reference (ToR), along with other general terms and conditions and forms the basis for the submission of technical and financial offers for th e provision of a Patent Landscape Report. Within a given deadline, the various suppliers prov ide a technical and financial offer, based on the ToR. That allows for comparability of the offers ba sed on specific requirements and deliverables, and the inclusion of certain addedDvalue deliverables. Selecting a candidate The selection of a candidate for the preparation of a Patent Landscape Report is not always a straightDforward decision. In the framework of a pu blic procurement procedure, the most common approaches are the lowest price or the most economi cally advantageous offer. Since the provision of the report is a service where quality is a high pri ority, the price as such may be important, but is o r should not be the decisive criterion. Through the e valuation and selection process it should be ensured that the successful candidate has a correct understanding of the commissioning party's needs and requested deliverables, fulfills the tech nical requirements, and submits a convincing offer that lies within the estimated budget. During the WIPO Patent Landscape Reports the need f or the definition of specific evaluation criteria has been identified. The approach followed aimed at a balanced evaluation of the financial and technical offer: 81 8.1.5.2 - Conducting the work in-house A number of bigger corporation have an inDhouse tea m with patent information professionals which can carry various names, such as Business or Compet itive Intelligence, Patent Information, Patent or IP Analytics. This team usually works in cooperatio n with the IP or Patent Law area and provide shorter or longer landscape reports to the senior m anagement to facilitate their decision making. 8.2 - Performing the Search While discussing the Linear Law of Patent Analysis, in section 7.3, it was stated that the question drives the data. The data, in the case of PLRs, is patent information, and it is collected by means of various types of searches conducted in a variety of different databases. Using the Linear Law of Patent Analysis as a backdrop for thinking about se arching, there are two elements that need to be considered, the first involves generating a query t hat will provide the right data for addressing the business question behind the PLR, and the second in volves producing the proper output and formats for ensuring that the data can be analyzed in the n ext step of this process. All of the planning behind a PLR is directed toward s providing insight on a particular organizational issue that the client is looking to explore. As alr eady described, the topic and scope are generated based on this principle, and once they are decided upon they frame the questions that will be 82 addressed with the search and subsequent analysis. If the topic, for instance, is access to essential medicines, and the scope includes developing countr ies, then the type of searching should included methods that will find patents on the agreed upon m edicines, and the databases searched should cover the countries determined to be part of the de finition of developing nations. Based on our earlie r discussion on scope, the databases searched should also include countries where the medicines will likely be manufactured. This may seem obvious or in tuitive, but it reinforces the reason why the Linea r Law of Patent Analysis is referred to as a linear l aw, the reason being that each subsequent step builds upon the previous one. Initial agreement on the topic, and the scope makes the development of the search parameters straightforward, and when it comes time to explain it to the client, easier for them to understand in the context of fulfilling the objectives of the PLR. It is also important to ensure that the items to be analyzed, in the subsequent steps, are included in the data to be exported from the database of intere st, once the search has been conducted. Different databases include different exporting options so an analyst will need to ensure that the requirements for analysis are met before time, and effort is put into the searching. At a minimum, as covered in section 8.4, the following fields should be availab le for export: Patent Assignees, Inventors, Application Date, Priority Date, International Pate nt Classifications, Forward Citations, Backward Citations and Patent Status. While it is not the intention of these guidelines t o provide a comprehensive discussion on patent searching, some thoughts on an approach for doing s o will be provided. Conducting an Internet search for the phrase \"patent searching tutorial\" c an discover additional perspectives on patent searching. One of the better examples comes from St anford University: http://www.stanford.edu/group/biodesign/patentsearc h/howto.html Another patent searching approach is referred to as \"reverse engineering\". Using this method an analyst will conduct a quick search for the main to pic in the title field of the database of interest. This will generate a few references, which are likely to be highly on target. These references are then \"reverseDengineered\" to identify relevant patent cl assification codes, database specific indexing, and other terms used by the inventor to describe the co ncept involved. As these searching artifacts are collected, another search is performed, generating a large collection of documents that are also examined for new synonyms, and additional codes. Th e process is repeated until no additional search items are identified, and the analyst feels they ha ve conducted a thorough search. Referring back to section 7.4, on precision and rec all, it was discussed how these principles are normally in conflict with one another. Precision is sacrificed normally in pursuit of higher recall. P LRs are overviews, and statistical measures are conduct ed in association with them, so recall is generally more critical than precision. This applies to work done in conjunction with a PLR where high recall searching methods should be employed. From a practi cal perspective, if the level of recall can be established at higher than 90%, while the precision kept above 70%, then the likelihood of finding statistically relevant items appearing in the subse quent analysis steps that are significantly offDtop ic is reasonably small. Major statistical finding should always be validated, to ensure that they are not coming from imprecise searching, but the majority o f the time records that are offDtopic will not be associated with major trends, and thus not seen in the analysis. 83 8.2.1 - Determining the Type of Searching to be Don e The following explanation of an approach to searchi ng pharmaceutically relevant compounds comes from the WIPO PLR on Atazanavir 80 : Of course, to find patents about a particular drug, the best way is to search for it by name. This is easier said than done with chemical compounds, and in this section of the report, the \"pre-clinical\" a nd \"clinical\" names will be discussed, along with the strategies for assembling a collection that covers the development of the compound from beginning to end. Having confidence in the quality of the collection is crucial to the subsequent analysis. When the initial patent application was made (1995) , the compound was not known as Atazanavir, which is its current non-proprietary generic name. Generic names are only applied to compounds after they have been approved for clinical investigation. It is usual also for the claims of the initial composition patent to cover not just one compositio n, but a range of compositions with different substitutions in various sites on the basic backbon e structure. The backbone with variable substituents (shown as R groups in the variable pos itions) is called a Markush structure. The report goes on to give examples of the various ways to identify all of the chemical names associated with Atazanavir, as well as the various additional methods, such as Markush and substructure searching, for finding documents on ch emical compounds. It provides a nice example of the need to structure an approach to the type of se arching needed, depending on the topic of the PLR. Searching in some technological fields, especially the life sciences, requires subjectDmatter expertis e from scientists who understand the field, and perha ps more importantly, from professional searchers, who know how to find patent information in these ar eas. If the analyst is not a trained patent searche r than assistance should probably be pursued in this practice. 8.2.2 - Determining which Databases to Use There are many databases containing patent informat ion available. A list of some of the more widely used ones can be found in section 9.2 of these guid elines. Some databases contain information that can subsequently be used to identify data in other databases that are configured to allow for the exporting of information that will be used in the a nalysis steps. The example below, from the Initiati ve for Medicines Access & Knowledge (IDMAK) PLR on HIV Drug Patents in China 81 demonstrates the use of this approach: The ARVs covered in this patent landscape are based on the generic names (International Nonproprietary Names - INN) of marketed ARV treatme nts listed by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA). In addition, patent informa tion for some ARVs showing potential in Phase III of clinical trials are also provided. The first step was to search for patents covering I NNs as listed in the USFDA Electronic Orange Book.4 As the Orange Book only provides US patent d ata, this information was used to conduct 80 http://www.wipo.int/patentscope/en/programs/patent_ landscapes/reports/atazanavir.html 81 http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/patentscope/en /programs/patent_landscapes/docum ents/i_mak_hiv_drug_patents_in_china_tahir_amin_may _2010.pdf 84 patent family searches that would capture patents c laiming the same priority and which have been filed or have entered the national phase in China u nder the PCT. It should be noted that a number of PCT applications designating China were located in the search, but have not yet entered the national phase there. These applications are not included in this patent landscape. The European Patent Office (esp@cenet) and Thomson Innovation databases were used for conducting patent family searches. Once the Chinese patent numbers were identified, the status of the patents was checked using Thomson Innovation, t he Chinese Patent Office (SIPO) and Chinese Patent Information Centre (CPIC) databases. However, relying solely on patents listed on the Or ange Book will only yield some of the patents relating to ARVs. First the Orange Book only lists granted US patents. Therefore, pending US patents that may relate to an HIV drug would not be listed. For example, the relevant patents covering the heat- stable tablet formulation for ritonavir, rito navir and lopinavir (Kaltra/Aluvia) are currently n ot patented in the US and, therefore, do not feature i n the Orange Book. Second, the Orange Book only covers HIV drugs marketed in the US. As a result, m any patents covering fixed dose combinations of ARVs will not be listed. An example of this is the combination lamivudine and zidovudine (Combivir). Also, patents covering drugs that are going through clinical trials do not feature in the Orange Book. Finally, patents on intermediate compounds and proc esses or methods of manufacturing a drug are not permitted for listing on the Orange Book. Taking into account the limited patent information available in the Orange book, further searches were conducted using keywords including chemical names f or INNs and brand names for ARVs. In addition, citation searches of to earlier patents i dentified in the Orange Book were also conducted. Only patents held by originator companies were incl uded in the landscape. Again, the patent status was checked using Thomson Innovation, SIPO and CPIC databases. Once the relevant Chinese patents were identified, copies of the published or granted patent specifications and their claims were downloaded fro m Thomson Innovation and Esp@cenet. Where possible, the key claims of the Chinese patent docu ments were translated using machine translation to obtain a basic understanding of the subject matt er covered. Additionally, claims of the Chinese patents were compared with their equivalent PCT, Eu ropean and US patents. The USFDA Orange Book was used to identify some of the relevant patents, while Thomson Innovation, and Espacenet were used to identify Chi nese family members. The translated claims were also extracted from these databases since they were required for subsequent analyses within the report. Once again, if the analyst is not comfortable with the art of patent searching, then appropriate, professional assistance should be sought. 8.2.3 - Sharing the Strategy When sharing the search strategy used for collectin g data for a PLR, there is a fine line between providing enough details to inspire confidence in t he search while not overwhelming the readers of the report with a large amount of searching syntax, and details. A practical approach is to provide a written overview of the methods used, which will be included at the beginning of the PLR, and providing details in an appendix. The Atazanavir PLR 4, discussed in section 8.2.1, also provides a good example of this practice: 85 A number of approaches are useful to prepare a coll ection of pre-clinical patents covering the same or similar compounds, even though the Atazanavir name was not yet available. These approaches are applicable even when access to enhanced content suc h as the Derwent World Patent Index is not available, and all have been used in this report. List of search approaches: Identifying founder compositions by using the SPC f iling registration found in the Legal Status field. In later documents this field is als o likely to contain the generic or brand name of the drug. Searching for key terms selected from the unique pa rts of the chemical name (\u00b1 classification codes). Searching for CAS codes in the description field. Searching for founding inventor names together with their developer company names to select potentially related documents from the comp any's holdings. Searching target key terms together with developer company names. Searching for documents that cite patents owned by the companies involved in development. The results from such searches do overlap with one another, and may also overlap with the clinical collection. After cross-deduplication, they will of ten need further review to determine if they are sufficiently on-topic. It is expected that this lis t will contain many fewer documents than are presen t in the clinical collection, because the volume of pate nts is typically lower before the discovery phase moves into clinical development. However, these doc uments should help fill in the \"gap\" period mentioned earlier, the period between the first com position patent, and the beginnings of clinical testing. The details for these search strategies ar e provided in Appendix A. The search methodology section of the PLR contains a written description of the various methods used. The breadth and depth of the approach can be clearly seen from the outlined steps, in a fashion that can be understood by the average reader of the document, but without overwhelming them with jargon and scripting. The details, important to a p atent information professional who might be tasked with updating or replicating the work, can be found in the appendix. 8.3 - Preparing the Data to be Analyzed With data from the search in hand, it is time to pu t it into a form that is appropriate for analysis. Under most circumstances, especially with large data coll ections, more time will be spent preparing the data than required to conduct the analysis. Almost all a nalysis and visualization tasks require one form of data preparation, or another, to be performed, but it is especially important for analytics involving statistical measures. The methods used and the resu lts of the preprocessing will significantly impact the values obtained in the statistical analyses. Th is requirement is so prevalent that it has an acron ym associated with it, GIGO, Garbage In Garbage Out. The following subsections examine, in greater detai l, some of the more common preprocessing steps used in conjunction with patent data sets for PLRs. These operations take place before any analyses are conducted, and don't generally require an itera tive series of vetting steps as will be seen when performing an analysis. 8.3.1 - Field Cleanup and Grouping On a number of occasions, particularly in section 6 .1, patent data has been referred to as \"messy\". In particular, there are frequent misspellings that ne ed to be addressed in the Patent Assignee/Applicant and Inventor fields, before they can be used in sta tistical analyses. General methods for manually and 86 semiDautomatically cleaning up misspellings in thes e fields were also briefly covered in section 6.1. A semiDautomated method for correcting misspellings t hat is gaining in popularity is found in the use of Open Refine for this task. Open Refine was once called Google Refine and was d eveloped by Google as a power tool for dealing with messy data 82 . There are six different algorithms provided for c leaning up data using the methods found in Refine. In particular, the Metapho ne3 algorithm does a nice job of automatically cleaning many of the common spelling errors found i n Patent Assignee and Inventor fields. Once the algorithm is launched it will provide the results a long with some statistics about the entries in the cells. The results of the cleanup can be reviewed and if t he analyst agrees with the way the algorithm performed they can check the Merge box. A New Cell Value can also be added so the organization name looks the way the user wants it to as opposed to what is provided by the tool. A full description, and example, for cleaning field s using this method can be found at: http://www.patinformatics.com/blog/patentDassigneeD cleanupDusingDgoogleDrefineDopenDrefineDtextD facetsDandDclustering/ Besides dealing with misspellings, it is also neces sary to group items together under a single name for accurate statistics. Accounting for mergers and acquisitions is an example of a case where grouping is done to reflect all of the documents as sociated with a single organization. In a similar fashion, when they are known, it is also important to standardize inventor names based on a change of name after marital status, or when middle names and initials, or multiple generations of individual s with the same name, need to be account for. These i tems are groupings, as opposed to cleanups since they require expert knowledge of external eve nts that may have taken place, which caused the change in status. Discovering these events often re quires additional research into the details associated with the documents in question, but once know the actual mechanism for conducting the grouping is performed using the same tools that are associated with cleanup. Looking at Open Refine again, groupings can be mana ged using a feature called text facets. Within the text facet window there is the capacity to manu ally edit any of the values, so grouping can be performed by scanning the list while in alphabetic order. If a change is required, pass the cursor ove r an entry, and an edit link will appear that allows the user to change the value to something different . Remember to stay consistent if repeating an organiz ation or inventor name that was used in a different part of the list. 8.3.2 - Family or Invention Reduction Patent family, or invention reductions were covered extensively in section 8.1.3.3. As stated in that section, many analysts use an extended family, of w hich the most popular is the INPADOC family, to eliminate the same invention covered by application s in multiple countries. As dicussed, the use of extended families can dramatically underrepresent t he amount of investment an organization has made in a technology, especially in the United Stat es and Japan. It is critical, however, that some family or invent ion reduction takes place, since over representatio n, based on a multiDcountry filing bias, can occur if a reduction of the set to be analyzed is not 82 https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine 87 performed. It has been suggested that a One Documen t per Invention (ODPI) approach 83 , where all inventions from a primary country, the United State s for instance, are retained, provides a middle ground for eliminating multiDcountry biases while e nsuring that investment is properly represented. The use of simple families or vendor specific famil ies is also encouraged. Regardless of the method used, the choice of reduct ion method should be clearly stated in the Methodology or Issues and Limitations section of th e PLR, and it should be consistently applied to all of the analytics associated with the project. 8.3.3 - Is Manual Review Required for Precision In section 8.2 it was stated that greater than 90% recall, and 70% precision, were required before accurate analyses could be generated on a data coll ection. Even with advanced searching tools it is sometimes impossible to produce a query that will p rovide at least 70% precision. There are also occasions where 70% precision is not high enough an d levels closer to 90% are required for trustworthy results. This is especially true with s maller data collections, were errors will have a la rger impact than they would with sets numbering in the t ens of thousands. In either event, if the analyst reviews the data ge nerated from a search and finds that an uncomfortable number of irrelevant documents, or \"f alse drops\" have made their way into the collection, a manual review of the documents will b e required. This step should be conducted after cleanup, grouping or family reduction has taken pla ce since these processes will either lower the number of documents that need to be reviewed or wil l organize them in a fashion that will make review more efficient. Manual review, under these circumstances, normally involves the scanning of titles, and perhaps abstracts, to determine if a document should remain in the corpus. The source titles and abstracts, of patent documents from most issuing authorities are notoriously vague and ambiguous, and many times are not particularly helpful. Enhanced titles and abstracts, as provided by several valueDadded database producers, are generally very helpful when performing a scanning process. Using enhanced titles and abstracts it is often possible to scan s everal hundred documents within an hour or two. Document collections with less than 500 members sho uld be reviewed quickly for relevance to achieve maximum results. 8.3.4 - Determining Which Year Field will be Used When conducting analytics, they are typically done on a yearDtoDyear basis. Dates are provided for a number of milestones in the onDgoing lifecycle of a patent application, but working with specific date s is normally too granular, so years are used instead . There are three primary year choices associated with patent data, the application or filing, the gr ant or publication and the priority filing. These w ere discussed in some detail in section 4.2.1.3. Depending on the objectives and questions being ask ed, in association with a PLR, a choice should be made about the year being used. As with the fami ly reduction method employed, once a decision is made on which year will be used, it should be co nsistently applied across the entire PLR. Deviation from this principle should not occur unless there i s an important reason for representing some analyses differently than the others. Under those c ircumstances, it should be made clear to the client that a different year type is being used. 83 http://www.patinformatics.com/blog/counting-documen ts-when-conducting-a-patent- analysis-project/ 88 Application year is used when an analyst wants to p rovide a closer approximation to when the research associated with an invention was performed , or when additional investments on behalf of an organization were being made. This is a popular yea r format for use in analytics, but there are issues associated with its use, since the analyses perform ed with this field generates a dip in the most rece nt years. This decline has to be explained to clients since it can be mistaken for a decrease in recent interest by a company, or in an area, but is really based on the 18Dmonth delay in the publication of patent applications. Many analysts either cut out t he last two years of their analysis, which is not recommended, or they place a red line on their visu alization, 18 months from the end of it, and add a note to the bottom suggesting that new patents appl ied for in the last 18Dmonths will not have published yet. Publication year, on the other hand, does not gener ate a dip in recent years, since this event occurs when the patent grants, or when the application pub lishes in real time. The advantage, in this case, i s that sudden downward trends don't have to be explai ned to the clients. The disadvantage to the use of publication year comes from issues surrounding t he length of time required for patents to grant in some art units, between patent offices, and other f actors. If only applications are being studied than this is not an issue, since almost all of them publ ish 18Dmonths after filing. With granted patents though, the path to investment can be difficult to gauge when some of the patents took three years to grant while others took five or more. The difficult y in interpreting publication year analytics are compounded when data collections contain both grant ed patents and pending applications. Analysts frequently also use the priority year when performing analyses. This practice should only be used if an expanded family reduction was used on th e collection before an analysis was performed. As was the case with underrepresentation with exten ded families, the use of priority year can create analytics where it appears that all of the work was done in a single year, since a large, extended family might all claim priority to a single, early year. Normally, large families develop over time, a nd if a reduction method such as ODPI is used than the ap plication, or publication year, is a better choice since they provide details on the timing associated with the growth of the individual inventions. Ultimately, the choice of which year to use will de pend on whether an extended family reduction is used, or if the analyst is more interested in highl ighting time of investment, or accurately portrayin g recent trends in the publication of patent document s of interest. 8.3.5 - Generating Technology Categories Most PLRs provide a broad overview of a technologic al topic area. There are often many approaches in which the issues associated with any given resea rch area can be addressed. One of the key objectives of many PLRs is to identify the subDcate gories, or approaches pursued within a topic area and provide statistics on relative interest, and ti ming for these. Before analyses are conducted the appropriate technology categories should be identif ied, and the data collection tagged, or grouped int o them. The general concept of grouping was discussed in section 6.1, along with data cleanup. The WIPO PLR on Solar Cooking 84 provides an example of how technology categories a re used: The obtained patent family members were broadly cla ssified into two major segments: 84 http://www.wipo.int/patentscope/en/programs/patent_ landscapes/reports/solar_cooking.htm l 89 Segment I - Complete solar cooking systems/solution s Segment II - Components only/also for solar cooking applications \"Segment I\" mainly comprises patent family members that were grouped primarily based on heating techniques like reflected concentration, trapped he ating, indirect heating (using steam/vapor cooking or using heat transfer medium) and direct solar abs orption. Furthermore, they were sub grouped under different components like concentrator/reflec tor, solar tracking device, heat absorber, heat storage, heat trap, insulation and other accessorie s. \"Segment II\" comprises patent family members that w ere grouped primarily based on different types of components only/also used for solar cooking appl ications, whereas the components include concentrator/reflector, collector, solar tracking d evice, heat absorber and other accessories. Technology categories are sometimes identified usin g the patent data itself, for instance, with classification codes, but ideally they should be ge nerated based on input from a subjectDmatter expert based on an industry standard view on how approache s are categorized. Using a market or industryD based approach to creating categories will make it easier for the clients of the PLR to identify with the technology, and apply it to the environment that th ey are already comfortable with. Once consensus has been reached on the appropriate categories, the analyst has a variety of methods for grouping the documents. At this point, the analyst should also d ecide whether a single document can only appear in a single category or, if it deals with several p otential approaches, be a part of multiple categori es. If documents can only reside in a single category than a judgment will have to be made on which category best represents the main focus of the docu ment. Under these circumstances, the analyst should probably refer to what is covered in the ind ependent claims to make this determination. Five methods for grouping documents into categories will be discussed in this section. Regardless of which approach the analyst takes, their choice on documen t inclusion in multiple categories, and the method for grouping the documents, should be clearly state d in the Methodology section of the report. As covered in section 4.2.1.4, patent documents are assigned classification codes when patenting authorities process them. Classification codes repr esent a hierarchical means for sorting documents into technology subcategories, and since an examine r vets them they would appear to be a good choice for identifying, and creating technology cat egories. Under ideal circumstances, the classification codes would conform to the market or industry thoughts on technological categories, but, unfortunately, this is rarely the case. Examin ers, to help segment work in a patent office, creat e classification codes, and it is a happy accident wh en they align with the business needs of a PLR client. Classification codes also present difficult ies since different patent offices sometimes use different systems, and even when the same system is used, can apply the codes at different levels of granularity. Codes are often the first place an ana lyst will look for technology categories, but frequently other methods will need to be used to me et the expectations of a client. Analysts can also populate categories by creating i ndividual search strategies for each of them. This method allows for large collections of documents to be grouped, but works most effectively when there are clear distinction between the categories and a small number of documents that would fall into multiple categories. Once again, ideally, text from the claims would be used for conducting these searches. Many analysts will generate categories on the fly w hile they are manually reviewing documents for precision, as discussed earlier, or in conjunction with an effort to group them manually. An electroni c spreadsheet, preDloaded with titles, abstracts, and the independent claims, is often used to collect t his 90 information. The analyst will add a new column onto the end of the spreadsheet, and as documents are reviewed an entry will be made in the new colum n for technology category, and potentially, subD category. When the analyst comes across a new appro ach they can create a name for it, and continue to reDuse the category as they come across additional documents of this type. The analyst will typically have spent time researching a topic, or speaking with a subject matter expert so the categories they create will closely reflect these l earnings. This approach is precise, but time consuming, especially for large data collections, a nd the analyst also needs to attempt to be consistent with their assignments, especially as th ey learn new things while conducting the review. Sometimes it is necessary to make a first pass thro ugh a set, and then revisit the collection a second time, to fineDtune and reclassify some of the docum ents. Finally, semi, or fully automated methods, based on machine learning or semantic approaches can be applied to populate technology categories. Supervis ed machine learning approaches to classification were covered in section 6.4, and semantic analysis was covered in section 6.9. As discussed earlier in this section, the choice of text used to perform the grouping into categories is critical to the su ccess of the process. This choice is also impacted by whi ch family reduction method has been used on the set. Using an extended family will reduce the numbe r of documents to one per family and the analyst will be at the mercy of which document is selected, usually the most recent, and the classification wi ll be based on what is covered in that particular docu ment. If several aspects of a broader idea are covered in different filings, but claim the same pr iority than all of this detail is lost. Alternative ly, many family members have identical specifications and it is only the claims that change from document to document. If a one document per invention approach is used then the claims should be analyzed to identify the differences between the family members for the purposes of populating categories. 8.3.6 - Reconciling Forward Citations The concept of citations was introduced in section 4.2.1.5, and it is important to recognize the impac t of redundant applications, and patent families on c itation counts. Citations are based on the referencing of discrete documents, so a recent gran ted patent may not have any forward citations associated with it, but the corresponding, redundan t, preDgrant application may well have several. An analyst can also look out over the entire extended patent family, especially if this method was used t o reduce the collection, and find that there are forw ard citations. These citations needed to be aggregated in some fashion so that the document bei ng discussed in a PLR is reconciled against all of the family members it represents. At the very least, forward citations associated wit h a redundant preDgrant application should be aggregated with its subsequent granted patent. Whil e these are discrete documents and yes, there are often times differences between them, they shou ld be equivalent. They are, after all, the same application. If possible, it is even better to coun t all the nonDredundant citations between all of th e documents in the same basic (as opposed to extended ) family. If there is a WO and a series of EP documents along with two US documents for instance which all share the same priority application number, and essentially all have the same set of cl aims (country specific modifications not withstanding) then all of these citations should be aggregated together. A series of blog posts on counting forward citation s was produced looking more closely at this issue and its impact depending on the patent's originatin g country. The URL for these citations, it is also impo rtant to distinguish citations coming from the assi gnee themselves versus those coming from other organizat ions. There are varying schools of thought on what is represented by selfDcitations compared to c itations from others, but an analyst should segregate the two, and be prepared to address this metric if asked. 8.4 - Statistical Analyses to Include Having gotten to this stage, it is now time to perf orm the analyses, which will provide the insight th at will be shared in the PLR. Everything to this point has been done to ensure that the analytics are don e correctly, and is as unbiased as possible. The majo rity of the analytics found in PLRs revolve around counting items in certain patent information fields . These are referred to here as statistical measure s. The primary methods for generating these statistics , and visualizing the results, include the use of lists, for looking at one primary field at a time, and tables, or coDoccurrence matrices, for working with two primary fields. Thoughts on generating lists we re covered in section 6.2, coDoccurrence matrices were covered in section 6.3, and layering or stacki ng information in relation to these items was covered in section 6.6. While the ultimate decision on which analyses to in clude in a PLR will depend primarily on the business objectives, and needs associated with the requisition of it, there are a number of \"standard\" items that can be found in almost every PLR produce d. This section looks at the statistical analyses that are generally \"required\" in a PLR. Once the st atistical analysis is conducted, often in a simple spreadsheet program, the output is visualized and a dded to the report. Visualizations are appealing and provide insight on their own but the analyst should not be shy about annotating and discussing the implications of what is seen in them. Analyst John Paul Nettles suggests the following when thinking about how char ts, and tables are interspersed within a research report 85 : I recommend using no more than one graph, chart, or bulleted list for every 1.5 pages of words. Visual appeal should not be the only thing keeping the rea der awake. At the end of the day, the paper should leave the audience's need for information on the to pic pretty damn well satisfied. A good example of this approach is seen in the WIPO PLR on Membrane Filtration and UV Water Treatment 86 . In this case, the analyst is providing a potentia l explanation for why a trend might be occurring, in addition to showing the trend as well : We performed a range of additional analyses around the patent datasets to examine the trends underpinning the patent datasets (see Table 6). For instance, we analyzed the average patent family size24 with more than 1 member - thus stripping out the 'noise' from patent families with a single publication. We found that for the membrane and UV datasets the average patent family has 9 or 10 85 http://repcapitalmedia.com/three-reasons-to-ditch-t he-charts-in-white-papers/ 86 http://www.wipo.int/patentscope/en/programs/patent_ landscapes/reports/water_treatment.h tml 92 members in both the membrane and UV water treatment datasets. However for the membrane-UV 'combination dataset the average family size was mu ch smaller at 4 and 2 patents for the overall and desalination-focused datasets. We also saw some ver y large extended patent family sizes (in the 'largest patent family' category). Possible interpretations of these findings could be that: More dynamic technology areas have a higher number of SMEs, who due to resource constraints may only file one patent or abandon exp erimental technology, A 'younger' technology or product would have had le ss time to develop 'mature' patent families Presence of several core product technology of very high importance for a corporate player justifying significant investment in a large extend ed patent families One of the motivations, covered in section 5.2, for producing PLRs, involved their use to enhance organizational decisionDmaking. PLRs need to genera te insight and this is done by interpreting the analyses provided and putting them in context with the issues being investigated. Providing statistica l analyses is better than providing raw data but the value of the analyst is really seen in the performance of sound analytics, wellDdocumented vis ualizations and reasoned, topical interpretations of what is being observed, and why it's important. In section 8.1.4 the preparation of a Terms of Refe rence (TOR) was covered, and one of the key items included in that document is an agreement on which analyses will be contained within the PLR. In the remainder of this section the mandatory fiel ds that should be included in a PLR are defined, an d a brief description of the insights they provide li sted. All of the listed analyses, with the exception of H ighly Cited Patents, looks at a single variable and counts the number of times each entry appears. In a ddition to lists based on this data, tables can als o be created with them. In all of these cases, an app ropriate year type can be added as a series of columns, generating a table that buts the total num ber of items in context by identifying if their occurrence took place recently or sometime in the p ast. Some of these fields can also be combined with one another to provide additional context, for instance, technology categories can be combined with top assignees, or inventors, to demonstrate wh at aspects of a topic are of interest to different organizations, or researchers, working in a field. 8.4.1 - Number of Families or Inventions After a data set is reduced by families, or inventi ons, as covered earlier in this section, the total investment, in patenting, for the topic can be foun d. This would be a single number without much context; so many analysts add granularity to this v alue by representing it using a year type. So while the analysis is referred to as the number of famili es, or inventions, it should be called the number o f families by year. The consequences of using the var ious year types was discussed in section 8.3.4 but regardless of which one is used this analysis d emonstrates whether interest in a topic, based on the number of patents that have been applied for, i s either growing, declining, or static. Technologie s can also exhibit an ebb and flow where initial inte rest wanes but then accelerates at a later date whe n a new application is found, or greater efficiencies are gained through improvements. 8.4.2 - Number of National Phase Entries The general idea behind this analysis can also be r epresented by the number of countries covered, or the average number of family members per invention. In all cases, the analyst is looking at how 93 pervasive the technology is, for instance, has inte rest only occurred in developing countries, or has protection been sought worldwide. Filing a single P CT application and designating many countries is relatively inexpensive and straightforward, but mov ing from a PCT application to a National Phase filing in other countries is a signal of increased investment, and interest. When talking about this concept in terms of country coverage the analyst mu st also distinguish whether they are talking about only granted patents, pending applications that are actively being examined, or potential coverage that could be acquired if a National Stage filing i s conducted before the deadline expires. This information can be presented by using a bar ch art with countries of interest listed on the xDaxis while the number of entries, or filings for that co untry is plotted on the yDaxis. Alternatively, if a dditional context, involving a year type, is required than a line chart can be used where the years are on the x D axis and individual lines on the chart represent th e countries of interest. These analyses can also signal the maturity, and up take of a technology since emerging technologies will not be extensively covered by larger families or around the world. 8.4.3 - Number of Granted Patents As seen with the number of families analysis, the n umber of granted patents would be a single number unless some additional context, once again, usually by year, is added to this. This analysis is particularly powerful when a stacked bar chart is u sed to compare the number of granted patents to the number of pending applications that are in the course of being examined. If total number of documents, regardless of kind is looked at, as in t he case of number of families then it is difficult to determine whether a topic area has patent protectio n in place, as opposed to the potential of having rights granted. Only inDforce, granted patents prov ide the right to exclude so understanding the statu s of the documents being analyzed provides perspectiv e on whether the topic at hand is extensively protected currently, or if it has the potential to become a minefield in the future. Adding a year typ e to this analysis also informs the analyst if patent pr otection took place ten or fifteen years ago, in wh ich case, the patents may be expiring soon, opening a p ossibility of utilizing them in the near future. 8.4.4 - Top Technology Categories and/or IPC Classi fications Generating technology categories, and their value w as covered earlier in this chapter. A chart of thes e can be used to compare relative interest between di fferent technological approaches to dealing with issues in a topic area. A simple chart of this item involves the listing of the categories along the x Daxis, and the document count tallied on the yDaxis. As stated, analyses using this field can be even mo re valuable when a table is created looking at top assignees, or inventors by technology categories. A nalysts can also examine interest in the categories by year by using a line chart, with each category represented by a different line and the years provided on the xDaxis. The document count by year is reflected in the numbers on the yDaxis. Classification codes have been covered in sections 4.2.1.4 and 8.3.5. They can be used in addition to, or in place of the Technology Categories and genera lly represent the same principles of understanding relative interest between different a pproaches within a topic area. 8.4.5 - Office of First and Second Filing This analysis is conducted by looking at the priori ty filing country associated with an invention. The priority filing country is referred to as the offic e of first filing. The office of first filing appro ximates where the invention was likely created, and provide s an indicator of which countries are leading in th e 94 development of a technology topic. Since it is coun try based, it can be analyzed, and visualized, in a similar fashion to how country coverage, or Nationa l Stage entries, is represented. This analysis is sometimes tempered by normalizing the output based on the Gross Domestic Product of the countries involved. This way, output from more economically d eveloped countries is kept in perspective compared to countries with fewer resources to call upon. The office of second filing analysis is conducted b y determining the country, other than the priority filing country, with the earliest application date, in a patent family. While office of first filing i ndicates where a technology was developed, the office of sec ond filing can provide insight into which country i s likely to represent a good market, or location for manufacturing, of the products generated from the technology. This field is visualized using the same methods used for the office of first filing analys is. 8.4.6 - Top Applicants/Assignees Applicants, or assignees, as they relate to patent documents were introduced in section 4.2.1.1. They represent the owner of a patent, and with whom nego tiations for the rights associated with the invention will have to be conducted. They also repr esent the organizations who have made a significant investment, or who have a potentially h igh stake in a topic area of interest. Studying the top applicants ranks the organizations, associated with a technology, by the ones that have devoted the most resources in researching and applying for pate nts. There are additional measures for looking at investment in a technology, but the number of paten ts applied for is a commonly accepted means for measuring this. The applicant, and inventor fields almost always need to be cleaned, or grouped, before statistical analysis can be carried out and this was covered in section 8.3.1. Output from this field is normally visualized using charts, especially bar, and stacked bar charts whe re the organization name is placed on the x or yDaxis and the number of documents associated with the organization is presented on the opposite axis. Thi s field is also used in conjunction with other fiel ds, such as a year type, or Technology Categories, or C lassification codes to provide context about the different interests one organization, versus anothe r, or when each organization was doing the investing, to produce tables or coDoccurrence matri ces. The applicant field is a popular one, and is used frequently when stacking, or layering informat ion, as was discussed in section 6.6. 8.4.7 - Top Inventors These individuals represent the key thought leaders , and innovators within a topic area. When these people patent, in conjunction with a University, th ey can be considered to be a potential source of collaborators, for organizations looking to enter a n industry. When they are unaffiliated, and appear to be a sole inventor, or part of a small, nonDcompeti tive group, they can potentially be a source for acquiring rights or expertise in a technology. Inve ntors who are associated with a competitor can also be a source of intelligence on a topic, if they are no longer employed by the company they filed their patents with. An inventor analysis is visualized using the same t ypes of charts and tables that are used to represen t data on applicants/assignees. 8.4.8 - Highly Cited Patents As discussed in section 4.2.1.5, citations represen t a relationship between two inventions. Studying them provides a means for identifying seminal docum ents that could have had a high impact on the development of a technology. When discussing highly cited patents the analyst is referring to patents 95 within a topic area that have the highest number of forward citations. This refers to documents that have been cited by applications filed later that re fer to the original document. The importance of aggregating, where citations asso ciated with a redundant patent application are reconciled with the corresponding granted patent wa s discussed in section 8.3.6. This aggregation needs to take place before any list of highly cited patents can be generated. Since highly cited patents refers to individual inv entions they are normally summarized in a textDbase d table, not a coDoccurrence matrix, as opposed to a chart. Information on the assignee, inventors, publication year, expiration date, number of forwar d citations, and the companies that have cited the patent, should be included in the table. 8.5 - Additional Statistical Analyses to Consider I ncluding Having covered the \"essential\" statistical analyses that should be included in almost any PLR, it is also important to mention additional analyses that are frequently used, and can provide valuable insight, but are not on the \"must have\" list. This section covers these frequently used analyses, and describes the organizational value of including the m. 8.5.1 - Type of Applicants/Assignee Throughout these guidelines, the word organization has been used when discussing companies and governmental entities. This has been done since the se entities have different ways of approaching and utilizing patents, in terms of their approach t o research and development, for instance. Since the organizational types are different, it can be valua ble to create groups based on them, and examine patenting activities based on these groupings. The most popular categories used to group entities are: Industry - both for profit, and nonDprofit compani es and businesses Governments - research conducted by labs associate d with a particular country Universities - while normally tax payer funded uni versities behave differently than governments Individual Inventors - people who develop technolo gies without being associated with a large firm Additional subDcategories can also be created, if t hey are meaningful for the business objectives associated with the PLR, but these are the four maj or ones. The objectives and motivations for most of these entity types were discussed in chapter 5, and it can be valuable to segregate and compare the output from these different sectors as applied to a particular technology, or subDcategory area. Some technologies might feature university, or gove rnmental organizations predominantly, for instance, which could indicate that an area is stil l in the basic research stage and may not be ready for commercialization or application. Type of applicant is normally generated by manual g rouping, but can also be accomplished by using automated methods that look for keywords, such as U niv, that can be used to group organizations into one of the categories used. Once the groupings have been made the output is visualized using the same methods used for the Applicant/Assignee field. 96 8.5.2 - Percentage of Foreign Born Inventors Working with assignees can sometimes be misleading since an organization may be headquartered in one location while the research conducted is perfor med in a different location not normally associated with them. Looking at foreignDborn inventors can pr ovide data on the country where the research was actually generated as opposed to where it was filed for. This statistic can also be used to speculate on the amount of partnering, and collaboration that ta kes place within an organization, and their researc h centers in different parts of the world. Taken in total, this data can be used, in conjuncti on with the Office of First Filing data to provide a more accurate picture of what countries are the rea l drivers for the development of different technologies or approaches to a topic. 8.5.3 - Patent Quality Indicators There are many methods, and arguments to assess whe ther a patent is of high quality. These methods form part of the soDcalled patent valuation . It is beyond the scope of these guidelines to evaluate the patent valuation methods. Neverthess, there is a brief discussion on the practice in section 10.1. The issue of patent quality and the w ays to assess it has been discussed for a long period of time and it is the issue on whether it ca n be assessed in an accurate way is disputed. It remains a fact that various methods are being used in practice to assess the quality and related value of a patent, as the latter remains an asset with ec onomic value that needs to be assessed on various occasions and for various reasons. Regardless of th e method used, it can be insightful to compare the number of high quality patents coming from differen t countries, organizations, technological subD categories, or time periods. It is important to provide some details on the meth od used to generate the quality scores in the methodology section of the report, and ensure that the method is applied consistently over all of the documents being studied. 8.5.4 - Number of Patent by R&D Spending As suggested in section 8.4.6, there is more than o ne way to measure investment as it pertains to research and development (R&D). Analysts will often look at actual R&D currency spent as another measure of interest. These two metrics can be combi ned to evaluate the effectiveness of a research program, or country by looking at the number of pat ent filings generated based on the amount of money spent on R&D. The theory goes that a higher n umber of filings relative to spending makes for an effective use of currency, while a lower number of filings suggest inefficiencies, or difficulties in translating money spent into defined inventions. This measure, of course, is nuanced and should be u sed selectively, and in context. Often a comparable with another organization in the same te chnological category, or a comparison between closely associated subDcategories will be useful fo r providing insight. 8.5.5 - Percentage of Triadic Families Triadic families have traditionally included a gran ted patent in the United States, Europe and Japan. It can be argued that there are other countries that s hould be added to the list in general, or countries selected should be based on relative strengths asso ciated with a particular technology. In any case, looking at the percentage of families that have mul tiple, relevant countries included indicates maturi ty and likely commercialization potential within a tec hnology area. 97 When looking at organizations, it is also speculate d that the ones with a high percentage of \"triadic\" families are likely to have longDterm interests in a technological area. 8.6 - Additional Analysis Types to Consider Includi ng While most analyses, include in PLRs are statistica l in nature, they are not the only methods used to provide insight. Other analysis tasks were covered in Chapter 6 and many of these methods find their way into PLRs. These methods are considered to be a little more advanced and typically require the use of additional tools outside of a spreadsheet ap plication. Tools for conducting these types of analyses are shown in section 9.1 of these guidelin es. 8.6.1 - Citation and Co-Inventor Networks Network analysis was discussed in section 6.8; the most relevant analyses pertaining to the creation of PLRs involves citations between assignees and, c oDinvention networks. Citation networks involve the visualization of forw ard and backward citations between a large collection of documents within a topic. Traditional citation analysis would start with a single patent , as a root, and show forward and backward citations onl y from the root document. Subsequent generations could be added, but they were treated a s new roots as opposed to showing shared connections from one generation to another with a d ocument that was common to both. With a network diagram, each patent document is a n ode and all of the connections, both forward, and back, are represented as edges, regardless of w hen they occurred and whether there was a linear, or direct connection between the nodes. In this fashion, connections are shown even if the citing skips a generation or two. With this type of visualization, seminal or lynch pin documents, one that get cited frequently over time, can be identif ied regardless of whether there is a direct connect ion or not. With a big collection, there can be a large number of nodes, and direct citation network visualization s can become very busy and difficult to interpret. To address this issue many tool providers will correlate the individual patents into groups based on their assignment and then use the organization name to label the node. This approach reduces the n umber of nodes and provides insight into which organizations are most well connected and regarded within a technology area. CoDinventor networks share the same qualities, node s, and edges, and connections that don't rely on direct linkages, but individual inventors are used as nodes, as opposed to patent numbers, or assignees. The patent documents are still the sourc e of the inventor data but the analyst, in this cas e, is looking for relationships, such as a student, an d a professor, between individuals. This type of analysis can also be combined with nodes for assign ees to visualize the movement of key people from one organization to another. Consulting agreem ents, and partnerships can also be identified this way by looking for connections between individuals who are associated with multiple assignees. One of the biggest concerns, for analysts, working with network analysis tools, is dealing with networks that contain a large number of nodes. The key to making diagrams that can be understood by clients is to cut down on the number of nodes th at are visible to the user. This is typically done by filtering based on the number of documents associat ed with the node representative. An analyst may decide, for instance, to restrict nodes to only tho se data points that have at least three occurrences associated with them. This will eliminate nodes for minor contributors in an area. Filtering can also be done on the number of occurrences that define the e dges as well. 98 Network analysis can be a very powerful visualizati on technique but it has not fully caught on with th e majority of vendors who make tools in the patent an alysis space. Hopefully, more examples of this type of functionality will be available in the futu re. 8.6.2 - Spatial Concept Maps Spatial concept mapping, is related to clustering, or classification, since it generally begins with o ne of these methods, but adds an extra component, identif ication of relative similarity between the categories created, to the task. The tools involved take the document clusters, or classes, and arrange them in 2Ddimensional space by considering the similarity of the documents, or clusters, relative to one another, over the entire collection . Documents that share elements in common are placed closer together spatially, while ones with l ess similarity, are placed further away This analys is task was introduced in section 6.5. Using layers in conjunction with spatial concept maps was covered in section 6.6. Most spatial concept maps begin wit h a clustering, or unsupervised machine learning step, which was covered in section 6.4. Since there seems to be an X and YDaxis on most map s, many users think these visualizations behave like a scatterplot, where extrapolating betw een the X and Y can identify empty spaces on the map. In reality, there are no X and YDaxis associat ed with the maps and the distance between documents, usually represented by dots, are based o n similarity of the documents to one another and compared to all of the other documents in the colle ction. Distance therefore, is relative, based on th e document collection and guesses cannot generally be made about what sort of document might occupy an empty space on the map. While the maps, and document organization, is provi ded in twoDdimensions a thirdDdimension is often implied by incorporating document density. The tigh tness of the clustering, in a group, or the number of documents, found in the group, will be used to d emonstrate which groups have the highest number of documents in them. On a topographical version of spatial maps this is represented by an implied increase in peak heights on the map, visualized usi ng a change in color. Many of the spatial maps, especially the ones based on clustering methods, al so provide contour lines on the diagrams. Generally, these lines are drawn based on the dista nce between the document dots. The distance between a dot and its nearest neighbor determines t he boundaries of the lines. Once the threshold is exceeded the line is drawn between the two dots. It has been speculated that contour lines encompassing multiple groups on a map implies a rel ationship between these groups, but generally, this is not the case and the lines are simply based on the spread of the documents. There are a few keys to creating good spatial conce pt maps that will be more easily interpreted by clients. The first involves the choice of words use d to generate the vector that will be compared between documents. When working with fullDtext pate nt documents an analysis of this type should be restricted to certain sections of the document, suc h as the claims, or the titles and abstracts. Worki ng with the entire body of text can confuse the system since there are sections, such as the background of the invention that are talking about other inven tions, as opposed to the one covered by the patent. In addition, when working with fullDtext, the words chosen by the algorithm creating the vector will likely be subDoptimized since there are so many wor ds to choose from. Users can selectively add stopwords to their map se ttings. Stopwords are also referred to as nonD content bearing words, and they can adversely impac t clustering results if they are included in the vector since they do not impart knowledge of the to pic area. Almost all mapping tools come with a list of standard stopwords, such as \"the\", \"and\", \"a\", a nd other nonDcontent bearing terms, but users can also look at initial results and identify other wor ds that do not add meaning to the technology being 99 examined. New words can be added to stopword lists within tools on a mapDtoDmap basis, or permanently. Modifying stopwords provides an analys t with a means for influencing the placement of documents on a spatial concept map. Finally, once the analyst feels comfortable that th e system has done a reasonable job clustering documents, they can change the labels on the map so they reflect the terminology used by the stakeholders of the PLR. Most systems generate labe ls on these maps by looking at frequently used words, or terms, especially if they are unique to a particular cluster. Sometimes this works well, but often the label terms are too generic and don't rea lly reflect the contents of the cluster. The cluste ring, in fact, may have been quite good, but a poor label may be the first, and only, thing that a client se es. If the labels are poor, and don't reflect meaningfu l categories, the client can lose interest or belie ve that the map is not meaningful. Labels can be chang ed within most mapping tools and should be done on a clusterDbyDcluster basis by examining the titl es of the individual documents with them. 8.6.3 - Problem/Solution Semantic Examination Using semantic analysis based on subject action obj ect triplets to build a knowledge base based on a collection of patents was discussed in section 6.9. Using semantic analysis to assist with the buildin g and population of Technology Categories was also co vered in section 8.3.5. The aggregation of a collection of problems gathered from a set of dispa rate documents can be represented as a knowledge base, and can provide a variety of potent ial solutions even if they are not found within a single document. Once a semantic analysis has gener ated categories, within a topic area of interest, i t is possible to count the number of documents associ ated with each of them. In this sense it is the same as Technology Category visualization. Alternately, the knowledge base can also be represe nted as problems, and their corresponding solutions, for representation within a PLR. A nice means for visualizing a problem/solution can be seen with the use of a mind map. Wikipedia contains the following definition for mind maps 87 : A mind map is a diagram used to visually outline in formation. A mind map is often created around a single word or text, placed in the center, to which associated ideas, words and concepts are added. Major categories radiate from a central node, and l esser categories are sub-branches of larger branches. Categories can represent words, ideas, ta sks, or other items related to a central key word or idea. With this method, the topic can be used as the cent ral node, problems listed as major categories radiating, or branching from the central node, and the solutions used as subDbranches of the larger, major category branches. 8.6.4 - Top Patents for Immediate Consideration While most analytics are conducted on a macroDlevel , as described in section 7.2, frequently analysts will come across patents that appear to be particul arly relevant to the organizational needs associate d with the tendering of a PLR. When this occurs, they will often call these patents out so the clients w ill immediately have some information on these document s without having to refer back to the raw data associated with the project. Documents of this type are determined to be importa nt for a variety of reasons, especially if they are coming from a major competitor, or represent potent ially valuable patents from an organization of 87 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map 100 interest to the PLR stakeholders, for one reason or another. These patents should be summarized in a table that includes information on the assignee, inventors, publication year, expiration date, numbe r of forward citations, the companies that have cited the patent, and the technology category or subD categories associated with the document. If applica ble, the first claim, or some form or claims summary, may also be included in the synopsis of th ese patents. 8.7 - Writing and Publishing the Report and Accompa nying Data All of the component pieces have now been assembled , it is time for the analyst to interpret their results, and decide on the most critical insights t hat will be shared in the deliverables to the decis ionD makers, and stakeholders in the PLR project. 8.7.1 - Writing the Report A written report should be part of the deliverables associated with the completion of a PLR project, and ideally include the following sections: Executive Summary - where key learnings and releva nt observations that reflect the objectives of the report should be shared. This may be the only section that is read in any detail, so it should include all of the major findi ngs. Introduction - should provide a legend, or key to how the PLR is organized and demonstrate the major sections of the report to the reader. Background on the Technology - a brief description of the technological topic area being studied. This section should also include a definit ion of the various subcategories used in the PLR, if any have been identified. Background on Patents - most readers, especially e xecutives, will have limited experience with patents and patent information, a brief descri ption of this area, similar to the backgrounder provided with these guidelines, should be included. Justifications for Creating PLR - The objectives a nd goals for creating the PLR should be clearly stated at the beginning of the documents si nce they will provide the lens through which the reader should consider the remainder of the doc ument. Economics Associated with the Topic - regardless o f the potential humanitarian purposes behind a PLR, there is always a financial component associated with any key organizational decision. Some basic information about the economic s behind the industry, or topic area provides important context for the report. Methodology - There are four issues which should b e covered here: o Search Strategy - as discussed in section 8.2 o Data Preprocessing - as discussed in section 8.3 o Analysis, or Task Methods Used - as discussed in s ections 8.4D8.6, and introduced in chapter 6 o Issues and Limitations - there are always assumpti ons made, and disclosures that should be shared, about the availability, and use o f patent data, and how it's interpreted. These should be covered here. Analysis section - relevant charts, tables and ass orted analytics, along with detailed commentary, on the insight and implications of the data. 101 Additional Resources - other sources that the read er can use to discover additional information, and gain insight from others on the to pic. Conclusions - a summary of the major findings and insights, along with recommendations for action, associated with the objectives, and topic o f the report. Most PLRs are 20D40 pages long, when provided in lo ng form, which should include all critical charts and tables. As discussed in section 5.2, the main p urpose of a PLR should be to assist with organizational decisionDmaking and should help an e xecutive or manager come to an informed decision quickly. A balance must be established bet ween a report that has too much detail, and may not be read, and one that does not provide enough i nsight, and thus is not useful for decisionDmaking. 8.7.2 - Publishing the Report and Accompanying Data The manner in which the PLR is delivered to the sta keholders is one of the items that should be agreed to while the project is being planned, and b efore any of the work is initiated. In section 5.2. 1 there was also some discussion on the learning styl es associated with the intended audience for the PLR, and this should be taken into consideration wh en deciding whether a long form written document or a presentation style deliverable is appropriate. Detail oriented decision makers will almost always want to see a long form written document, while an intuitive thinker will appreciate the abbreviated style of a presentation document. These are guidelines for Patent Landscape Reports, and with report in the name the expectation is that there will be a report generated in associatio n with the project. In some circumstances, the repo rt will be the sole deliverable, but in many instances analysts will also provide the data used to genera te the analyses conducted. If available, analysts may also decide to load the data into an interactive visualization tool, which will allow the readers to explore the environment as well. While the analyst is the key driver in providing insight some users, esp ecially the analytical thinkers, will appreciate ha ving access to tools and data to ponder on their own. Ma ny of the analysis tools mentioned in section 9.1 provide \"reader\" or simplified versions of their to ol that can be configured for use by an endDuser. 8.7.2.1 - Published Reports PLRs can be produced in a variety of different writ ten formats. For the purposes of these guidelines, the written formats have been divided into long for m, and presentation styles. The overwhelming favorite for long form documents i s the use of the Portable Document Format or PDF. Originally developed by Adobe the PDF format a llows the creation of stylized long form documents that can be viewed on almost any computer platform. They are the preferred long form output since they will look, and print the same way , regardless of what system the eventual reader is using. Wikipedia describes the PDF 88 document as follows: Portable Document Format (PDF) is a file format use d to represent documents in a manner independent of application software, hardware, and operating systems. Each PDF file encapsulates a complete description of a fixed-layout flat documen t, including the text, fonts, graphics, and other information needed to display it. In 1991, Adobe Sy stems co-founder John Warnock outlined a system called \"Camelot\" that evolved into PDF. 88 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_For mat 102 Word processing programs, including MS Word are oft en used to generate PLRs, since it is relatively easy to review, and track changes with these applic ations, but they are not used as frequently for sharing the final long form document. Often differe nt word processing programs, and even different versions of the same application, will display resu lts differently from one another. Word processing programs can be used, but the analyst should be awa re that formatting and breaks might not transfer as anticipated to other readers of the report. Some analysts also decide to create webDbased versi ons of their long form documents. An example of this type of PLR can be found at: http://www.patentlens.net/daisy/adjuvants/Introduct ion.html Creating a webDbased version of a PLR is supposed t o offer some of the same benefits as using a PDF document, with regards to retained formatting, but there can be issues with compatibility and interpretation between different browser applicatio ns. The primary advantage of a webDbased report is that extensive reports can be broken into sections, as opposed to downloading a single large document, to speed viewing and sharing. The drawbac k though is that a reader will need to have continuous Internet access to keep accessing the re port since there is not, ordinarily, an offDline method for reading if the webDbased report is the o nly one provided. Presentation style deliverables of PLRs are conside red to be a little less formal, and appeal more to intuitive thinkers, but they can be used effectivel y to produce directed outputs that speak specifical ly to the objectives of the project. In many circumsta nces, analysts will also be asked to present on the key results of a PLR, regardless of whether a long form document is generated, and thus will also be producing a presentation style document. While there are many presentation applications avai lable, MS PowerPoint is the overwhelming standard, and will likely be used for sharing with others. Some analysts may feel more comfortable generating slides in other programs, but eventually these will probably need to be exported, and vetted in PowerPoint format. Creating effective PowerPoint presentations is an a rt in itself, and will not be covered extensively i n these guidelines. There are many who feel that slid e presentations should follow the 10/20/30 rule 89 , or ten slides, twenty minutes and 30 point font, wh en producing content, but this rule is not particul arly effective unless a true executive summary is being given. When a presentation style document is the primary deliverable for a PLR then many more slides and an appendix will often be used. The primary points are made using representative slides, while background and supporting data slides are placed in the appendix where they can be quickly, and easi ly be referred to, if needed. 8.7.2.2 - Published Data Analytical thinking stakeholders in a PLR will appr eciate being given access to the data used to creat e the analyses associated with a project. This is esp ecially the case when the PLR was produced by a thirdDparty doing work on behalf of another organiz ation. Under these circumstances, the analyst should provide only the postDprocessed, value added data for delivery to the client. Raw data should never be provided, since it will not lead to result s that are reproducible. While data is generally provided to allow users to address different questi ons, and explorer unanticipated circumstances, it i s also used to evaluate the analytic methods of the a nalyst. As such, a different analyst should be able to reproduce the results if provided with the same data. 89 http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2005/12/the_102030_rule .html 103 Data can be shared in several ways but is almost al ways provided as a file from a commercial spreadsheet application, such as MS Excel. Database files, including MS Access, or SQL are also provided on occasion. A good example of a WIPO docu ment that includes the appropriate data access in a MS Excel file can be found at: http://www.wipo.int/patentscope/en/programs/patent_ landscapes/reports/vaccines.html 8.7.2.3 - Published Visualizations While there are charts and tables included in the l ong form, or presentation style representations of the written report, an analyst can provide addition al functionality to the data associated with a topi c if they use static, or interactive visualizations in c onjunction with it. Interactive visualizations, in particular, allow the reader to explore the data th emselves, and explore new questions, which may not have been identified when the objectives for the PL R were first established. Static visualizations, normally large, highDresolution images of very deta iled maps and network diagrams can be posted to a data repository, or website associated with the p roject, especially when the primary deliverable is a long form report, since these images may not be abl e to read easily in the document. A good example of a WIPO document that provides int eractive visualizations associated with a PLR can be found at: http://www.wipo.int/patentscope/en/programs/patent_ landscapes/reports/atazanavir.html 8.8 - Evaluating the Report Once a PLR is delivered, the clients will evaluate it. The ultimate validation for an analyst is to le arn that the organization implemented the recommendatio ns suggested by them, and this resulted in a successful outcome that followed the reasoning prop osed. An analyst will also know if their project was successful if the clients, or perhaps more impo rtantly, their associates, return to them with additional work. Word travels quickly when a critic al decisionDmaking resource is discovered. Some organizations, especially governmental ones, w ill put more formal evaluation criteria in place. WIPO, for instances uses the following criteria for evaluating the PLR projects that they have contracted out for: The key purpose of the evaluation was to assess whe ther the Project provided the right type of support in the right way based on four main evaluat ion criteria: Relevance: The extent to which project objectives w ere consistent with beneficiaries' requirements, member countries' needs, global prior ities and policies. Efficiency: How economically inputs (e.g. funds, e xpertise, and time) were converted into results (\"value for money\"). Effectiveness: The extent to which objectives were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Sustainability: assesses the likelihood of continu ation of project benefits after the assistance has been completed. Formal evaluation documents may include the followi ng sections as well: 104 Findings and Assessments - detailed discussion on the evaluation criteria and how they were applied to the particular project Recommendations - key learnings that the organizat ion can apply to future work conducted Conclusions - discussion on whether the project wa s successful and what impact it had on the organizational objectives Once again, the most critical evaluation criteria a re whether the PLR was read, and acted on by the organization. 105 Chapter 9: Third-Party Analysis Tool, Patent Databa se and Report Production Providers Lists of analysis tool providers, patent databases, and contractors, available to conduct work, or provide services associated with PLRs, can be found in the sections below.

http://www.ipDpragmatics.com/landscaping TechInsights - http://www.techinsights.com/servicesDandDsolutions/ Chapter 10: Additional Topics Related to the Strate gic Use of Patent Information but Not Covered in Guidelines As seen in section 4.4, there are reports, other th an Patent Landscape Reports (PLRs), which take advantage of patent information as their primary da ta source. In a similar fashion, while PLRs are key instruments for the formation of organizational str ategy, they are not the only tools used to develop one. This is especially the case in industries that are technologically focused, and require an alignment of a patent strategy with the corporate g oals of the participating players. This chapter provides some background, and referenc es associated with additional topics that involve the analysis of patent information for the developm ent of organizational strategy. These guidelines ar e focused on the use of patent analytics to generate PLRs, but the following coverage of additional topics that incorporate patent analytics are provid ed for reference. 10.1 - Patent Valuation In essence, there are two philosophies associated w ith the valuation of patent documents. One is based primarily on economic and market driven princ iples, while the other focuses more on the scope of the claims associated with the patent of interes t. In a blog post on the Seeking Alpha site 90 , an organization called Markman Advisors provided the f ollowing assessment of the two approaches. The economic or market driven approaches include th e following: One is a cost-based approach , which seeks to capture the value of a patent by e stimating the cost of replacing the patented technology with another technology. By calculating the total costs of developing the patented technology economi sts usually arrive at a very limited value, one that is exclusively based on a single factor - cost. Second, some valuation experts use a market-based approach that values a patent by comparing it with other transactions that involve s imilar patents. However, if no similar transactions are available, this approach is of lit tle use. In a third model, use of an income-based approach values a patent on the basis of the future income derived from utilizing the patented technolo gy. Essentially the present value of a patent is derived from future income, taking into a ccount the net cash flow (extra cash earned due to patented technology), the duration of income , and the discount rate, factoring in inflation, risk, interest rates, etc. Finally, the option-based approach is based on the option pricing theory developed fo r use in pricing financial options. It takes into account th e value of the options involved in the R&D projects that lead to patents, the choices made in the prosecution of the patent, as well as in the post-grant phase of patent commercialization. E ssentially you can think of the patent filing process or commercialization of the underlying inve ntion as a series of call options (the right to buy at a future date) and abandoning the patent or terminating the R&D project as a put option. Needless to say, this is an extremely compl icated method for valuing patents and in many ways is unrealistic. 90 http://seekingalpha.com/article/1540362-investor-f riendly-patent-monetization-a- marathon-not-a-sprint 110 They contrast these methods with the prosecution hi story based methods by saying: The takeaway is that such valuation methods are bas ed on the success of the underlying protected technology. They don't take into account the fundam ental meaning of a patent - not the affirmative right to practice (e.g., make, use or sell) the pro tected invention, but the right (derived from Artic le 1, Section 8, Clause 8 of the U.S. Constitution) to ex clude others from practicing the patented invention . This exclusion concept of patents is what different iates patents from a frequently compared-to real property right, where the right to exclude ensures the right to use. More can be read on Markman Advisors' thoughts on t he exclusionary nature of patents and it's impact on their potential value at the site referen ce provided. The next section also provides examples of the use of file wrapper analysis, inclu ding a discussion of potential claim scope, and the ir application to patent valuation. 10.2 - Prosecution history or file wrapper analysis The topic of prosecution histories, and file wrappe rs was introduced in section 4.3.1. While the primary use of a file history is to understand how the claims of a patent document developed during the prosecution process, there is also additional i nformation contained in the file that can assist wi th the determination of potential value associated wit h a patent document, and its associated portfolio family. While the US is used as an example below, t he same principles can be applied to analyzing the prosecution history of almost any document from any patenting authority that makes it patent register publically available. Public PAIR 91 is the USPTO system for allowing any interested pa rty to look at the prosecution history associated with a granted United States Patent or a published preDgrant application. The information in PAIR is also referred to as a file wrapper (or f ile history) for a particular patent application. P rior to 2002 (or thereabouts) this information could only b e obtained by going to the Public Search Room at the USPTO, or ordering a copy of the file history f rom a variety of different agencies. This was a reasonably expensive process since the various agen cies (including the USPTO) charged for file wrappers by the page, and there was traditionally n o away of knowing how many pages the document might be in the first place or deciding that you re ally only wanted to see some of the more critical documents, as opposed to the entire wrapper. This all changed when the USPTO began making the fi le wrappers available electronically through Public PAIR. With this information more readily ava ilable it is easy for anyone interested in a patent to look at the course it took during prosecution. Look ing at this information in detail can also help analysts decide how valuable a patent could be base d on a number of different criteria that can be investigated in Public PAIR. To help new analysts familiarize themselves with US Public PAIR an infographic was developed, which looks at the various tabs in PAIR, and points out the portions of the system that can be used to help identify the potential value of an individual US patent application. The infographic can be downloaded from the URL below: http://www.patinformatics.com/wpDcontent/uploads/20 13/01/Look_For_In_Public_PAIR.png Public PAIR is organized using a tab interface, and the infographic goes through the following tabs in some detail: 91 http://portal.uspto.gov/pair/PublicPair/ 111 Application Data Continuity Data Patent Term Adjustment Display References Image File Wrapper By going through each of these sections an analyst can provide a prosecution level analysis of the potential value of a patent. Additional discussion on the details on this proces s can be found at Mapping patents to products It can often be useful to identify the patents asso ciated with specific products produced by an organization. A recent survey 92 suggests that 60% of the triadic patents owned by an organization are commercialized in some fashion. The percentage of p atents commercialized decreases as the size of the organization increases, so very large companies only use about 20% of their portfolios, but understanding which products are covered, and which ones are not is a critical corporate exercise. The following blog post from Innography 93 further explains this practice, and provides some rationale for why an organization would go through this exerc ise. The business world runs on products. Profits and lo sses, revenue forecasts, and product offerings are all the lifeblood of a company and they're all driv en by products. It should come as no surprise, then , that you would want to protect your products with p atented technology \u2014 but it turns out there is more to it than just protection. With a patent to product mapping, you could start a ssigning a true value to patents. With that improved capability you have a greater capacity to maximize the return on your intellectual property investment. That's because you would have a better understandin g of which patents are your most valuable and which have very little value. If you could tie your patents to your products the actual assessment cou ld be performed with greater accuracy and precision, w hich in turn could help you: Understand whether or how much to prune your portfo lio because you could tie it more directly to your balance sheet Gain insight into new licensing opportunities Determine how to direct future R&D investments 92 http://www.rieti.go.jp/jp/publications/dp/09e011.p df 93 http://www.innography.com/blog/?p=18 112 Enhance your existing capability to manage protect and exploit your patents An additional application of this practice occurs w hen organizations file US Continuation Applications in order to create new claims, which expressly cove r new products, from competitors, as they enter the market that may incorporate a patented technolo gy. It is common practice, with many inventions; to alw ays have at least one application pending in the United States so additional claims can be written b y filing Continuation, or Divisional applications. Once the last pending application has issued (with the fees being paid) the door closes for the filing of new claims by these routes. It is also a sign of good patent strategy when a co mpany follows this practice since it allows them to shape their claims to cover new entrants to their f ield. This is possible since in the definition of a Continuation application 94 it expressly says, \"Ielipsis where an applicant may not h ave exhausted all useful ways of claiming different embodiments of the inven tion\". In this case the applicant is writing claims on dif ferent embodiments based on what they see being developed or marketed by a competitor, as they ente r the space. Additional discussion on the process of claim shaping and the mapping of new claims to c over a competitor's products can be found at the URL below: http://www.patinformatics.com/blog/patentDstrategyD lessonDshapingDpatentDclaimsDtoDmatchDchangingD markets/ 10.4 - Litigation analysis The reality of patent monetization is that in order to be taken seriously it is sometimes necessary to engage in litigation over patent infringement. The threat of legal action is sometimes required even when the goal of the patent owner is to engage in a negotiation for a reasonable license to the technology developed. Understanding the patent liti gation environment, and how it operates is a key requirement for organizations who intend to operate in technology driven industries. Both PriceWaterhouseCoopers, and RPX provide litiga tion reports that provide data on the filing of patent related lawsuits in the United States. The l anding page for the 2013 PWC report 95 provides the following rationale for generating this data: Prior to 2012, only three patent cases eclipsed the $1 billion mark in damages awarded. But last year alone, three cases, tried before juries in separate districts, resulted in awards of $1 billion or gre ater. Additionally, NPEs continued to play a significant and growing role in patent litigation in 2012. Our analysis shows a significant disparity in median da mages awarded to NPEs versus practicing entities. Over the last 12 years, the median damages award fo r NPEs has averaged twice the median award for practicing entities. The AIA also made an impact in 2012. The 'anti-join der' provision of the AIA, which constrained the number of defendants that could be named in a singl e lawsuit, resulted in an increase in the overall number of suits, particularly those filed by NPEs. The AIA also largely ended the phenomenon of false marking 'qui tam' actions that had become so preval ent in 2010 and early 2011. 94 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuing_patent_app lication 95 http://www.pwc.com/us/patentlitigation2013 113 Recognizing these developments and business and civ ic leaders' continuing deep interest in intellectual property matters, PwC maintains a data base of damages awards and other case information related to identified patent infringeme nt decisions. We collect data related to patent hol der success rates, time-to-trial statistics, jury versu s bench comparisons, and practicing versus non- practicing entity (NPE) statistics from 1995 throug h 2012. This year's study also includes statistics by judge. Our analysis yields a number of observations that can help executives, legislators, and litigators assess their patent enforcement or defen se strategies, as well as the impact of NPEs. RPX Corp 96 is a defensive aggregator, which in the world of p atent monetization is a company that acquires patent assets so they can't be used agains t their member companies. They describe themselves by saying: Any company that uses technology in its products or services today faces a steadily increasing threat of patent litigation. That threat is already costin g operating companies more than $10.9 billion per y ear in legal costs and lost productivity. RPX is changing this equation. Our market-based sol ution dramatically reduces patent-related costs for client companies by sharing risk across our net work. We aggregate capital from annual subscription fees to acquire dangerous patents and patent rights, with each RPX client receiving a license to every asset we own. As the network conti nues to grow and our service offerings expand, we are removing progressively more high-threat pate nts - and more high-cost risk - from the operating ecosystem. The result: strong, broad-based defense against was teful patent litigation and dramatically lower operating costs and financial risk for our clients. Beginning in 2012, RPX began compiling statistics o n patent litigation in the United States 97 . The introduction of the 2012 report provides the reason ing for why they believe this is an important endeavor: In 2012, patent monetization, including that by non -practicing entities (NPEs), once again made significant headlines. Despite the increasing promi nence of patent monetization and the role NPEs play, limited information regarding the industry ex ists. With this in mind, RPX has decided to produce an annual report (this is the first) that includes comprehensive data on cases filed by NPEs. RPX hopes that an annual report will provide much neede d transparency into significant economic activities that have long fallen under the radar. Studying and following the litigious nature of a pa rticular competitor, or industry should be a key component when developing a patent strategy. 10.5 - Predictive models Various models have been generated that use patent information to predict future behavior of one type or another. One of the most famous uses US mai ntenance data to predict how valuable patents are, compared to one another, and how valuable a re cently granted patent might become. This 96 http://www.rpxcorp.com 97 http://www.rpxcorp.com/siteFiles/SiteManager/0BF995 E82CFF591EE80EFE8AC69259E7.pdf 114 method is patented itself, and the mechanism for bu ilding the model can be found in the abstract of US 7,657,476 : A method and system for valuing patent assets based on statistical survival analysis. An estimated value probability distribution curve is calculated for an identified group of patent assets using statistical analysis of PTO maintenance fee records . Expected valuations for individual patent assets are calculated based on a the value distribution cu rve and a comparative ranking or rating of individual patent assets relative to other patents in the group of identified patents. Patents having the highest percentile rankings woul d be correlated to the high end of the value distribution curve. Conversely, patents having the lowest percentile rankings would be correlated to the low end of the value distribution curve. Advant ageously, such approach brings an added level of discipline to the overall valuation process in that the sum of individual patent valuations for a give n patent population cannot exceed the total aggregate estimated value of all such patents. In this manner, fair and informative valuations can be provided based on the relative quality of the patent asset in question without need for comparati ve market data of other patents or patent portfolios, and without need for a demonstrated (or hypothetical) income streams for the patent in question. Estimated valuations are based simply on the allocation of a corresponding portion of the overall patent value \"pie\" as represented by each p atents' relative ranking or position along a value distribution curve. Theoretically, a model can also be built based on t he likelihood that an assignee will allow a patent to be abandoned by not paying a maintenance fee at som e point during the life of the document. By studying the past history of an organization it is possible to predict what their future behavior will likely be. Equipped with this information predictions can be made about when a technology of interest might enter the public domain and be used by others.

These activities involve the preparatio n of PLRs on topics which are relevant for developi ng countries, the promotion of patent analytics and th e advanced exploitation of patent information in developing countries. The present PLR on palm oil related technologies is prepared in collaboration with the Intellectual Property Organization of Malaysia (MyIPO) and the P alm Oil Board of Malaysia (MPOB). The palm oil industry is an essential part of Malaysia's economy and plays an important role also for other economies in SouthDEast Asia, Latin America and Afr ica. The global patent landscape report in the area of palm oil technologies will be paired with t he patenting applications filed in Malaysia, with t he support of the Malaysian Intellectual Property Offi ce (MyIPO). Following the completion of the patent landscape re port, a regional seminar is envisaged to be organized in Malaysia with the participation of pub lic and private sector institutions from Malaysia a nd other countries of the region (e.g. Philippines, In donesia) working in the area of palm oil to inform them about the IP perspective of palm oil, share th e results of the report with them, but also explore potential research and technology transfer possibil ities. The national stakeholders in Malaysia which should be involved in the seminar will be identifie d with the help of MyIPO and the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. The report is intended to be used for awaren essDraising on and use of patent information and patent analytics as tool for business intelligence and strategic planning of development and investment in research. A separate patent landscape report on palm oil cove ring the national patenting activity in the Philippines is planned to be carried out by the Phi lippines Intellectual Property Office (IPOPHL). Thi s data will be compared to the global patent landscap e report and can also serve stakeholders in the field of palm oil in Malaysia to identify potential partners. 123 1. Purpose of the RFQ/RFP I. SCOPE OF THE PROJECT Palm oil is the highestDyielding vegetable oil crop , and palm oil produced from its seeds is an important and sustainable source both for food and biofuel, and other products. This report aims to investigate the patenting activity related to techn ologies in the following areas: a) Production of pa lm oil, i.e. growing and harvesting the fruit, process ing of the fruit, crude palm oil, refining of the o ils. Both, technologies related to palm oil derived from the mesocarp of the fruit and palm kernel oil derived from the fruit kernel will be covered. b) T reatment of waste from palm oil production, extraction of phytonutrients, utilization of palm bioDmass and /or byDproducts generated by the palm oil for food and beverage, cosmetics, biofuel and other areas of industry. The landscape report will research inventions discl osed in patent publications (for the purpose of the present ToR, the term \"patent\" includes both patent s and utility models). Some nonDpatent literature should also be researched and analyzed. The report should describe patterns and trends of p atenting activities by including a standard statistical analysis of the search results, e.g. th e key commercial and institutional innovators and patent right owners, their collaborations, the geog raphy of the origin of their innovations (priority countries, offices of first filing) and the geograp hical extent of protection they seek (offices of se cond filing), the patent activity over time, distributio n of patenting activity by category of technology e tc . Patenting activity of research institutes and unive rsities, as well as collaborations among them and between them and private sector entities should be analyzed and highlighted separately. In particular, the terminology used for writing the report and cat egorizing the technologies should be consistent wit h the respective terminology used by the institutions active in the field. The final patent dataset will be made available in Excel format, while each patent family will be hyperlinked to the full publication on ESPACENET, i n order to provide access of the readers to the related family information and available legal stat us of family members. The report will not focus on aspects of validity of protection or freedomDtoDoperate, i.e. it will not investigate whether a patent that has been granted for a particular patent application has entered int o force or is still valid. Claims need only be used a s general guidance as to what types of subject matt er is claimed as invention. However, in order to asses s coarsely the level of innovation of applications, it will be researched, for each patent family, whether the family comprises at least one publication of a granted patent (based on the publication kind codes of patent family members). A further, important objective of the report is to serve as an instructive example of how specific technical subject matter can be researched in exist ing patent databases. A comprehensive explanation of the applied search strategy, includi ng the challenges and limitations of the search, along with well documented and thereby repeatable s earch queries, will be essential components of the report (see 3.4). 2. List of services Preparation and delivery of a highDquality patent landscape report in Word format, in English language, following the formatting guidelines to be provided by WIPO to the contractor Inclusion of a detailed description of methodology with mention of all used tools and search 124 strings used, along with the advantages of each of each of the approaches used Provision of the intermediary and final datasets, including the search results in Excel format (or a different one, should it be considered more appro priate), hyperlinked to the full patent documents on ESPACENET and including technology tag ging and further categorizations, as deemed necessary and discussed with the WIPO Secret ariat Provision of all supporting data of the provided g raphs and statistics Use of appropriate and as far as possible and sens ible, different for each analysis visualization tools, showcasing the various patent analysis tools to the patent information users Provision of support to the Malaysian Patent Offic e for the required patent searches in their national patent database and coordination for the u se of comparable search strings Inclusion of the Malaysian search results in the p atent landscape report and comparison to the global landscape report Provision of inputs (mainly on key findings of the report) for the preparation of an Infographic 3. Deliverables The search should identify all relevant patent fami lies originating from jurisdictions whose publicati ons are part of the PCT minimum documentation 98 , and irrespective of whether a patent was granted at any patent office for any family member. The successful candidate will be expected to delive r a patent landscape report in English language, in a format to be defined by WIPO, taking into account the above mentioned objectives and including at least the following sections: 3.1 Extended executive summary This section of the report will consist of an execu tive summary of 3D4 pages, phrased in a manner to be addressed to policy and decision makers. This se ction should highlight the findings, possibly correlate them with other findings or additional da ta in a comprehensive manner to facilitate the relevant policy discussions and the use of the data provided through the report. The successful candidate will also provide the data and necessary support to WIPO Secretariat and the Infographic provider to feed into an Infographic serving dissem ination purposes. 3.2 Introduction section This section of the report should briefly explain t he objective and scope of the report, and the framework within which it is established. 3.3 Technology section This section of the report should describe the diff erent categories of technologies related to the production of palm oil, treatment of waste from pal m oil production and use of such waste for 98 http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/standards/en/p df/04D01D01.pdf 125 cosmetic, pharmaceutical, biofuel and other industr y. Each category should be illustrated with selected patent applications. This section should t herefore elaborate on the indexing/tagging that is applied to the patent families in the attached data base (Excel sheet). 3.4 Description of search methodology and limitatio ns This section of the report is important in view of the objectives of the project to develop tools for access to and exploitation of patent information. T he report should explain the search methodology in detail, e.g. how the search queries were developed and refined (search strategy narrative should be part of the report, while search queries are to be included in an Annex), how classification symbols were identified and to what extent they were useful for patent search in this area of technology, how citations were exploited, which databases were used , etc. This section should also discuss difficulties, limi tations and acceptable tolerances with respect to recall and precision. In particular, the effect of including different patent classification systems l ike CPC and FI in order to improve recall in comparison to purely IPC based searches should be presented. Other strategies to improve recall shoul d also be explained, e.g. by supplementary or combined keyword searches or citation analysis. Num erical evidence should be included. The report should include explanations on limitatio ns of availability of patent information from developing countries and countries with economies i n transition, e.g., of patent family data coverage of the databases used for search. Furthermore, part icularities or difficulties related to searching th is particular subject matter should be illustrated alo ng with the approach followed to overcome the related challenges. The report should include in this part a descriptio n on the family reduction method. Both that and the statistical analysis should be based on the concept of simple patent families, or similar family concepts like Fampat or Thomson DWPI families. The family reduction should not be based on the concept of extended (Inpadoc) families. It would ho wever be advantageous if the subscriber would include information or analysis regarding the exten ded families, e.g. whether two simple families belong to the same extended family, or how differen t the size of the respective extended family is in comparison of the single family. 3.5 Analysis of patenting activity The report should include a statistical analysis of the patenting activity, including appropriate visualization, according to at least the following aspects: (1) Number of simple patent families (additional in formation on extended or INPADOC families would be advantageous) and patent publications (i.e . including all family members), in total and per (earliest) priority year; average patent family siz e; size of the largest patent family. (2) Percentage of families comprising at least one publication of a patent grant (to be determined only according to the kind codes of publications; i .e. no legal status data need to be researched, e.g . in order to determine if the grant was revoked afte r an opposition), in total and per (earliest) prior ity year. (3) Percentage of patent families with at least one PCT family member, in total and per (earliest) priority year. 126 (4) Distribution over \"priority countries\", i.e. th e number of families filed per earliest priority fi ling office, i.e. Office of First Filing (OFF), includin g the International Bureau of WIPO as a PCT receivi ng office, in total and per (earliest) priority year. The report is expected to include an analysis of pa tent families originating from Malaysia, Philippines, In donesia, Brasil, Colombia, but also other countries from Asia, Latin America and Africa due to the impo rtance for these countries and regions for palm oil industry/market and the potential for technology tr ansfer and partnerships. The report will be complemented by national patent filing data related to palm oil in Malaysia, to be provided by MyIPO, and is expected to compare the n ational Malaysian activity with the PCT applications with OFF or OSF in Malaysia. The contr actor is expected to assist MyIPO in assessing this information and work with them in the definiti on of the appropriate search strategy and the use o f specific search queries which will ensure comparabl e search results to the provided by the contractor global and regional patent landscape analysis. The contractor is also expected to incorporate the Malaysian national data results into the report, an alyze them and compare them to the global patenting activity results. (5) Geographical distribution of extensions, i.e. o f patent family members filed with any Office of Second Filing (OSF) after the priority filing with the OFF, in total and per (earliest) priority year. The distribution of OSF should be determined such that the OFF is excluded, i.e. second filings in the country of OFF that are derived from the priority d ocument should not be counted. Each OSF should be counted only once. (6) Geographical distribution of applicant national ities (for families having several applicants each nationality is counted separately, i.e. the statist ics should not be limited to the nationality of the applicant listed first). (7) Geographical distribution of inventor nationali ties (for families having several inventors, each nationality is counted separately, i.e. the statist ics should not be limited to the nationality of the inventor listed first). (8) Most active applicants (top 20); breakdown by t he sector they represent (industry, academia/research/public sector, individuals); thei r geographical distribution; their preferred OFF; their use of OSF for extensions; their activity ove r time; relevant corporate trees, i.e. close links between distinct applicants; the categories of tech nologies for which they have filed patent applications. (9) Most active inventors (top 20); their affiliati on with industry, academia/research/public sector; their nationality, their activity over time; the categori es of eDwaste recycling technologies for which they have filed patent applications. (10) Collaboration networks among applicants and am ong inventors. (11) Citation frequency, i.e. patents that have bee n cited frequently and therefore possibly cover key innovations. The analysis should be done in total (for all relev ant patents) and separately, if significant, for th e different categories of components or technologies. The successful candidate will be invited to include further analysis and visualization that he discove rs as interesting or instructive during the analysis s tage. Suggestions in the proposals submitted in 127 response to the RFP are welcome. 3.6 Annexes (1) A table (Excel sheet) which sorting (e.g. for d ates) and filtering functionalities that includes all relevant simple patent families. Each simple fa mily should be identified by the publication number of a single published family mem ber, preferably the earliest published PCT publication number, if available. If the family has no PCT family member, the family member given in the table should be one that is pub lished in English language, preferably the earliest priority document defining the family. Each of these publication numbers identifying a fa mily should be hyperlinked to ESPACENET in order to readily allow the viewing of the full publication and the related INPADOC family and available legal status of family members. If ESPACENET does not include the publication, the publication number sho uld be linked to another freeDofDcharge patent database that includes the publication (pref erably the database hosted by the publishing office, if available). The table should further include in separate addit ional columns for each family (derived from the publication representing the family): D title; D at least the first claim; D applicant name(s); D an indication as to whether at least one applican t is a private sector and/or a public sector entity (names of individuals are considered neither private nor public sector entity); D inventor name(s); D priority information: D earliest priority date (or application date in ca se no priority is claimed), D priority country of earliest priority (i.e. OFF) D further priority dates with respective priority c ountry; D the size of the simple family and the size of the related Inpadoc family; D publication numbers of all members of the simple family (not to be linked); D the country codes of all offices of second filing (OSF, each OSF indicated only once, OFF excluded); D number of OSF (each OSF counted once); D an indication as to whether the family comprises at least one publication of a patent grant (to be determined only according the kind cod es of publications; i.e. no legal status data need to be researched, e.g. in order to determine if the grant was revoked after an opposition). D all IPC symbols attributed to the document select ed for identifying the family. Each family should additionally be indexed/tagged a ccording to the technology and use categories to which they belong (categories as desc ribed in the report body; see Section 3.3 above). Where possible, columns should be sortable in alpha betical manner or according to date or number. 128 All dates have to be formatted as YYYY.MM.DD. (2) All search queries and all cleaning methods tha t were used to establish the final set of results; they should be presented in such a way tha t they can be reused in the respective databases for updating the search results. 4. Input/support from WIPO; WIPO support to the con tractor The contractor will be expected to undertake the w ork autonomously, while working closely with selected staff focal points in WIPO. Whenever possible, WIPO will undertake to assist in providing some already existing studies, data an d information which is required by the contractor. The contractor will report to the IP In formation Officer of the Project. WIPO will provide the service with copies of its existing mat erials directly related to the topic, including both final and draft documents, and coord inate in the communication with the Malaysian IP Office. WIPO will provide feedback thr oughout the project delivery. In situations where neither WIPO nor the contractor ow n any original material or compiled data on a particular subject, external public or pr oprietary databases need to be researched and accessed by the contractor. 5. Intellectual Property The patent landscape report, as well as all interme diate drafts and data the Contractor has developed under the contract shall be the sole prop erty of WIPO. The Contractor acknowledges and agrees that such products and othe r materials constitute 'works made for hire' for WIPO. 6. Travel requirements Travel may be required for presentation of the repo rt's findings, in Geneva or in Malaysia. In that case, travel costs will be covered by WIPO. II. TIME FRAMES/DURATION 7. The delivery of the patent landscape report will be according the following timeline: (1) Phase I : within four (4) weeks upon receipt of notification on contract award. (2) Phase II: within four (4) weeks upon receipt of WIPO comments of Phase I. (3) Phase III: within two (2) weeks upon receipt of WIPO comments of Phase II. 129 The specific time frame will be finalized together with the contractor. III.
