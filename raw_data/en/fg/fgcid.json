Although the formula showcased a variety of sweetening solutions, it can also serve as a great demonstration of how to boost the health and nutritional value of food & snack products with the functional ingredient Vitamin E. What Are The Benefits of Vitamin E? Vitamin E is a nutrient that's important to vision, reproduction, and the health of your blood, brain, and skin. The key to these benefits of Vitamin E is its powerful antioxidant properties. The process of oxidation and accelerated aging takes place in our bodies when cells are exposed to molecules called free radicals. Although free radicals form as a result of normal body processes, they can weaken and break down healthy cells. These molecules cause damage that shortens the life of our cells and may contribute to heart disease and cancer. The antioxidant Vitamin E may help reduce free radical damage and slow the aging process of cells. To take advantage of these benefits, the recommended daily dosage of vitamin E for adults is 15 milligrams a day. Crystal E\u00ae Natural Vitamin E Powder As a part of HOWTIAN's portfolio of health supplements and cellular nutrition ingredients, [Crystal E\u00ae Vitamin E Powder](https://howtiangroup.com/other-products/) is our brand of natural Vitamin E for manufacturers of food & nutrition products. Crystal E\u00ae is stable, readily bio-available, has good flowability, and preserves vitamin E's original form as -tocopherol (based on the FDA's updates to the new supplement facts panel in the US, Vitamin E is now required to be labeled as -tocopherol). Crystal E\u00ae is co-crystallized to a stable, crystalline powder without any chemical modifications or an encapsulation process. It is available in its original form from a natural source (d--tocopherol ) by way of our patented production process. The current acetate form produced by esterification destroys its natural properties, making it less bio-available and reduces its antioxidant capabilities. Microencapsulation typically uses gelatin, an animal-based ingredient, but a plant-based starch form is also available at a higher cost. Typical Vitamin E oil decomposes by roughly 22% over 4 weeks when stored at an accelerated temperature of 60C, whereas our co-crystalized product stays stable. Crystal E\u00ae was also shown to be much more stable when mixed with minerals or exposed to light. Minerals typically accelerate the decomposition of vitamins. In a tablet or pill application, Crystal E\u00ae only needs 26% of the mass compared to synthetic -tocopherol acetate powder (50%) due to its higher concentration of -tocopherol. The higher concentration also has environmental and sustainability benefits because it doesn't consume acetate anhydrate or silicone dioxide in the production process, and generates savings on packaging, shipping, storage, and production equipment costs. Comparing the Cost of Crystal E\u00ae vs. Other Commercial Vitamin E Products Here is a general cost comparison to the most common Vitamin E types on the market, including natural, semi-synthetic, and synthetic forms of Vitamin E. |Type||Product per per gram| |Synthetic||Vitamin E 50% Gelatin based (animal sourced with Al SiO2)||Powder||22%||4.55||$11 per kg||$0.05 per gram| For a 90 count 15mg dosage product, the cost of Natural Crystal E\u00ae equates to $0.17 per bottle.
