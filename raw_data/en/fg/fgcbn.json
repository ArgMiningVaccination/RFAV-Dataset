NSU Health Professions Division 5Nova Southeastern University Mission Statement Nova Southeastern University, a private, not-for-profit institution, offers a diverse array of innovative academic programs at the undergraduate, graduate, and professional levels, complementing on-campus educational opportunities and resources with accessible distance learning programs, and fostering intel - lectual inquiry, leadership, and commitment to community through engagement of students and faculty in a dynamic, life-long learning environment.6 NSU Health Professions DivisionHealth Professions Division Board of Governors Royal Flagg Jonas, Howard Hanbury II, Ph.D., NSU President Ronald Braverman, O.D. Frank DePiano, Stern, O.D. NSU Health Professions Division 7Health Professions Division Mission Statement The mission of Nova Southeastern University Health Professions Division is to train primary care health practitioners in a multidisciplinary setting, with an emphasis on medically underserved areas. The institutional premise is that health professionals should be trained in a multidisciplinary setting and, whenever possible, with integrated education. The university trains students in concert with other health profession students so that the various disciplines will learn to work together as a team for the good of the public's health. During their didactic work, students share campus facilities and, in some cases, have combined classes. In their clinical experiences, they work together in facilities operated by the university. Furthermore, the division aims to educate health care practitioners who will eventually increase the availability of health care in areas of Florida that suffer from health care shortages. The division aims to alleviate some of these shortages by exposing the entire student body to the needs, challenges, and rewards of rural, underserved urban, and geriatric care. Existing curricula require all students to attend ambulatory care clerkships in rural or urban areas, or both, making Nova Southeastern University strongly oriented toward a pattern of training its students in areas geographically removed from the health center itself, and to the care of indigent and multicultural population groups. In doing this, it developed training programs that address the primary care needs of the region's most medically underserved populations. 8 NSU Health Professions DivisionMonday-Friday, July 26-30, 2010 ...................

This growth culminated in January 1994, when Nova University and Southeastern University of the Health Sciences merged to become Nova Southeastern University. Nova University was chartered in 1964 as a graduate institution in the physical and social sciences. Over time, Nova added programs in law, education, busi - ness, psychology, computer science, oceanography, social and systemic studies, and hospitality, and, in 1972, introduced its first off-campus course of study, in education. Soon, Nova became nationally recognized for its innovative distance learning programs. Today, field-based programs are located in 32 other Florida cities, in nearly 30 other states, and at selected interna - tional sites. While Nova continued to expand its educational reach, Southeastern University of the Health Sciences also was on an expansion course. Southeastern was created by osteo - pathic physicians committed to establishing a College of Osteopathic Medicine in the Southeast. As a result, Southeastern College of Osteopathic Medicine, as it was first known, opened in 1981. From 1987 to 1997, Southeastern added Colleges of Pharmacy, Optometry, Allied Health, Medical Sciences, and the College of Dental Medicine, which admitted 88 students in 1997. This growth was unprecedented, but not unsurpassed. There was still more to come. The merger brought on new pos - sibilities. Prior to 1994, Nova had evolved with innovative technology and Southeastern expanded to provide much needed health care education. With the merger, Nova Southeastern University's resources make possible a more transdisciplinary education. Students have an opportunity to integrate across the disciplines and understand how their professions relate to society as a whole. Campus Nova Southeastern University's Health Professions Division offers a rare blend of tropical South Florida weather, plen - tiful sunny beaches, an easily accessible campus, a dedicated and professional faculty, well established affiliations with many hospitals, clinics, and health care systems in the area, and a mis - sion to educate professionals capable of providing the highest quality health care service. The university's main campus is located on a lush 300-acre site in the Greater Fort Lauderdale area, 10 miles inland of the Atlantic Ocean and readily accessible via several highways and Florida's Turnpike. The Health Professions Division complex, dedicated in June 1996, is located on 21 acres and encompasses more than 1 million square feet of buildings. The division comprises the Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine, Pharmacy, Optometry, Allied Health and Nursing, Medical Sciences, and Dental Medicine. NSU Health Professions Division 1 1The division elicited input from students and faculty members and incorporated innovations in architec - ture, ergonomics, and computer-aided technology to provide facilities that enhance the learning experience. The complex is an arrangement of eight buildings, four of which are connected by air conditioned lobbies. The Sanford L. Ziff Health Care Center, physi - cal plant, and 1,600-space garage are connected to the central buildings by covered walkways. Administration and faculty offices are on the upper levels of the five-story Terry Administration Building, with the departments of admissions and student affairs, and a cafeteria located on the first floor. Located in the lobby of the Terry Building, the Health Museum exhibits artifacts and antiques representing each of the colleges of the Health Professions Division. The collection houses an infor - mative and historical display of medical memorabilia for students, faculty mem - bers, and visitors to explore. Private tours of the museum can be arranged with the curator, Cynthia Magalian Tupler, B.F.A. Contact Helen Caidin in the Pharmacy Department to schedule an appoint- ment, (954) 262-1380. Adjacent to the administration building is the Assembly Building, which consists of a 500-seat auditorium, a 250-seat auditorium, and eight 126-seat amphitheater-classrooms, all equipped with computerized audio/ video systems. Connected to this is the three-story Library/ Laboratory Building. On the first floor is the library and a 100-seat cardiac laboratory utilizing \"Harvey,\" a computerized mannequin that duplicates the sounds and symp - toms of most heart conditions. Also on the first floor are patient simulation training rooms and a 50- station computer laboratory for stu - dent use. The second and third floors house laboratories, a student lounge, and a research area. Laboratories are equipped for viewing pretaped medical procedures, and each large laboratory has a video system and hookups to equipment such as an electron micro - scope, so that illustrations can be amplified for laboratory-wide viewing. Just north of the Library/ Laboratory Building is the Health Care Center, with facilities for primary health care, rehabilitative services, eye care, pharmacy, and a simulation nursing laboratory. The College of Dental Medicine's 70,500-square-foot building advances the state-of-the-art in dental educa- tion facilities. The first floor contains a 100-operatory predoctoral clinic facil - ity and clinics and support laboratories for oral medicine, radiology, and oral surgery. The second floor houses a faculty practice and clinics for post- graduate programs in endodontics, orthodontics, pediatric dentistry, periodontology, and prosthodontics, a 120-position simulation technique laboratory and support laboratories. Faculty and administration offices and an auditorium are on the third floor. The Health Professions Division added a building to foster opportu - nities for interdisciplinary education and to meet the need for additional 12 NSU Health Professions Divisionclassroom, computer, and research facilities. This modern, spacious facil - ity known as the Assembly II Building contains more than 31,000 square feet of instructional and research facili - ties, including a 312-seat auditorium, ultrasound training center, a 50-station computer science laboratory, and 37 seminar and study rooms.

However, this admis - sion includes a condition that final and official transcripts, documents, and requirements must be received within 90 calendar days from matriculation. If these final and official transcripts, documents, and/or requirements are not received by that time, the student will not be allowed to continue class attendance. Financial aid will not be disbursed to a provisional/ conditional student until he or she has been fully admitted as a regular student (all admissions requirements have been approved by the college /program admissions office). Students who have an unpaid balance 30 days from the start of the term will be assessed a $100 fee. Background Checks Accepted applicants and students are required to authorize the NSU Health Professions Division to obtain background check (s) as per the policy adopted on April 22, 2005. Students also may be required by the Health Professions Division to obtain a back - ground check or authorize, where appropriate, clinical training facilities to conduct the check and to permit the results of the consumer reporting agency be provided to HPD and/or the clinical training facilities. If the background check (s) reveal infor - mation of concern, which the NSU Health Professions Division may deem unfavorable, HPD will request NSU Health Professions Division 13that the individual provide a detailed written explanation of the informa - tion contained in this report, along with appropriate documentation (e.g., police reports). This information must be responded to in the same format it is requested (electronic or written) to the NSU Health Professions Division Background Check Committee within 10 business days of the date the com - munication is sent or another date specified by HPD in its communica - tion with the student. Offers of admission will not be con - sidered final until the completion of the background check (s), with results deemed favorable by the NSU Health Professions Division, and where appro - priate, by the clinical training facilities. If information received indicates that the student has provided false or misleading statements, has omitted required information, or in any way is unable to meet the requirements for completion of the program, then the admission may be denied or rescinded, the student may be disciplined or dis - missed, or his or her enrollment may be terminated. Following the initial background check (s), students will be asked annu - ally to provide a certification relating to any convictions or guilty or no-contest pleas to any criminal offense other than traffic violations. Voluntary Withdrawal Tuition Refund Policy Students who wish to withdraw must submit a written request for volun - tary withdrawal to the dean, who will evaluate the student's request. After completing the required withdrawal form (s) and obtaining the dean's approval, an eligible student may receive partial refund of the tuition, according to the following formula: First three class days ..................... 70 percent Fourth or fifth class day ......................... 60 percent Sixth or seventh class day ...................... 40 percent Eighth, ninth, or tenth class day ........... 20 percent After the tenth class day ....................... 0 percent No refunds will be made thereafter. (Students with questions should consult the program office.) Students may not be given refunds for portions of tuition paid by financial aid funds. As appropriate, the respective financial aid programs will be credited in accordance with federal regulations. Students should notify the Office of Student Financial Assistance prior to withdrawing to determine the effect this will have on financial aid. For complete withdrawals, please refer to the Return of Title IV Funds section of the student handbook. Failure to comply with these require - ments could jeopardize future receipt of the Title IV student assistance funds at any institution of higher education the student may attend. The regulation requires that if the student has received a financial aid overage to assist with related, but indirect educational costs, e.g., living expenses, books, supplies, transporta - tion and/or personal expenses, this 14 NSU Health Professions Divisionmust be prorated for the period the student attended the institution. The student must then refund the differ - ence (between the actual overage and prorated amount) to the institution for restoration to the appropriate Title IV account. Failure to comply with these require - ments could jeopardize future receipt of Title IV student assistance funds at any institution of higher education the student may attend. A refund due the student will be mailed to the student's permanent home address or deposited directly into his or her checking account as soon as the dean of the respective college has approved the withdrawal. The tuition refund policy is subject to change at the discretion of the university's board of trustees. Florida Residency Eligible students must request in-state tuition on application. For tuition purposes, students' Florida residency status (in-state or out-of-state) will be determined at initial matriculation and will remain the same throughout the entire enrollment of the student at NSU. Accordingly, tuition will not be adjusted as a result of any change in residency status after initial enrollment registration. Financial Aid The Office of Student Financial Assistance assists qualified students in obtaining the funds necessary to pursue their educational objectives. In order to be eligible for student finan - cial aid, students must complete the U.S. Department of Education's Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and meet federal general eligibility criteria. A need analysis is performed, utilizing information from the FAFSA to determine the student's Expected Family Contribution (EFC), or the amount the student and the stu - dent's family can contribute toward the student's educational expenses. Financial need is defined as the differ - ence between the institution's Cost of Attendance (COA) and the EFC. The university's cost of attendance includes tuition and fees, books and supplies, room and board, transportation, and personal expenses. The fastest way to apply for the FAFSA is online through FAFSA on the Web at www.fafsa.edu.gov. By applying elec - tronically, financial aid information is forwarded to the Office of Student Financial Assistance within 72 hours, expediting the awarding process and reducing errors due to built-in edits. Students should request a Department of Education Personal Identification Number (PIN) online through www.pin.ed.gov. By using the PIN, students will be able to esign their FAFSA, which eliminates the need to send a signature page. Undergraduate students may be eligible for grants, student employment, loans, and scholarships. Graduate/professional students may be eligible for loans in the form of Federal Subsidized and Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, Federal Graduate Plus Loans, and private/ alternative loans, as well as student employment (FWS) and scholarships. In order to successfully complete the financial aid process, students should NSU Health Professions Division 15apply early, provide all necessary documents and requests to the Office of Student Financial Assistance in a timely manner, register for at least the minimum number of credits required per term (half time in a degree-seeking program), and meet required deadlines. For more information regarding the financial aid process, contacts, and other pertinent information, students may visit the NSU Financial Aid Web site at www.nova.edu/cwis/finaid. Students will be notified of missing information, their financial status, award notifications, and other financial aid related information via their NSU email addresses.

Forms will be distrib - uted by the HPD Office of Admissions and Student Services to each matricu - lant as part of the admissions package, or can be downloaded from www.nova .edu/smc/. Students may request that the University Health Service perform these examinations after matriculation. The University Health Service will make appointments in as timely a man - ner as possible, and the appointments, once made, become an obligation of the student, and must be kept. These certificates (whether done pri - vately or by the university) will be placed in an appropriate facility. Immunization Requirements Students must have completed the mandatory immunization form, which can be found at www.nova.edu/smc/. The following immunization proce - dures are required of students at the Health Professions Division. Immunizations Every student is required to have had an immunization for the following diseases before matriculating at Nova Southeastern University: diphtheria- pertussis-tetanus, varicella (chicken pox), and measles-mumps-rubella. A written memorandum of the immu - nization given and the date, signed by a physician, must be filed with the Office of Admissions on the day of registration at the latest. These 16 NSU Health Professions Divisionbasic immunizations are the financial responsibility of the student. The uni - versity also has the right to require additional immunizations. Current Additional Required Immunizations Hepatitis B Vaccine Since every student at the Health Professions Division potentially can be exposed to this deadly virus, and since many rotation sites require it of personnel, we will administer and require hepatitis B vaccinations for every entering student during the first year with a follow-up blood test showing the presence of the hepatitis B antibody. The cost of this vaccination will be supported through the student activities fee. Tuberculosis Because of the resurgence of tuber - culosis and the possible exposure of students to TB, the Health Professions Division will require and provide a yearly tuberculosis test for every student. The student activities fee supports this, as well. Arrangements The University Health Service will schedule appointments for students for tuberculosis testing and for hepatitis B vaccination. Because both of these require preparation, any student who does not keep a scheduled vaccination appointment will be required to pay for the immunization personally. The university is not required to provide alternate sites for clinical practicum or rotations should immuni - zation be a requirement for placement. Therefore, the student may be delayed in meeting the graduation require - ments of his or her program. Student Housing NSU offers a residential living program that is designed to meet a wide array of student needs. Students who live on campus have numerous opportunities to participate in a variety of programs and activities that maximize intellec - tual growth and personal development.

When a class requires special dress (such as the wearing of scrub suits in anatomy laboratory), it will be the only exception to the dress code allowed during that time. The dress code is to be observed at all times including midterms and exami - nation periods. Students are expected to consult their respective program handbooks for compliance with any program-specific supplemental dress code policy. Identification Requirements and Fieldwork Prerequisites An affiliated clinical/fieldwork teach - ing facility may also require a student to pass a state of Florida Department of Health screening before rotation. Other requirements that may be held by the affiliated facility include, but are not limited to, fingerprinting, a criminal background check, urinaly - sis for drugs and alcohol, and proof of immunization. If a student does not meet all requirements held by the affiliated facility before the first day of the scheduled placement, the stu - dent's placement will be canceled. If the placement has already begun, the student will be asked to leave.Student Insurance Requirement It is required that each Health Professions Division student (except those in online education programs and R.N. to B.S.N. or R.N. to M.S.N. nurs- ing programs) carry adequate personal medical and hospitalization insurance. It is strongly suggested that students and their families avail themselves of the insurance plan obtainable through the university. Information about the policy can be obtained through the HPD Admissions and Student Services Office, or by accessing the Web site at www.nova.edu/smc and clicking on the link for Student Health Insurance. Please note that students will see a charge for health insurance appear on their student account as part of the academic regis- tration process.

Standards of Progress A student receiving veterans' benefits must maintain satisfactory progress. Students will be considered to be making satisfactory progress as long as they meet the academic standards set by their school for retention in their degree programs. A student who, at the end of any eval - uation period, has not attained and maintained satisfactory progress will be certified, in a probationary status, for only one additional evaluation period. Should this student not attain and maintain satisfactory progress by the end of the probationary period (one evaluation period), the student's Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) educational benefits will be terminated for unsatisfactory progress. A student whose VA educational benefits have been terminated for unsatisfactory progress may petition the school to be recertified after one evalua -tion period has elapsed. The school may recertify the student for VA educational benefits only if there is a reasonable likelihood that the student will be able to attain and maintain satisfactory prog - ress for the remainder of the program. To initiate the petition, students should contact the Office of Student Financial Assistance, VA Benefits representative, at 800-986-3380. For VA payment of benefits purposes, an I (Incomplete) designation for a course must be converted to a credit grade counting toward graduation, or a failing grade, by the end of one calendar year unless permission for a delay is granted by the academic dean for that program. An NG (no grade) designa - tion for a course must be converted to a credit grade counting toward gradu - ation, or a failing grade, by the end of one regular semester unless permission for a delay is granted by the academic dean for that program. Grade /Progress Reports Each student who has VA benefits will be provided a grade /progress report at the end of every evaluation period (e.g., term, semester). A copy of each report will be placed in the student's permanent file maintained by the school. The university periodically furnishes each student with a working transcript that shows current status of grades and earned semester hours for all courses completed and/or attempted, plus grades for all courses in which the student is currently enrolled. Credit for Prior Training (CPT) Nova Southeastern University complies with federal regulations for veterans' training in that it is mandatory for all NSU Health Professions Division 21veterans' benefit recipients to report either prior education and/or train - ing. A student receiving veterans' benefits who has previous postsecond - ary educational training /experience must request official transcript (s) to be sent to the school. If the transcript has not been received prior to the end of the student's second term at Nova Southeastern University, the stu - dent can not be certified for veterans' benefits for the upcoming term. The student can be certified for veterans' benefits only after the transcript has been received. The school will evaluate the student's previous training and/or experience and grant credit as appropriate. Should credit (s) be accepted and/or granted, the tuition and training time will be reduced proportionately, with the stu - dent eligible for veterans' benefits and VA so notified. Student Conduct All students are expected to comply with the legal and ethical standards of this institution. Academic dishonesty and/or non - academic misconduct will result in disciplinary action. Specific instances of misconduct include, but are not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, know - ingly furnishing false information to the institution, and forging or altering institutional documents and/or aca - demic credentials. The institution reserves the right to require a student to withdraw at any time for misconduct as described above. It also reserves the right to impose probation or suspension on a student whose conduct is determined to be unsatisfactory. Students who feel their rights have been denied are entitled to due process. Students are expected to consult their respective program handbooks for compliance with any program- specific supplemental student conduct policy.

Core Performance Standards for Admission and Progress The Nova Southeastern University Health Professions Division is pledged to the admission and matriculation of qualified students and wishes to acknowledge awareness of laws that prohibit discrimination against anyone on the basis of race, color, religion or creed, sex, pregnancy status, national or ethnic origin, nondisqualifying disabil - ity, age, ancestry, marital status, sexual 24 NSU Health Professions Divisionorientation, unfavorable discharge from the military, veteran status, or political beliefs or affiliations. Regarding those students with verifi - able disabilities, the university will not discriminate against such individuals who are otherwise qualified, but will expect applicants and students to meet certain minimal technical standards (core performance standards) as set forth herein with or without reason- able accommodation. In adopting these standards, the university believes it must keep in mind the ultimate safety of the patients whom its graduates will eventually serve. The standards reflect what the university believes are reason - able expectations required of health professions students and personnel in performing common functions. The holders of health care degrees must have the knowledge and skills to function in a broad variety of clinical situations and to render a wide spectrum of patient care. In order to carry out the activities described below, candidates for Health Professions Division degrees must be able to integrate consistently, quickly, and accurately all informa - tion received, and they must have the ability to learn, integrate, analyze, and synthesize data. Candidates for degrees offered by the Health Professions Division must have, with or without reasonable accommo - dation, multiple abilities and skills including intellectual, conceptual, integrative, and quantitative abilities; interpersonal communication; mobility and strength; motor skills; and hearing, visual, tactile, behavioral, and social attributes.

While both types of physi - cians are trained in all aspects of patient care, D.O.s offer a distinct, holistic approach to medicine. Osteopathic medicine is distin - guished by an emphasis on primary care, by using osteopathic manipula - tive medicine when necessary, and by a tradition of caring for patients in underserved rural and urban areas. Osteopathic physicians recognize the relationship between physical struc - ture and organic function and view the human body as an interdependent unit rather than an assortment of separate parts and systems. While all medical and surgical specialties are represented within the osteopathic medical profession, the training of vitally needed family physicians and the drive to reach rural, minority, geriatric, and indigent populations, make the osteopathic medical profession unique. We are proud of our success in producing vitally needed primary care physicians\u2014nearly 70 percent of our graduates practice in the primary care disciplines of family medicine, general internal medicine, or general pediatrics\u2014and we remain commit - ted to training physicians capable of delivering the highest standards of total-patient care in all practice settings.

It is recommended that applicants complete at least one course in biochemistry and one course in physiology. 3. A minimum cumulative and science GPA of 3.0 is required. However, the dean is empowered to evaluate the total qualifications of every student and to modify requirements in unusual circumstances. 4. All applicants are required to take the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). Applications for the MCAT may be obtained online at www.aamc.org , from your college's preprofessional adviser's office, by calling (319) 337-1357, or by writing directly to Medical College Admission Test Program Office 2255 North Dubuque Road P .O. Box 4056 Iowa City, IA 52243-4056 College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014Osteopathic Medicine Program 31MCAT scores must be no more than three years old prior to the application cycle. The discipline and intensive study required by the osteopathic medicine curriculum make the attainment of a superior GPA in undergraduate studies essential. The college receives more than 3,500 applications a year, from which only 230 students are chosen. These students have varied backgrounds, and while some many enter the college directly from an undergradu - ate program, other students come from successful careers. The Committee on Admissions recommends applicants to the dean on the basis of demonstrated academic excellence, leadership, compassion, and commitment to the osteopathic medical profession. Application Procedure The college participates in the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Applica - tion Service (AACOMAS) for the receipt and processing of all applica - tions. AACOMAS takes no part in the selection of students. Applicants should submit applications electronically through AACOMAS Online, an interactive, Web-based application at www.aacom.org . For questions, applicants may call (301) 968-4190. The following steps are necessary to the primary application process. 1. The applicant should submit the following materials to AACOMAS by January 15: completed AACOMAS application official transcripts from the registrars of all colleges or universities attended, mailed directly to AACOMAS by the college or university MCAT scores (must be no more than three years old prior to the application cycle) 2. The applicant must submit the following to the college by March 1 : a secondary application, which will be sent to the applicant by the college on receipt of the AACOMAS application a nonrefundable application fee of $50 a letter of evaluation from the preprofessional committee, or, if such a committee does not exist, then three letters of evaluation: two from science professors, and one from a non-science professor a letter of evaluation from a physician A personal interview is a part of the admission process; however, being interviewed is not a guarantee of admission. Not all applicants will be granted an interview. Those selected for an interview will be notified of the date and time of such interview by the Office of Admissions. Notice of acceptance will be on a rolling or periodic schedule; therefore, early completion of the application is in the best interest of the applicant because of the limited number of spaces available in each class. After acceptance, final and offi - cial documents and requirements must be received by the Office of Admissions within 90 days following 32 College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014Osteopathic Medicine Programthe start of the first term. If these final and official documents are not received, or other requirements are not met by that time, the student will not be able to continue his or her enrollment. Financial aid will not be disbursed to anyone until he or she has been fully admitted as a regular student (all admissions requirements have been approved by the program office). Tuition and Fees 1. The tuition for 2010-2011 (subject to change by the board of trustees without notice): $34,480 for Florida residents and $40,375 for out-of- state students. Eligible students must request in-state tuition on their application. For tuition purposes, a student's Florida residency status (in-state or out-of-state) will be determined at matriculation and will remain the same throughout the entire enrollment of the student at NSU. Accordingly, tuition will not be adjusted as a result of any change in residency status after initial enroll - ment registration. 2. For first-year students, a micro- scope /laboratory fee of $100 is required. In addition, a Health Professions Division general access fee of $145 is required each year. An NSU student services fee of $750 is also required annually. Additional program fees may apply. 3. Acceptance fee is $1,250. This fee is required to reserve the accepted applicant's place in the entering first- year class. This advance payment will be deducted from the tuition payment, but is not refundable in case of a withdrawal.4. Deposit is $750. This advance payment is due March 15. It will be deducted from the tuition payment, but is not refundable in the event of a withdrawal. Applicants accepted after this date will have a due date following the date of acceptance. Applicants accepted prior to Novem - ber 15 will have until December 14 to pay the acceptance fee. Appli - cants accepted between November 15 and January 14 will have 30 days, and those accepted between January 15 and May 14 will have 14 days to pay their acceptance fee. Anyone accepted on May 15 or later will be asked to immediately pay the combined acceptance fee and deposit of $2,000. Those accepted between March 16 and May 14 will be required to submit their combined acceptance and deposit fees within 14 days. The first semester's tuition and fees, less the $2,000 previously paid, are due upon receipt of the NSU invoice. Students will be billed tuition for each subsequent semester. Students will not be admitted until their finan - cial obligations have been met. The financial ability of applicants to complete their training at the college is important because of the limited number of positions avail - able in each class. Applicants should have specific plans for financing four years of medical education, including tuition, living expenses, books, equipment, clinical rotation travel, and miscel - laneous expenses.

Students must pass a comprehensive examination given for the purpose of determin - ing the student's competency in the subject involved. The passing require - ment will be determined by the College of Osteopathic Medicine. The decision regarding the request for advanced standing will be transmitted in writing to the student by the dean. The Office of the Registrar will be appropriately notified. Courses for which advanced standing is granted will be designated as advanced placement on the student's transcript and will not show a grade or contribute to the student's grade point average. Course of Study The College of Osteopathic Medi - cine has a dedicated faculty; well established affiliations with medical centers, hospitals, and health care systems; a nationally recognized rural medicine program; and a mission to educate the finest osteo - pathic physicians possible. We place College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014Osteopathic Medicine Program 35our students and residents at the nation's fourth largest public hospi - tal system\u2014the North Broward Hospital District\u2014or at one of our regional academic centers through - out the state to improve continuity and coordination of clinical educa - tion within our vast and growing clinical training network. Our innovative curriculum is designed to fulfill our mission of training primary-care physicians. The design of the curriculum is based on successful academic models\u2014care - fully developed and integrated. It emphasizes interdisciplinary collabo - ration, guiding students to develop a holistic, and more importantly, an osteopathic approach to medicine. We continually correlate basic scien - tific information with fundamental clinical application. Students are exposed to clinical settings in their first semester, which gives them the opportunity to prepare for the \"real world\" of medicine. This clinical exposure continues into the second year when students have increased opportunity to interact with standardized patients on campus as well as be involved, under physi - cian supervision, with real patients in the office and hospital setting. A notable aspect of the clinical program is a required three-month rotation in a rural practice setting. In rural clinics throughout the state of Florida, our students provide health care to medically underserved and indigent patients. Our students learn to treat various patients whose life - styles, practices, and attitudes toward health care differ from those seen in more traditional training sites. This enriching educational experi - ence is one that cannot be taught in the classroom. Physicians do not work in a vacuum, but rather in a health care team, and NSU promotes interdisciplin - ary cooperation whenever possible. Students share faculty members and campus facilities with NSU's phar - macy, dental, optometry, physician assistant, physical therapy, occupa - tional therapy, public health, nursing, and medical science students.36 College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014Osteopathic Medicine ProgramCurriculum Outline M1 Credit hours Fall Term COM 5021 Medical Biochemistry .................................................................. 5.5 COM 5010 Gross Anatomy COM 5020 Medical Histology ......................................................................... 3.0 COM 5061 Medical Physiology I ..................................................................... 3.0 COM 5001 Patient-Centered Medicine I ....................................................... 3.0 COM 5121 OPP I ............................................................................................. 2.0 COM 5100 Medicine, Health, and Society (MHS) ....................................... 3.0 SPAN 5000 Conversational Spanish for Health Care Professionals ............... 1.0 COM 5004 Behavioral Medicine ..................................................................... 1.0 COM 5800 Foundations and Applications of Clinical Reasoning I .............. 2.0 COM 5080 Basic Life Support ......................................................................... 1.0 TOTAL: 30.5 Winter TermSPAN 5001 Medical Spanish for Health Care Professionals ........................... 1.0 COM 5062 Medical Physiology II ................................................................... 4.0 COM 5030 Medical Microbiology I ...............................................................

The premise of the program is that expo - sure to professional role models is a significant determinant of medical students' career choices, and that an early clinical experience is an essential learning component for medical students to begin to corre - late classroom knowledge with actual patient encounters. The IGC Program is composed of three compo - nents: (1) the IGC Physician Mentor Program, (2) the IGC Business of Medicine /Managed Care Program, and (3) the College of Osteopathic Medicine in Community Service (COM 2Serve) Program. IGC Physician Mentor Program Students are placed with physician mentors, either one or two students at a time. They may elect to switch mentors every semester and are required to switch primary care disci - plines and mentors after their first year. In addition to providing a broad exposure to the role of a primary care physician, the physician mentor provides the student with the oppor - tunity to perform patient histories and physical examinations within the limits of the student's ability, and educates the student by provid - ing timely feedback and engaging in discussions and explanations of his or her decision making. There are approximately 140 primary care physician mentors who teach first- and/or second-year medical students in their private offices. This network of preceptors is composed of physi - cians in the three primary care disciplines; they are located through - out the tricounty area. IGC Business of Medicine/ Managed Care Program Students learn the business aspects of practice as well as the various compo - nents of managed care organizations (MCOs). Each student is either assigned to an MCO teaching partner, or attends a special conference or seminar on health care systems, poli-cies, and access. Students learn how a managed care organization operates by participating in seminars and small group discussions led by professionals representing various departments/ experiences such as medical opera-tions, physician committee meetings, utilization management, quality 58 College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014Osteopathic Medicine Programm an a ge me n t, a n d pr o v id er / practice management. IGC COM 2Serve Program This is the community service component of the IGC preceptor - ship, in which second-year medical students are involved in service learn-ing with community health centers, public health departments, homeless assistance centers, migrant farm - worker clinics, and other subsidized community clinics. The COM 2Serve partner organizations provide health care and other needed services to medically underserved, minority, and at-risk populations. Osteopathic Principles and Practice Laboratories The development of the palpatory skills used for diagnosis and treatment is a significant distinction between the educational programs in osteo - pathic and allopathic medical schools. Stedman's Medical Dictionary defines palpation as \"examination with the hands and fingers; touching, feeling, or perceiving by the sense of touch.\" Palpation in the osteopathic medical education context is the use of touch to examine the body. Palpa - tory skills are used in all areas of osteopathic medical practice and are especially important in the evalua - tion, diagnosis, and treatment of the musculoskeletal system. The development of palpatory skills is taught in the first- and second-year osteopathic principles and practice (OPP) courses. Successful comple - tion of these courses requires active participation in all laboratory sessions. During the two years, each student will palpate, in the laboratory setting, a variety of people, representing both genders and individuals with different body types to simulate the diversity of patients expected in a practice setting. Being palpated by other students helps the student understand from the patient's perspective how palpa - tion feels and enables the students to provide feedback to their laboratory partners, thus enhancing the palpatory skills of all students. The osteopathic medical profession uses a variety of treatment models, and through the skills development process, the student learns the art and skills of manipulative treatment. Psychomo - tor skills are developed by repeated practice. Reading and observation, although helpful, do not develop the skills required to perform palpatory diagnosis and manipulative treatment. Each student is required to actively participate in all skills development laboratory sessions. These skills are taught by treating and being treated by a cadre of students of both genders and with varying body types to simulate a medical practice setting. Area Health Education Center (AHEC) Program The mission of NSU's Area Health Education Center (AHEC) Program is to improve the access to and the quality of primary health care service to medically underserved communities by linking the resources of academic health centers with community-based health care providers. Nova Southeastern University's College of Osteopathic Medicine, the first medical school in the state of Florida to develop an AHEC Program, offi - cially began its program in 1985. Since its inception, the program College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014Osteopathic Medicine Program 59has worked to develop effective and comprehensive training programs that improve access to quality primary health care for Florida's medically underserved rural and inner-city urban communities. Our nationally recognized program now serves underserved communities and populations throughout a nearly 20,000 square mile area of South and Central Florida. Our first AHEC center\u2014the Everglades AHEC\u2014 reaches underserved areas within a 10-county region extending from the inner city of northern Miami-Dade County to rural communities around Lake Okeechobee. Based on the success of the Everglades AHEC, the univer - sity was awarded additional funding to develop a Central Florida AHEC, which now serves nine counties and extends from Lake Okeechobee to north of Orlando. By including train - ing programs in community settings, we expose students to the challenges, rewards, and practice opportuni - ties related to working in medically underserved areas. Students have opportunities to work together while learning to provide valuable primary care services to the community. Consortium for Excellence in Medical Education (CEME) In January 1999, the College of Osteopathic Medicine established an innovative program to revolutionize clinical education and training. The Consortium for Excellence in Medical Education (CEME), in affiliation with NSU College of Osteopathic Medicine, was formed to increase opportunities for postdoctoral medical training, including internships, resi -dencies, fellowships, and continuing education programs. The CEME is an alliance of affiliated clinical sites linked through elec - tronic networks; teaching, research, and community health collabora - tions; and a shared commitment to excellence in the education of tomor - row's physicians. CEME partners are joining forces on postgraduate clinical education, research initiatives, and public health and preventative medi - cine programs to benefit Florida's elderly, indigent, and minority patient popula - tions. The CEME creates a unified medical education system composed of Nova Southeastern University College of Osteopathic Medicine and 18 teaching hospitals and hospital systems spanning the state of Florida and includes ambulatory centers, county health departments, and social service agencies. Four additional affili - ated programs are located in Georgia, Louisiana, and North Carolina. The CEME, as a dynamic network of affiliated regional academic training centers, uses distance learning systems to strengthen teaching, research, and community health collaboration while also nurturing a shared commitment to excellence in the education of tomorrow's physicians. West Palm Beach Veterans Affairs Medical Center The College of Osteopathic Medi - cine has a major affiliation with the West Palm Beach Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC). This state-of-the-art health care facility's close academic ties with the college includes sharing academic positions, granting faculty appointments to VAMC staff members, a shared resi -60 College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014Osteopathic Medicine Programdency training program in preventive medicine, and major participation in the clinical program of the college. The VAMC employs a computer - ized paperless patient record system. It also permits X rays to be visualized with high resolution, includes labo - ratory and other reports that can be retrieved and tracked, has systems that ensure the selection of appropriate drugs for patient safety, and facilitates arrangements for specialist consulta - tions. Students may spend as much as six months at the facility during their clinical years. Rural Medicine Program Since its establishment in 1979, the College of Osteopathic Medicine has been committed to educating students about rural medicine and having them train in underserved commu - nities. The Department of Rural Medicine's instructional programs have been recognized nationally for helping to meet the health care needs of underserved communities and enhancing the medical skills of our students. Our fourth-year medical students train for three months in rural and underserved settings. They are expected to expand their diagnostic and therapeutic skills as well as their patient and community proficiency in relation to addressing multicul - tural populations. Training sites include community health centers, private physicians' offices, ambulatory care facilities operated by the West Palm Beach Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and leading health care institutions of the Florida Department of Corrections. The Rural Medicine Training Program provides our students with a unique and enriching experience. A number of our graduates are now clinical direc - tors at the community health centers or have established successful prac - tices in a rural Florida region. Preventive Medicine Prevention, in its broadest sense, is practiced by all physicians and other health professionals who help their patients to stay healthy. Preventive medicine, however, is also a distinct medical specialty, one of 25 recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties. The specialty of preventive medi - cine is based on our knowledge that promoting health and preventing disease requires work with both indi - viduals and communities. Preventive medicine physicians are trained in both clinical medicine and public health. They have the skills to under - stand and reduce the risks of disease, disability, and premature death both in individuals and population groups. The distinctive aspects of preven-tive medicine include knowledge and competence in biostatistics bioterrorism epidemiology environmental and occupational health planning, administration, and evaluation of health services the social and behavioral aspects of health and disease the practice of prevention in clinical medicine The American Osteopathic Associa- tion grants certificates to physicians who have successfully completed three years of supervised training and College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014Osteopathic Medicine Program 61a written examination in any one of three areas: general preventive medicine /public health, occupational medicine, or aerospace medicine. Specialists in general preventive medicine /public health focus their skills on population groups, such as the residents of a particular community or state or the patient population of a health center, hospital, or managed care organization. Preventive medicine specialists work in a wide variety of settings, includ - ing primary care and managed care settings, public health and commu - nity agencies, industry, and academia. These physicians usually engage in multiple activities, including plan - ning, administration and evaluation of disease prevention and health promo - tion programs, research, teaching, and direct patient care. The varied career paths include managed care, public health, occupational medicine, aero - space medicine, clinical medicine, informatics, policy development, academic medicine, international medicine, and research, covering all levels of government, educational institutions, organized medical care programs in industry, as well as volun - tary health agencies and health professional organizations. About 6,000 physicians nationally are board-certified in preventive medicine. In addition to the need for more physicians trained in the specialty of preventive medicine, there is a need for more training in prevention in all the other medical specialties, especially in primary care. Toward this end, the Department of Preventive Medicine is initiating efforts to strengthen preven - tion education, particularly in relation to individual patient care. This will be accomplished by weaving the distinc - tive aspects of preventive medicine throughout all coursework offered to medical students at the College of Osteopathic Medicine. Specialists in preventive medicine, who have skills in population-based prevention as well as individual preventive interven - tions, can assist the other specialties in the further development of education in prevention and the population-based health sciences for residents and medical students alike. Geriatric Teaching Program The College of Osteopathic Medicine has a strong commitment to teach - ing students, residents, and physicians about the care of the geriatric patient. As a result, the college requires a didactic geriatric course in the M-2 year, which addresses \"successful aging.\" Attention is given to elderly populations and their diverse profiles and circumstances. During the M-3 year, students participate in a month - long, required geriatric clerkship, where they care for elders in a variety of settings under the supervision of a geriatric specialist. The College of Osteopathic Medi - cine also provides clinical teaching in geriatrics for second-year family medicine residents from its Palmetto Family Medicine Residency during a one-month rotation. The College of Osteopathic Medicine, along with the North Broward Hospital District, sponsors a geriatric fellowship training program for family medicine physi - cians who successfully complete an American College of Osteopathic Family Physicians (ACOFP) approved family medicine residency program. This will prepare the physician for a Certificate of Added Qualifications (CAQ) in geriatrics. We are excited about what we are doing in geriatrics 62 College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014Osteopathic Medicine Programand are looking for ways to expand our programs and teaching facilities.

It is designed to train future leaders in the development, dissemi - nation, and evaluation of information technology as it relates to health care environments, such as hospitals, health systems, health information technology system vendors, eHealth companies, insurers, pharmaceutical companies, and academic institutions. This innovative distance program uses a completely online format to enable working professionals to earn a master's degree in biomedical infor - matics without career disruption. There has been an emergence of biomedical informatics as a discipline due to advances in computer and communications technology and an increasing awareness of the exponen - tial growth of biomedical knowledge. This has been accompanied by clinical information that has become unman - ageable by traditional, paper-based methods and the growing realization that the process involved in knowl - edge retrieval and decision making are important to modern biomedicine and clinical decision making. Biomedical informatics is an interdisci - plinary field that incorporates computer and information sciences, cognitive and decision sciences, epidemiology, telecommunications, and other fields. Researchers in this evolving field discover new methods and techniques to enhance health care, biomedi -78 College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014Biomedical Informatics Program improving the ability to collabo - rate with other health organizations including hospitals, health depart - ments, medical societies, and clinicians in rural and remote areas Those who are part of the biomedi - cal informatics community have the potential to seriously confront many issues that need to be addressed in health care. These issues include predicting who will become sick preventing health complications or problems in individuals making effective interventions in large populations reducing adverse complications in health care overcoming physician resistance to intricate systems and information technology maximizing constrained resources Course of Study The M.S.B.I. Program is designed to prepare students for careers in infor - mation management, teaching, and research in academic health centers, other health care institutions and organizations, and the health care computing industry. It has become almost axiomatic that the organization and retrieval of information is essential for the development of new knowl - edge. The quality of a medical school's computing and information technology environment will profoundly affect its ability to compete in both education and research. In addition, the quality of the biomedical informatics program will influence a school's opportunities to collaborate with health organizations such as hospitals, health departments, cal research, and education through information technology. Those in this discipline study and encourage the use of appropriate information to support clinical care, research, teaching, and health services information. Biomedical informatics allows physi - cians and other health professionals to integrate advanced information system capabilities and highly trained individu - als with a clinical outlook and approach. The methods, tools, and resources devel - oped through biomedical informatics often help physicians and other health professionals accomplish tasks that they were already doing, but in a more effi - cient, perhaps more accurate, or even entirely new manner. It also allows for the performance of tasks that were not previously possible. Informational technology now provides physicians and other health professionals with the potential to access large databases. As a result, they can now begin to think like epidemiologists, in addition to being providers of patient care. Specific areas of added value provided by biomedical informatics include analyzing information to develop new knowledge and information developing action plans to use the new knowledge and to maintain a continuous quality- improvement cycle using information and feedback to create an impact on organizational performance improving the quality of an academic health center's computing and information technology envi - ronment to profoundly influence its ability to compete in education and research College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014Biomedical Informatics Program 79medical societies, and physicians in remote areas. The major areas included in the M.S.B.I. education program are computer science and its clinical application in medical informatics, management, and program evaluations of health information technology. The program provides a course of study leading to a master's degree that will lead to the use of information science to enhance clinical performance use of information science to improve patient safety (e.g., reduce medical errors) acquisition of a position in medical informatics in a health care environment At the end of the course of study leading to the degree of master of science in biomedical informatics, the graduate will be able to layout and design an information system understand the fundamentals of a telecommunication network design and the Internet have in-depth knowledge of data- base systems and structures evaluate medical information tech - nology to determine what should be integrated into clinical medicine employ the knowledge, skills, and concepts of biomedical informatics in evidence-based medicine understand documentation require - ments for medical records, including risk management and patient safety have knowledge in information security and policy formation be current about existing and emerging technology in biomedical informatics and related areas have a basic understanding of biosta - tistics and epidemiology and their application to biomedical informatics use and apply interface design prin - ciples to biomedical informatics systems Admission to the Master of Science in Biomedical Informatics The M.S.B.I.

Harris, B.S., Pharm.D. Assistant Dean, Experiential Educa - Carvajal , Pharmacy Practice Pharmaceutical Sciences Mark L. Palm Beach Program Reyes Director, Puerto Rico Program Goar Director, Pharmacy Services Leanne College of PharmacyPharmacy With the nation struggling to deliver high quality, affordable health care, there has come a greater appreciation of the importance of pharmacists as members of today's health care team. The pharmacist's role has expanded rapidly from drug compounding and distribution to a more patient- oriented role. The College of Pharmacy is educating its students in practices vital to meeting the challenges facing the profession and important to improving health and reducing health care costs. The College of Pharmacy admitted its first class in 1987 to become the first College of Pharmacy in South Florida. Since then, it has graduated more than 2,700 pharmacy profession - als. The college offers the doctor of pharmacy (Pharm.D.) degree program and will begin offering a graduate Ph.D. program in 2010. Pharmacists are experts on drugs and therapeutic goals, their biological action and uses, formulation, adverse effects, and potential for drug interac - tions. However, pharmacists are not only knowledgeable about drugs, they must also be people-oriented. They consider both the medication and the patient to ensure the patient has the right drug, in the right amount, for the right length of time, and with minimal adverse effects. The result is improved health care. Most pharmacists practice in patient- oriented settings: in community pharmacies, hospitals, extended care facilities, or public health clinics. In addition, pharmacists are employed by the pharmaceutical industry in research and development, in manu - facturing, or as medical service representatives. They work in academic institutions, government, health maintenance organizations, and home health care programs. It is because of these challenges and opportunities that pharmacy has assumed a wider role and become an increasingly rewarding profession involving patient counseling, compli - ance, and education. The shortage of pharmacists has become so critical that colleges of pharmacy would have to double their enrollments to meet the projected needs of the health care system. Accreditation The Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education, 20 North Clark Street, Suite 2500, Chicago, IL 60602-5109, (312) 664-3575, 800-533-3606; Fax (312) 664-4652, Web site: www.acpe-accredit.org , has accredited the Doctor of Pharmacy Program of the College of Pharmacy, Nova Southeastern University. The College of Pharmacy is a member of the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy. Facilities The College of Pharmacy is head - quartered on the third floor of the Health Professions Division Admin - istration Building. Pharmacy practice and research laboratories are located on the third floor of the Library / Laboratories Building, near the Health Professions Division's research labora - tories. Experiential sites are primarily located throughout Central and South Florida. In the fall of 2000, the NSU College of Pharmacy opened a West Palm Beach program on RCA Boulevard College of Pharmacy 97near I-95 and PGA Boulevard. In the fall of 2001, a full-time program on the campus of Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Puerto Rico in Ponce, Puerto Rico, was opened. The only distinction between the Fort Lauder - dale campus-based degree and the distance degree is geography. Each location has a program director, administrators, and faculty and staff members. Interactive video technol - ogy is used to provide lectures among the three sites simultaneously. This provides for live interaction between lecturer and students regardless of location. Identical handouts, tests, and texts are used. Communica - tion through telephone, fax, online technologies, and email are available to students at all sites. All students have access to the Health Profes - sions Division Library, computer labs, online learning resources, and the vast technological innovations provided by NSU, which has been a leader in distance education programs for many years. The pharmaceutical care center and pharmacy are adjacent to the health clinic in Fort Lauderdale. This is a community pharmacy with disease management services for diabe - tes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, and anticoagulation. It also manages pharmacy services, including drug regimen review, consultation, and teaching. The College of Pharmacy's Drug Informa - tion Center meets a pressing demand among health care professionals for accurate, up-to-date information on medications, their adverse effects, incompatibilities, potential for inter - actions, and related legal issues.Financial Aid The purpose of the Student Finan - cial Assistance Program at Nova Southeastern University is to help as many qualified students as possible to complete their pharmacy education. Various loans, scholarships, and grants are available to qualified students to help ease the high cost of a health professions education. Approximately 90 percent of College of Pharmacy students receive some form of finan - cial assistance. These financial assistance programs are described in a separate university publication: A Guide to Student Financial Assistance . Although most first-year pharmacy students will be classified as graduate students for financial aid purposes, students who matriculate with fewer than 90 semester hours and students in the dual-admission program will be classified as undergraduates for the first year in the College of Pharmacy. Transfer Credits Requests for transfer credit must be submitted in writing to the exec- utive associate dean.

Accordingly, tuition will not be adjusted as a result of any change in residency status after initial enroll - ment registration. Tuition\u2014Ponce, Puerto Rico Tuition for 2010-2011 (subject to change by the board of trustees without notice) is $23,898 (U.S.) for Puerto Rico residents and $28,265 (U.S.) for nonresident students. A Health Professions Division general access fee of $145 is required each year. An NSU student services fee of $750 is also required annually. Acceptance fee is $500. This fee is required to reserve the accepted applicant's place in the entering first-year class. This advance payment will be deducted from the tuition payment due on registration day, but is not refund - able in the event of a withdrawal. It is payable within three weeks of an applicant's acceptance. Preregistration fee is $500. This is due March 15, under the same terms as the acceptance fee. The first semester's tuition and fees, less the $1,000 previously paid, are due on or before registration day. Tuition for each subsequent semester is due on or before the appropriate registration day. Students will not be permitted to register until their financial obligations have been met. The financial ability of applicants to complete their training at the college is important because of the limited number of positions available in each class. Applicants should have specific plans for financing 102 College of Pharmacy\u2014Entry-Level Programfour years of professional education. This should include tuition, living expenses, books, equipment, and miscellaneous expenses. Undergraduate /Pharm.D. Dual Admission Program Nova Southeastern University Health Professions Division has established a dual admission program with the Nova Southeastern Univer - sity Farquhar College of Arts and Sciences, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Puerto Rico, and Inter - national College in Naples, Florida, for a select number of highly moti- vated, qualified students interested in pursuing both an undergraduate education and professional studies in pharmacy. This allows students to receive their undergraduate bachelor of science degree and a doctor of pharmacy degree in a six- to eight- year period. Candidates must maintain a specified GPA and achieve acceptable scores on the Pharmacy College Admissions Test (PCAT). Students will spend two to three years in the undergradu - ate school and then will be awarded a B.S. degree upon successful comple - tion of the second /third year at Nova Southeastern University College of Pharmacy. Students will receive the doctor of pharmacy degree after successfully complet - ing the four-year Pharm.D. program at Nova Southeastern University College of Pharmacy. For information and requirements, contact one of the following: Office of Admissions Farquhar College of Arts and Sciences Nova Southeastern University 3301 College Avenue Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33314-7796 Office of Admissions Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Puerto Rico 2250 Avenida Las Americas Suite 584 Ponce, Puerto Rico 00717-0777 Office of Admissions International College 2655 Northbrooke Drive Naples, Florida 34119 Internship An internship is a requirement for licensure. The internship must be completed within the guidelines of the Florida Board of Pharmacy as set forth in the Rule, Chapter 64B16-26.400(4), or by the Board of Pharmacy in the state in which the student plans to fulfill the requirements for internship. A Social Security number is necessary in order to obtain an intern license from the state of Florida. It is the responsibil - ity of any student who does not have U.S. citizenship or permanent resident status to ensure that his or her visa status allows for the issue of a Social Security number. An intern license is a requirement for placement on prac - tice experiences. Without practice experiences, a student cannot complete the curriculum or the requirements of the Pharm.D. degree program. Any student who has concerns regarding visa or Social Security status should contact the Office of International Students by phone at (954) 262-7241 or 800-541-6682, extension 27241, or by email at intl@nsu.nova.edu . The college's director of experiential programs provides assistance and guidance to students regarding internships. College of Pharmacy\u2014Entry-Level Program 103Course of Study The doctor of pharmacy degree is awarded after successful completion of four years of professional study in the College of Pharmacy. The curriculum stresses innovative teaching delivery and assessment methods. Students are provided an initial orientation during which they are exposed to library and online resources, profes - sionalism, and academic expectations. The curriculum is designed so courses integrate information and build on one another in order to provide students with the knowledge and skills necessary to be successful in the profes - sion. The didactic component of the curriculum builds a foundation in the medical and pharmaceutical sciences. Traditional courses in anatomy and physiology, biochemistry, and microbiology are provided in order to develop a solid foundation. Phar - maceutical sciences courses including Pharmaceutics, Pharmacokinetics, and Nonprescription Therapies are designed to provide students with a strong understanding of the princi - ples of drug therapy. The innovative curriculum also includes the inte - gration of medicinal chemistry and pharmacology into one course titled Pharmacodynamics, which runs four semesters. Insight into the business, human relations, communication, marketing, and legal aspects of phar - macy and the health care system are also provided. The third year of the curriculum includes courses that focus on applica - tion of material learned during the first two years. Therapeutics is integrated with pathophysiology to address the use of drugs in the disease process and physical assessment provides the students with hands-on opportunities to develop skills essential to moni - toring drug therapy. Students hone their analytical skills with courses in research design and statistics, pharma - coepidemiology, pharmacoeconomics, and drug literature evaluation. All students must also complete a minimum of 6 semester hours of elec - tive credit. Unique aspects of the first three years of the curriculum include an introductory pharmacy practice expe - rience program and an integrated laboratory. Opportunities for the students to experience pharmacy practice first hand are provided early in the curriculum. In the first year, students spend four hours per week in a service learning experience. In the second year of the curriculum, students spend four hours per week in a community pharmacy setting. Practice experiences in the third year involve eight hours per week in hospi - tal and pharmacy service settings. Patient Care Management Lab is initiated during the third year. This provides an opportunity for students to integrate information learned in all courses of the curriculum in order to facilitate application of the mate - rial in real-life practice settings. During the fourth year, the expe - riential component includes nine 160-hour experiences: four in core practice areas and five elective experi - ences in specialty areas. At this point of the curriculum, it is expected that the students practice drug therapy monitoring with more independence. In the last month of the curriculum, all students will return to campus for updates on new and changing drug therapy, for presentations, and for board exam preparation.104 College of Pharmacy\u2014Entry-Level ProgramNote: The advanced practice experi - ences are full-time commitments for the students (a minimum of 40 hours per week). Students are assigned to approved off-campus facilities and must arrange their own transporta - tion. Experiences may be taken in any sequence, however students may not enroll in advanced practice expe - riences until all didactic work has been satisfactorily completed. There are currently few advancecd phar - macy practice sites in Puerto Rico for the entry-level students. Students must expect to use Florida sites for most experiences. The curriculum is designed so that knowledge gained in one semester becomes the foundation for material covered in subsequent semesters. Therefore, if students do not successfully complete the course - work specified for one semester, it will impede their ability to take courses in the future semesters. (Students have 60 days after the end of the semester to resolve any grade disputes; after that, the instructor may discard all materials from the semester.) This may lead to a delay in graduation. The program must be completed within seven years from the date of matriculation. Study Abroad Opportunities for study abroad programs are provided during the summer. Graduation Requirements To receive a degree, a student must fulfill the following requirements: be of good moral character pass all required courses complete a minimum of 139 semester hours of coursework in the College of Pharmacy within seven years satisfactorily complete the assigned curriculum requirements for the degree, including all assignments, with a GPA of 2.0 on a four-point scale or a numerical average of 70 percent or above satisfactorily complete the capstone examination satisfactorily meet all financial and library obligations complete a minimum of 16 credit hours of didactic course - work in addition to five advanced experiences if transferring submit to the registrar's office an application for degree /diploma by March 15.

Administration David Loshin Bacigalupi , M.S., O.D., FAAO Rouse , O.D., FAAO Chief Operations Officer, The Eye Institute Heidi Wagner , O.D., M.P .H., FAAO Chair, Didactic EducationOptometry Sight is one of our most precious gifts and the optometric physician is dedicated to the preservation and enhancement of this gift. The optometric physician, through aca - demic and clinical training, is able to examine, diagnose, treat, and manage disorders and diseases of the visual system and associated structures. Optometry is constantly evolving as a profession to enable optometric physicians to broaden their scope as the primary eye-care practitioner. The profession of optometry offers many challenges and rewards to those willing to devote themselves to serv - ing others through a lifetime of study and dedication to excellence. T oday's optometrists practice in urban and rural communities throughout the nation, in individual or group practices, hospital settings, centers for vision research, and in the pub - lic health service. They also take part in teaching, research, and public health. Nova Southeastern University College of Optometry stands alone as the only optometric academic institu - tion in the state of Florida. Furthermore, the college benefits from the integrated multidisciplinary health care programs of the uni - versity's Health Professions Division, represented by optometry, osteo - pathic medicine, dental medicine, pharmacy, and allied health and nurs - ing. Nova Southeastern University takes pride in the optometry degree program, which provides a strong didactic and clinical education.

Reapplicants If you are reapplying to Nova Southeastern University's College of Optometry, please take time to answer these additional questions. In order to fully consider your applica - tion, it will be necessary for you to submit the answers to these questions (on a separate sheet of paper) with your secondary application. Why are you interested in reap - plying to Nova Southeastern University's College of Optometry? What have you been doing since your last application to Nova Southeastern University's College of Optometry? What changes in your applica - tion make you a more competitive candidate? Tuition and Fees Tuition\u2014Tuition for 2010-2011 (subject to change by the board of trustees without notice) is $22,800 for Florida residents and $27,575 for out-of-state residents. A Health Professions Division general access fee of $145 is required each year. An NSU student services fee of $750 is also required annually. Eligible students must request in- state tuition on their application. For tuition purposes, a student's Florida residency status (in-state or out-of-state) will be determined at initial matriculation and will remain the same throughout the entire enrollment of the student at NSU. Accordingly, tuition will not be adjusted as a result of any change in residency status after ini - tial enrollment registration. Acceptance fee is $250. This fee is required to reserve the accepted applicant's place in the enter - ing first-year class. This advance payment will be deducted from the first tuition payment, but is not refundable in case of withdrawal. It is payable within two weeks of the applicant's acceptance. Deposit is $750, due April 15, under the same terms as the accep - tance fee. College laboratory/equipment fee is $50 per year, due at time of registration. The financial ability of applicants to complete their training is important because of the limited number of posi - tions available. Applicants should have specific plans for financing four years of professional education. This should include provision for tuition, living expenses, books and equipment, travel, and miscellaneous expenses. College of Optometry 147Financial Aid The function of the Student Financial Assistance Program at Nova Southeastern University is to help as many qualified students as possible to complete their optometric education.

Additionally, students begin training in the primary care clinic by providing direct patient eye care. The fourth year of the academic program is entirely clinical with intensive training in university-based or affiliated primary, secondary, and tertiary care facilities. These include clinics dealing with contact lenses, pediatrics, binocular vision, low vision, and geriatric issues. Students also receive training in medical/ sur- gical tertiary care settings. By the completion of the program, our students have been trained to be optometric physicians capable of pro - viding quality eye care. Extended (Five-Year) Doctor of Optometry Degree The College of Optometry has insti - tuted an extended program leading to the Doctor of Optometry (O.D.) degree. The extended program is designed for individuals who are returning to school after an absence, are changing profes - sional fields, or who require a lighter course load initially because of fam - ily or other obligations. Students in the extended program take courses with the full time students but with a reduced course load. Coursework covered in the first two years of the traditional full-time program is cov - ered in three years in the extended program. The last two years of both programs are identical. The curricu - lum and graduation requirements for the extended and full-time programs are the same. The enrollment for the extended program is limited. The dean of the College of Optometry will make the final determination on eligibility for the extended program. Tuition for 2010-2011 (subject to change by the board of trustees) is $18,789 for Florida residents and $22,270 for out-of-state residents for the first three years. T uition reverts to the regular rate for the fourth and fifth years. Student Organizations The College of Optometry Student Government Association (OSGA) is the official voice of all optometry students. The OSGA welcomes input and participation from the entire stu - dent body. Its responsibilities include collecting and expressing student opinion, dispensing funds for student activities, acting as liaison for the student body, promoting optometry, supporting club and class activities, and working to improve the qual - ity of life for students at the College of Optometry.

(3 credits) College of Allied Health and Nursing\u2014Occupational Therapy Department 183Occupational therapists provide services to enhance participation and function in daily occupations, including self care, work, and leisure. Occupational therapists frequently work with individuals when per - formance has been interrupted or jeopardized by disease, injury, disabil - ity, life stress, or other factors. Therapy consists of clients' planned involve - ment in occupation\u2014purposeful and meaningful activities\u2014that positively influences their life adaptation. This involvement in occupation may be facilitated by supportive training, spe - cialized equipment, environmental modification and/or problem solving to accomplish life tasks. The therapeutic process is founded upon the belief that individuals are the principal agents of their own adaptation, and through active involvement in occupation, can have a significant impact on their health status, recovery from illness, and adjustment to disability. The occupational therapist must be an expert in the knowledge of occupa - tion, its role in health and adaptation, and its use in therapy. Occupational therapy practice requires the thera - pist to exercise increasingly complex, autonomous decision-making and problem-solving skills in multifactorial situations. The therapist must, there - fore, be a critical thinker, capable of evaluating and synthesizing informa - tion from a variety of sources about a wide range of phenomena. Finally, the therapist should be a reflective practi - tioner able to evaluate his or her own clinical reasoning.The NSU Occupational Therapy Department offers an entry-level Master of Occupational Therapy (M.O.T.) degree and two post - professional degrees: a Doctor of Occupational Therapy (Dr.OT), and a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.). The M.O.T. program is a full-time, campus- based entry-level program. The M.O.T. is designed so that a student may enter after completing an undergraduate or graduate degree or after completing 90 credits of undergraduate work from a regionally accredited college or uni - versity (with a minimum of 30 credits of upper division.) The Dr.OT and Ph.D. are postprofessional OT degrees offered through distance education. Accreditation The entry-level Master of Occupa - tional Therapy is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Occupa - tional Therapy Education (ACOTE) of the American Occupational Ther - apy Association (AOTA), located at 4720 Montgomery Lane, P.O. Box 31220, Bethesda, Maryland 20824-1220. ACOTE's telephone number, care of AOTA, is (301) 652-AOTA. Graduates of the program will be eligible to sit for the national certification examination for the occupational therapist adminis - tered by the National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy (NBCOT). After successful comple - tion of this exam, the individual will be an Occupational Therapist, Regis - tered (OTR). In addition, most states require licensure in order to practice; however, state licenses are usually based on the results of the NBCOT certification examination. Note that a Occupational Therapy Department184 College of Allied Health and Nursing\u2014Occupational Therapy Departmentfelony conviction may affect a gradu - ate's ability to sit for the NBCOT certification examination or attain state licensure.

(3 credits) College of Allied Health and Nursing\u2014Physical Therapy Department 205Physical therapists are health care professionals who diagnose and treat movement dysfunction that results in physical impairment and disability. In addition to providing direct patient care services, physical therapists serve as administrators of physical therapy services, educators, and consultants. They screen people for potential risk for movement dysfunction in order to prevent impairment and disability and engage in critical inquiry to conduct and review research. Physical therapists work in a range of settings including acute and subacute care hospitals, rehabilitation cen - ters, outpatient clinics, home health, skilled nursing facilities, school sys - tems, and industrial settings. Physical therapists may work as employees of health care systems, may indepen - dently contract their services, or own and manage a private practice. In any setting, for every patient, physi - cal therapists perform a history and physical examination; conduct assess - ments to determine a diagnosis; select, perform, and supervise appropriate physical therapy interventions; and monitor the effectiveness of treatment. Physical therapists are licensed in all states and may practice without physi - cian referral in most of them. They are integral members of health care teams in a variety of service systems who serve to improve and maintain the quality of life for millions of people. More than 900,000 people a day are helped by physical therapists to restore health, alleviate pain, and prevent the onset of disease.The mission of the Nova Southeastern University Physical Therapy Depart- ment is to prepare and advance physical therapists as primary care providers who stand beside other health care pro - viders, in any setting, in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of movement- related dysfunction. In addition, the Physical Therapy Department fosters critical inquiry, research, lifelong learn - ing, and service to the profession and the community. Physical Therapy Student Organizations Student Council The Physical Therapy Student Council is the official voice of all students. The organization is open to all students and welcomes proposals and participa - tion from the entire student body.

The topic, methodology, and depth of the study will be determined by the supervising faculty member. Though this is a group project, stu - dents will receive individual grades for the work they contributed to the project. (3 credits) PHT 6914\u2014Neuromuscular II Neuromuscular II integrates concepts from Neuroscience and Neuromuscular Systems I to engage students in the patient/client management of patients with neuromuscular dysfunction. Students are exposed to a variety of case studies, representing all adult neuromuscular practice patterns in the Guide to Physical Therapist Practice, to integrate and apply previously learned neuromuscular skills to patient scenarios. Emphasis is placed on clinical reasoning during all steps of patient/client management, the ability to apply evidence in practice, design and execution of patient/client-related instruction, delegation to support personnel, and documentation of all aspects of care. This class also addresses primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention for patients with neuromuscular conditions. (2 credits) PHT 6914L\u2014 Neuromuscular II Lab This course is the laboratory com - ponent of Neuromuscular II. In it, students will perform all aspects of patient/client management including examination, evaluation, diagnosis, prognosis, development of a plan of care, procedural interventions, and outcome measurement. Students will apply these techniques to a vari -ety of case studies, representing the scope of adult practice patterns in the Guide to Physical Therapist Practice. Neuromuscular II culminates in an intense, one-week laboratory experi - ence, the Neuro Boot Camp, in which students work with real patients who have complicated neuromuscular dis - orders in a faculty-supervised setting. Students are responsible for perform - ing a thorough examination, writing a comprehensive plan of care, perform - ing procedural interventions, providing patient instruction, and communicat - ing with caregivers. (2 credits) PHT 6915\u2014 Prosthetics and Orthotics Students will acquire the skills needed to manage movement-related problems in patients with amputations because of diabetes, burns, trauma, oncologi - cal problems, and genetic conditions. They will study upper and lower extremity prosthetics and orthotics and spinal orthotics. Orthotic needs associated with obesity, arthritis, pain, etc., will be addressed, as well. (3 credits) PHT 6920\u2014 Applied Clinical Decision Making Students apply problem solving heu - ristics, analyze case presentations of multifactor movement dysfunction, synthesize patient problem lists from collected data, develop intervention strategies, and evaluate the outcome of assessment and intervention deci - sions. The course integrates material from the foundational medical and clinical sciences and student clini - cal experiences. Accordingly, students demonstrate differential diagnosis and treatment planning across the life span as well as select and justify inter - ventions, recommend referrals, and establish discharge dispositions.226 College of Allied Health and Nursing\u2014Physical Therapy DepartmentStudent learning and course participa - tion is driven by mock and real clinical cases and clinical experiences. Content experts guide cognitive domain discus - sion and the decision-making process, assess the affective domain and com - pliance with professional ethical standards, and evaluate complex overt performance of psychomotor tasks. Students will develop initial plans for examination and assessment, perform assessments, analyze and interpret test results, prepare written intervention plans, perform interventions, and sug - gest potential outcome assessments. Students will justify and modify treat - ment plans to account for changes in the patients' status. In addition, stu - dents will prepare and present a clinical case report to the assembled class at the conclusion of the term. Topics for the clinical cases and clinical experi - ences will cover a broad spectrum of conditions seen by physical therapists in the clinical setting. (4 credits) PHT 6911\u2014Tier IIA Clinical Education Internship This is the first of four senior, full- time, clinical affiliation courses. This course will provide senior physical therapy students with the opportu - nities to practice clinical decision making based on evidence and develop entry-level physical therapy skills for patient/client management in a variety of clinical settings on a full-time basis. Students will apply their knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors in community-based physi - cal therapy settings. Tier II clinical education encompasses on-campus orientation and 32 weeks of full- time, senior-level clinical internships during fall and winter semesters. Students will typically rotate through four, eight-week clinical place - ments in a variety of health care organizations; schedule modifications may be made to accommodate facil - ity requirements or other needs. The goal of all placements is for student achievement of entry-level compe - tency and professional behaviors in all settings. Students must complete at least one internship in an acute care/inpatient or subacute setting, a neurorehabilitation setting, and an outpatient setting. The remaining internship may be completed in the venue or setting of the student's choice, including outpatient clinics; rehabilitation hospitals or units; spe - cialty practices including pediatrics, sports, workers' compensation/ergo - nomics; or women's and men's health, as available. During the full-time internship, students will focus on patient/client management models by performing patient examinations, evaluations, determining diagnoses, prognoses, and interventions (POC) within the context of the clinical setting utilizing the Guide to Physical Therapist Practice . It is expected that through the Tier II clinical education experiences, students will demon - strate appropriate management skills of patients/clients across the adult life span or across the continuum of care commonly seen in physical therapy practice. Students are expected to demonstrate effective communica - tion and documentation skills and to develop their professionalism con - sistent with the APTA core values, cultural competence, and ethical and legal practice.

(1 credit)* Physician Assistant Department\u2014 Fort Lauderdale Physician assistants (PAs) serve as essential components of a medi - cal system that continues to struggle to provide quality, affordable health care for all Americans. Their roles in the system will continue to grow as changes in health care indicate. Today, more than 88,000 individuals are eligible to practice as PAs under physician supervision. PAs provide care that would otherwise be provided by physicians. PAs take medical histories, perform physical examinations, order and interpret tests, diagnose and treat illnesses, perform medical /surgical pro - cedures, assist in surgery, and can write prescriptions in all states. PAs work in most medical specialities and in all types of communities. Many PAs prac - tice family and internal medicine, and more than one-third are in towns with fewer than 50,000 residents. The PA profession is one of the fastest growing health care professions. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that employment of PAs is expected to grow 39 percent from 2008 to 2018. It is the obligation of each physician / PA team to ensure that the PA's scope of practice is identified; that delega - tion of medical tasks is appropriate to the PA's level of competence; that the relationship of, and access to, the supervisory physician is defined; and that a process of performance evaluation is established. Adequate responsible supervision of the PA con - tributes to both high-quality patient care and professional growth. The Physician Assistant Department offers an innovative program that lasts 27 months. Upon successful completion of study, students will be awarded the master of medical sci - ence degree in physician assistant. The curriculum includes rigorous instruction in basic science subjects, followed by clinical medicine, physi - cal diagnosis, clinical laboratory medicine, clinical pathophysiology, clinical procedures and surgical skills, electrocardiography, pharmacology, radiology, and others. Students also take courses that include health care law and ethics, epidemiology and bio - statistics, research methodology, and cultural issues in health care. During the clinical year of study, the student participates in challenging 246 College of Allied Health and Nursing\u2014Physician Assistant Departmentclinical rotations at a variety of health care facilities associated with the pro - gram. These rotations include family medicine, internal medicine, pediat - rics, gynecology and prenatal care, emergency medicine, and surgery, all complemented by three elective rota - tions. NSU graduates are prepared to work in many clinical areas, both in primary care and specialty medicine.

(54-0-3)260 College of Allied Health and Nursing\u2014Physician Assistant DepartmentPhysician Assistant Department\u2014 Southwest Florida Physician assistants (PAs) serve as essen - tial components of a medical system that continues to struggle to provide quality, affordable health care for all Americans. Their roles in the system will continue to grow as changes in health care indicate. Today, more than 88,000 individuals are eligible to prac - tice as PAs under physician supervision. PAs provide care that would other - wise be provided by physicians. PAs take medical histories, perform physical examinations, order and interpret tests, diagnose and treat illnesses, perform medical /surgical procedures, assist in surgery, and can write prescriptions in all states. PAs work in most medical specialties and in all types of communi - ties. Many practice family and internal medicine, and more than one-third are in towns with fewer than 50,000 resi - dents. The PA profession was ranked the fourth fastest growing profession in the country by CNN.com and Forbes. com in 2007. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that employment of PAs is expected to grow 39 percent from 2008 to 2018. It is the obligation of each physician / PA team to ensure that the PA's scope of practice is identified; that delega - tion of medical tasks is appropriate to the PA's level of competence; that the relationship with, and access to, the supervisory physician is defined; and that a process of performance evaluation is established. Adequate responsible supervision of the PA con - tributes to both high-quality patient care and professional growth.The Physician Assistant Department\u2014 Southwest Florida offers an innovative program that lasts 27 months. Upon successful completion of study, students will earn a master of medical science (M.M.S.) in physician assistant degree. The curriculum includes rigorous instruction in the basic sciences, clini - cal medicine, physical diagnosis, clinical laboratory medicine, clinical pathophys - iology, clinical procedures and surgical skills, electrocardiography, radiology, psychiatry, legal and ethical issues in health care, cultural issues in health care, interpretation and evaluation of medical literature, complementary medicine and nutrition, and clinical pharmacology. During the clinical year of study, the student participates in clinical rota - tions throughout the state of Florida, primarily within 80-100 miles from NSU's Fort Myers Student Educational Center. These rotations include family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, gynecology and prenatal care, emergency medicine, and surgery, all complemented by three elective rotations. Each student should expect to complete at least one rotation in a rural or underserved area. With a sound foundation in medical training, NSU graduates are prepared to work in many clinical areas, both in primary care and specialty medicine. Accreditation The NSU Physician Assistant Program\u2014Southwest Florida is accredited by the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for Physician Assistants, Inc., (ARC-PA). The NSU PA Department\u2014Southwest Florida was initially awarded provi - sional accreditation in 2005 and received full, continuing accredita - tion in 2007.

Course of Study The Physician Assistant Program curriculum is completed following attainment of a baccalaureate degree, including specified course prerequisites. The comprehensive curriculum, com - pleted in a consecutive manner, is oriented to primary care and prepares the student to practice in a wide vari - ety of clinical settings. The first 14 months of study consist of basic sci - ences and clinically related didactic courses. All courses are required and must be successfully completed before advancing to the clinical year. During this time frame, students are gener - ally in class from Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., although there are occasional evening and/or weekend hours. Because of its highly integrated and compact curriculum, the PA department requires matricu - lants to complete the entire curriculum at NSU Southwest Florida. The clinical year is devoted to 13 months of clinical training with required clinical rotations in family medicine, emergency medicine, pediat - rics, prenatal care /gynecology, surgery, and internal medicine. The students also complete three elective rotations, for a total of nine clinical rotations. The required subject rotations and two of the elective rotations are six weeks in length. The remaining elective rota - tion is four weeks in length. All required rotations must be completed in the state of Florida, primarily in an area within 100 miles from the Fort Myers Student Educational Center. Each student should expect to com - plete at least one rotation in a rural or underserved area. Each required rotation has assigned readings and learning objectives. At the end of each required rotation, a written comprehensive subject exami - nation is administered and must be passed. During rotations, students will be supervised by licensed practitioners and will actively participate in patient assessments, perform common labora - tory procedures, interpret common diagnostic examinations, and help manage common medical problems. The work hours during clinical rota - tions are set by the preceptor and can include evening and weekend hours. Students are required to work a mini - mum of 40 hours per week, although many rotation sites require a greater student participation. Upon completion of the course of study, students will have earned a master of medical science (M.M.S.) in physician assistant degree. Graduates will be eli - gible to take the Physician Assistant National Certification Examination (PANCE) administered by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants (NCCPA). The role of the physician assistant requires a high level of expertise and responsibility. The applicant must possess the ability and desire to com - plete a rigorous academic and clinical program and make a commitment to continued learning.

(4-90-3) Physician Assistant Department\u2014Orlando Physician assistants (PAs) serve as an essential component of a medi - cal system that continues to strive to provide quality, affordable health care for all individuals. Their roles in the system will continue to grow as changes in health care indicate. Today, more than 88,000 individuals are eligible to practice as PAs under physician supervision. PAs provide care that would otherwise be provided by physicians. PAs take medical his - tories, perform physical examinations, order and interpret tests, diagnose and treat illnesses, perform medical/surgi -cal procedures, assist in surgery, and can write prescriptions in all states. PAs work in most medical specialties and in all types of communities. Many practice in primary care settings, and more than one-third are in towns with fewer than 50,000 residents. The PA profession is one of the fastest growing health care professions. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that employment of PAs is expected to grow 39 percent from 2008 to 2018. It is the obligation of each physi - cian/PA team to ensure that the PA's scope of practice is identified; that delegation of medical tasks is appro - priate to the PA's level of competence; that the relationship of, and access to, the supervisory physician is defined; and that a process of performance evaluation is established. Adequate responsible supervision of the PA con - tributes to both high-quality patient care and professional growth. The Physician Assistant Department\u2014 Orlando offers a modern program that lasts 27 months. Upon successful completion of study, the student is awarded a Master of Medical Science degree in Physician Assistant. The cur - riculum includes rigorous instructions in basic science subjects, followed by clinical medicine, physical diagnosis, clinical laboratory medicine, clinical pathophysiology, clinical procedures, surgical skills, electrocardiography and radiology, and psychiatry. The student also takes courses in the Master of Medical Science program including health care law and eth - ics, epidemiology and biostatistics, research methodology, cultural issues in health care, publication skills, and medical research, as well as a graduate project. College of Allied Health and Nursing\u2014Physician Assistant Department 275During the clinical year of study, the student participates in clinical rota - tions predominantly in Central Florida. Required six-week rotations include family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, gynecology and prenatal care, emergency medicine, general sur - gery, and one selective of six weeks from one of the following areas: der - matology, otorhinolaryngology, or orthopedics. The clinical year contains one six-week and one four-week elec - tive rotation. With a sound foundation in medical training, NSU graduates are prepared to work in many clinical areas, both in primary care and spe - cialty medicine.

Each stu -dent is required to carry adequate personal medical and hospital insur - ance. Students may avail themselves of the hospitalization insurance plan obtainable through the university. Due to the demands of the PA cur - riculum, the program discourages any outside employment. The program does not allow working for NSU or any of the associated clinical training sites. Requirements for Graduation In order to be eligible to graduate from the Physician Assistant Program, stu - dents must successfully complete all academic and clinical courses and degree requirements have satisfactorily met all financial and library obligations attend, in person, the rehearsal and commencement program, at which time the degree is conferred Academic Dismissal in the Physician Assistant Program See the suspension/dismissal section of the student handbooks. Readmission Policy in the Physician Assistant Program In selected cases, and only with the approval of the department chair and college dean, a student may be allowed to be noncompetitively matriculated with the next first-year class. It is emphasized that this only refers to those few students with special aca - demic or personal issues. Remediation Policy The Nova Southeastern University Physician Assistant Program\u2014 Orlando is an intense academic 280 College of Allied Health and Nursing\u2014Physician Assistant Departmentexperience. Students will encounter both written and performance-based examinations. In specific courses, (Physical Exam/diagnosis, Clinical Medicine, and Surgery, etc.) all blocks of instruction must be successfully passed by the student in order to pass the entire course. All students are aware of their per - formance at the end of every test. If a student fails to demonstrate the required competencies for a specific exam or block of instruction, he or she will be notified in writing and cer - tain actions shall be taken. Students will receive email notification of failed grades from the academic coordina - tor. The student will meet with his or her academic adviser and/or the course director/instructor in order to discuss the academic situation and develop a plan for remediation of his or her academic deficiencies. The student will review the remediation and grade sheets and sign them. Students will coordinate a retesting date with the course director and that will be within seven calendar days of the test failure. The student must be proactive in coor - dinating additional study/tutoring time before the retest. If the student successfully passes the retest, the student will receive a score of 75 percent. If the student fails to demonstrate mastery of the course objectives by failing the retest, the student's case will be forwarded to the Student Progress Committee for further review and possible academic and administra - tive action. Recommendations will be referred to the department chair for final disposition.Course of Study The Physician Assistant Program cur - riculum is completed following an acceptable bachelor's degree. The comprehensive PA curriculum, com - pleted in a consecutive manner, is oriented to primary care and prepares the student to practice in a wide vari - ety of clinical settings. The first 15 months of study consist of basic sci - ences and clinically related didactic courses. All courses are required and must be successfully completed before advancing to the next semester or the clinical year. During this time frame, students are generally in class from Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 4:20 p.m., although there may be occasional evening and/or weekend hours. Because of its highly integrated and compact curriculum, the PA department requires matriculants to complete the entire curriculum at NSU. Therefore, no requests for advanced placement, transfer of credit, and credit for experiential learning will be considered. The clinical year is devoted to 12 months of clinical training with required six-week clinical rotations in family medicine, internal medi - cine, emergency medicine, pediatrics, prenatal care/gynecology, general sur - gery, as well as a selective rotation in orthopedics, dermatology, or otorhi - nolaryngology and a six-week and a four-week elective. The rotations are as follows: Emergency Medicine (six weeks) Family Medicine (six weeks) Internal Medicine (six weeks) Pediatrics (six weeks) Prenatal Care and Gynecology (six weeks) College of Allied Health and Nursing\u2014Physician Assistant Department 281 General Surgery (six weeks) Selective (six weeks in one of the following three courses) Orthopedics (six weeks) Dermatology (six weeks) Otorhinolaryngology (six weeks) Elective (six weeks) Elective (four weeks) Graduate Project (each semester) Each required rotation has assigned readings and learning objectives. At the end of each required rotation, a written, comprehensive subject exami - nation is administered and must be passed. The six-week elective rotation requires the submission of an accept - able paper on a topic related to the rotation. A comprehensive, written, summative examination is adminis - tered as a component of the four-week elective and must be passed. During rotations, students will be supervised by licensed practitioners and will actively participate in patient assess - ments, perform common laboratory procedures, interpret common diag - nostic examinations, and help manage common medical problems. The work hours during clinical rotations are set by the preceptor and can include eve - ning and weekend hours. Students are required to work a minimum of 40 hours per week, however, many rotation sites require a greater student participation.Upon completion of the course of study, students will have earned a Master of Medical Science (M.M.S.) in Physician Assistant degree. Graduates will be eligible to take the Physician Assistant National Certification Examination (PANCE) administered by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants. The role of the physician assistant requires a high level of expertise and responsibility. The applicant must pos - sess the ability and desire to complete a rigorous academic and clinical pro - gram and make a commitment to continued learning and becoming a professional.282 College of Allied Health and Nursing\u2014Physician Assistant DepartmentCurriculum Outline for the Master of Medical Science (M.M.S.) in Physician Assistant Program\u2014Orlando Start Date ..........

Final summer semester (0-0-1) College of Allied Health and Nursing\u2014Physician Assistant Department 291Physician Assistant Department\u2014Jacksonville Physician assistants (PAs) serve as essential components of a medi - cal system that continues to struggle to provide quality, affordable health care for all Americans. Their roles in the system will continue to grow as changes in health care indicate. Today, more than 88,000 individuals are eligible to practice as PAs under phy - sician supervision. PAs provide care that would otherwise be provided by physicians. PAs take medical histories, perform physical examinations, order and interpret tests, diagnose and treat illnesses, perform medical/surgical pro - cedures, assist in surgery, and can write prescriptions in all states. PAs work in most medical specialties and in all types of communities. Many PAs prac - tice family and internal medicine, and more than one-third are in towns with fewer than 50,000 residents. The PA profession is one of the fastest growing health care professions. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that employment of PAs is expected to grow 39 percent from 2008 to 2018. It is the obligation of each physician/ PA team to ensure that the PA's scope of practice is identified; that delega - tion of medical tasks is appropriate to the PA's level of competence; that the relationship with, and access to, the supervisory physician is defined; and that a process of performance evaluation is established. Adequate responsible supervision of the PA con - tributes to both high-quality patient care and professional growth. The Physician Assistant Department offers an innovative program that lasts 27 months. Upon successful comple - tion of study, students will be awarded the Master of Medical Science Degree in Physician Assistant. The curricu - lum includes rigorous instruction in basic science subjects, followed by clinical medicine, physical diagnosis, clinical laboratory medicine, clinical pathophysiology, clinical procedures and surgical skills, electrocardiography, pharmacology, radiology, and others. Students also take courses that include health care law and ethics, epide - miology and biostatistics, research methodology, and cultural issues in health care. During the clinical year of study, the student participates in clinical rotations. These rotations include family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, gynecology and prenatal care, emergency medicine, and surgery, all complemented by three elective rotations. NSU graduates are prepared to work in many clinical areas, both in primary care and specialty medicine. Accreditation The NSU Physician Assistant Program is accredi ted by the Accreditation Review Commission for Physician Assistants, Inc., (ARC-PA). The NSU Physician Assistant Program\u2014Jacksonville received Provisional Accreditation in March 2009. The program is a member of the Physician Assistant Education Association (PAEA).

Admission to the B.H.Sc. program requires the following: 1. completion prior to matriculation of three semester hours (or equivalent) of college-level written composition from a regionally accredited college or university with a minimum grade of C (GPA of 2.0 on a 4.0 scale) Effective January 1, 2006 2. an associate's degree in a field of health from a regionally accredited college or university with a mini - mum cumulative GPA of 2.0 on a 4.0 grading scale or a diploma or certificate of comple - tion in a field of health care In order for this coursework and edu - cation to be considered for credit, an applicant must submit a student- prepared learning portfolio request - ing assessment of prior experiences for academic credit. This will describe all traditional, online, mili -312 College of Allied Health and Nursing\u2014Department of Health Sciencetary, and other health care education, as well as work-related experience and health care-related conferences attended. A resume or CV, tran - scripts and/or official documentation of attendance must accompany all prior learning portfolios. Learning portfolios will be reviewed to deter - mine the amount of credit given, if any, for prior learning only after an applicant has been accepted into the program. 3. documented evidence demonstrat - ing education or experience in the health care field within the past five years. All applicants must show evidence of computer skills through course work or self-study prior to the end of the first term. Students may obtain instruction through the NSU Student Microcomputer Laboratory or other training facilities. It should be noted that many criteria, in addition to academic credentials, play a role in the admission process for the B.H.Sc. program. While the program allows the student to demon - strate academic capability, it does not assure admission to any professional school. Admission to the B.H.Sc. program will not guarantee admis - sion to any other program of Nova Southeastern University. Upon receipt of the completed applica - tion, fees, credentials and transcripts, the admissions officers and the College of Allied Health and Nursing will review all material for evidence of the proper education, training, and back - ground to enter the B.H.Sc. program.Transfer Credit Policy Students who have earned college credits at other regionally accredited colleges or universities can transfer these credits into the B.H.Sc. program. Students should contact a B.H.Sc. admissions counselor to discuss how prior college credits can be used to obtain the B.H.Sc. degree. An evaluation of transfer credit will be completed prior to, or during, the first semester of enroll - ment, and applicable credit will be transferred based on all final official transcripts received. Students will be advised to take courses based on the official evaluation in their file. Transfer students must provide final official transcripts from all their previous colleges; their previous aca - demic work will then be evaluated. The B.H.Sc. program will transfer a maximum of 90 eligible semester credits including credit for CLEP, proficiency exams, and prior experi - ential learning toward a degree. A limited number of D grades may be considered, depending on the total number of credits being transferred and where the D grades are being applied to the curriculum. Students must complete a minimum of 25 percent (30 semester hours) of their coursework within the B.H.Sc. program major. Students with credits, health care or academic experiences, certificates, diplomas or degrees from nationally accredited colleges, military training or other educational training /experi - ences should refer to the section below tilted: Assessment of Prior Experiences for Academic Credit in order to apply College of Allied Health and Nursing\u2014Department of Health Science 313to convert these prior experiences into academic credit. Assessment of Prior Experiences for Academic Credit Nova Southeastern University has established four different mechanisms for students to convert their prior experiences into academic credit. Students must initiate all requests for experiential learning credit before they complete 24 credits at NSU. Credits will be transcripted after 12 credits are successfully earned at NSU. For additional information, contact the B.H.Sc. Program or the Office of Prior Learning Assessment at (954) 262-8414 or 800-356-0026, ext. 28414, or via email at miletsky@nsu.nova.edu. 1. CLEP/DANTES/ACT -PEP/ Computer Test-Out Students can demonstrate their knowledge in a variety of areas by taking objective tests. The coordi - nator of experiential learning can provide further information about these tests as can the testing office in Academic Services. 2. Nationally Accredited School Portfolios Students who have attended nation - ally accredited institutions have the opportunity to write school portfo - lios. The coordinator of experiential learning works with each student in reviewing the student's nationally accredited institutional transcript to identify courses that may be applied toward his or her academic goal. 3. Full Portfolio\u2014Course Challenge The full portfolio is the process for challenging a college-level course for credit. Through this mechanism, a student presents his or her knowledge on a topic and has it evaluated by a faculty mem - ber. A maximum of 25 percent of a student's credits may be earned through the full portfolio process. 4. Standard Grant Certain training courses, military experiences, or licenses may be converted into college credit. This can be done by supplying some very basic documentation. For military training programs the recommendations contained in the Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the Armed Forces from the American Council on Education, will be used to evaluate such training for credit transfer. Examples include Combat Casualty and Flight Medicine Courses of training. Distance Education Support Distance education students in the B.H.Sc. Program are provided with NSU computer accounts including email. The student, however, must obtain their own Internet service providers (ISP) and use their own com - puter systems (IBM-compatible PC or Apple Macintosh and a modem). New students receive an orientation and extensive online technical support online access, online tools and meth - ods, and library resources. Online interactive learning methods involve Web pages to access course materials, announcements, the elec - tronic library, and other information, plus a range of online activities that facilitate frequent student-professor interaction.

AAs work exclusively within the anesthesia care team environment as described by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). AAs possess a premedical background and a baccalaureate degree, and also complete a comprehensive didactic and clinical program at the graduate level. AAs are trained extensively in the delivery and maintenance of quality anesthesia care as well as advanced patient monitoring techniques. The goal of AA education is to nurture the transformation of qualified student applicants into competent health care practitioners who aspire to practice in the anesthesia care team. The 27-month AA course of study consists of an intensive academic and didactic program that will prepare the student to function within the anesthesia care team. The students will get an extensive clinical training experience that will consist of a minimum of 2,500 clinical hours that encompass all aspects of anesthesia care for the surgical patient. Upon completion of the course of study, students will have earned a master of health science degree from NSU. The first year of study focuses on the foundations of anesthesia practice through classroom, mock operating room scenarios and studies, and laboratory work. Clinical experience during the first year will increase as the year progresses. The senior year (semesters 5, 6, and 7) will consist of clinical rotations assigned in two-week and four-week intervals. During the senior year, clinical rotations are full time and involve all specialty areas in anesthesia, including general surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, otolaryngology, orthopedics, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, genito- urinary surgery, vascular surgery, cardiac surgery, thoracic surgery, transplantation, and trauma. Clinical rotations include days, evenings, nights, weekends, and on-call\u2014 depending upon the rotation.

Northwest Highway Park Ridge, Illinois 60068-2573 www.asahq.org Master of Medical Sonography (DMS) uses the properties of sound to image tissues and organs within the body. Vascular Sonography is a specialty of DMS, focusing on the assessment of all arteries and veins of the body (excluding those located in the heart). Vascular sonographers are an impor - tant part of the medical team. Clinical settings using the skills and services of vascular sonographers typically include imaging centers, radiology departments, and cardiology or vas - cular surgery offices. The demand for vascular sonographers is projected to increase primarily due to the aging of the population, as seniors are generally more prone to vascular problems. The Master of Health Science\u2014 Vascular Sonography specialization at Nova Southeastern University is designed to train highly skilled and knowledgeable vascular technologists at a graduate level. Students will take master's degree-level online courses and will develop professor-monitored research projects for publication and/or presentation in their second year. This course of study will prepare graduates for leadership positions in research, clinical management, and education. Program Objectives to graduate competent vascular tech - nologists who are qualified to perform a variety of standard and specialized diagnostic vascular procedures to ensure that graduates are quali - fied to take, and successfully pass, a national credentialing exam, from either the American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonography (ARDMS) or Cardiovascular Credentialing International (CCI) to prepare master's degree-level grad - uates for future leadership roles in vascular laboratories, research centers, and vascular centers to develop advanced academic and clinical skills, for pursuing research studies and publication in the field of vascular sonography Upon successful completion of the Master of Health Science with a specialization in 378 College of Allied Health and Nursing\u2014Department of Health ScienceVascular Sonography, students are eligible to apply for admission to the Doctor of Health Science (D.H.Sc.) program. The D.H.Sc. program has a requirement for students to complete two one-week summer institutes. Curriculum Overview The vascular sonography program 12-month externship in a clinical vascular labo - ratory. The program starts in July with two online courses and is 26 months long. The successful graduate will earn a Master of Health Science degree with a specialization in Vascular Sonography. Students will take a com - bination of core courses in both the health science field and more focused vascular technology courses. A sample of core courses in the health sciences includes subjects such as Writing for Medical Publication, Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Principles and Practice of Management in Health Care. Examples of vascular technology courses include Ultrasound Physics, Cerebrovascular Testing, Venous Testing, and Peripheral Arterial Testing. While on campus, the student will spend more than 300 hours in the Ultrasound Training Laboratory learn - ing scanning skills and physiologic testing methods prior to the clinical externship experience. The second year will focus almost entirely on clinical training for a mini - mum of 48 weeks, with a minimum of 35 hours per week, with hands-on experience in a vascular laboratory under the supervision of a registered vascular technologist. Students will be required to fulfill competencies out - lined in the clinical syllabus. These competencies include all aspects of vascular sonography training and pro - fessional development.

Doctor of Health Science (D.H.Sc.) Program The D.H.Sc. has a two-track curricu - lum. One is the generalist track. The second is a generalist track with a concentration in global health stud - ies. The generalist D.H.Sc. program requires completion of a minimum of 61 semester hours of coursework. This includes 48 semester hours didactic coursework, 11 semester hours practical coursework, and 2 semester hours for the Doctoral Objective Analysis. The generalist D.H.Sc. program with a con - centration in global health studies also consists of 61 semester hours, with the majority of electives and the intern - ship and practicum dedicated to global health topics. The D.H.Sc. program is designed for completion in a distance learn - ing format and requires only minimal on-campus time during two inten - sive, one-week, summer institute seminar sessions. The residential sum - mer sessions are available at the NSU campuses or student educational cen - ters, with the location varying from year to year. The program curricula are designed to build upon the scientific and general knowledge of the health care profes - sional while focusing on the overall health care picture. Leadership, pol - icy, diversity, evidence-based medical practice, and alternative methods of treatment are but a few of the areas stressed in the generalist curriculum. During the generalist course of study, the student must complete a practicum and internship approved by the D.H.Sc. program director in an area of health care such as leadership, education, pol - icy, or delivery. Students selecting the global health concentration will focus their internship and practicum work in the global health arena. The intern -400 College of Allied Health and Nursing\u2014Department of Health SciencePrior health care experience is required and is strongly considered in the admissions process. The D.H.Sc. is a postprofessional degree designed for health practitioners, public health professionals, and health care administrators from a wide variety of disciplines. The commonality exhibited by our students is the expert practice of a recognized health occupation at a professional level, or five years of administrative experience in a health care organization with progressively increasing responsibilities over that time frame. The successful applicant's health profession may emphasize delivery of services to individual clients (e.g., PA, PT, R.N., LCSW, etc.) or be population based (M.P.H., M.H.A.). An appropriate level of professional practice is generally recognized by health professions licensure (e.g., R.N., PT), a national certification or registration (e.g., PA-C, RVT, RRT, CRNA, , FACHE), (e.g., M.P.H., M.S.N., M.S.W., M.H.A., M.B.A.), or a combination of the above. All questions regarding the appropriateness of an applicant's qualifications for admission can be discussed with the department chair or program director on an informal basis, but the official recommendations are made by the Committee on Admi ssions to the dean of the College of Allied Health and Nursing. The dean makes the final determination. Successful past applicants and graduates have included physicians, dentists, nurses, nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, physician assistants, master's degree- level social workers, physical therapists, occupational therapists, dental hygienists, and athletic trainers. We have recently expanded the program to include health care administrators, and our graduates now include a hospital CEO and an assistant surgeon general of the U.S. Public Health Service. 4.
