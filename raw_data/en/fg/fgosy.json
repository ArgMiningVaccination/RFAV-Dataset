Coolant-pack: A purposely designed leak-proof container, typically complying with performance, quality and safety (PQS) specification PQS/E005/IP01, filled with tap water or with another phase-change material.3 Domestic refrigerator or freezer: A refrigerator or freezer that is not WHO PQS-prequalified for vaccine or pharmaceutical storage. Domestic refrigerators or freezers are typically available in the local commercial marketplace for food storage. Dry-storage capacity requirements: The controlled storage space needed at a vaccine store or service-delivery point to store commodities , typically at ambient conditions in a secure area. 3 WHO PQS performance specification E005/IP01.2, Water-packs for use 15 June 2016.Gross volume: The measured volume of the airspace inside the internal compartment of a model of cold chain equipment with the door or lid shut. Insulated shipping container: A single-use insulated passive container , containing coolant-packs , typically used for the international shipment of vaccines from manufacturer to primary vaccine store. Net storage capacity: The estimated volume available for storing vaccines and associated supplies inside a model of cold chain equipment , taking into account packing efficiencies and airspace requirements. The net storage capacity of prequalified refrigerators is provided in the PQS Catalogue. Packed vaccine volume per dose: Quantifies, typically as cm3, the space needed to store or transport each dose of vaccine or diluent in the cold chain ; it includes the vaccine or diluent primary container and packaging material. Passive container: A container that maintains a temperature-controlled e nvironment inside an insulated enclosure, generally without thermostatic regulation, using frozen, conditioned, cool, or warm coolant-packs .4 Passive containers in this context include reusable insulated cold boxes and vaccine carriers as well as single-use insulated cartons. Primary container: Vial, ampoule, prefilled device, plastic dispenser, or tube containing vaccine or diluent. Primary vaccine store: A store that receives vaccine deliveries from the vaccine manufacturer, generally the national vaccine store. However, this may also be a state- or regional-level store in larger countries. Refrigerated vehicle: A road transport vehicle such as a van, truck or semi-trailer whose isolated, thermostatically controlled cargo compartment is maintained at a temperature different (lower or higher) than the external ambient conditions. Safety stock: The amount of stock that serves as a cushion or buffer to protect against stockouts due to delivery delays, product shortages at the supplier level, or when stock is issued at an unexpectedly high rate. The level of safety stock required should be established for each vaccine at each vaccine store based on past consumption data.

This is generally the relevant volume for calculation of storage requirements. Shelf volume: The aggregated volume of all designated equipment baskets, shelves or pallet bays in a model of cold chain equipment . This volume includes only areas where vaccines can be stored safely. Stockout: When a vaccine product is not available to provide an immunization service during routine or supplemental immunization activities. Storage temperature: The temperature range for vaccine storage as stated by the manufacturer on the primary container label and the package insert and within the regulatory filings for the product. Some manufacturers also provide a temperature range for vaccine transport.

Utilization factor: A number (less than one) that is multiplied by the shelf volume of walk-in cold rooms and freezer rooms or by the gross volume of refrigerators, freezers, vaccine carriers and cold boxes in order to estimate the usable net storage capacity of that equipment. The utilization factor accounts for the fact that it is not usually possible to use 100% of available storage capacity due to the impact of vaccine handling practices, packaging dimensions and other practicalities. Vaccine storage compartment: The zone within a refrigerator, freezer or passive container that is designated by the manufacturer as suitable for storing vaccine. When defined for a passive container , this is the zone designated when the container is loaded with the recommended number of coolant-packs required to achieve the container's maximum rated cold life. Vaccine storage volume: The maximum volume of vaccine that will be stored at a vaccine store or service-delivery point; includes the vaccine volume per supply interval as well as the volume of the vaccine safety stock .

Water-pack freezing capacity: For mains-powered appliances, this is defined as the maximum weight of water- packs that can be fully frozen, in one batch, during a 24-hour freezing cycle. During this period the temperature of the vaccine storage compartment (in combined refrigerators/ freezers) must remain within the acceptable temperature range of +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C. For solar direct-drive freezers, this is defined as the daily maximum weight of fully frozen water-packs that remain at the end of the night phase of the water-pack freezing test.5 5 See: WHO PQS verification protocol E003/RF05-VP.3, Refrigerator or combined refrigerator and water-pack freezer: compression-cycle.

Introduction This module describes how to calculate vaccine volumes and evaluate the cold chain capacity requirements of a vaccine supply chain. This module also provides guidance on how to calculate cold chain storage needs for coolant-packs and the dry-storage capacity needed for immunization-related commodities. The most basic question for those who are managing vaccine distribution is whether there is sufficient cold chain capacity to store and deliver all the required vaccine products at the recommended temperatures at all points of the vaccine supply chain. To ensure that sufficient cold chain capacity is available where and when it is needed, it is important to: yrecognize the impact of vaccine presentations and packaging on vaccine storage volumes; yknow how to translate vaccine needs into annual vaccine volumes and vaccine storage volumes; yestimate the net storage capacity provided by all models of cold chain equipment; yidentify and quantify cold chain capacity gaps; and yexplore the range of solutions that can potentially address capacity gaps. Availability of sufficient cold chain capacity is crucial to the optimal performance of an immunization programme and the ability to achieve comprehensive and equitable immunization coverage. This module demonstrates how to calculate the volume of vaccines that must be stored and transported in the vaccine supply chain. This vaccine volume is compared with the net storage capacities of existing cold chain equipment to identify where a cold chain capacity gap exists today, or when a cold chain capacity gap is anticipated in the future. When a cold chain capacity gap is identified, the next step is to identify and evaluate potential solutions. Potential solutions may include procurement of new equipment, but may also include the use of alternative vaccine presentations, implementing equipment repair, changing the frequency of vaccine deliveries, or modifying the structure of the current vaccine cold chain. Methods to estimate the dry-storage capacity needs of immunization commodities are also introduced.1.1 Objectives The objectives of this module are to demonstrate how to: a. estimate the packed vaccine volume per dose of any vaccines delivered by the immunization programme; b. estimate a vaccine storage volume for each vaccine based on annual vaccine needs and the supply chain structure; c. aggregate the vaccine storage volumes of all the vaccines in the national immunization schedule to determine the cold chain capacity requirements; d. estimate the net storage capacity of cold chain equipment; e. evaluate whether the available net storage capacity at a facility satisfies the cold chain capacity requirements ; f. estimate transport and dry-storage capacity requirements ; and g. identify potential solutions that can help address current and future cold chain capacity gaps. 1.2 Target audience This module is intended to be used by Expanded Programme on Immunization managers, logistics and supply chain officers, and all staff and partners who are: a. supporting the planning of in-country vaccine supply chain operations; b. assessing implementation of effective vaccine management practices; c. identifying strategies that ensure sufficient storage and transport capacity at all facilities; and d. purchasing cold chain equipment. VMH-E3-01.1: How to calculate vaccine volumes and cold chain capacity requirements12. Calculating vaccine volumes This section describes how to estimate the vaccine storage volume for vaccines. The estimation process starts by determining the packed vaccine volume per dose for each vaccine type and presentation. Based on the annual vaccine need, an annual vaccine volume for each vaccine that is stored or transported in the vaccine cold chain is calculated. To estimate the vaccine storage volume for each vaccine, the annual vaccine volume will be adjusted by the number of supply intervals used each year to deliver the vaccine to a vaccine store or service-delivery point, as well as by the vaccine safety stock requirements. 2.1 Definition of packed vaccine volume per dose The packed vaccine volume per dose quantifies the space needed to store or transport vaccines and diluents in the supply chain; it includes the vaccine primary container and all packaging material. The packed vaccine volume per dose varies by vaccine type, presentation and the dimensions of the vaccine packaging. Up to four different levels of vaccine packaging may be used during storage or transport of vaccines. 1. Primary container: Vial, ampoule, prefilled device, plastic dispenser or tube in which the vaccine or diluent is held. 2. Secondary packaging: Carton or other second level of vaccine or diluent packaging, containing one or more primary containers (see Figure 1). 3. Tertiary packaging: Carton or other third level of vaccine or diluent packaging that contains a number of secondary cartons; usually constructed of corrugated fibreboard. 4. Insulated shipping container: Insulated passive container typically used for the international shipment of vaccines in tertiary packaging from manufacturer to primary vaccine store. The packed vaccine volume per dose is most often quantified using the dimensions of the secondary vaccine packaging. However, it is important to ensure that calculations of vaccine storage volumes , and consequently cold chain capacity requirements , reflect the dimensions of the specific level of packaging being used to store or transport vaccines. So, if vaccines are stored in insulated shipping containers , then those dimensions should be used.2.2 How to determine the packed vaccine volume per dose Whenever possible, the packed vaccine volume per dose should be calculated using data from the vaccine manufacturer or supplier. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) online databases provide access to data on the packed vaccine volume per dose or the dimensions of vaccine and diluent packaging for WHO-prequalified vaccines. These online resources include: yWHO-prequalified vaccine database: Provides product details including , in most cases, a packed vaccine volume per dose for vaccines in secondary packaging.6 yEffective Vaccine Management (EVM) initiative assessment tool: The vaccine database worksheet in this tool provides a comprehensive set of data on the packed vaccine volume per dose for multiple vaccine products in secondary packaging as well as data on maximum packed vaccine volume per dose for each vaccine.7 yUNICEF Cold Chain Weight and Volume Calculator: Provides data on the dimensions of supplied vaccine products in secondary packaging and insulated shipping containers.8 Countries that do not know in advance which vaccines they will receive should use the maximum recommended packed vaccine volume per dose as provided in Tables 7 and 8 in WHO's Guidelines on the international packaging and shipping of vaccines.9 When an estimate of the packed vaccine volume per dose cannot be made from data provided from vaccine manufacturers or suppliers, the packed vaccine volume per dose can be estimated by measuring the length, width and height of the vaccine packaging and dividing the resulting volume by the total number of vaccine doses contained in that packaging. The following example demonstrates how to calculate the packed vaccine volume per dose , using the dimensions of a measles vaccine and diluent. 6 The WHO-prequalified vaccine database is located at: http:/ /www.who. int/immunization_standards/vaccine_quality/PQ_vaccine_list_en/en/ , accessed 15 June 2016. tool is located at: http:/ /www.who.int/immunization/ programmes_systems/supply_chain/evm/en/index3.html , accessed 15 June 2016. 8 See: UNICEF Supply Division.

VMH-E3-01.1: How to calculate vaccine volumes and cold chain capacity requirements2Example 1 - How to determine a packed vaccine volume per dose Figure 1 - Vaccine vials in secondary packaging VACCINE 50 multi-dose mL vialsh wl Step 1 - Measure the dimensions of secondary carton Measure three dimensions of the vaccine carton: length (l), width (w) and height (h), illustrated in Figure 1. This example assumes the following measurements: l = 18.5 cm w = 9.5 cm h = 6.0 cm Step 2 - Calculate the volume of secondary carton Volume (cm3) = length x width x height = 18.5 cm x 9.5 cm x 6.0 cm = 1055 cm3. Step 3 - Calculate the total number of doses in the secondary carton Total number of doses per secondary carton = doses per vial x number of vials per secondary carton. This example will assume the following measurements: Number of doses per vial = 10 Number of vials per secondary carton = 50 Total number of doses per secondary carton = 10 x 50 = 500 doses.Step 4 - Calculate packed vaccine volume per dose of the vaccine in the secondary carton Packed vaccine volume per dose = volume of secondary carton \u00f7 total doses in secondary carton. Based on the results in Step 2 and Step 3, the packed vaccine volume per dose is 1055 cm3 \u00f7 500 doses = 2.1 cm3 per dose of measles vaccine. Step 5 - Calculate packed vaccine volume per dose of the diluent in the secondary carton Measure three dimensions of the vaccine diluent carton: length (l), width (w) and height (h), illustrated below in Figure 2. Figure 2 - Vaccine diluent carton AMPOULE 50 multi-dose mL ampoulesh wl Use the same methodology shown above in Steps 14 to calculate the packed vaccine volume per dose for vaccine diluents. This example assumes the following measurements: l = 10.5 cm w = 8.7 cm h = 17.0 cm The volume (cm3) of the diluent secondary carton is 10.5 cm x 8.7 cm x 17.0 cm = 1553 cm3. Because this secondary carton of diluents also contains 500 doses, the packed vaccine volume per dose is 1553 cm3 \u00f7 500 doses per vial = 3.1 cm3 per packed diluent dose. The packed vaccine volume per dose calculated above for both the measles vaccine and the diluent are used in Example 2 and Example 3, found in Section 2.3. VMH-E3-01.1: How to calculate vaccine volumes and cold chain capacity requirements32.3 Estimating vaccine storage volume Example 2 below demonstrates how to estimate the vaccine storage volume of each vaccine or diluent at a vaccine store or service-delivery point. In Step 1, the annual vaccine need is multiplied by the packed vaccine volume per dose to estimate an annual vaccine volume . In Step 2, this annual vaccine volume is converted into a vaccine volume per supply interval . Finally, in Step 3, the volume of the vaccine safety stock is added to estimate the total vaccine storage volume . Example 2 - How to estimate a vaccine storage volume Step 1 - Determine the annual vaccine volume based on the annual vaccine need The annual vaccine need is measured as the number of doses of each vaccine that must be delivered to a vaccine store or service point to immunize the intended target population, and will include additional vaccine doses that must be delivered to a service-delivery point to accommodate unavoidable open-vial wastage.10 Note: It is best practice to meet the cold chain capacity requirements for the vaccine storage volume estimated when an immunization programme meets a performance target of 100% immunization coverage. This will ensure that the cold chain capacity will not limit a country from achieving its coverage goals. Multiply the annual vaccine need by the packed vaccine volume per dose to determine the annual vaccine volume of each vaccine. To convert the annual vaccine volume quantified as cubic centimetres into litres or cubic metres, divide by 1000 or 1 million, respectively.11 In the equation below, the annual vaccine volume is converted to litres: Annual vaccine need (number of doses)Packed vaccine volume per dose (cm3 per Annual vaccine volume (cm3) =1000 cm3 per litre Annual vaccine volume (litres) 10 More information on estimating annual vaccine needs can be found in the forthcoming WHO VMH module on how to forecast vaccine needs. When published, the document will be available on the Internet at: http:/ / www.who.int/immunization/documents 11 1 litre = 1000 cubic centimetres; 1 cubic metre = 1 million cubic centimetres.Step 2 - Determine the vaccine volume per supply interval To convert an annual vaccine volume into a vaccine volume per supply interval , divide by the number of supply intervals (vaccine deliveries) to a vaccine store or service-delivery point each year. Supply intervals may vary by the supply chain level, by type of facility, by region or by season. The equation below shows how to convert an annual vaccine volume into a vaccine volume per supply interval : Annual vaccine volume (litres)Vaccine volume per supply interval (litres)Number of supply intervals each year (typically > 1)\u00f7 = When the supply interval varies - for example, if the interval is extended from monthly to quarterly vaccine deliveries at certain times of the year because roads are unpassable in a rainy season - then the number of supply intervals used in this calculation step should be based on the longest supply interval. (For example, if delivery is usually monthly, but there is one three-month interval per year, then the number of supply intervals used in the calculation should be four, to calculate the largest vaccine volume per supply interval that the facility will need to accommodate.) This assumption will help ensure that the cold chain capacity requirements are estimated using the largest expected vaccine volume per supply interval . Step 3 - Calculate and add the volume of the vaccine safety stock to the vaccine volume per supply interval To calculate the vaccine storage volume , add the volume of the safety stock to the vaccine volume per supply interval estimated in Step 2. The vaccine safety stock is the amount of stock which serves as a cushion or buffer to protect against stockouts due to delivery delays, product shortages at the supplier level, or when stock is issued at an unexpectedly high rate. The amount of safety stock needed by a facility will vary. In stores where the catchment area is unknown or the weather threatens regular distribution, up to 100% levels of safety stock can be required. VMH-E3-01.1: How to calculate vaccine volumes and cold chain capacity requirements4The following equation estimates the volume of the vaccine safety stock: Vaccine safety stock (number of doses)Packed vaccine volume per dose (cm3 per dose)\u00d7 \u00f7= Volume of vaccine safety stock (cm3) =1000 cm3 per litre Volume of vaccine safety stock (litres) By adding the volume of the vaccine safety stock to the vaccine volume per supply interval, the total vaccine storage volume is estimated and can be used to evaluate cold chain capacity requirements . Vaccine volume per supply interval (litres)Vaccine storage volume (litres)Volume of vaccine safety stock (litres)\u00f7 = Step 4 - Identify the recommended vaccine and diluent storage temperatures Vaccine and diluents must be stored within a recommended temperature range, and these temperatures may vary by product or supply chain level. More information on these recommended storage temperature ranges can be found on the WHO website for prequalified vaccines and in the Vaccine Management Handbook (VMH) module, How to monitor temperatures in the vaccine supply chain .12,13 Cold chain capacity requirements must take into account the vaccine storage volume calculated in Step 3 and the recommended temperature ranges for each vaccine and diluent. Examples 3 and 4 below illustrate the process of calculating the vaccine storage volume for measles vaccine and diluent using the packed vaccine volumes per dose that were calculated in Example 1. Example 3 illustrates the calculations using a scenario representing the supply chain conditions of a primary vaccine store; Example 4 shows the 12 The WHO-Prequalified Vaccine Database is located at: http:/ /www.who. int/immunization_standards/vaccine_quality/PQ_vaccine_list_en/en/ , accessed 15 June 2016. 13 The WHO Vaccine Management Handbook module (VMH-02-01.1), How to monitor temperatures in the vaccine supply chain, can be viewed at: http:/ / apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/183583/1/WHO_IVB_15.04_eng.pdf , accessed 15 June 2016.calculations for a scenario representing the supply chain conditions of a service-delivery point.

If the annual vaccine need is 1 million doses and there are four supply intervals per year, the vaccine delivered per supply interval is 250 000 doses; 25% of 250 000 is 62 500 doses.

This will result in a vaccine storage volume of 969 litres for the diluent, which will be stored at the primary store at approximately +25\u00b0C.15 Example 4 - How to calculate the vaccine storage volume for measles vaccine and diluent at a service-delivery point Service-delivery point scenario Annual vaccine need 10 000 doses Packed vaccine volume per dose, vaccine2.1 cm3 per dose (see Example 1) Packed vaccine volume per dose, diluent3.1 cm3 per dose (see Example 1) Annual number of supply intervals12 (evenly spaced) Safety stock requirement 208 doses Vaccine storage temperature +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C Diluent storage temperature +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C To calculate the vaccine storage volume for the measles vaccine, the following calculation methodology applies: Step 1 - Determine the vaccine volume per supply interval Annual vaccine need (10 000 doses)Annual number of supply intervals (12)Packed vaccine volume per dose (2.1 cm3 per dose)\u00d7 = Vaccine volume per supply interval (1750 cm3 or 1.75 L) at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C\u00f7 15 Vaccine volume per supply interval: 1 million x 3.1 cm3 \u00f7 4 = 775 000 cm3 or 775 L Volume of the safety stock: 62 500 x 3.1 cm3 = 193 750 cm3 or 194 L Vaccine storage volume: 775 L + 194 L = 969 LStep 2 - Determine the volume of the vaccine safety stock Vaccine safety stock (208 doses)Volume of safety stock (437 cm3 or 0.44 L ) at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0CPacked vaccine volume per dose (2.1 cm3 per dose)\u00d7 = Step 3 - Calculate the vaccine storage volume by adding the vaccine volume per supply interval to the volume of the vaccine safety stock Vaccine storage volume (2.19 L) at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0CVolume of safety stock (0.44 L) at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C Vaccine volume per supply interval (1.75 L) at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C+ = Because diluents are typically stored between +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C alongside vaccines at servicedelivery points, the vaccine storage volume for diluents are part of the cold chain capacity requirements at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C in these facilities. To calculate the vaccine storage volume for the diluent, follow the same methodology shown above, using the packed vaccine volume per dose for the diluent (as calculated in Example 1). This will result in a vaccine storage volume for the diluent of 3.2 litres at this service-delivery point, to be stored at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C.16 2.4 Supplementary immunization activities In some locations, it may be important to consider the volume of vaccines for supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) or school-based immunization services when estimating the vaccine storage volume . In such cases, there are a number of special considerations to take into account. While the methodology used to calculate the vaccine storage volume of SIA vaccines is similar to the process used in Section 2.3 for routine vaccines, there are a few differences: ySIA vaccines are not distributed regularly throughout the year. A number of vaccine arrivals may instead occur over a one- to six-month period. Nevertheless, the total vaccine volume of each SIA vaccine is divided by the number of planned deliveries to convert this total vaccine volume into a vaccine volume for each delivery. 16 Vaccine volume per supply interval: 10 000 x 3.1 cm3 \u00f7 12 = 2583 cm3 or 2.6 L Volume of the safety stock: 208 x 3.1 cm3 = 644.8 cm3 or 0.6 L Vaccine storage volume: 2.6 L + 0.6 L = 3.2 L VMH-E3-01.1: How to calculate vaccine volumes and cold chain capacity requirements6 ySafety stock is typically not used to manage SIA vaccines. It may not be necessary to add the storage volume of a vaccine safety stock to the storage volumes per supply interval of vaccines and diluents. ySIAs and school-based immunization services often bypass one or more levels of the vaccine supply chain. It may not be necessary to calculate SIA vaccine and diluent volumes for every vaccine store or service-delivery point. yVaccine presentations used for SIAs may be different from those used for routine services. It is important to verify that the correct packed vaccine volume per dose is used to calculate the vaccine storage volumes for these vaccines and diluents. It is important to look at ways of reducing the impact of SIA vaccines on cold chain capacity requirements. The surge in cold chain capacity needed for short periods of time to store or transport SIA vaccines may be reduced by the following actions: ySchedule SIAs so there is no overlap between SIAs or so these SIAs occur when the volume of routine vaccines in stock at the primary or subnational vaccine stores are at a lower level. yOrganize the supply chain in order to distribute SIA vaccines directly from the primary vaccine store to the lowest level of vaccine store, bypassing intermediate stores. yApply approved modifications to vaccine handling procedures; for example, storing SIA vaccines temporarily on pallets placed on the floors of walk-in cold rooms to augment the vaccine storage capacity provided by the shelves. yWhen qualified suppliers are available, consider renting the excess capacity needed during SIAs. VMH-E3-01.1: How to calculate vaccine volumes and cold chain capacity requirements7This section defines the relevant storage space terms for cold chain equipment. It also provides links to information on WHO-prequalified cold chain equipment and describes how to determine the net storage capacity of equipment when WHO performance, quality and safety (PQS) data are not available. 3.1 Cold chain equipment capacity terms Figures 3, 4 and 5 illustrate and define three key terms used to describe storage space inside cold chain equipment. Figure 3 - Gross volume The measured volume of the airspace inside the internal compartment of a model of cold chain equipment with the door or lid shut. Figure 4 - Shelf volume The aggregated volume of all designated equipment baskets, shelves or pallet bays in a model of cold chain equipment . This volume includes only areas where vaccines can be stored safely. Figure 5 - Net storage capacity The estimated volume available for storing vaccines and associated supplies inside a model of cold chain equipment , taking into account packing efficiencies and airspace requirements. Note that while gross volume and shelf volume can be measured, net storage capacity is an approximate value used for planning purposes in order not to overestimate the total volume available for storing vaccines. In this document, shelf volume is only relevant for walk-in cold rooms and freezer rooms. Shelf volume is never relevant to vaccine carriers and cold boxes, which have no shelves or inner storage divisions. A utilization factor is sometimes used to estimate net storage capacity when gross volume or shelf volume are known. For the purpose of this document, utilization factor is defined as a number less than one that is multiplied by the shelf volume of walk-in cold rooms and freezer rooms or by the gross volume of refrigerators, freezers, vaccine carriers and cold boxes in order to estimate the usable net storage capacity of those equipment. The utilization factor accounts for the fact that it is not usually possible to use 100% of available storage capacity due to the impact of vaccine handling practices, packaging dimensions and other practicalities. In this document, WHO recommends using a utilization factor of 0.67 for walk-in cold rooms and freezer rooms, as well as all other equipment. Countries may revise this factor based on their own experience. 3.2 Determining the net storage capacity This section describes several quick reference sources for net storage capacity of different types of cold chain equipment. Net storage capacity is the important dimension to use when planning for accommodating the vaccine storage volumes as calculated in Section 2. When it is not available from reference sources, the net storage capacity of equipment can be estimated using the methods described in Section 3.3. 3.2.1 Walk-in cold rooms and freezer rooms Although specific models of walk-in cold rooms and walk- in freezer rooms are not WHO PQS-prequalified, WHO PQS provides a list of qualified suppliers of a range of cold room or freezer room sizes, typically but not limited to 10 m3 to 40 m3 gross volume.17 An estimated net storage capacity is available for standard gross volumes of cold rooms and freezer rooms in the UNICEF Quick Reference Guide18 (shown in Table 1 below). 17 WHO PQS-prequalified cold and freezer room suppliers are listed at: http:/ / apps.who.int/immunization_standards/vaccine_quality/pqs_catalogue/ categorypage.aspx?id_cat=15 www.unicef.org/supply/files/Cold_Chain_Quick_Reference_Repository. xlsx , accessed 15 June 2016.3. Calculating cold chain capacity VMH-E3-01.1: How to calculate vaccine volumes and cold chain capacity requirements8Table 1 - Approximate net storage capacity for WICs and WIFs (five shelves)17 WIC/WIF size (m3) (gross freezer room. Because cold room dimensions, shelving configurations, vaccine packaging dimensions and storage practices will significantly influence the net storage capacity, it is preferable to consult manufacturers or cold chain experts when estimating the net storage capacity for any given walk-in cold room or walk-in freezer room. 3.2.2 Vaccine refrigerators and freezers Net storage capacity values for WHO-prequalified refrigerators and freezers are available from the WHO PQS Catalogue.19 This same information can be found in the 'E003 database' available on the PQS website.20 Country cold chain equipment planners may instead calculate their own net storage capacity value using either the methodology described in the PQS verification protocol,21 or by use of empirical data based on their own experience with the equipment. 3.2.3 Vaccine cold boxes and carriers The WHO PQS Catalogue does not list net storage capacity for cold boxes and carriers. Values for internal dimensions of the vaccine compartment (with coolant-packs in place) can be used to calculate the gross volume. See Section 3.3 for information about how to use the resulting gross volume in order to estimate net storage capacity. 19 WHO PQS Catalogue, available at: http:/ at: http:/ /apps.who.int/immunization_standards/ vaccine_quality/pqs_catalogue/catdocumentation.aspx?id_cat=17 , accessed 15 June 2016. 21 PQS verification protocols for different categories of refrigerators and freezers can be found on the PQS website at: http:/ /apps.who.int/immunization_ standards/vaccine_quality/pqs_catalogue/catdocumentation.aspx?id_ cat=17 , accessed 15 June 2016.3.3 How to estimate net storage capacity when data are unavailable If the net storage capacity for a particular model of cold chain equipment is not available, it is possible to estimate it. The following sections describe this process for different categories of cold chain equipment. 3.3.1 Walk-in cold rooms and freezer rooms Figure 6 illustrates the dimensions of a shelving unit in a walk-in cold room. The shelf volume is calculated by aggregating the measured volume of all shelving units or pallet bays. Net storage capacity can then be estimated by multiplying the shelf volume by a utilization factor . For walk- in cold rooms and walk-in freezer rooms, WHO recommends using a utilization factor of 0.67. Figure 6 - Dimensions of walk-in cold room shelving units tw bl h The following example demonstrates how to calculate the net storage capacity of a typical walkin cold room with a gross volume of 40 m3.

Gross volume is usually reported by the manufacturer for a given model of cold chain equipment. If it is not available, gross volume can be measured. Figure 7 below shows an illustration of a top-opening ice-lined refrigerator. Multiply the height, length and width of the internal refrigerated space as if the lid were closed to determine the gross volume in cm3. Estimate the net storage capacity by multiplying the measured gross volume by a utilization rate of 0.67. The resulting value can be converted into litres (L) by dividing by 1000.Figure 7 - Top-opening ice-lined refrigerator hw l VMH-E3-01.1: How to calculate vaccine volumes and cold chain capacity requirements10When measuring the gross volume of a refrigerator designed for household food storage, do not include the vegetable storage or door areas. These areas should be loaded with water-filled coolant-packs or water bottles or otherwise be made off limits to vaccine storage. Domestic refrigerators are not recommended for vaccine storage and should be replaced with WHO PQS-prequalified equipment as soon as possible. The freezer compartments in domestic-style refrigerators are suitable only for preparing and storing frozen ice-packs. 3.4 Transport equipment capacity To determine the available capacity for transport of vaccines, it is necessary to understand how to determine net storage capacity in passive containers, refrigerated vehicles and traditional trucks. 3.4.1 Vaccine cold boxes and carriers Use the following procedure to calculate the net storage capacity of vaccine cold boxes and carriers: Step 1: Load the vaccine cold box or carrier with the number of frozen coolant-packs designated by the manufacturer. Step 2: Measure in centimetres the minimum internal dimensions of the vaccine storage compartment, taken between the bulging internal faces of the frozen coolant-packs. When measuring the height, consider that the height will be limited by the bottom of the lid when it is in place. Step 3: Multiply the minimum internal dimensions (length, width and height) to calculate the gross volume in cm3. To convert this volume from cubic centimetres to litres, divide by 1000. For cold boxes and carriers, WHO recommends multiplying the gross volume by a utilization factor of 0.67 in order to estimate net storage capacity.3.4.2 Refrigerated vehicles Refrigerated vehicles include vans, trucks and semi-trailers that have an insulated, thermostatically controlled cargo compartment and a dedicated refrigeration unit capable of maintaining a controlled temperature range. Vans and small trucks typically have refrigeration units powered directly by the vehicle's engine. Larger trucks and semi-trailers have independent, diesel-powered refrigeration units. Both types may also have electrical backup so that they can be plugged into the main electric grid when parked. For more information on how to transport vaccines using refrigerated vehicles, refer to Annex 5, Supplement 12, Temperature-controlled transport operations by road and by air , of the WHO Technical Report Series on the storage and transport of time- and temperature-sensitive pharmaceutical products.22 The generic EVM standard operating procedure (SOP) E7-05: Loading and operating refrigerated vehicles23 should be reviewed and adapted by national immunization programmes to represent a national vaccine handling procedure and to standardize procedures when using refrigerated vehicles. WHO PQS specifications and prequalification procedures are not currently available for refrigerated vehicles. In most cases, the manufacturer of each vehicle will provide a gross volume for its equipment. Calculate net storage capacity by multiplying the gross volume by the standard utilization factor of 0.67. It is always important to adhere to the proper loading protocol of refrigerated vehicles, including any requirements to maintain a minimum distance from ceiling, walls and cooling units. 22 WHO Technical Report Series, No. 961, Annex 5, Supplement 12, Temperature- controlled transport operations by road and by air , is available at: http:/ /www. who.int/medicines/areas/quality_safety/quality_assurance/supplement_12. pdf?ua=1 , accessed 15 June 2016. 23 A model of an EVM SOP manual and individual generic SOPs can be downloaded to help immunization programmes document critical tasks for the nine EVM criteria at: http:/ /www.who.int/immunization/programmes_ systems/supply_chain/evm/en/index2.html , accessed 15 June 2016. VMH-E3-01.1: How to calculate vaccine volumes and cold chain capacity requirements113.4.3 Traditional trucks and vans When nonrefrigerated trucks or vans are used to transport vaccine cold boxes between primary and subnational vaccine stores, to calculate net storage capacity it is necessary to know both the external dimensions of the cold boxes and the internal dimensions of the cargo area of the vehicles. Once these dimensions are known, an optimized load configuration can be calculated. Cold boxes should be kept upright, and at least 1 cm must be maintained for clearance between cold boxes, affecting the loading configuration options. Figure 8 below illustrates the dimensions of a vaccine transport truck. Example 6 illustrates how to calculate the maximum number of cold boxes that can be loaded on a large cargo truck. In this example, once this is determined, the aggregated value of the net storage capacity of all the cold boxes that can be loaded comprises the net storage capacity of the truck. In this example, cold boxes with a net storage capacity of 15.5 L are used. The net storage capacity of the truck is determined to be 2232 L of vaccine and diluent. With vehicles, it is also important to aggregate the weight of the cold boxes to determine if the maximum weight of the load is within limits. If not, then the number of cold boxes must be reduced, bringing the weight within limit and reducing the total net storage capacity of the vehicle. Figure 8 - Internal dimensions of a vaccine transport vehicle Length WidthHeight Example 6 - How to calculate the maximum net storage capacity of a truck Calculation step Desired result Value Step 1: Measure internal dimensions of truck bed.

To determine the cold chain capacity requirements at a vaccine store or service-delivery point, the vaccine storage volume for all the vaccines or diluents stored or delivered by each facility must be aggregated. 4.1 Determining cold chain capacity requirements for a storage point Examples 7 and 8 below illustrate how to calculate the total vaccine storage volume for all routine vaccines and diluents. These will all be summed to estimate a total storage volume at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C, -25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C, and approximately +25\u00b0C (a controlled ambient temperature of dry stores). Example 7 uses assumptions suitable for a vaccine store; Example 8 uses assumptions suitable for a service-delivery point. Both examples access the packed vaccine volume per dose for vaccines and diluents from the WHO database on prequalified vaccines.24 24 These data can be obtained from the WHO website at: http:/ /www.who. int/immunization_standards/vaccine_quality/PQ_vaccine_list_en/en/ , accessed 15 June 2016.Example 7 - How to determine the cold chain capacity requirements at a vaccine store Vaccine store scenario Catchment population5 million Number of supply intervals per year4 (evenly spaced) Vaccine storage temperatureAll vaccine except OPV, vaccine measles and BCG diluents stored at ambient temperatures, ~+25\u00b0C Safety stock policy 25% of vaccine quantity per supply interval 25 Freeze-dried vaccines that are packed together (bundled) with their diluent must never be frozen.Vaccine Annual number of doses Number of supply intervals per year Number of doses per supply interval Packed vaccine volume per dose (cm3/dose) Packed vaccine volume per dose, diluent (cm3/dose) Vaccine storage volume, vaccine (L) +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C Vaccine storage volume, diluent (L) +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C Vaccine storage volume, vaccine (L) -15\u00b0C to -25\u00b0C Vaccine storage volume, diluent (L) dry store A B A/B C D (A/B) * C 1000(A/B) * D 1000(A/B) * C 1000(A/B) * D 1000 BCG 240 000 4 60 000 1.20 1.10 72 66 DTP-HepB, Hib-IPV505 263 4 126 316 11.30 1427 Measles 369 231 4 92 308 2.40 3.20 222 295 OPV 160 000 4 40 000 2.00 80 PCV13 378 947 4 94 737 13.80 1307 Rotavirus vaccine252 632 4 63 158 17.13 1082 TT 320 000 4 80 000 3.11 249 Total vaccine volume per supply interval (L) 4065 374 361 Volume of 25% safety stock (L) 1016 94 90 Cold chain capacity BCG = = hepatitis B vaccine; Hib vaccine.4.

VMH-E3-01.1: How to calculate vaccine volumes and cold chain capacity requirements144.2 Checking for sufficient capacity Sections 4.2.1 through 4.2.3 describe how to evaluate whether available net storage capacity is sufficient for storing the expected volumes of vaccines and diluents. It is important to note that in some countries the same cold chain equipment may be used to store other pharmaceutical products.26 If this is the case, then the cold chain capacity requirements should be expanded to include the appropriate packed volumes for those non-vaccine products as well. 4.2.1 Walk-in cold room and freezer room requirements To determine whether there is sufficient storage capacity to accommodate all the vaccines and diluents at a vaccine storage point, the cold chain capacity requirements are compared to the net storage capacity of existing equipment. In Example 7, the cold chain capacity requirement for all vaccines stored at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C in the subnational vaccine store was calculated as 5081 L or 5.1 m3. If the vaccine store contained a walk-in cold room similar to the one shown in Example 5, with a net storage capacity of 5.9 m3, there would be sufficient cold chain capacity at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C at this vaccine store. Also in Example 7, the cold chain capacity requirements at -15\u00b0C to -25\u00b0C of this vaccine store were calculated to be 468 L. A small number of vaccine freezers or a small walk-in freezer room should be able to provide sufficient net storage capacity at -15\u00b0C to -25\u00b0C to meet this requirement. It is important to monitor all assumptions used to calculate vaccine storage volumes . Although storing vaccines in insulated shipping containers greatly increases the volume of storage capacity needed, it may be justifiable where vaccine is kept alongside other refrigerated pharmaceuticals or when vaccines are stored and moved on pallets.27 In these situations, the vaccine storage volumes should be estimated using the packed vaccine volume per dose calculated for vaccines in insulated shipping containers to ensure that sufficient cold chain capacity is available. When planning cold room and freezer room capacity for vaccines delivered during SIAs or school-based services, it may be possible to temporarily store the vaccine on pallets 26 See: WHO/UNICEF Joint Statement, Temperature-sensitive health products in the Expanded Programme on Immunization cold chain.

After calculating the cold chain capacity requirements for all the vaccines and diluents for a facility, compare these to the net storage capacity provided by the vaccine refrigerators and freezers installed at each location. In Example 8, the cold chain capacity requirement for all vaccine and diluents at the service-delivery point was calculated to be 4.0 L at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C. The net storage capacity for all of the vaccine refrigerators currently prequalified by the WHO PQS system is greater than 4.0 L, so any of the PQS equipment would provide sufficient cold chain capacity at this location. At medium-sized subnational vaccine stores, cold chain capacity requirements may be met either by multiple refrigerators or by a walk-in cold room. If this is the case, then it may be useful to compare the two options carefully, considering cost (purchase price plus operating costs), availability of electricity and fuel for generators, and availability of technicians for unit repairs. Decision- makers should also consider whether the risk of placing a large volume of vaccine under the dependency of a single cold chain equipment unit can be well-managed in the location under consideration. 4.2.3 Transport equipment requirements Vaccines are transported in a temperature-controlled environment between vaccine stores and service-delivery points using refrigerated vehicles or passive containers transported in trucks or other vehicles. It is important to ensure that the net storage capacity of transport equipment is sufficient and that the holdover times of these passive containers are adequate.28 Guidance on how to use passive containers can be found in the WHO VMH module, How to use passive containers and coolant-packs.29 28 Route temperature profiling for passive containers is discussed in WHO Technical Report Series, No. 961, Annex 5, Supplement 14, Transport route profiling qualification, available at: http:/ /www.who.int/medicines/ areas/quality_safety/quality_assurance/supplement_14.pdf?ua=1 , accessed 15 June 2016. 29 WHO VMH module VMH-E7-02.1, How to use passive containers and coolant-packs for vaccine transport and outreach operation , is available at: http:/ /apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/183584/1/WHO_IVB_15.03_eng. pdf, accessed 15 June 2016. VMH-E3-01.1: How to calculate vaccine volumes and cold chain capacity requirements15Vaccine cold boxes and carriers Cold boxes are often used to distribute vaccines.30 The aggregated net storage capacity of all available cold boxes should be sufficient to transport both the vaccine volume per supply interval and the volume of the vaccine safety stock. Although the transport of safety stock will only be required when establishing or recovering safety stock levels, it is recommended to plan cold chain capacity so that this additional transport capacity is available when needed. When a vaccine store delivers vaccines to lower levels of the vaccine supply chain, there must be sufficient net storage capacity provided by all available cold boxes to transport the vaccine storage volumes for all vaccines and diluents of all lower-level stores or service points on a single supply circuit. When a facility collects vaccine stock from a higher supply chain level, the aggregate net storage capacity of all cold boxes or carriers used in a single collection trip must be equal to or greater than the vaccine storage volume for all vaccines and diluents being collected. For outreach services, the number and size of vaccine carriers required at a service point is heavily dependent on the specific immunization services and strategies used at each service point.31 Therefore, the estimation of the number of vaccine carriers required is best carried out at the service- delivery level. In addition to ensuring that there are sufficient vaccine carriers for each immunization team that provides outreach services at a service point, additional vaccine carriers should be kept in reserve at district or subnational vaccine stores so that they are available when needed by service points. Transport vehicles Transport vehicles may include refrigerated transport vehicles and vehicles that transport vaccines in cold boxes. During route planning and selection of refrigerated transport vehicles, it is important to verify that each vehicle will not only provide the net storage capacity needed for all the distribution points on a single route but also meet the 30 Generic EVM-SOP-E7-02.1, Packing vaccine and diluents for transport, using cold boxes, is available for adaptation and implementation by immunization programmes at: http:/ /www.who.int/immunization/ programmes_systems/supply_chain/evm/en/index2.html , accessed 15 June 2016. 31 Generic EVM-SOP-E7-03.1, Packing vaccine and diluents in vaccine carriers, is available for adaptation by immunization programmes at: http:/ /www. who.int/immunization/programmes_systems/supply_chain/evm/en/ index2.html , accessed 15 June 2016.needs of the operating environment.32 When transporting by truck it is also important to estimate the weight of vaccine shipments to ensure that the maximum load limit of a vehicle is not exceeded and that roadway restrictions are observed to avoid delays or problems at checkpoints. In Example 7, the vaccine volume per supply interval for the vaccine store was determined to be 4065 L. Therefore, two of the trucks from Example 6, with a net storage capacity of 2232 L each would be required to deliver the vaccine expected at the vaccine store. 4.3 Requirements for coolant-packs When evaluating equipment requirements, it also necessary to ensure that there is sufficient water-pack freezing capacity and net storage capacity to prepare and store coolant-packs . The need to freeze, chill or store coolant- packs depends on the vaccine distribution strategy and the immunization strategies used by each service point. 4.3.1 Coolant-pack requirements for vaccine transport Vaccine transport from a primary vaccine store to subnational vaccine stores or from a subnational store to all service- delivery points in its service area may be distributed over the course of a month, or it may take place on the same day. The distribution strategy will influence the rate of water-pack freezing or chilling of coolant-packs that is required, as well as the storage capacity needed for these coolant-packs. The number of coolant-packs, and whether these coolant- packs are frozen or chilled, will also depend on whether the vaccines are freeze-sensitive or heat-sensitive, the type of container used for transport, and the route temperature profile. The following questions can help determine the requirements for coolant-pack chilling (at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C) or freezing (at -15\u00b0C to -25\u00b0C) as well as the coolant-pack storage volume requirements: ywhat is the volume of vaccine that must be transported? yhow many passive containers will be required? ywhat are the number and volume of the coolant-packs needed for each model of container? ydoes the shipment include freeze-sensitive vaccines? 32 For more information on how to qualify refrigerated vehicles for transport of time- accessed 15 June 2016. VMH-E3-01.1: How to calculate vaccine volumes and cold chain capacity requirements16 ydoes the shipment include heat-sensitive vaccines? ywhat number of delivery locations will be served? ywhat is the timing of vaccine deliveries? and ywhat is the temperature profile of the distribution routes? Example 6 showed that 144 cold boxes could be transported by a large truck. If each cold box needs, for example, 24 coolant-packs of 0.6 L each, then to prepare frozen coolant-packs for a single shipment, an ice-pack freezer would need to freeze 144 x 24 x 0.6 L, or 2074 L (2074 kg) of water-packs per container, in the required time frame.33 Multiple large icepack freezers and multiple days would be required to prepare for this size of a shipment.34 4.3.2 Coolant-pack requirements for routine immunization outreach For routine outreach services, coolant-pack requirements are often expressed as kilograms per week because outreach services are often provided only one to two days each week, leaving the other days of the week available to prepare coolant-packs. Like cold boxes, each WHO PQS-prequalified vaccine carrier also has specific coolant-pack requirements. The vaccine carrier data shown in Figure 9 requires a total of 2.4 L, or 2.4 kg of coolant-packs (6 x 0.3 L + 2 x 0.3 L). Figure 9 - WHO PQS data on coolant-pack requirements for a sample vaccine carrier35 Specications (from PQS catalog, p116 Version 26 May 2016) Waterpacks units Coolant-packs supplied: Yes It is important to determine the number of each type of coolant-pack that is needed to prepare the maximum number of vaccine carriers used during a single week of outreach. If five of the vaccine carriers shown in Figure 9 are needed on a single day, this means that 12 kg of coolant- packs ([4 x 0.6 L] x 5) must be prepared. The water-pack freezing capacity required can then be determined by taking 33 1 L of water = 1 kg. 34 It is necessary to condition these ice-packs except when transporting lyophilized vaccines or liquid vaccine that is not freeze-sensitive, like OPV. A generic SOP is available as part of the EVM materials, EVM- SOP-E7-04, Conditioning frozen ice immunization/programmes_systems/supply_chain/evm/en/index2.html , accessed 15 June 2016.into account how many days will be available to prepare this load of ice-packs. If a service-delivery point has access to the vaccine refrigerator and water-pack freezer shown in Figure 10 below, with a water-pack freezing capacity of 1.6 kg/24 h, then it would require 48 hours to freeze the water-packs needed for only one of the vaccine carriers shown in Figure 9. If only one vaccine carrier is needed for outreach and there are at least two days between outreach sessions, this water- pack freezing capacity is sufficient. However, if five vaccine carriers are needed for outreach services on a single day, more frequently than every 10 days, this ice-pack freezer would not provide sufficient capacity. 35 WHO PQS Catalogue, Version 26, p. 116.

However, it is important to ensure both that there is sufficient net storage capacity at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C to store these cool water-packs in addition to the total vaccine storage volume and that the refrigerator can maintain the +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C controlled temperature range when introducing coolant-packs that have been warmed during use to ambient temperatures. 4.3.3 Coolant-pack requirements for supplementary immunization activities Often, SIA vaccines are delivered using a separate supply chain than that for routine vaccines. Since SIAs frequently occur over a short time frame with multiple teams leaving from a central location on many days in a row, water-pack 36 WHO PQS Catalogue, Version , accessed 15 June 2016.freezing capacity requirements for SIAs are often expressed as kg per 24 hours rather than kg per week. In many cases, it will be necessary to ensure that additional water-pack freezers are available to fulfil the ice-pack requirements of all SIA teams. These ice-pack freezers may be turned off when they are not needed. VMH-E3-01.1: How to calculate vaccine volumes and cold chain capacity requirements18When the total cold chain capacity requirement is larger than the available net storage capacity available, then a cold chain capacity gap exists. When vaccine stores or service- delivery points do not have sufficient net storage capacity , there can be negative consequences for the health and welfare of the population. It is important to not only quickly identify and resolve the current cold chain capacity gaps, but also to identify when cold chain capacity gaps are likely to occur in the future so that disease-prevention goals are met without interruption. 5.1 Potential solutions As discussed in Sections 2 and 3, there are several factors that affect both vaccine storage volumes and net storage capacity . Capacity gaps may be reduced by taking the following actions: yChoose vaccine products with a smaller packed vaccine volume per dose . Explore whether a different vaccine presentation or a change in the level of vaccine packaging used for storage or transport can potentially reduce the packed vaccine volume per dose and thereby reduce the vaccine volume per supply interval . yIncrease the utilization rate of the gross volume . Check whether the utilization factor used to calculate net storage capacity is realistic. Explore changing shelving configurations or modifying storage racks or equipment- packing protocols to use a larger percentage of the available gross volume . yShorten vaccine supply intervals. Reducing the supply interval will mean delivering a smaller quantity of vaccine more often, thereby reducing vaccine storage volume for the receiving facility. Although shorter supply intervals can reduce the cold chain capacity requirements and may also lower the risk of stockouts, they will increase transport and labour costs. In contrast, longer supply intervals can reduce transport costs and will also increase the cold chain capacity requirements, the value of vaccines held in a particular level in the system, and the amount of vaccine potentially lost in the event of a cold chain failure at that level. yRehabilitate cold chain equipment. With an investment in technician time and spare parts, it is often possible to increase available cold chain capacity at vaccine stores and service points by rehabilitating cold chain equipment that is currently not functioning. yProcure new cold chain equipment. When other solutions are unable to address cold chain capacity gaps, new equipment must be procured and installed. This is discussed further in Section 5.2. 5.2 Procurement of new cold chain equipment Selecting suitable models of new equipment to meet cold chain capacity requirements begins by reviewing the database of WHO PQS-prequalified equipment.37 WHO PQS-prequalified equipment can be filtered against certain criteria and combinations of conditions, including: ytype of equipment (refrigerator or freezer or combined source/quality; yholdover time. In addition to equipment performance specifications, there are additional questions that will help assess the suitability of equipment, including: yis the power rating appropriate for the local energy source; yis the equipment affordable, including its maintenance and operational costs; yis the equipment user-friendly and suitable for the health facility personnel; yare spare parts readily available; and yare local service contracts available? Finally, it is valuable to review the performance history of equipment models already installed in facilities. Contact colleagues and technical staff at UNICEF and WHO before making a decision on equipment procurement. 37 WHO PQS-prequalified equipment is listed in the PQS Catalogue apps.who.int/immunization_standards/vaccine_quality/pqs_catalogue/ index.aspx , accessed 2016.5. Capacity gap analysis and potential solutions VMH-E3-01.1: How to calculate vaccine volumes and cold chain capacity requirements19Dry-storage capacity is needed to store several types of commodities, including diluents that can be stored at ambient temperatures, syringes used for reconstitution, syringes used for injection, other separate delivery devices, safety boxes, spare parts for cold chain equipment, and planned surpluses of vaccine cold boxes and carriers. Sufficient dry-storage space must be available for these commodities: yVaccine diluents. When diluent labelling indicates that a diluent can be stored at ambient temperatures, it is possible to store these products in a controlled dry-storage space. This dry- storage space must be designed and packed in such a way that there is sufficient air circulation and that supplies are kept dry and secure. ySafe-injection equipment (syringes and safety box supplies). The WHO Vaccine Volume Calculator uses the packed commodity volumes shown in Table 2 to estimate the volumes of safe-injection equipment that will need dry storage, based on the estimates of annual vaccine needs.38 Table 2 - Estimated packed volume per unit of common safe-injection equipment Safe-injection equipmentUnits per boxPacked volume (cm3) per unit AD syringes, 0.05 mL for BCG 100 37.5 AD syringes, 0.1 mL for BCG 100 37.5 AD syringes, 0.5 mL 100 56.7 Syringes, 2 mL for 66.3 Safety boxes, 2.5 L 25 455.0 Safety boxes, 5 L 25 693.9 Safety boxes, 10 L 25 1094.4 Safety boxes, 15 L 26 1728.8 AD = = bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine; Hib = Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine. 38 The WHO Vaccine Volume Calculator can be viewed at: http:/ /www.who. int/immunization/programmes_systems/supply_chain/resources/tools/ en/index4.html , accessed 15 volume per syringe, both injection and dilution, can be multiplied by the number of vaccine doses per anticipated supply interval to estimate the dry-storage requirement of this equipment. For safety boxes, there will be considerable variation in the packed volume per unit and in the number of syringes that each safety box type can accommodate; therefore, it is important to measure this packed volume and usage rate on site.39 ySpare parts, surplus cold boxes and vaccine carriers. Secure dry-storage space must also be available for storing spare parts for cold chain equipment or excess cold chain equipment, including vaccine cold boxes, carriers, or refrigerators and freezers that are waiting for installation. yHealth care waste. Secure dry-storage space is necessary to store full safety boxes before incineration, burial or autoclaving. The storage area for this infectious waste must be separated from the dry-storage space used to store diluents and safe- injection equipment. When calculating the net storage capacity of a dry-storage building, 2.1 metres is typically considered a useful height limit for stores using manual handling without mechanical equipment. Modern palletized warehouses will use much higher stacking heights. When calculating the net storage capacity of dry stores, it is important to not only consider the impact of shelving and pallet configuration but also to plan for all supplies to be stored at least 10 cm off the floor and 30 cm from the walls. Example 5 can be used to help estimate the net storage capacity of a dry-storage depot. 39 More information on warehouse management, including requirements for the dry storage of health commodities, can be found in the Guidelines for warehousing health commodities at: http:/ /apps.who.int/medicinedocs/ en/d/Js21549en/ ; or the Guidelines for the storage of essential medicines and other health commodities at: http:/ /deliver.jsi.com/dlvr_content/ resources/allpubs/guidelines/GuidStorEsse_Pock.pdf , accessed 15 June 2016.6. Dry-storage capacity for supplies VMH-E3-01.1: How to calculate vaccine volumes and cold chain capacity requirements20To proactively plan for future cold chain capacity needs, it is important to calculate cold chain capacity requirements that take into account the impact of future changes to the national immunization programme, looking five to 10 years into the future. Potential plans that will affect cold chain capacity requirements include: yintroduction of new vaccines; yanticipated changes to vaccine presentation and packaging; yanticipated changes to supply intervals and wastage rates; yanticipated changes to the vaccine distribution system; ychanges to safety stock policies; yplans to position emergency vaccines to help control potential disease outbreaks. By anticipating future cold chain capacity requirements , long-term cold chain expansion strategies can be developed that may reduce the long-term capital and operating costs of the vaccine supply chain. Cold chain capacity planning exercises will explore the impact of various programmatic scenarios to help identify the optimal solution to ensure that cold chain capacity requirements are met for the future immunization system.7.
