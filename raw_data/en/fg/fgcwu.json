The truth is, the viruses and bacteria that cause illn ess and death still exist and can be passed on to people who are not protected by vaccines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends vaccinations from birth through adulthood to provide a lifetime of protect ion against many diseases and infections, such as influ enza, pneumococcal disease, human papillomavirus, a nd hepatitis A and B. Yet most adults are not vaccinat ed as recommended, leaving them needlessly vulnerab le to illness, long-term suffering, and even death. Why vaccination is important Vaccines are very effective in preventing the suffe ring and costs associated with vaccine-preventable infections, such as influenza, pneumococcal disease , human papillomavirus (HPV) and hepatitis B. Some of these illnesses do not have a cure, and all can cause tremendous health problems, including ca ncer. The majority of Americans who die every year from v accine-preventable diseases are adults. What you need to know about vaccine-preventable dis eases Influenza , also called the flu , is a contagious viral infection of the nose, thro at, and lungs that can cause mild to severe illness. Its severity varies from year to ye ar, but at its worst, kills as many as 49,000 Ameri cans every year, more than any other vaccine-preventable disease. The influenza vaccine is recommended for everyone s ix months and older and must be given once yearly, from early fall to winter. Pneumococcal disease is an infection caused by a type of bacteria called Streptococcus pneumonia that can invade the lungs, bloodstream, brain, and spinal co rd, resulting in a number of different illnesses, i ncluding pneumonia and meningitis. The pneumococcal vaccine is usually given once at a ge 65 or older (or in adults younger than 65 who sm oke or have underlying medical conditions, like asthma) . Revaccination is recommended for people with cert ain health conditions or those over 65 who received the ir first dose five years previously and before age 65. Human papillomavirus (HPV) refers to a group of more than 100 viruses that are usually spread through sexual contact. The most serious long-term complication of HPV is cervical cancer, and it is also associated with other genital cancers and oral cancers. Two of the virus strains covered in the HPV vaccines cause about 70 percent of cervical cancers. Twenty million Americans are infe cted with HPV, with more than six million new infec tions occurring in the U.S. each year. Almost three out o f four infections occur in females younger than 24 years of age. Two vaccines (Cervarix and Gardasil) are available to protect females against the types of HPV that ca use most cervical cancers. One of these vaccines (Gardasil) also protects against most genital warts. Both vacc ines are recommended for 11 and 12 year-old girls, and for f emales 13 through 26 years old, who did not get any or all of the three recommended doses when they were younger. These vaccines can also be given to girls beginnin g at age 9. One available vaccine (Gardasil) protects males against most genital warts. This vaccine is availab le for boys and men, 9 through 26 years of age. Women 26 and younger should receive a three-dose HP V series over six months to reduce the risk of cerv ical cancer. The vaccine is also approved for males age 9 to 26 to reduce their likelihood of getting HPV i nfection and passing it to their partners. Shingles , or herpes zoster , is a painful skin rash caused by the same virus t hat causes chickenpox (varicella-zoster virus). Shingles pain has been shown to negatively affect a person's ability to function as much as co ngestive heart failure, heart attack, type II diabetes, and/or dep ression. The pain of shingles can last long after t he rash has disappeared. One dose of shingles vaccine is recommended for per sons 60 and older including people who have had shingles before. Whooping cough , also known as pertussis , is a serious infection that causes coughing spell s so severe that it can be hard to breathe. The disease can even lead to cr acked ribs, pneumonia, or hospitalization. Since th e 1980s, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of cases of pertussis, especially among teens and babies le ss than five months of age. In 2010, California reported the lar gest outbreak in over 50 years, with 10 infant deat hs in the first 10 months of the year. Mothers are the source of ne arly one-third of whooping cough cases in infants. Adults under age 65 who have never gotten tetanus/d iphtheria/pertussis (Tdap) booster should receive i t for the next scheduled booster dose of Td, then continu e with a dose of Td every 10 years. Hepatitis B is a serious liver disease caused by the hepatitis B virus that can infect people of all ages. Up to 1 .4 million people in the United States have long-term or \"chronic\" infection, which can lead to liver cir rhosis, liver cancer, and death. There is no specific treatment f or people who have hepatitis B. Adults who might come in contact with the infection and those with certain underlying medical conditio ns should receive the vaccine. Hepatitis B is a three- dose series is given over six months. A combination hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine is also availab le. In some cases the vaccines may also be given on a four- dose schedule. Hepatitis A is a contagious liver disease caused by the hepatit is A virus. The virus is spread by eating contamina ted food or drinking contaminated water. It can also be spread by close person-to-person contact such as h ousehold or sexual contact with an infected person. About 15 pe rcent of people with hepatitis A require hospitaliz ation in the U.S. each year. Adults who might come in contact with the infection and those with certain underlying medical conditio ns should receive the vaccine. The hepatitis A vaccine is 94-100 percent effective in preventing hepatiti s A. While protection begins approximately two to four w eeks after the first injection, a second injection results in long-term protection. Tetanus , sometimes called \" lockjaw ,\" is a bacterial infection affecting the nervous s ystem. Approximately 16 percent of reported cases of tetanus are fatal. All adults who had the primary series of vaccines a s children should get a booster dose of tetanus-con taining vaccine every 10 years. Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria a nd acellular pertussis) vaccine, a three-in-one com bination that also includes protection against pertussis (wh ooping cough), should be used in place of one Td (t etanus and diphtheria) booster for adults.
