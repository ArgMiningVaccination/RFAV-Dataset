(3) Unless an un qualified statem ent of nu merical count gives accurate inf ormation as to the quantity of food in the package, it shall be supplem ented by such statem ent of weight, measure, or size of the individual units of the food as will give such information. (H) Statem ents of quantity shall contain only such fractions as are generally used in expressing the quantity of the food.

FDA approved preservatives m ay be used to inhibit reproduction of micro-organis ms of nonh ealth significance in lieu of therm al processing . (3) Suff icient control, including frequent testin g and reco rding of re sults, shall be exercised so that the fin ished equilibrium pH values for acidified foods are not higher than 4.6. Measurem ent of acidity of foods in process may be made by potentiom etric methods, titratab le acid ity, or colorimetric methods.
