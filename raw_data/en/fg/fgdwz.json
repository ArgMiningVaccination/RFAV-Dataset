Many of us today associate it with the exotic practices of acupuncture and herbal remedy, and the all-encompassing concepts of yin-yang and qi/chi. These impressionistic views of Chinese medicine, however, belie a more sophisticated understanding of the long-lasting system of healing. We may ask further: How does Chinese medicine actually work? What are the cultural milieus in which it develops and flourishes? And how do we evaluate it in juxtaposition with modern biomedicine? Overall, this course seeks to not only enrich our understanding of Chinese medicine in the past, but also to utilize historical knowledge to illuminate our ways of living today. [No prior knowledge in Chinese language or history is required.] This course is the same as HIS 392, and course repeat rules will apply. Students should consult with their major department regarding any restrictions on their degree requirements. "}
