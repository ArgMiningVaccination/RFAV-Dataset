That's why we offer a selective range of products to help you obtain your optimal wellness. Read on to find out more, and feel free to ask us for more information about any of our products. Standard Process Supplements Good nutrition is an essential part of wellness, and the best nutrition comes from whole foods. We believe that good nutrition should be individualized to meet each patient's needs, promoting your body's amazing capability to keep itself healthy. Standard Process whole food-based supplements meet our high standards for whole food-based ingredient sources and high quality product development. Standard Process whole food supplements are prepared in a way that ensures nutritional value. Their products are highly bioavailable, so the nutrients are readily absorbed and used by the body. Most of the ingredients are sourced from the company's own organic farm in Palmyra, WI. At Wautier Wellness, we stock dozens of Standard Process supplements. If you have special dietary needs (i.e., vegan or vegetarian; grain-, dairy-, or soy-free) or if you want to try a Standard Process product that we do not have in stock, we are also happy to place a specific Standard Process order for you. Even with your best efforts to eat quality foods, you may still have key nutrient deficiencies. Ask us more about completing the Standard Process Symptoms Survey for an evaluation of your specific dietary supplemental needs. Therapeutica Sleeping Pillow Each component of the Therapeutica pillow was thoughtfully designed to help correct the cervical curve and support the neck in a neutral position. When the pillow fits correctly, the line from the nose, chin, and neck are in alignment which means the spine is properly supported. The pillow is constructed of a non-allergenic, non-toxic foam that will not lose its shape or resilience, and they all come with a fitted zippered pillow cover made of a polyester/cotton blend, and it's machine washable. Measuring to find the correct size Therapeutica pillow is critical for proper fit. Ask us more about getting measured for your pillow in our office. Foot Levelers Orthotics Foot Levelers Stabilizing Custom Orthotics were developed by a doctor to treat the body as a functional unit, starting with the feet.

DoTerra Essential Oils doTERRA\u00ae Deep Blue Rub is a topical cream formulated with Deep Blue Soothing Blend of CPTG Certified Pure Tested Grade essential oils, natural plant extracts, and additional helpful ingredients that provides a comforting sensation of cooling and warmth to problem areas. Additional single essential oil and essential oil proprietary blends are also available at Wautier Wellness. Zilis Ultra Cell Zilis Ultra Cell offers a full range of hemp and CBD products developed with proprietary technology for superior bioavailability, so they work faster and longer. Cannabinoids are native compounds to both plants and humans. Hemp contains phytocannabinoids (phyto = plant), one of which is CBD. The human body also makes cannabinoids called endocannabinoids (endo = within) that support proper function of several key systems, including the digestive system, the nervous system, and the immune system. CBD is the most commonly known phytocannabinoid, but there are many others. Hemp's chemical profile also includes terpenes and flavonoids, in addition to protein, amino acids, ALA Omega-3, fiber and several vitamins and minerals. At Wautier Wellness, we stock several Zilis Ultra Cell oils and topical products for pain relief, system support and even weight loss support. Superior Chaga The Chaga Mushroom (Inonotus Obliquus) is a non-toxic fungus that grows on birch and other trees. Chaga is known as a natural source of medicinal properties that may help to strengthen and heal the body and has been determined safe by the USFDA for food use and supplements. The mushroom contains over 215 phytonutrients. Superior Chaga products are wild harvested and based here in the Upper Peninsula. They are formulated into extracts, dietary supplements and topical skin care products. The products are reported to reduce oxidative stress, reduce inflammation and have many potential health benefits. Ancient Minerals Ultra Pure Topical Magnesium Magnesium is a common metal that activates hundreds of cellular, biochemical reactions in the body. It is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body, and it functions as a dampener in the nervous system. Unfortunately, dietary magnesium intake in the US is below or significantly below the daily recommended recommendations in about 75% of the population. Topical magnesium is particularly helpful for those seeking a safe method of increasing magnesium intake beyond that possible with oral supplements. Benefits reported by those who use topical applications of magnesium relate specifically to its therapeutic application on the skin and its direct absorption into the cells. These benefits include: - Increased sleep - Reduced muscle aches, pains, cramping and spasms - Healthy skin and reduced outbreaks of eczema and psoriasis - Better relaxation and stress management - Increased energy levels and improved moods - Increased athletic performance Ask us anytime about the Ancient Minerals flakes, oils and lotions that we carry at Wautier Wellness. RockSauce and RockTape RockTape kinesiology tape microscopically lifts the skin away from the muscle and fascia below, creating a decompressive effect that soothes discomfort and improves performancve. Rocktape relieves swelling through decompression, which speeds recovery. It also increases awareness of your body position to help you maintain proper posture and form. RockSauce works with Rocktape to provide heating sensations that last for hours - with powerful ingredients like menthol and capsaicin that work together to soothe sore joints and muscles. You can even ask Dr. Stephanie to help apply both at your next adjustment appointment. "}
