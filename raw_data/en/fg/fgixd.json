I was really excited to go to Luna Rose's talk on spiritual bathing and healing baths to see which herbs are good for which ailments. You could tell that Luna is absolutely passionate about the subject. She started off by saying that plants, trees and flowers have spirits and auras just like animals and humans. Each plant gives off different energies that can be used for healing different problems. Using nature to heal is my passion as well, but I had never thought of a plant having a spirit. It makes sense though, if you think of a spirit as energy, then absolutely yes, plants are full of energy that feed and heal us. Spiritual bathing can be used for a number of different things. For example, if you've ended a relationship, you can take a herbal bath to remove the residual engery from that relationship if it's bringing you down. Spiritual baths have been used in all different cultures and religions for thousands of years. They can also be used to just uplift your emotions or lighten your mood. It was a fascinating talk. She gave us a long list of flowers and herbs and what they are used for. Here are a couple of examples: Roses - Calming to the mind. - Strengthening to the heart. - Helps to open up to love. Angelica - Powerfully protective. - Dispels negativity. - Brings angelic energy. Luna is a practicing herbalist and also lectures at a number of places including Mira Costa College, Palomar College, The International Herb Symposium, The San Diego Natural History Museum and The Golden Door. I truly enjoyed her talk and hope to go to more in the future. "}
