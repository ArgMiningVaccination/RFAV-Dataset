Thought of by many as one of the last few legal \"drugs\" (along with nicotine and alcohol), caffeine is a staple of academic and professional life, getting you through that final exam or that all-nighter before work. Yet some nutritionists claim caffeine consumption has gotten out of control, even as dozens of Facebook groups make fun of the so-called \"caffeine addiction.\" In past years, caffeine was found largely in coffee and sodas. Today, it's added to candy and even cosmetics. This recent influx of caffeinated products has raised serious questions about caffeine's health effects, a topic that consumers and health experts have debated for years. \"Caffeine has the same characteristic as other dangerous drugs: It is psychoactive; you build up a tolerance requiring more to achieve the same effect; it has negative withdrawal effects once you stop consuming it; and it is very possible to overdose at larger doses,\" said Nikita Alexandrov, an Auburn University sophomore who uses Facebook to educate others on what he sees as a caffeine epidemic. \"SumSeeds\" -- caffeinated sunflower seeds -- made their debut in 2007 and became an instant hit. Treats like caffeine mints and \"Jolt\" caffeinated candy that promise to keep consumers awake are popular among kids and high school students. Caffeine has even infiltrated the cosmetics market, with companies selling \"caffeinated lotion,\" claiming the face cream makes users look younger and -- dare we say it? -- more alert. Jonathan Ulaszek became passionately interested in spreading the anti-caffeine message in 2004, the year he graduated from Beloit College in Wisconsin. Ulaszek said his perspective on caffeine changed after reading \"The Great American Detox Diet\" by Alex Jamieson. \"I find myself surrounded by people that are hooked on coffee or soda,\" said Ulaszek. \"I watch people all day stay slaves to coffee and soda. If they don't have it, they can't seem to function.\" But many medical experts believe this heightened awareness of caffeine consumption is unwarranted. \"There are no harmful health consequences for using caffeine over a long period of time,\" said Dr. Herbert Muncie, a clinician and professor of medicine at Louisiana State University who has written extensively on the issue of caffeine consumption over the last 10 years. \"There are some short-term effects -- people can get a little nervous, a little jittery. Probably there are some withdrawal symptoms, although studies find it hard to prove. \"For me, for something to be truly addictive, you have to have adverse health consequences, withdrawal -- which there may be -- and neurological changes in the brain,\" said Muncie. \"We don't normally see people engage in "}
