Waters Ave Tampa, FL 33604 Miami-Dade Community College 11380 NW 27th Ave, Miami, FL 33167 Decontaminating Cups & Other Equipment Plastic cups are best for personal use...bleach solutions used to sanitize these between patients will degrade the surface of the cup making them increasing porous and hard to sanitize over time. Post-care sanitizing tools (glass or plastic cups) with NO VISIBLE blood, secretions, puss, etc, cleaned with soapy water and air dried (dishwasher would work) or 10 min soak in \u00bc cup/ gallon water solution. Frankly, I think a 10 min soak in weak bleach solution followed by dishwasher makes good sense. Post-care sanitizing (decontaminating) tools with blood or fluids contamination below. OSHA describes: 1.5 cups bleach per gallon, which equals 1:9 parts bleach to water to make the correct solution for surfaces that are heavily contaminated with mold, feces, or body tissues should be disinfected using the following household bleach solution: 1 1/2 cups bleach. 1 gallon of water Here's some advice on talking to patients about it from our healthcare attorneys. If a patient asks for an Acupuncturist's opinion on the COVID-19 vaccinations, or has questions in general, an Acupuncturist really cannot opine or give advice. Unless an Acupuncturist is accepted into the FL Department of Health FloridaSHOTS or VFC/VFA vaccination programs as a vaccination provider, the scope of practice under F.S. Chapter 457 prevents them from not only administering such vaccinations, but also giving certain type of \"healthcare\" related advice on the vaccinations (including efficacy, risks, alternatives). An Acupuncturist can explain that the vaccination is something to discuss with a primary care physician, or even pharmacists to a certain extent. Acupuncturists can also explain that personally, or candidly, they can't give an opinion either due to licensure restrictions. Treat this like any other vaccine or other physician prescribed injectable drug, in that it is simply something Acupuncturists cannot ethically give an opinion on, to avoid having their patients rely on it. Looks like L.Ac fall under Phase II and the timeline is dependent on dozens of variables, like vaccine availability, which vaccine is available, storage conditions, dispensing point, consumer willingness to receive vaccinations, vaccination waste levels, and new potential approved vacc's being available, etc. L.Ac's not working in a hospital are critical infrastructure workers and 4th in line for vaccination (Attached page 5). Refer to graph (Attached page 12) for more details. L.Ac's should consider reading the entire attached doc to be familiar with Florida's Vacc Plan and help with patients questions. Abstract - The Treatment of COVID-19 with Chinese Medicine - [CLICK HERE FOR FULL ARTICLE](/assets/docs/The%20Treatment%20of%20COVID-19%20with%20Chinese%20Medicine%20-%20Assignment%20PhD%20Study%20NJUCM%20-%20Janneke%20Vermeulen%20-%20FSOMA.pdf) The scientific, ethical and legal aspects regarding treatment of COVID-19 with Chinese Herbal Medicine are discussed in this article. Chinese Herbal Formulas have a long history of effective treatment for many diseases and they have clearly stood the test of time. However, our Western world has many other requirements and restrictions regarding its usage. This article will give more insights into treating COVID-19 with Chinese Herbs. It highlights the importance of better integration of Western and Chinese Medicine, so that COVID-19 patients outside of China may also benefit from this ancient wisdom. This assignment was written during the lockdown in the Netherlands by Janneke Vermeulen as part of the first year PhD program at Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine in China. Janneke is Acupuncturist, Chinese Herbalist, Master Face Reader, Physiotherapist and Author of Diving Medical Acupuncture, published by Singing Dragon in 2018.

Treatment Protocols & Clinical Information Licensed Acupuncturists treat diseases and patterns according to the principles of TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) or Traditional Asian Medicine. We are the only licensed practitioners where herbal medicine is written into our scope of practice. It is a medicine based on pattern differentiation. It is not \"one herbal formula for one disease\" but rather \"one disease with many formulas to treat it\" based upon how the disease manifests in each individual. Please do not share these resources with untrained patients or other types of practitioners. Even the ones with \"stages\" of the disease are guidelines and not absolute. It does our years of training a disservice to put out information implying that you can use a single document to treat the complex interplay of disease and constitution.
