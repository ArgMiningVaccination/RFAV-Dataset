These cases have elicited a lot of clamor, prompting the necessity to determine the real prevalence of allergic reactions to the vaccines, especially because no cases of anaphylaxis were reported in randomized clinical trials with the vaccine. A large number of studies have been published in the latest months about this topic, confirming that hypersensitivity reactions to COVID-19 vaccines and their prevention are one of the hot topics in the allergy and clinical immunology field. The underlying immunological mechanisms of hypersensitivity reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines are only partially understood and urgently need clarification. Precisely for these reasons, this Special Issue will focus on the re-assessment of published evidence and the re-evaluation of procedures and protocols for the prevention and management of this specific aspect, also taking into consideration patients' psychological aspects and new tools such as digital health technologies.
