Yellow is a 'sun' color and makes us feel happy and optimistic. It lifts the soul, is cheerful, joyful and friendly. It helps us go through changes. A natural cleanser, lemon associates with qualities of purification and love. Lemon symbolizes the human heart, light and love. It is known to bring in feelings of healing and love in addition to calming and a sense of well-being. So, with this in mind, it seems only fitting that lemon would be the ideal agent to help with energetic and spiritual cleansing. Spiritual and Energy Lemon Cleanse Exercise Here is what you do. Set aside a time to hold your 'Spiritual and Energy Lemon Cleanse'. This can be done with either a bath or shower. Both are nice and have unique qualities. With a bath, start by adding a few drops of lemon to the water prior to entering. Then add more as needed. With a bath you can feel totally surrounded and emerged in the cleansing energy. The lemon can be squeezed to drip on your skin. Feel the cleansing power. Feel the 'gunk' going down the drain. With a shower, visualize the negativity or 'gunk' being washed off as the water splashes on your skin. Changing the water temperature can aid in different feelings. Both are nice. Hold the intent the entire time that the purpose is to cleanse energy, ridding and washing away negative energies for the highest good. Ask for divine protection. Use Visualization Visualize and feel the negative, heavy issues being washed away. Think of, visualize and feel the cleansing qualities of the lemon being used to aid in this. I like to use several lemons and taking them just from the refrigerator so the are nice and cool. The different temperature on the skin has a nice feel and aids in the cleansing effect. I also de-seed the lemons prior to use. Lighting a candle helps bring in the transformation and regenerative energy of fire. Keep in mind that coughing or gagging during a energy cleansing process might occur. This is the physical expression of the body eliminating energetic gunk and releasing. Go with the flow. Playing soothing music may add to the goal. Holding each lemon or lemon half in the palm of you hand acknowledging the cleansing spiritual quality of lemon, honoring and thanking the lemon will help strengthen the effects and bring in more light and love. During the cleansing, gently squeeze drops from the lemon slowly from head to toe. Feel the cleansing, feel the love, feel the gunk wash away. Bring in the light and love. Surround yourself in light and love. See and feel bright color of yellow, golden light as you do this. If you have other essences, lavender or chamomile, make nice additions and helpers although, not necessary. Any of this can be tailored as desired. The important thing is the intent and feeling of cleansing and restoration. Another idea is to invite in Spirit Guides, Guardian Angels, Ascended Masters or Master Healers in to assist. I almost always invite Beings of Protection to protect sessions for the highest good. Have fun and keep me posted of the results. There is a Lemon Energy Clearing and healing session we can also do.
