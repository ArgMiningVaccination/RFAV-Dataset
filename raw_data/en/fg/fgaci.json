Intentionally choosing to begin to recognize & process the things that no longer serve you. This introspective and insightful [half day retreat](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/medicine-for-your-soul-half-day-retreat-tickets-301589832307) will take place on the beautiful, secluded grounds of [Blue Lotus Farm & Retreat Center](https://www.bluelotusfarm.org/) in West Bend, WI. Guests will be greeted with an optional high quality cacao drink or butterfly pea flower tea with blue lotus syrup to begin easing your mind and body into the experience. The evening will begin with a fire ceremony led by Kristina to help release what no longer serves our highest good and open our minds up to the possibilities available to each of us. Guests will then spend an hour going within to journal and reflect, with the opportunity to explore the bounty of nature's healing environment including a board walk along a 4 acre pond, a labyrinth, nature trails, swings, sound healing instruments and a bonfire. As dusk falls, we will round out the evening by raising our vibrations in the pavilion with a one hour guided meditation and sound bath lead by Stacey and Laurel. Building on the evening's experience, we will be fully immersed in the vibrations of sound through sacred instruments and the spoken word, penetrating deep within our mind, body and soul to help bring about insight, introspection and restoration. During this experience we will enter a state of inner peace and harmony, connecting to our own sense of self through deep states of relaxation and expansive consciousness by reducing stress and opening our hearts. Guests will leave feeling relaxed, reset and recharged Tickets can be purchased [HERE](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/medicine-for-your-soul-half-day-retreat-tickets-301589832307) Sorry, no refunds if we can't replace your spot [10% early "}
