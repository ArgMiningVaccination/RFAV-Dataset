Strongly Endemic Endemic Sporadic Areas Introduction Different types of Typhoid vaccines Generation - Inactivated Whole - Cell Vaccine 1st Generation - Cell Vaccine (Live Oral) 2nd Generation - Vi Polysaccharide Vaccine 2nd Generation - Vi Polysaccharide Conjugate Vaccine of Vi -polysaccharide bulk Conjugation processes evaluation Characterization of ViPs -TT Conjugates by NIBSC & BBIL Mouse immunogenicity testing by NIBSC & BBIL Non -Clinical Toxicity studies in laboratory animals Stability studies of ViPs -TT Conjugate vaccine Clinical trials Phase II & III Further on- going clinical studies Source for Typhoid Vi Polysaccharide : Purified Typhoid Vi Polysaccharide Bulk from BBIL . The bacterial strain : Salmonella typhi Ty2 given to BBIL by Dr. John Robbins, NIH,USA. Source for Tetanus Toxoid : P.T. Biofarma (WHO Prequalified) Used as Carrier at BBIL Why conjugate vaccine Conjugate Vaccine Polysaccharide Vaccine The covalent attachment of the polysaccharide to a protein carrier can create a conjugate molecule This conjugate molecules can convert the T-independent Polysaccharides (TI) to T-dependent (TD) by creating an enhanced immune responses Several highly immunogenic proteins have been proposed as the protein component, but mainly four have been used Diphtheria, Tetanus toxoid, CRM 197, Outer Membrane protein, N. Meningitidis. NIH Scientists also used Recombinant Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Conjugate Vaccines Characterization of Typbar -TCV S.

Physico -Chemical Studies: a) LAL Assay Endotoxin content of final formulated vaccine batches ranged from 300- 1200 IU/mL, i.e., below EP requirements for ViPs (less than 3750 IU per dose). b) Size Exclusion Chromatography The final Conjugated high molecular weight molecules in formulated material were identified as that of ViPs -TT conjugates. VIPs -TT Conjugates Analysis Report: of NIBSC - 1 c) NMR: The NMR spectrum of the ViPs revealed good levels of O-acetylation ViPs -TT Conjugates Analysis: Report of NIBSC - anti-ViPS Antibody Response in 1:100 diluted sera 0.000.100.200.300.400.500.600.700.800.901.001.101.20 7 day 21 day 28 day MethodsOD 450nm Method 1 Method 2 Method 3 ViPSImmunogenicity studies in Mice The anti-ViPs antibody response of the conjugate polysaccharide vaccine (Method 1) is showing a good response when compared with the plain polysaccharide vaccine and other conjugate methods. 3 different Conjugation methods attempted Mice and Rabbits were used in these studies. Studies done as per Schedule Y guidelines. 1. Single- Dose Toxicity of Typhoid Vi Polysaccharide - TT Conjugate Vaccine in Mice and Rabbits No premature deaths and no clinical observations of acute toxicity seen Body weight gain was normal and satisfactory. No abnormalities were detected. 2. 28 Day Repeated Dose Toxicity Study of Typhoid Vi Polysaccharide - TT Conjugate Vaccine in Mice and Rabbits No treatment related effects on Mortality, Clinical observations, Body weights, Food consumption, Water consumption, Coagulation, Hematology or Clinical chemistry analysis of both Mice and Rabbits. Pre Clinical Toxicity Studies Typbar -TCV development Special Thanks to Dr. Szu for providing the Conjugate Reference Standards for analysis used for Phase II clinical trial samples Clinical Trial Phase -IIa/IIb Open label active controlled Phase IIa / IIb study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of BBIL's Typhoid VIPs - TT Conjugate Vaccine Vs Reference Typhoid Vi Capsular Polysaccharide Vaccine in healthy teenagers (13-17 yrs) and children (2- 12 yrs old). Sample size: Number of subjects enrolled : 100, Number of subjects completed study and analyzed : 95 Number of subjects dropped out: 5 Single & two dose of 25g/0.5mL and two doses of 15g/0.5mL were tested in Phase IIa/IIb study. Single dose of 25g/0.5mL Typhoid- TT conjugate vaccine showed excellent immune response (100% Seroconversion). Based on several considerations, Bharat Biotech carried out a large diverse, multi -centric Phase III Clinical Trial with 25mcg/0.5mL as single dose. Clinical Trial Phase -IIa/IIb Phase -III Clinical Trial A Phase III, randomized, multicentric, controlled study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety BBIL's Typhoid Vi - TCV) vs. Reference Vaccine (Typbar) in healthy subjects. Study Rationale The comparator vaccine is a polysaccharide vaccine which has T-cell independent nature of immune response and is not effective below 2 years and hence not approved for use in this age group. Also we examined other vaccines which could be used as comparator vaccine in below 2 years age group. The other vaccines which could be given in the control arm of this group would be different in the various stratified age range based on the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI)/Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) vaccine schedule leading to complexity of the study design and also statistical analysis. As per the EPI schedule recommendations the Measles, Mumps and Rubella should be administered at 9 to 12 months of age. Recommended age for Hepatitis A vaccine administration is 12 to 23 months . Considering all these issues this group (Cohort- 1) would be single arm, an open labeled study . Cont .. Study Design & Study Population Study Design: randomized, multicentric, controlled Phase III study Study Population: The healthy subjects divided in to two groups of 6 months to 2 years, and >2 years to 45 years Randomization and labeling done by third party A total of 981 subjects allocated at 2:1 ratio to test vaccine and reference vaccine across all the centers.

(Data on file) Immunogenicity Results Literature review The effect of immunogenicity upon the selective dosage of Vi conjugates witnessed that 25 microgram/dose is efficient in raising high levels anti-Vi IgG antibodies in 2-5 year children(Lin & Szu etal.,2004. Infection and Immunity) NIH estimated the protective level of Vi antibody is 7 Elisa unit/mL (Lin and Szu et al., 2001 NEJM) NIH estimated 3.52 Elisa unit/mL (Lin & Szu etal.,2004 .Infection and Immunity) The Vi conjugate prepared using ADH as a linker proven to raise efficient immunogenicity with administration of a single dose containing 25 microgram/dose ., Kossaczka & Szu etal., 1999 . (Infection Typbar -TCV development Special Thanks to Dr. Szu for providing the Conjugate Reference Standard for Phase III clinical trial sera samples analysis (under progress). The Typbar -TCV vaccine is safe and more effective than Typbar vaccine . There is statistically significant difference between Typbar -TCV vaccine and Typbar vaccine in terms of GMT and four fold seroconversion (p<0.05). Typbar -TCV has found to induce high Ab titres in children less than 2 years age. The Superiority of Typbar -TCV vaccine over Typbar vaccine with respect to GMT post vaccination in both the groups with respect to estimated GMT of Typbar -TCV vaccine is ~ 3 - 4 times larger than the Typbar vaccine GMT . Discussion & Conclusion 3- year follow -up underway for seroconversion data of Phase III subjects (18 months data would soon be available) . Measles Interference Study with subjects at 9 months in preparatory phase . Post licensure : plan to evaluate safety in around 3000 subjects. Study the effect of a booster dose on antibody titres .
