Meditation is silence, energising and fulfilling. Silence is the eloquent expression of the inexpressible.\" Sri Chinmoy, [God the Supreme Musician](http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/gsm-1), Agni Press, 1976 \"When we meditate, we make the mind calm, quiet and still \u2014 without thoughts. At that time, we have to be fully aware of the arrival of thoughts and allow no idle thoughts to enter into the mind. The mind is vacant and tranquil, with neither good nor bad thoughts; nothing at all. Our whole existence becomes an empty vessel. When this vessel is absolutely empty, with our whole inner being we invoke infinite Peace, Light and Bliss so it will enter into the vessel and fill it. This is meditation.\" Sri Chinmoy, [Quotes on meditation](http://www.srichinmoyquotes.com/quotes-meditation/) Music, spirituality and meditation \"We all have a heart. You have a heart, I have a heart. Spirituality means softness, sweetness, kindness, sympathy and the feeling of oneness. If anybody plays or sings a spiritual song, there will be something inside the heart that is bound to feel an inner connection with the music. The individual does not have to see the singer or the musician. But the music immediately establishes a kind of friendship with the person because the heart has already become receptive to the music. So you do not have to know what the music represents, as long as you can become one with the essence of the music. You do not have to know which language it belongs to, no. If you can establish oneness with the music, then you will derive immense joy, light and delight from it.\" - Sri Chinmoy, [ Inner peace and world peace](http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/ipwp-13) Learn to Meditate - Resources [Guided meditation exercise](https://www.radiosrichinmoy.org/guided-meditation-breathing-in-peace-and-joy/)- breathing in peace.
