No. The chiropractic physician (DC) license includes treatment of human ailments without the use of prescription drugs and without operative surgery. Therefore, it does not include dispensing or administration of prescription drugs, whether or not the drugs were prescribed by an allopathic physician (medical or osteopathic doctor). In short, chiropractic physicians are bound by the limitations of their license. However, the Attorney General has determined that procedures such as drawing blood are diagnostic procedures and are within the scope of practice for a chiropractic physician. "}
