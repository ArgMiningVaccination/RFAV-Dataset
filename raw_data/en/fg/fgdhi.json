If you want to go deeper: bring your attention to that tingling sensation in your feet for a while. Notice if the sensations are becoming stronger or fainter, if your feet are g etting warmer or cooler. Mind your posture Practice: now and then become aware of your posture for a few moments. If you want to go deeper: when checking your posture, do a quic k scan of your body, noting areas of tension and of calm. Allow your body to settle into a sense of balance. Wash your hands Practice: wash your hands mindfully, feeling the sensation of the water and soap. If you do not have access to a washbasin to wash your hands, imagine you are doing this e xercise and do it for real, when you get a chance. Alternatively, use hand cream and take the time to do i t slowly and with care and mindfulness. If you want to go deeper: as well as washing your hands mindful ly, dry them mindfully. When you have nished, try to bring some of that sense of awareness to whatev er you do next. Drink your tea Practice: next time you're drinking a cup of tea (or coffee) be aware of at least the rst minute of the experience.If you want to go deeper: pay attention to the taste and aroma (smell).

TFI/PUB-476We Can Quit Participant Book A STORY OF PERSISTANCEA Story A story of persistence A man in California was told that there was a diamond vein unde r his farm. So, he went off and bought a huge mining drill. He drilled for days and weeks and months. He got nothing but rubble. Then, one morning, he decided he had enough and gave up. A lost cause. So he sold the farm and went off to make his fortune some other way. The farmer who bought the land was a bit of a h andyman. He managed to get the mining drill working again. After a short time drilling, he hit the diamond vein. He made his fortune. Meanwhile, the previous owner heard about the new man's good fo rtune and he also made a fortune. How? By going around the country telling people that just when peopl e are about to make a breakthrough, they give up. So near and yet so far. He became the guru of persistence - keep on trying and trying and do not give up. Quitting success So many people give up just when they are within inches of thei r tipping point. This is the magic moment when an idea or a new habit seems to take hold and spreads like wild re. You have put huge effort into preparing to quit and quitting sm oking. Maybe when you are just about to make a big breakthrough in making this a lifelong change, you give up. You are back down the slippery slope. When you make a big change in your life, like quitting smoking, your motivation will change over time, like waves hitting the shore. Sometimes you will feel motivated, som etimes you won't. But it's not your motivation that will produce results - it's your action. If you feel that your motivation is down, think back to the goa ls you set and the reasons you wanted to quit. Be inspired by your success to date and how much healthier you are; how good being smoke free feels; or the money you have saved.Adapted from: Pave your way to success with sheer persistence - Declan Coyle in Independent Newspaper declan@andec.ie (permission sought). TFI/PUB-477We Can Quit Participant Book MOTIVATIONMotivation Motivation \u00b7 Quitting smoking may not be easy and life can get in the way. Find strategies that work for you to help you in your quit smoking journey. Try to identify a feeling that you w ill experience when you achieve your goal of one day, one week, one month quit. For example \"At one month quit, I want to feel strong, condent and proud of myself\". Maybe write this down and post it on a wall to remind yourself of your goal. \u00b7 Why not try writing a journal or recording your quit smoking journey. It can be helpful to record things as though you are talking to a friend and you can read back you r entries when you need some extra motivation. For example \"I was at a family gathering today and there were some people smoking. I found some non-smokers to chat with. I talked about how well I was getting on and they were very supportive and encouraging\". \u00b7 Think about the money that you will have when you have quit s moking for one week, one month, six months or one year. Think of something you said you would like or like to do, if you only had the money. It might be paying off a debt, buying a treat, getting swimming lessons or heading off on a holiday. Focus your attention on this and maybe put a picture up on a wall near a money box w here you keep the money you save from not smoking.\u00b7 Think about how quitting smoking is an investment in you - yo ur health, your wellbeing, your money. Think of the opportunities that will come your way as you quit smoking: start a new sport or activity; having more energy to do the things you love; having money to treat yourself; etc.\u00b7 \"Get online\"! If you are someone who likes technology, this w ill be an easy one. Get on the Quit Facebook page, Instagram or Twitter, and hear about other people's quitt ing success and how they manage challenges and celebrate their achievements. It can be a great source of e xtra support. If you are not very good with technology, you might think about learning a new skill in compu ters. Keep your hands busy Maybe there is a job at home that you have been putting off for some time, like clearing out a cupboard, xing those shelves or tidying up the garden. Sorting it out will not only keep your hands and mind busy but also help you to change the spaces in your home. You might even nd something that you forgot you had or were looking for.
