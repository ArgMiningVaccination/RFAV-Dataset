However, current evidence is limited to single social media platforms. Our objective was to compare arguments used by anti-vaxxers in the context of COVID-19 vaccines across Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok. We obtained the data set of 53,671 comments regarding COVID-19 vaccination published between August 2021 and February 2022. After that, we established categories of anti-vaccine content, manually classified comments, and compared the frequency of occurrence of the categories between social media platforms. We found that anti-vaxxers on social media use 14 categories of arguments against COVID-19 vaccines. The frequency of these categories varies across different social media platforms. The anti-vaxxers' activity on Facebook and Twitter is similar, focusing mainly on distrust of government and allegations regarding vaccination safety and effectiveness. Anti-vaxxers on TikTok mainly focus on personal freedom, while Instagram users encouraging vaccination often face criticism suggesting that vaccination is a private matter that should not be shared. Due to the differences in vaccine sentiment among users of different social media platforms, future research and educational campaigns should consider these distinctions, focusing more on the platforms popular among adolescents (i.e., Instagram and TikTok).", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-07-27", "cleaned_text": "Attitudes toward COVID-19 Vaccination on Social Media: A Cross-Platform Analysis [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10081190](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10081190) [1](#B1-vaccines-10-01190), [2](#B2-vaccines-10-01190)]. Negative sentiment on social media persisted after the start of the vaccination campaign [ [3](#B3-vaccines-10-01190), [4](#B4-vaccines-10-01190)], although the vaccination of millions of people has demonstrated the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines [ [5](#B5-vaccines-10-01190)]. [6](#B6-vaccines-10-01190), [7](#B7-vaccines-10-01190)]. About 40% of frequently shared health information on social media contains text classified as fake news, and the most fallacious content concerns vaccines [ [8](#B8-vaccines-10-01190)]. The experiment conducted by Betsch et al. revealed that even 5-10 min of access to anti-vaccine websites decrease the intention to vaccinate and increase the perception of risk [ [9](#B9-vaccines-10-01190)]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media was one of the main information sources on newly introduced vaccines [ [10](#B10-vaccines-10-01190)]. However, the influence of social media on attitudes towards vaccination against COVID-19 is unclear. Social media's negative and positive effects on the perception of safety and the willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 have been reported [ [11](#B11-vaccines-10-01190), [12](#B12-vaccines-10-01190), [13](#B13-vaccines-10-01190), [14](#B14-vaccines-10-01190)]. The analysis of vaccine-related social media opinions is especially important considering the high dynamic of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in society [ [15](#B15-vaccines-10-01190), [16](#B16-vaccines-10-01190)]. [2](#B2-vaccines-10-01190), [3](#B3-vaccines-10-01190), [17](#B17-vaccines-10-01190)]. Prior to the pandemic, subjects regarding insufficient vaccine testing and ineffectiveness, commonly discussed in the context of COVID-19 vaccines, were virtually absent in the anti-vaccine discourse [ [18](#B18-vaccines-10-01190)]. Conversely, the historically popular theme linking vaccination to the development of autism in children has disappeared during the pandemic [ [19](#B19-vaccines-10-01190)]. Anti-vaccine arguments on social media vary over time, making it necessary to monitor them regularly in different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic [ [2](#B2-vaccines-10-01190), [3](#B3-vaccines-10-01190)]. [1](#B1-vaccines-10-01190), [3](#B3-vaccines-10-01190), [4](#B4-vaccines-10-01190), [20](#B20-vaccines-10-01190), [21](#B21-vaccines-10-01190), [22](#B22-vaccines-10-01190)]. Facebook and Instagram [ [2](#B2-vaccines-10-01190), [17](#B17-vaccines-10-01190), [23](#B23-vaccines-10-01190), [24](#B24-vaccines-10-01190)], and one paper examined content on TikTok [ [25](#B25-vaccines-10-01190)]. The lack of multi-platform analyses leaves knowledge regarding attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination incomplete and selective, since there are significant sociodemographic differences among the users of different social media platforms. The major differences include gender, age, and income [ [26](#B26-vaccines-10-01190)]. Thus, none of the social media platforms provide a complete cross-section of society; however, it has not been investigated whether these sociodemographic differences influence attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination across social media platform users. Depending on the social platform, the impact of content on the user's well-being is different. Therefore, the platforms must be differentiated in research to fully understand users' attitudes and behaviors [ [27](#B27-vaccines-10-01190)]. [27](#B27-vaccines-10-01190)]. This paper studies differences in attitudes toward vaccination by using a single hashtag that gained popularity on Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram and provided a unique opportunity to conduct a comparative analysis among different social media platforms. 1.2. Aim of the Study 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Data Collection [28](#B28-vaccines-10-01190)], we retrieved 24,869 comments from Facebook, 8721 comments from Twitter, 2997 comments from Instagram, and from TikTok. 2.2. Data Categorization [2](#B2-vaccines-10-01190), [3](#B3-vaccines-10-01190), [18](#B18-vaccines-10-01190)]. In the second step, we randomly selected 100 comments from the collection, and two researchers (D.W. and J.K.) categorized the comments using this initial codebook. In the cases where we could not find a proper category for a comment, we created a new category by consensus. Finally, we removed all unused categories from the initial codebook and created a final codebook of anti-vaccine themes. [29](#B29-vaccines-10-01190)] to estimate our interrater agreement. We found that the agreement was high ( = 0.919). Finally, we discussed the divergence in the assessments, and we assigned the differently rated comments to categories through consensus. As the concordance of the assessments was high, we conducted further classification individually. We divided the remaining 900 comments equally between the two researchers (D.W. and J.K.), who independently assigned comments to the categories. 2.3. Keyword Extraction [30](#B30-vaccines-10-01190)]. The calculation was based on the word counts within categories and in the corpus. To create these counts, we first performed the following pre-processing steps: (i) delete URLs, hashtags, and usernames in the Twitter mentions and emojis; (ii) translate the comments into English using DeepL API [ [31](#B31-vaccines-10-01190)]; (iii) remove digits, punctuation, and stopwords; (iv) lemmatize words (reduce words to their dictionary form) using WordNet\u00ae lemmatizer [ [32](#B32-vaccines-10-01190)] with the Stanford Part of Speech tagger [ [33](#B33-vaccines-10-01190)]. [34](#B34-vaccines-10-01190)]. This generally down-weights globally frequent terms. A parameter () determines the weight given to each of the two components (we set ). Finally, we ranked the keywords according to relevance and selected the top words in each category. 2.4. Social Media Similarity [35](#B35-vaccines-10-01190)]. The Cosine similarity between two platforms is defined as: 3. Results 3.1. Data Overview [Table 1](#vaccines-10-01190-t001)presents the number of comments from each platform in the final data set, their total number of reactions, and average length as measured by the number of words in the comment. Facebook and Instagram users write the longest comments about COVID-19 vaccination, averaging 2.5 times longer than those created by TikTok users. The most popular comments on Instagram receive approximately five times fewer reactions compared to the other analyzed social media platforms. 3.2. Categories of Comments [Table 2](#vaccines-10-01190-t002). Anti-vaccine content is present in 73% of the most popular social media comments about vaccination. Anti-vaxxers mainly declare that they would not be vaccinated because of their inherent freedom of choice. In addition, they often distrust the government and accuse vaccines of being dangerous to health, ineffective, or inadequately tested. [Table 3](#vaccines-10-01190-t003)presents all categories, with examples of original comments from the final data set. [Table 3](#vaccines-10-01190-t003). The consistency of the categories and keywords showed that our assignment of the comments to categories was semantically coherent. Words specific to Polish discourse require an additional description. The word \"Pinocchio\" refers to the Polish prime minister and is associated with public accusations of his frequent lies. Amantadine is considered a miracle drug against COVID-19, similarly to ivermectin in other countries. 3.3. Differences among Social Media Platforms [Figure 1](#vaccines-10-01190-f001)shows each category's level of popularity on the analyzed social media platforms. The highest proportion of anti-vaccine comments is found on Twitter and the lowest on Instagram. There are differences in the anti-vaccine arguments between users of social media platforms. Anti-vaxxers on TikTok mainly focus on the issue of freedom of choice (Category 1). Conversely, anti-vaccine Facebook and Twitter users focus on similar categories of arguments, primarily emphasizing their lack of trust in the government and pointing out that vaccines are dangerous to health or ineffective (Categories 2, 3, and 4). Instagram users are more likely than others to believe that vaccines are poorly tested (Category 5) and often criticize the public's praise about being vaccinated (Category 6), despite Instagram being a platform designed to share moments from everyday life. [Figure 2](#vaccines-10-01190-f002)illustrates the pairwise scores. A score of 1 indicates perfect similarity between two platforms, whereas a score of 0 represents no similarity. Anti-vaxxers on Facebook and Twitter use the same comment categories with similar frequency, whereas TikTok and Twitter are most dissimilar. 4. Discussion 4.1. Empirical Setting [36](#B36-vaccines-10-01190), [37](#B37-vaccines-10-01190)]. In contrast, the hashtag \"#COVID19Vaccine\" is specific to COVID-19 vaccines. However, it contains almost only positive content regarding vaccination. This may be due to the policies of combating disinformation and fake news introduced on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok [ [38](#B38-vaccines-10-01190), [39](#B39-vaccines-10-01190)]. Although these solutions do not completely eliminate the activity of anti-vaccine movements on social media, they distort the analysis of anti-vaccine sentiment [ [40](#B40-vaccines-10-01190), [41](#B41-vaccines-10-01190)]. Since the fight against misinformation on social media is much less effective in languages other than English, non-English anti-vaccine content is less distorted by the censorship of social media platforms [ [39](#B39-vaccines-10-01190)]. [2](#B2-vaccines-10-01190), [42](#B42-vaccines-10-01190)] have shown a high convergence of anti-vaccine other countries [ [1](#B1-vaccines-10-01190), [3](#B3-vaccines-10-01190), [4](#B4-vaccines-10-01190), [18](#B18-vaccines-10-01190)]. [Table 4](#vaccines-10-01190-t004)presents youngest population with a predominance of women. Twitter and Facebook, which are mostly analyzed in the current literature, have different sociodemographic characteristics, with a large group of their users over 35 years of age. In addition, men are predominant among Twitter users. All analyzed platforms require users to be 13 years of age or older to create an account following their regulations; there are no specific rules in Polish law. However, these restrictions are often only theoretical, and many younger children actively use social media [ [47](#B47-vaccines-10-01190)]. 4.2. Anti-Vaccine Arguments on Social Media [48](#B48-vaccines-10-01190)]. The second most popular anti-vaccine argument concerns distrust toward the government. The government responsible for the vaccination campaign is accused of being unable to deal with the pandemic. It is also alleged that the government is working for the benefit of pharmaceutical corporations, not the public. This is in line with research that has shown that trust in the government influences willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 [ [49](#B49-vaccines-10-01190)]. [50](#B50-vaccines-10-01190), [51](#B51-vaccines-10-01190)]). A related argument is that the vaccines were inadequately tested or that some side effects may appear months or years after vaccination, like in the case of fast development of the swine flu vaccine [ [52](#B52-vaccines-10-01190)]. Safety is a common concern among anti-vaxxers, which may be due to insufficient transparency of COVID-19 vaccine trials [ [53](#B53-vaccines-10-01190)]. [54](#B54-vaccines-10-01190)]; thus, they attempt to discredit those who encourage vaccination. [55](#B55-vaccines-10-01190)], some anti-vaxxers believe that the disease is not so dangerous as to require vaccination. Conversely, others believe that it is better to use drugs that are not registered to treat this disease (e.g., amantadine or ivermectin) than to prevent it. At first glance, there is an inconsistency in the fact that anti-vaxxers who distrust science want to take other medical substances with less evidence than the vaccines. However, some anti-vaxxers are not only against the vaccines, but also create a complex alternative narrative of the pandemic. These conspiracy theories in such narratives may be inconsistent but are tied together by a belief that the government hides the truth [ [56](#B56-vaccines-10-01190)]. Another argument suggests that natural methods of boosting immunity and treatments are better than immunization. Natural medicine is often preferred by people committed to environmentalism and interested in spirituality or personal growth psychology [ [57](#B57-vaccines-10-01190)]. However, natural treatment methods in the case of COVID-19 may delay the implementation of an effective and scientifically proven therapy. [58](#B58-vaccines-10-01190)]. The allegations also include the argument that corporations are not responsible for the side effects despite large profits. However, they do not mention creating enough worldwide compensation funds for adverse effects of the vaccines such as the WHO's compensation program for 92 low- and middle-income countries [ [59](#B59-vaccines-10-01190)]. 4.3. Comparison of Social Media Platforms [60](#B60-vaccines-10-01190)]. Second, Facebook and Twitter users often express disbelief in the safety or efficiency of vaccination. These similarities may be due to the similar age structure, with a higher proportion of older people compared to other platforms, as presented in [Table 4](#vaccines-10-01190-t004). [61](#B61-vaccines-10-01190), [62](#B62-vaccines-10-01190)]. TikTok involves the youngest population studied. Their anti-vaccine comments are generally short and emphasize personal freedom. This finding is consistent with research showing the development of rebellion and a desire for autonomy in adolescents [ [63](#B63-vaccines-10-01190)]. Although the distribution of anti-vaccine comments on TikTok is highly independent of Twitter and Facebook, there are similarities with Instagram. Users on Instagram and TikTok complain that COVID-19 vaccines are improperly tested. This may be related to the young age of users on these platforms for whom individual safety and long vaccine testing are more important than the population's health, since they do not belong to the at-risk group due to the fact of their age. The anti-vaxxers on TikTok and Instagram also often accuse users promoting vaccines of creating sponsored content. As the marketing content is generally widespread on those platforms [ [64](#B64-vaccines-10-01190)], anti-vaxxers may be more willing to believe that all content promoting vaccination on TikTok and Instagram is sponsored. 4.4. Practical Implications [65](#B65-vaccines-10-01190)] proved that politicians' messaging endorsing the COVID-19 vaccines can increase uptake among those who identify with that speaker. Information campaigns should also take into account that positive messaging promoting community protection provided by vaccines has a stronger impact on users' willingness to vaccinate than messaging promoting only personal safety [ [66](#B66-vaccines-10-01190)]. 4.5. Limitations [67](#B67-vaccines-10-01190)]. Such an argument did not appear in our data set. Thirdly, the opinions on social media do not strictly represent public opinions because negative information spreads faster than positive [ [68](#B68-vaccines-10-01190), [69](#B69-vaccines-10-01190)]. For this reason, the proportion of anti-vaccine comments on social media may be higher than the number of vaccine opponents in society. 5.
