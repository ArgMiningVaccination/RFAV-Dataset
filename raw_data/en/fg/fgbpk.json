Because here's the bottom line: getting stuck in [negative emotions](https://rebekahsimonpeter.com/emotional-intelligence) won't do for spiritual leaders like you. It's time to boost your resilience so that you can continue to lead with agility and flexibility. Step #1: Hear the Word Start with an uplifting message from Scripture. For instance, consider the simple yet powerful verse from Psalm 118:24: \"This is the day the Lord has made, we will rejoice and be glad in it.\" Now, put yourself in the picture: \"This is the day the Lord has made, I will rejoice and be glad in it.\" If this sounds like more of a command than an affirmation, you have picked the right one. The truth is, no one feels like rejoicing all the time. No one is always glad. Step #2: Listen to Your Soul Ask your soul what is getting in the way of your rejoicing or of being glad. Consult the following list of potential barriers and note the ones that apply to you: - Worry - Self-doubt - Blame - People-pleasing - Busyness - Unforgiveness Step #3: Clear the Pathway To clear the pathway back to your soul: - Invite Jesus to hear your list and to listen with compassion. - Read your list out loud, sparing no detail. - Sense the barriers being removed as you fess up. - Light the list afire and offer it up for Divine guidance. Welcome the Holy Spirit back into the newly cleaned space of your soul. Step #4: Start the Day Over Now that you have cleared the pathway back to your soul, and hopefully back to the space of gladness and rejoicing, it's time to start the day over! Personalize and recite the psalm so that it sings. Perhaps like this: \"Today I rejoice in this day that the Lord has made, I am glad to be alive in it!\" Now that you're ready for spiritual renewal, extend that to the life of your congregation.
