It is an estimate of the amount KPIC will pay if You are eligible and meet all the requirements of the Group Policy at the time the treatment You have planned is completed. In order to receive Pre -determination of Benefits, Your Provider must send a statement of proposed treatment to our Administrator, Delta Dental listing the proposed treatment. Delta Dental will send Your Provider a Notice of Predetermination of Benefits which estimates how much of the treatment costs KPIC will pay and how much You will have to pay. After You review the estimate with Your Provider and You decide to go ahead with the treatment plan, Your Provider returns the statement to the following address for payment after treatment has been completed.

Please see the \"Exception Requests for a drug not on the formulary\" subsection below for information on the exception process. Prior Authorization Outpatient Prescription Drug Prior authorization is a procedure that is used to encourage safe and cost -effective medication use. Prior authorization is generally applied to drugs that have multiple indications, are high in cost, or have a significant safety concern. The purpose of prior authorization is to ensure that a Covered Person gets the right medication. This means that when Your licensed prescribing provider prescribes a drug that has been identified as subject to prior authorization, the medication needs to be reviewed by Us to determine Medical Necessity before the prescription is filled. Prior authorization edits address clinical appropriateness, including genomic testing, safety issues, dosing restrictions and ongoing treatment criteria. If a drug requires prior authorization, your licensed prescribing provider will need to work with Us to pre -approve the drug. Prior authorized drugs have specific clinical criteria that You must meet in order to obtain coverage. Refer to the formulary for a complete list of medications requiring prior authorization. The most current formulary can be obtained by visiting kp.org/kpic/ppo. If you have questions about prior authorization or about drugs covered You can call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (closed holidays), at 1- 800-788-2949 or 711 (TTY). The Covered Person or the licensed prescribing provider must notify the Prescription Drug Review Program as follows : Send the request form that is available on- line at kp.org/kpic.

Under this program, a \"step\" approach is required to receive coverage for certain high- cost medications. Refer to the formulary for a complete list of medications requiring step therapy. This means that to receive coverage You may first need to try a proven, cost -effective medication before using a more costly treatment. Treatment decisions are always between You and Your Provider. The step therapy program is a process that defines how and when a particular drug can be dispensed by requiring the use of one or more prerequisite drugs (1st line agents), as identified through the Covered Person's drug history, prior to the use of another drug (2nd line agent). SAMPLEOUTPATIENT PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS PPO-COI-SG-Std (2023) 115 2023- COI (Sg) Std Your licensed prescribing provider should prescribe a first -line medication appropriate for Your condition.

SAMPLEPPO-COI-SG-Std (2023) 133 2023- COI (Sg) Std COORDINATIO N OF BENEFITS Application This Coordination of Benefits provision applies when the Covered Person has coverage under more than one Plan. If this provision applies, the benefit determination rules state whether this Plan pays before or after another Plan. The benefits of this Plan: 1. will not be reduced when this Plan is primary; 2. may be reduced when another Plan is primary and this Plan is secondary. The benefits of This Plan are reduced so that they and the benefits payable under all other Plans do not total more than 100% of the Allowable Expenses during any Calendar Year; and 3. will not exceed the benefits payable in the absence of other coverage. Order of Benefit Determination Rules This Plan determines its order of benefits by using the first of the following that applies: 1. General: A Plan that does not coordinate with other Plans is always the primary Plan. 2. Non-dependent \\Dependent: The benefits of the Plan which covers the person as a Covered Person, or subscriber (other than a Dependent) is the prima ry Plan; the Plan which covers the person as a Dependent is the secondary Plan. 3. Dependent Child--Parents Not Separated or Divorced: When This Plan and another Plan cover the same child as a Dependent of different parents, benefits for the child are determi ned as follows: a) the primary Plan is the Plan of the parent whose birthday (month and day) falls earlier in the year. The secondary Plan is the Plan of the parent whose birthday falls later in the year. b) if both parents have the same birthday, the benefits of the Plan which covered the parent the longer time is the primary Plan; the Plan which covered the parent the shorter time is the secondary Plan. c) if the other Plan does not have the birthday rule, but has the male\\ female rule and if, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, the rule in the other Plan will determine the order of benefits. 4. Dependent Child: Separated or Divorced Parents: If two or more Plans cover a person as a Dependent child of divorced or separated parents, benefits for the child are determined as follows: a) first, the Plan of the parent with custody of the child; b) then, the Plan of the spouse or Domestic Partner of the parent with custody of the child; and c) finally, the Plan of the parent without custody of the child. However, if the specific terms of a court decree state that one parent is responsible for the health care expenses of the child and the entity obligated to pay or provide the benefits of the Plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, that Plan is the primary Plan. This paragraph does not apply with respect to any Calendar Year during which any benefits actually paid or provided before the entity has actual knowledge. Also, benefits for the child of a non -custodial parent who is responsible for the health care expenses of the child may be paid directly to the provider, if the custodial parent so requests. SAMPLECOORDINATION OF BENEFITS PPO-COI-SG-Std (2023) 134 2023- COI (Sg) Std 5. Active/Inactive Service: The primary Plan is the Plan which covers the person as a Covered Person who is neither laid off or retired (or as that employee's Dependent). The secondary Plan is the Plan which covers that person as a laid off or retired Covered Person (or as that Covered Person's Dependent). If the other Plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule does not apply. 6. Longer \\Shorter Length Of Coverage: If none of the above rules determines the order of benefits. the primary Plan is the Plan which covered a Covered Person, or subscriber the longer time. The secondary Plan is the Plan which covered that person the shorter time. Effect of Medicare This Plan will be primary to Medicare for an active employee and Dependent spouse or Domestic Partner of such active employee. This Plan will not be primary to Medicare if the Covered Person is eligible for Medicare as primary. Any such Covered Person may not continue enrollment under This Plan. Medicare is primary for an insured retiree or the Dependent spouse or Domestic Partner of a retiree age 65 or over; this applies whether or not the retiree or spouse or Domestic Partner is enrolled in Medicare. Members with Medicare and Retirees This plan is not intended for retirees and most Medicare beneficiaries. If, during the term of this Group Policy, You are or become eligible for Medicare or you retire, the following will apply: If You are the Insured Employee and You retire, Your coverage under this Policy will be terminated and you may be eligible to continue membership as described in Your Group Policy or in the Termination of Membership section of This Plan. If federal law requires that Your Group's health care plan be primary and Medicare coverage be secondary, Your coverage under this Policy will be the same as it would be if You had not become eligible for Medicare. If none of the above applies to You and You are eligible for Medicare, please ask Your Group's benefits administrator about Your membership options. Reduction in this Plan's Benefits When the benefits of This Plan are reduced, each benefit is reduced in proportion. It is t hen charged against any applicable Benefit Maximum of This Plan. Any benefit amount not paid under This Plan because of coordinating benefits becomes a benefit credit under This Plan. This amount can be used to pay any added Allowable Expenses the Covered Person may incur during the remainder of the Calendar Year, including any coinsurance payable under This Plan. Right to Receive and Release Information Certain facts are needed to coordinate benefits. KPIC may get needed facts from or give them to any other organization or person. KPIC need not tell, or get the consent of any person to do this. Each person claiming benefits under This Plan must give KPIC any facts it needs to pay the claim . Facility of Payment A payment made under another Plan may have included an amount which should have been paid under This Plan. If it does, KPIC may pay that amount to the organization that made the payment. That amount will then be treated as though it were a benefit paid under This Plan. KPIC will not pay that amount again. The term \"payment made\" includes providing benefits in the form of SAMPLECOORDINATION OF BENEFITS PPO-COI-SG-Std (2023) 135 2023- COI (Sg) Std services.

The \"amount of payments made\" includes the reasonable cash value of any benefits provided in the form of services. When a Covered Person's Injury appears to be someone else's fault, benefits otherwise payable under the policy for Covered Expense incurred as a result of that Injury will not be paid unless the Covered Person or his legal representative agrees: a) to repay KPIC for such benefits to the extent they are for losses for which compensation is paid to the Covered Person by or on behalf of the person at fault; b) to allow KPIC a lien on such compensation and to hold such compensation in trust for KPIC; and c) to execute and give to KPIC any instruments needed to secure the rights under a) and b).

In addition, there are separate Appeals procedures for Adverse Benefit Determinations due to a retroactive termination of coverage (rescission). If We deny Your Claim (Post Service, Pre -service or Concurrent Claims), in whole or in part, You have the right to request an Appeal of such decision. The internal Appeals process is described below. Additionally, our Adverse Benefit Determination notice will tell You why We denied Your claim and will include information regarding the mandatory appeal rights, including external review, that may be available to You. We must receive Your review request within 180 days of Your receiving Our Adverse Benefit Determination. Please note that We will count the 180 days starting 5 business days from the date of the notice to allow for delivery time, unless You can prove that You rec eived the notice after that 5 business day period. Providing Additional Information Regarding Your Claim When You Appeal, You may send us additional information including comments, documents, and additional medical records that You believe support Your Claim.

Pre-service Claims and Appeals. Pre-service Claims are requests that we provide or pay for a Service that You have not yet received. Failure to receive authorization before receiving a service that must be authorized or precertified in order to be a covered benefit may be the basis of reduction of Your benefits or for our denial of Your pre -service Claim or a post -service Claim for payment. If You receive any of the Covered Services You are requesting before we make our decision, Your pre- service Claim or Appeal will become a post -service Claim or Appeal with respect to those services. If You have any general questions about pre- service Claims or Appeals, please call 1- 888-251-7052. Following are the procedures for filing a pre -service Claim, a non- urgent pre- service Appeal, and an urgent pre -service Appeal.
