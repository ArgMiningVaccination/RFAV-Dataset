Thank you for the invitation to provide testimony on this important topic. While many Americans may have largely moved beyond the detrimental impacts of the COV ID-19 vaccine mandates , one of our natio n's greatest assets \u2014our military service members \u2014are still suffering the consequences . This testimony will explain the following: how the military mandates remained in effect long after all other Executive Branch -level mandates were overturned, the unlawful treatment s ervice members received once they exercised their rights and lawfully objected to required vaccination , and how despite the 2023 NDAA language requiring rescission of the Department of Defense COVID -19 vaccine requirement, our national security remains at risk. 2 THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO COVID -19 BEFORE THE MANDATES ISSUED The World Health Organization declared the COVID -19 outbreak a public health emergency on January 30, 2020.1 Vaccines first became available in December 2020.2 At that time, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that \"if 75 percent to 80 percent of Americans are vaccinated in broad -based campaigns likely to start in the second quarter of next year, then the U.S. should reach . . . herd immunity threshold months later. \"3 According to Dr. Fauci, \"[i]f vaccination levels are significantly lower, 40 percent to 50 percent . . . it could take a very long time to re ach that level of protection. \"4 But by May of 2021, as reported by The Hill, Dr. Fauci changed his message, stating that \"[t]he herd immunity threshold is not attainable \u2014 at least not in the foreseeable future, and perhaps not ever .\"5 The article reported that \"[i] nstead, [experts] are coming to the conclusion that rather than making a long -promised exit, the virus will most likely become a manageable threat that will continue to circulate in the United States for years to come, still causing hospitalizations and deaths but in much smaller numbers.\"6 In fact, Dr. Fauci said \"people should forget about what experts have said in the past, which they said depended on herd immunity, and focus on getting vaccinated or encouraging them to ge t vaccinated. \" Shifting gears from the herd immunity approach, the Executive Branch began incentivizing Americans to get vaccinated. In April of 2021, the President \" announced a tax credit for employers offering vaccine -related paid leave as the White House urge [d] more 1 World Health Org., Timeline: WHO's COVID - is/ 6 Id. 3 Americans to seek out Covid shots amid a slight decline in vaccinations. \"7 Then, in May of 2021, \"[t] he U.S. coronavirus vaccination campaign ha [d] reached a tipping point, with supply outstripping demand due to factors including ambivalence or skepticism about the vaccines as well as access issues. In [the spring of 2021] , the number of Americans seeking to be vaccinated against COVID -19 dropped by a third, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \"8 That forced \"public health officials to try new strategies to persuade people to get the shot, efforts that range [d] from creative gimmicks to grassroots outreach resembling get-out-the-vote drives .\"9 By June of 2021, it was reported that the President was offering more incentives, \"[d]angling everything from sports tickets to a free beer, President Joe Biden is looking for that extra something \u2014 anything \u2014 that will get people to roll up their sleeves for COVID -19 shots when the promise of a life -saving vaccine by itself hasn't been enough. \"10 At the same time, on June 30, 2021, a Military.com article explained that a \"new study of U.S. service members found higher than expected rates of heart inflammation following receipt of COVID -19 vaccines. It's a finding Defense Department researchers say should call attention to the condition, known as myocarditis, as a potential side effect of the immunizations. In an article published . . . in JAMA Cardiology11, U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force physicians described 23 cases of myocarditis in previously healthy males who developed the condition within four days of receiving a COVID - 7 . . All were previously healthy and physically fit and none showed any evidenc e of having acute COVID -19 illness or any other infection, according to the report.\"12 But on July 22, 2021, U.S. News and World Report, in an article titled, \"Biden Goes Too Far in Assurances About Vaccines,\" reported that \" President Joe Biden offered an absolute guarantee ... that people who get their COVID -19 vaccines are completely protected from infection, sickness and death from the coronavirus. The reality is not that cut and dried . . . 'breakthrough ' infections do occur and the delta variant driving cases among the unvaccinated in the U.S. is not fully understood. \"13 THE ONSET OF THE COVID -19 V ACCINE MANDATES After assuring the public that the COVID vaccines provided complete protection from the virus, o n July 29, 2021, in addition to announcing vacc ination mandates for federal employees pursuant to Executive Order 14043 (Federal Employee Mandate) and federal contractors pursuant to Executive Order 14042 (Federal Contractor Mandate) , the President announced that he directed the Department of Defense (DoD) to require military service members to receive a COVID -19 vaccination.14 \"[T]he President bluntly argued that if you are unvaccinated, ' You present a problem to yourself, to your family and to those with whom you work. '\"15 As reported by CNN , the decision \"mark [ed] a pivot away from encouraging Americans to get vaccinated in their own time and stepping toward placing the onus on unvaccinated individuals. 15 Id. 16 Id. 5 However, just one day later, on July 30 , 2021, new data17 was released by the CDC showing that \"vaccinated people infected with the delta variant can carry detectable viral loads similar to those of people who are unvaccinated.\"18 According to an August 2, 2021 article published by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, there was also \"some question about how cultivatable - or viable - this virus retrieved from vaccinated people actually is.\"19 Looking a few months ahead , on October 29, 2021, a Lancet study20 found even more evidence that \"once infected, the vaccinated were just as likely to transmit COVID to people in their own households as the unvaccinated\" and that the \"asymptomatic infection rate among vaccinated and unvaccinated participants was similar: around 30 percent.\"21 Despite this developing data, the Biden Administration continued to mandate COVID -19 vaccination, which eventually affected nearly every aspect of the American workforce . In addition to the Federal Employee Mandate , Federal Contractor Mandate , and the military mandates, on November 5, 2021, employers with at least 100 employees were required to implement a mandatory COVID -19 vaccination policy as directed by the OSHA Emergency Temporary Standard .22 However, b ecause the mandates , generally, imposed significa nt U.S. Constitutional, statutory, and financial , and other harm on citizens, service members, and businesses, 56 lawsuits were filed in federal district courts across the nation.23 Ultimately, each of the mandates was rescinded. 17 https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7031e2.htm?s_cid=mm7031e2_w 18 https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2021/new . Reg. 61402 (2021) 23 Exhibit 1, First Liberty Institute Mandate Related Case List , July 26, 2023 6 A. The DoD's COVID -19 Vaccine Mandate On August 24, 2021, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin issued a memorandum directing the DoD to vaccinate all active -duty and reserve service members against COVID -19.24 The DoD also confirmed that the mandate applied to members of the National Guard.25 The memo made clear that service members who contracted and recovered from COVID -19 must still receive a vaccination. But the memo also exempted from the mandate all servi ce members who are currently participating in a COVID -19 clinical trial \u2014even those given a placebo . The total number of service members that were required to comply with this mandate was approximately 1,417,800.26 1. The Navy's COVID -19 Vaccine Mandate On August 30, 2021, Secretary of the Navy Carlos del Toro issued All Navy (ALNA V) message 062/21, entitled \"Department of Navy Mandatory COVID -19 Vaccination Policy.\"27 This policy imposed a vaccination mandate for Navy active -duty and reserve personnel, directing them to become vaccinated within 90 and 120 days, respectively , and reiterated the exemption for \"[s]ervice [m]embers who are actively participating in COVID -19 clinical t rials[.]\"28 The total number of Navy service members who were required to comply with the Navy's COVID -19 vaccination requirement 29https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy#:~:text=With%20336%2C 978%20personnel%20on%20active,b ranches%20in%20terms%20of%20personnel. 7 In addition to requiring vaccination, the Navy threatened punishment on those who declined the C OVID -19 vaccines. On September 24, 2021, the Navy issued \"Trident Order #12 - Mandatory Vaccination for COVID -19.\"30 In this order , the Navy declared \"non -deployable\" all SEALs and SWCCs who obtain \u2014or even merely request \u2014a religious accommodation. This disdain for religious service members sharply contrast ed with the Navy's more receptive attitude toward those submitting medical exemption requests; the medical disqualification provision in Manual of the Medical Department (MANMED) 15 -105(3)(n)(9) expressly \"does not pertain to medical contraindications or allergies to vaccine administration.\" Thus, an unvaccinated Special Operations service member who receive d a medical accommodation could be deployed, but one who merely ask ed for a religious accommodation was rendered non-deployable. A few weeks later, o n October 13, 2023, the Chief of Naval Operations issued NA V ADMIN 225/21, which threatened religious objectors not only with the loss of their careers, but also with potentially crippling debt.31 It state d that, \"[t]o date, over 98 percent of active -duty U.S. Navy service members have met their readiness responsibility by completing or initiating a COVID -19 vaccination series.\"32 NA V ADMIN 225/21 further state d that \"Navy service members refusing the COVID -19 vaccination, absent a pending or approved exemption, shall be processed for administrative separation .\"33 It also provide d that the Navy \"may seek recoupment of applicable bonuses, special and incentive pays, and the cost of training and education for servi ce members refusing the vaccine.\"34 On its face, this recoupment provision was not forward - looking. Instead, it targeted past training costs, bonuses, and payments, even for duties already 30 Exhibit 2 - Navy's Trident Order #12, September 24, 2021 31https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Portals/55/Messages/NAVADMIN/NAV2021/NAV21225.txt?ver=EfkG2psijI2X0I EKSId_5w%3D%3D#:~:text=This% 20NAVADMIN%20announces%20the%20assignment,are%20not%20fully%20 vaccinated%20per 32 Id. 33 Id. 34 Id. 8 fulfilled. For Special Operations personnel, such as SEALs , this mean t that the Navy was threatening to force each of them to pay back over $1 million. NA V ADMIN 225/21 also authorize d temporary reassignment of \"Navy service members who refuse d the COVID -19 vaccine, regardless of exemption status, based on operatio nal readiness or mission requirements.\"35 It also mandate d that \"[c]ommands shall not allow those refusing the vaccine to promote/advance, reenlist, or execute orders, with the exception of separation orders, until the CCDA has completed disposition of their case.\"36 And it direct ed that \"commanders and commanding officers shall delay the promotion of any officer refusing the vaccine.\"37 On November 15, 2021, the Navy issued another discriminatory policy \u2014NAV ADMIN 256/21, \"CCDA Guidance to Commanders .\"38 This policy states that \"Navy service members whose C OVID -19 vaccination exemp tion request is denied are required to receive the COVID - 19 vaccine as directed by the exemption adjudicating authority or commence vaccination within 5 days of being notified of the denial, if the exemption adjudicating authority does not specify.\"39 NA V A DMIN 256/21 also states that Navy service members who continue to refuse vaccination after the expiration of the five days \"will be processed for separation and be subject to the other administrative actions described in this NAV ADMIN and [NA V ADMIN 225/21] .\"40 In addition to immediate processing for separation, the \"other administrative actions described in this NA V ADMIN\" include adverse performance evaluations; denial of promotion or advancement; and, subject to the discretion of the Department of Veterans Affairs (\"V A\"), the loss of eligibility 35 Id. 36 Id. 37 Id. 38 https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Portals/55/Messages/NAVADMIN/NAV2021/ NAV21256.txt 39 Id. 40 Id. 9 for some V A benefits such as the GI Bill, including the transfer of GI Bill benefits to dependents.41 Because these policies caused significant harm to the Navy's religious service members, First Liberty Institute a nd Hacker Stephens LLP brought Navy SEALs 1-26 v. Biden , Case No. 4:21-cv-01236, in the federal district court of the Northern District of Texas on behalf of 26 U.S. Navy SEALs, 5 Special Warfare Combatant Craft Crewmen, 1 Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technician, and 3 U.S. Navy Divers against President Biden, the DoD, Secretary Lloyd Austin, the Navy, and Secretary Carlos Del Toro. On November 9, 2021, First Liberty filed a complaint citing violations of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), the First Amendment, and the APA. Shortly thereafter, on November 24, 2021, First Liberty filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction, seeking immediate relief from the Navy's discriminatory policies. After the matter was fully briefed and a hearing was held, on January 3, 2022, the court concluded that the Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their substantive claims that the Navy's vaccine mandate violated RFRA and the First Amendment, and t hat the mandate's permanent medical -disqualification provision failed strict scrutiny. While the government asserted that vaccination was the least restrictive means to achieve its end, the court determined that the government had not demonstrated a compel ling interest justifying the substantial burden imposed on the Plaintiffs' religious beliefs. In short, the court granted Plaintiffs the relief they requested , which allowed them to remain employed without being vaccinated. One of the important factors in the court reaching its decision was that the Navy did not conduct an individualized assessment of the Plaintiffs' RARs to justify the Navy's compelling 41 Id. 10 interest in the Plaintiffs being vaccinated. Instead, to \"adjudicate a religious accommodation request, the Navy used a six -phase, fifty -step process42.\"43 In the court's words, \"[b]y all accounts, Plaintiffs have safely carried out their jobs during the pandemic.\"44 And even if the government had a broad compelling interest in widespread vaccination of its force, this goal was achieved because \"[a]t least 99.4% of all active -duty Navy servicemembers\" were vaccinated at that time, and \"[t]he remaining 0.6% [were] unlikely to undermine the Navy's efforts.\"45 Moreover, the court noted, \"the Navy is willing to g rant exemptions for non -religious reasons ,\" as its \"mandate includes carveouts for those participating in clinical trials and those with medical contraindications and allergies to vaccines . . . Because these categories of exempt servicemembers are still d eployable, a clinical trial participant who receives a placebo may find himself ill in the high -stakes situation that Defendants fear.\"46 Taking all relevant facts into consideration, the court determined that the \"Navy provides a religious accommodation p rocess, but by all accounts, it is theater.\"47 After class -wide injunctive relief was issued and extended to the Navy Class on March 2 8, 2022, as of March 31, 2022, the Navy reported 89,791 total cases of COVID -19, 2 hospitalizations, and 17 deaths, as wel l as 13 approved permanent medical exemptions, 207 approved temporary medical exemptions, and 0 approved religious accommodation requests.48 2. The Department of the Air Force's COVID -19 Vaccine Mandate On September 3, 2021, Secretary Frank Kendall issued a memorandum to all Air Force Commanders implementing the Department of the Air Force's COVID -19 Vaccine Mandate. The 42 Exhibit 3 - Navy's 50 Step SOP 43 Exhibit 4 - Navy SEALs 1 -26 v. Bide n, Preliminary Injunction Order 44 Id. 45 Id. 46 Id. 47 Id. 48 Exhibit 5 - U.S. Navy March 31, 2022, COVID -19 Update 11 Air Force COVID -19 Vaccine Mandate directed all Air Force commanders to take \"all ste ps necessary to ensure all uniformed Airmen and Guardians receive the COVID -19 vaccine.\" It further direct ed that, unless exempted, Active -Duty Airmen and Guardians must be fully vaccinated within 60 days, by November 2, 2021, and Ready Reserve, including National Guard, Airmen and Guardians must be fully vaccinated within 90 days, by December 2, 2021. The total number of Airmen who were required to comply with the COVID -19 vaccination requirement were approximately 399,131.49 Because Department of the Air Force service members were experiencing similar discriminatory treatment by the DoD and the Department of the Air Force for requesting to be religiously accommodated from the COVID -19 vaccine requirements, a class action compl aint was filed in Doster v. Kendall , Case No. 1:22 -cv-84, on February 16, 2022. Similar to the issues raised in the Navy SEALs 1-26 case, the Doster Plaintiffs cited to the government's violations of RFRA and the First Amendment and requested injunctive re lief to halt the ongoing violations of law. On February 22, 2022, in a request to obtain immediate relief, the Plaintiffs filed an Emergency Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Motion for Preliminary Injunction, which was granted on March 31, 2022 . This relief was eventually extended to the Department of the Air Force class members on July 14, 2022 and allowed the class members to remain employed without the vaccine. Before the Doster class was certified, First Liberty and Schaerr Jaffe LLP filed a class action lawsuit, Spence v. Austin , Case. No. 4:22 -cv-00453, on May 27, 2022. The case is comprised of nine Air Force officers who each have a religious objection to taking a COVID -19 vaccine. The harms each of the Plaintiffs experienced in that case ranged from loss of 49 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Air_Force 12 promotions and the threat of imminent loss of retirement to loss of flying privileges.50 On July 14, 2022, that case became part of the Doster lawsuit once the Doster class was certified. As of February 16, 2022, according to the Department of the Air Force's own data, there were 90,116 active duty and reserve cases of COVID -19, 53 hospitalizations and 15 deaths from the virus, with 96.1% of the total force fully vaccin ated, 1,393 approved medical exemptions, 12,623 requests for religious accommodation submitted, and only 1 religious accommodation request was fully approved.51 B. The Federal Contractor Mandate (EO 14042) On September 9, 2021, President Biden issued EO 1 4042, which required that \" Executive departments and agencies, including independent establishments subject to the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 102(4)(A) (agencies), shall, to the extent permitted by law, ensure that contract s and contract -like instruments . . . include a clause that the contractor and any subcontractors (at any tier) shall incorporate into lower -tier subcontracts. This clause shall specify that the contractor or subcontractor shall, for the duration of the co ntract, comply with all guidance for contractor or subcontractor workplace locations published by the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force (Task Force Guidance or Guidance), provided that the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (Director) approve s the Task Force Guidance and determines that the Guidance, if adhered to by contractors or subcontractors, will promote economy and efficiency in Federal contracting. This clause shall apply to any workplace locations (as specified by the Task Force Guid ance) in which an individual is working on or in connection with a Federal Government contract or contract -like instrument .\"52 50 Exhibit 6 - Spence v. Austin Declarations On December 7, 2021, the U.S. District for the Southern District of Georgia, in Georgia v. Biden , Case No. 1:21 -cv-163, issued an injunction because the court found that the states could likely prove that Congress did not clearly authorize President Biden to issue EO 14042 under the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act (FPASA).53 In the court's opinion, EO 1404 2 \"goes far beyond addressing administrative and management issues in order to promote efficiency and economy in procurement and contracting\" and practically operates as a regulation of public health, which is not clearly authorized under FPASA.54 The cour t determined that states could likely prove that EO 14042 does not have a sufficient nexus to the purposes of FPASA and thus does not fall within the authority granted to the President under FPASA. Additionally, the time and effort federal contractors spen t on implementing a vaccine mandate in the past (and will spend in the future) constitute irreparable compliance costs resulting from EO 14042. And in balancing the harms, the court found that enjoining EO 14042 \"would, essentially, do nothing more than ma intain the status quo; entities will still be free to encourage their employees to get vaccinated, and the employees will still be free to choose to be vaccinated. In contrast, declining to issue a preliminary injunction would force Plaintiffs to comply wi th the mandate, requiring them to make decisions which would significantly alter their ability to perform federal contract work which is critical to their operations.\"55 This ruling impacted over 5,138 government contractors currently employed in the Unite d States.56 53 Exhibit 7 - Georgia v. Biden , Preliminary Injunction Order 54 Id. 55 Id. 56 https://www.zippia.com/government -contractor -jobs/demographics/ 14 C. The Federal Employee Mandate (EO 14043) On September 9, 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14043, which generally required all federal employees to be vaccinated. Employees who did not comply would face termination. Shortly thereafter, on December 21, 2021, Feds for Medical Freedom, a non -profit organization with over 6,000 members employed by numerous federal agencies and contractors , along with a chapter of the American Federation of Government Employees and more than 50 individual Plaintiffs filed a complaint against President Biden and other Executive Branch officials challenging the Federal Employee Mandate and Federal Contractor Mandate .57 The next day, the Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction requesting the court to enjoin both mandates. In their filings, Plaintiffs raised several constitutional and statutory claims. First, they argued that the President did not have inherent Article II authority to issue either mandate , and that a ny purported congression al delegation of such power violated either the major questions doctrine or the non -delegation doctrine. Second, they claimed both mandates were arbitrary, capricious, and otherwise not in accordance with law under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") , and that the contractor mandate violated the APA because it was not in accordance with law. Finally, they sought relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act . While t he district court declined to enjoin the contractor mandate because it was already the subject of a nationwide injunction , on January 21, 2022, it enjoined the Federal Employee Mandate . Although the government appealed that injunction, on March 23, 2021, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling. This ruling impacted 2,8790,000 federal civilian employees.58 57 Feds for Medical Freedom v. Biden , Case No. 3:21 -cv-356 58 https://www.statista.com/statistics/204535/number -of-governmental -employees -in-the-us/ 15 D. The OSHA Mandate On November 4, 2021, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued its Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) that applie d to roughly 84 million workers, covering virtually all employers with at least 100 employees . 59 The ETS stated that c overed employers must \"develop, implement, and enforce a mandatory COVID -19 vaccination policy ,\"60 and were required to verify the vaccina tion status of each employee and maintain proof of it.61 The ETS contain ed an \"exception\" for employers that require d unvaccinated workers to \"undergo [weekly] COVID -19 testing and wear a face covering at work in lieu of vaccination.\"62 Unvaccinated employees who d id not comply with OSHA's rule were required to be \"removed from the workplace.\"63 And employers who commit ted violations face d hefty fines: up to $13,653 for a standard violation, and up to $136,532 for a willful one.64 After OSHA published its vaccine mandate , scores of parties \u2014including States, businesses, trade groups, and nonprofit organizations \u2014filed petitions for review, with at least one petition arriving in each regional Court of Appeals. The Fifth Circuit initially en tered a stay preventing OSHA's rule from taking effect .65 But when the cases were consolidated before the Sixth Circuit, that court lifted the stay and allowed OSHA's rule to proceed .66 However, in response to an emergency petition, the Supreme Court deter mined that the ETS was no 59 https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/11/05/2021 -23643/covid -19-vaccination -and-testing -emergency - temporary -standard Reg. 61402 (2021). 60 Id. at 61402. 61 Id. at 61552. 62 Id. at 61402. 63 Id. at 61532.

This 'lack of historical precedent, ' coupled with the breadth of authority that the Secretary now claims, is a 'telling indication ' that the mandate extends beyond the agency's legitimate reach. \"68 SERVICE MEMBERS DISCRIMINATED AGAINST FOR LAWFULLY OBJECTING TO REQUIRED V ACCINATION As previously stated, s ervice members across the military branches were discriminated against after exercising their religious liberty rights in response to the COVID -19 vaccine mandate. In the Navy SEALs case, some of t he most common examples of the coercion and punishment Firs t Liberty's clients suffered are as follows: A. Navy SEAL 26 Navy SEAL 26 was denied permission to travel to a treatment program for Traumatic Brain Injury, which the court called an \"egregious example\" of harm suffered by Plaintiffs. SEAL 26's request to travel to obtain treatment was made before the injunction was issued, and on January 3, 2022, the same day the court issued the preliminary injunction, SEAL 26's reques t was officially denied.69 At that time, a n officer in his chain of command began trying to obtain approval of leave for SEAL 26 so that he could at least attend treatment on his own dime . This is precisely what SEAL 3 , also a Plaintiff, had to do, as he testified at the preliminary -injunction hearing. Ultimately, SEAL 26 was denied the ability to travel to a Traumatic Brain Injury 67 Nat'l Fed'n of Indep. Bus. v. DOL, OSHA , 142 S. Ct. 661 (2022) 68 Id. 69 Exhibit 8 - SEAL 26 Declaration 17 treatment program twice (both prior to and after the issuance of the injunction), even to receive the treatm ent out of his own pocket. This action clearly violate d the injunction's prohibition on \"adverse action\" and is all the more egregious given that this treatment was necessary for injuries sustained during his service. B. Navy SEAL 21 Plaintiff Navy SEAL 21 w as kicked out of his platoon and forced to turn in his gear prior to the issuance of the injunction. He was unable to participate in training, which mean t he could not deploy.70 SEAL 21 was explicitly told \u2014after the injunction was issued \u2014that he could not take the chief examination (a requirement for promotion) as scheduled because of NAV ADMIN 225/21 paragraph 7.D, because he was \"refusing the vaccine.\" Subsequently, he was permitted to take the chief examination \"in case things get over turned.\" When SEAL 21 took his exam on January 24, 2022, there was a notation at the top of his paperwork stating that he was unable to promote due to NA V ADMIN 225/21. Additionally, SEAL 21's work duties (along with Plaintiff SEAL 25 and another SEAL with a pending Religious Accommodation Request (RAR) ) were to pick up trash around the base and report what he picked up to his chief. C. Navy SEAL 13 Navy SEAL 13 was removed from a four -month course (despite completing over half) f or submitting a R AR.71 The course was for a critical qualification for being at his current command and for being in the position of Lead Petty Officer (LPO), which he was at the time. SEAL 13 was subsequently removed from that position and replaced with a nother person who didn't have the course qualification SEAL 13 would have had if he had not been removed from the course. 70 Exhibit 9 - SEAL 21 Declaration 71 Exhibit 10 - SEAL 13 Declaration 18 SEAL 13 took the chief examination on January 26, 2022, but was ineligible for promotion because he was removed from his leadership po sition for submitting his RA R. D. Navy SEAL 22 Navy SEAL 22 was supposed to transfer from a training detachment to a SEAL Team for a milestone position as a platoon chief in October 2021.72 But because of his pending RAR , he was not allowed to formally trans fer to the Team. As a result, he lost his position as SEAL Team 7 Alpha platoon chief. On January 28, 2022, SEAL 22 was told by his command that he was not permitted to attend a training course along with the other members of his training cell because of his pending RA R. NA V ADMIN 256/21 denie d educational opportunities to vaccine refusers, but SEAL 22 is not a \"refuser\" because he had a pending RA R. Unfortunately, these types of harms were not limited to the Navy SEALs Plaintiffs. They also extended to members of the Navy Class who were threatened with having to repay the cost of schooling and already earned bonuses73 and being forced to live in deplorable conditions.74 Air Force service members in the Spence case simi larly experienced harm by being grounded from flying duties75 while pilots with medical reasons for refusing the vaccine received a one - year medical exemption that allowed a full return to regular pilot duties.76 THE DOD WAS NONCOMPLIANT WITH ITS POLICY ON PROCESSING RELIGIOUS ACCOMODATION REQUESTS The DoD's policy for processing religious accommodation requests is found in DoD Instruction 1300.17, Religious Liberty in the Military Services , 1 September 2020 .77 The relevant 72 Exhibit 11 - SEAL 22 Declaration 73 Exhibit 12 - Lieutenant Commander (Select) Levi Beaird Declaration 74 Exhibit 13 - Petty Officer Third Class Faith Mack Declaration 75 https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden -declared -pandemic -over-unvaxxed -air-force -pilots -still-grounded 76 Exhibit 14 - Lieutenant Colonel Michael McCoy Declaration 77 https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/130017p.pdf 19 purpose of the instruction is to \"[e]stablish[] DoD policy in furtherance of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, recognizing that Service members have the right to observe the tenets of their religion, or to observe no religion at all ,\" \"[e]stablish [] DoD policy on the accommodation of individual expressions of sincerely held beliefs (conscience, moral principles, or religious beliefs), which do not have an adverse impact on military readiness, unit cohe sion, good order and discipline, or health and safety ,\" and \"[i]mplements requirements in Section 2000bb -1 of Title 42, United States Code (U.S.C), also known as 'The Religious Freedom Restoration Act ' (RFRA), and other laws applicable to the accommodation of religious practices for DoD to provide, in accordance with the RFRA, that DoD Components will normally accommodate practices of a Service member based on a sincerely held religious belief. \"78 While the Secretary of Defense delegated his authority to a ct on requests for the accommodation of religious practices to the Secretaries overseeing the individual military branches, Section 3 of the instruction explains how accommodation requests should be processed. However, as this process relate d to the COVID -19 vaccine mandate, on June 2, 2022, the Inspector General (IG) for the DoD informed the Secretary of Defense of \"potential noncompliance with standards for reviewing and documenting the denial of religious accommodation requests of Service members identif ied through complaints submitted to my office . . . We found a trend of generalized assessments rather than individualized assessment that is required by Federal law and DoD and Military service policies . . . The denial memorandums we reviewed generally d id not reflect an individualized analysis, demonstrating that the Senior Military Official considered the full range of facts and circumstances relevant to the particular 78 Id. 20 religious accommodation request . . . Additionally, the volume and rate at which deci sions were made to deny requests is concerning. The appeal authorities of the Services we reviewed indicated that an average of 50 denials per day were processed over a 90 -day period. Assuming a 10-hour work day with no breaks or attention to other matters , the average review period was about 12 minutes for each package. Such a review period seems insufficient to process each request in an individualized manner and still perform the duties required of their position.\"79 The DoD IG's findings are consistent with the court's determination in the Navy SEALs case that the Navy's religious accommodation process was \"theater.\" THE DOD HAD NO DESIRE TO RESCIND THE COVID -19 MANDATE In December 2022, as the legislative text for the 2023 NDAA was being finalized, th e National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, John Kirby, announced \"We continue to believe that repealing the vaccine mandate is a mistake. Making sure our troops are ready to defend this country and prepared to do so that remains the President's priority and the vaccine requirement for Covid does just that .\"80 This statement was made after Mr. Kirby appeared for an interview on Fox and Friends on October 4, 2022, where he continued to support the COVID -19 vaccine requiremen t, stating \"[p]art of being ready is being healthy . . . and not having the ability to infect your unit and make their unit readiness any worse than it is.\"81 Yet, during the interview, he announced that he was working from home, as he was \"wrapping up [his] own bout with COVID,\" despite being \"double boosted .\"82 When the host of the show then said \"to invest in our people and then train them and to dismiss them for an experimental vaccine is folly when every one of your branches can't recruit their thresho ld, yet you're kicking out 79 Exhibit 15 - DoD IG Report, September 2, 2022 80 https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/07/politics/biden -military -covid -mandate -ndaa/index.html 81 https://www.foxnews.com/video/6313240705112 82 Id. 21 good men and women , how do you explain that,\" and that \"it's a risk to our national security,\" Mr. Kirby answered, \"Yes, it's a tough recruiting environment . . . but this is a valid military requirement.\"83 Secretary of the Nav y, Carlos Del Toro also responded to the news of Congress's proposal to end the DoD's vaccine mandate. In December, he \" spoke against removing the mandate at a Navy League event, raising concerns such as what happens to sailors who need to go to countries with strict vaccine requirements. Congress needs to understand the secondhand consequences of their decisions, the Navy Secretary said. 'But unquestionably it'll create almost two classes of citizens in our services, ' Del Toro said. 'Those that can't deplo y and those that can deploy. And that creates all sorts of problems. '\"84 This was the view of senior military leadership despite lower -level commanders supporting subordinates who submitted RARs and determining that no compelling interest existed for requi ring vaccination and denying RARs.85 THE HARM IS STILL ONGOING While the Secretary of Defense rescinded the August 24, 2021 COVID -19 vaccination mandate pursuant to Section 525 of the NDAA,86 which states, \" Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall rescind the mandate that members of the Armed Forces be vaccinated against COVID -19 pursuant to the memorandum dated August 24, 2021, regarding 'Mandatory Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccination of Departm ent of Defense Service Members ',\"87 the harm is still ongoing for service members. 83 84 https://news.usni.org/2022/12/07/pentagon -unclear -how-military -would -handle -end-of-mandatory -covid 22 After nearly 33 total lawsuits were filed by service members against the DoD and their respective individual armed services and Secretaries,88 those who sought a religious accommodation from their respective branch of service are now one to three years behind their peers as a result of being removed from their duties. As a result, many will be unable to promote and are faced with the future prospe ct of losing their careers. Considering a total of 19,460 service members remained unvaccinated as of October 4, 2022,89 this means we could lose millions in training costs, and hundreds of thousands of years of invaluable institutional knowledge. At a tim e when young Americans have no desire to join the military90 and military members are telling their children not to join the military ,91 we should consider this a significant national security crisis. 88 Exhibit 1 - First Liberty Institute Mandate Related Case List, July 26, 2023 89 https://www.foxnews.com/video/6313240705112 Exhibit 1 CASE LIST Military: Religious 1.

Supp. 3d 1105 (D. Wyo. 2022): Plaintiff Air Force sergeants sued on RFRA and First Amendm ent grounds. PI and TRO denied; plaintiffs did not show they suffered actual, concrete injury. 14.

The court found no standing to challenge the EO. The court did find suggestive but insufficient evidence to substantiate plaintiffs' claims of anti-religious bias. PI and TRO denied as to RFRA and Fr ee Exercise claims because plaintiffs failed to show that the military will require a servicemember to receive an emergency vaccine not approved by the FDA. 16. Crosby v. Austin , No. 8:21 -cv-2730 -TPB-CPT, WL 603784 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 1, 2022): Plaintiff Army Reserve Sergeant Major agreed to Comirnaty vaccine but not BioNTech. His PI 3 was denied because he was f ound unlikely to prevail.

In June 2022, Plaintiff Army NCO challenged Army's mandate based on informed c onsent, APA, RFRA, and First Amendment. The court dismissed all except plaintiff's religious claims. 17. Wiese v. Biden , -SMY, LEXIS 124202 (S.D. Ill. July 13, 2022): Plaintiff Air Force Lieutenant challenged mandate on constitut ional and RFRA grounds. Plaintiff was ordered to receive the vaccine within five days or request to separate or retire within five months from her final appeal.

This was based on the Air Force's numerous grants of medical exemptions while only 135 religious exemptions of the 10,000 requested. Those who were given the exemption already had plans to leave the military as well. In th e same litigation at the lower court, that court found that plaintiffs' challenge to Air Force's vaccine mandate constituted a substantial burden on claimants' free exercise. Additionally, the government relied on broadly formulated interests as justificat ion for the mandate, which RFRA prevents. See Doster v. Kendall , 596 F. Supp. 3d 995 (S.D. Ohio 2022). The Sixth Circuit also refused to grant Air Force's motion for emergency stay of class action lawsuit because it had not demonstrated a 4 likelihood of suc cess on the merits. Doster v. Kendall , 48 F.4th 608 (6th Cir. 2022). Moreover, the court also held that claims against Air Force were ripe under the First Amendment. Defendant's motion to dismiss at the outset of the litigation was denied because plaintiffs would have suffered \"significant hardship\" if the Court did not review the issue. Doster v. Kendall , 615 F. Supp. 101876 Tex. June 12, 2023): Plaintiffs alleged that Coast Guard's vaccine mandate violated RFRA, First Amendment, Fifth Amendment Due Process , and APA. Court dismissed the claims as moot because of the Coast Guard's lifting of its vaccine mandate. 25. Vance No. 2022): Army's motion to dismiss granted because plaintiff had filed for a religious accommodation from all vaccines, but the Army, at the time of filing, had not made a decision regarding whether the accommodation request would be granted with respect to the COVID -19 vaccine. As such, the claim was not ripe and therefore dismissed on a 12(b)(6) motion. 26. Child ren's Health Def. v. United States F ood & Drug Admin. , No. 21 -6203, 2022 WL 2704554 (6th denied sub nom.

Plaintiffs also opposed the mandate on religious grounds. 27. U.S. Navy SEALs v. Austin , 594 F. Supp. 3d 767 (N.D. Tex. 2022): Plaintiff's motion for class certification was granted under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). The alleged injury arose from violations of constitutional rights and a denial of religious accommodations for vaccine mandate. 28. Schneider v. Austin , No. 3:22 -cv-00293, 2022 Sept. 7, 2022): Defendant's motion to stay an injunction pending a ruli ng in another case was granted.

Tenn. 2021): This case was dismissed due to lack of standing. Pla intiffs presented declarations from several of its members who were current or active military duty opposing the vaccination on numerous grounds, including religion. However, the case was dismissed for lack of standing because it was the actions of the mil itary, not the FDA, that caused the complaint to be filed. As such, the injury was not redressable. 5 Military: Other 1. (N.D. Fla. Nov. 7, 2022): Plaintiff Air Force members argued that military has no right to require vaccines and mandate is arbitrary and capricious under the APA. The court found that plaintiffs alleged a plausible claim that the Armed Services Guidance policies requiring vaccines are facially invalid under informed cons ent rights. Government's other motions to dismiss were granted with leave to amend. 2. Church v. Biden , 573 F. Supp. 3d 118 (D.D.C 2021): Active -duty Marines challenged vaccine mandate. PI and TRO denied partly because servicemembers' request for exemptions were still pending, making their claims not yet ripe. 3. Doe v. Austin , 572 F. Supp. 3d 1224 (N.D. Fla. 2021): PI denied because servicemembers challenging policy did not show a high likelihood of success. 4. Robert v. Austin , No. 22 -1032, 2023 WL 4361082 (10t h Cir. July 6, 2023): Plaintiffs Army and USMC Staff Sergeants sued DoD, challenging mandate. The lower court had declined to certify a class.

Sept. 1, 2021): Army and USMC Staff Sergeants challenged mandate based on naturally acquired immunity. TRO was denied. 6. Oklahoma v. Biden , 584 F. Supp. 3d 1034 (W.D. Supp. (W.D. Okla. 2021): Oklahoma governor sought to enjoin DoD from enforcing its mandate as to the Oklahoma National Guard and Air National Guard. PI denied: the court \"quite readily\" found the mandate valid and enforceable. Oklahoma did not show that EO 14043 interfered with any state law or caused economic injury that would provide the requisite standing. Oklahoma did show injury -in-fact, but not satisfactorily for standing purposes. Later, Guard members sought permission for sixteen members to proceed anonymously. Motion for protective order was denied. 7. Guettlein v. United States Merch. Marine Acad. , 577 F. Supp. 3d 96 (E.D.N.Y. 2021): Held that plaintiff students were not entitled to a preliminary injunction against the COVID -19 vaccine mandate because there was no demonstration of likelihood of success on the merits. The court found that there was no jurisdiction under \u00a7 1983 or 28 U.S.C.S. \u00a7\u00a71331, 1343, which was a large basis upon which the motion for preliminary injunction was denied. 8. Abbott v. Bi den, 70 F.4th 817 (5th Cir. 2023): Court held that district court erred in denying preliminary injunction for members of Texas militia. The reason was because the 6 district court only considered the likelihood of success on the merits and not the other factors for preliminary injunction. 9. Abbott v. Biden , 608 F. Supp. 3d 467 (E.D. Tex. June rev'd , 70 F.4th 817 (5th Cir. 2022): This is the district court's ruling that denied a preliminary injunction against the National Guard from imposing their v accination mandate because the plaintiffs had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits, which is the reason the court was reversed by the Fifth Circuit. 10. Alvarado v. Austin , No. 1:22 -cv-876, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27657 (E.D. Va. Feb. 17, 2023): This ruling upholds the original dismissal of the action challenging the military's vaccine mandate because the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 did not perpetuate a change in law that was relevant to the original grounds upon wh ich the action was dismissed, which was for want of subject matter jurisdiction. The original action was brought by military chaplains against the Department of Defense. OSHA 1. BST Holdings, L.L.C v. OSHA , 17 F.4th 604 (5th Cir. 2021): Petitioners, a business of more than 100 people, to whom OSHA's vaccine mandate applied, sought a stay of enforcement against the mandate. The court granted the stay on the grounds that the mandate was \"staggeringly overbroad,\" under -inclusive, and likely outside the scope of the Commerce Clause's grant of authority due to its regulation of noneconomic inactivity. 2. In re MCP No. 165 , 20 F.4th 264 (6th Cir. 2021): This was the litigation challenging the vaccine mandate issued by the Secretary of Labor. Appel lants sought an initial hearing en banc , which the Sixth Circuit denied by an 8 -8 vote. Then, a three -judge panel dissolved the stay issued by the Fifth Circuit in BST Holdings . That ruling was appealed, which resulted in Nat'l Fed'n of Indep. Bus . 3. Nat'l Fed'n v. OSHA , 142 S. Ct. 661 (2022): A conglomeration of independent businesses with more than 100 employees brought a challenge against the vaccine mandate for private businesses. The Supreme Court held that the Secretary of Labor la cked the statutory authority to issue a vaccine mandate because the Act concerned workplace hazards specifically, not universal hazards faced by Americans whether they were at work or not. - This is the culmination of nationwide litigation challenging the m andate. All of the United States Circuit Courts received a petition for review. Therefore, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2112(a), these cases were consolidated into the Sixth Circuit. 7 EO 14043 1. Feds for Med. Freedom v. Biden , 63 F.4 366 (5th Cir. 2023): Organization representing over 6,000 federal employees and individual employees brought action alleging that President exceeded his authority when he issued executive order mandating COVID -19 vaccination for all executive bran ch employees, subject to medical and religious exceptions.

Ala. 2022): Two federal civilian employees, a federal contractor's employee, and a physician challenged the constitutionality of EO 14042 and 14043. The court held that it lacked jurisdiction. Also, at the time, \"nationwide injunctions\" prevented the government from enforcing the vaccine mandate, rendering plaintiffs' claim against that mandate not justiciable. 3. AFGE Loc. 2586 v. Bide n, 616 F. Supp. 3d 1275 (W.D. Okla. 2022): Plaintiff labor union representing federal civil employees with DoD challenged enforcement of EO 14043.

Dec. 28, 2021): This concerns a challenge brought by employees of a federal contractor to seek an injunction against the enforcement of the contractor vaccine mandate. Because, at the time this c ase was filed, a Georgia district court had already issued a nationwide injunction against the mandate, the Court sua sponte stayed the action pending further proceedings in the Georgie district court, the Eleventh Circuit, or the U.S. Supreme Court. 2. Louisiana v. Biden , 55 F.4th 1017 (5th Cir. 2022): A challenge was brought by federal contractors from multiple states against Executive Order 14042. The district court preliminarily enjoined the federal contractor mandate. The Fifth Circuit, on appeal, held that to allow the mandate would be a \"transformative expansion in the President's power under the Procurement Act.\" The court held Executive Order 14042 was consequently unlawful and, therefore, upheld the district court's grant of a preliminary injunction. 3. Georgia v. President of the United States , 46 F.4th 1283 (11th Cir. 2022): This is an appeal of the lower court's issuance of a nationwide injunction against the contractor 8 vaccine mandate.

However, this court held that the injunction should not apply nationally and limited the scope of the original injunction. 4. Peterson v. Honeywell Fed. Mfg. & Techs. , No. 4:21 -CV-00931 -DGK, Mo. Jan. 4, 2022): This case was brought pro se by an employee of a federal contractor seeking, among other things, a temporary restraining order against employer's enf orcement of the contractor mandate, which had already been nationally enjoined at the time. The court held that plaintiff had not carried the necessary burden of proof required for a TRO. 5. Mo. v. Biden , No. 22 -1104, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 14065 (8th Cir. Jun e 7, 2023): This is an appeal of the district court's grant of preliminary injunction regarding the federal contractor mandate. However, Executive Order 14042 was revoked by the Biden Administration. As such, this opinion deals with the government's volunt ary dismissal motion. Because of the revocation of the Executive Order, the case was dismissed as moot and remanded to the lower court. 6. Florida v. Nelson , 576 F. Supp. 3d 1017 (M.D. Fla. 2021): The state of Florida sought an injunction against the enforce ment of the contractor mandate. The court granted the injunction holding that the Executive Order exceeded the President's authority under the procurement act. 7. Commonwealth v. Biden , 571 F. Supp. 3d 715 (E.D. Ky. Nov. 30, 2021): The state of Kentucky brought a lawsuit against the Biden Administration regarding the federal contractor vaccine mandate. The court enjoined the government from enforcing the vaccine mandate against federal contractors in Tennessee, Ohio, and Kentucky because there had been a demonstration of irreparable harm by plaintiffs. The loss of constitutional freedoms, the court states, \"unquestionably constitute[s] irreparable injury.\" 8. Brnovich v. Biden , 562 F. Supp. 3d 123 (D. Ariz. 2022): This was a challenge to the federal contractor mandate brought by the State of Arizona and Attorney General Mark Brnovich seeking a preliminary injunction. The preliminary injunction was granted in part and denied in part. The injunction was granted as to the federal contractor mandate but not the federal employee mandate. The state lacked standing to challenge the employee mandate but showed a strong likelihood of success on the claim that the contractor mandate excee ded the President's authority under the Procurement Act. 9. Rhoades v. Plaintiff employees sued federal contractor employer after employer issued a vaccin e mandate pursuant to EO 14042. The court denied PI, finding Georgia v. Biden distinguishable. 9 10.

BIDEN, ., et al., \u00a7 \u00a7 \u00a7 Defendants . \u00a7 ORDER ON PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION Our nation asks the men and women in our military to serve, suffer, and sacrifice. But we do not ask them to lay aside their citizenry and give up the very rights they have sworn to protect.1 Every president since the signing of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act has praised the men and women of the mili tary for their bravery and service in protecting the freedoms this country guarantees.2 In this case, members of the military seek protection under those very freedoms. Thirty - five Navy Special Warfare servicemembers allege that the military's mandatory vaccination policy violates their religious freedoms under the First Amendment and Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The Navy provides a religious accommodation process, but by all accounts, it is theater. The Navy has not granted a religious exemption t o any vaccine in recent memory . It merely rubber stamps each denial. The Navy servicemembers in this case seek to vindicate the very freedoms 1 George Washington wrote in 1775 that \"When we assumed the Soldier, we did not lay aside the Citizen.\" Those words are carved into the marble of the Memorial Amphitheater in the Arlington National Cemetery. 2 See President William Clinton, Remarks at the V eterans Day National Ceremony (Nov. 11, 1999); President George W. Bush, Remarks at the Veterans Day Proclamation (Oct. 30, 2001); President Barack Obama, Remarks at the Veterans Day National Ceremony (Nov. 11, 2009); President Donald Trump, Remarks at the New York City Veterans Day Parade Address (Nov. 11, 2019); President Joseph Biden, Remarks at the National Veterans Day Observance (Nov. 11, 2021).

There is no COVID -19 exception to the First Amendment. There is no military exclusion from our Constitution. Having considered the briefing, oral argument, relevant facts, and applicable law, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction should be and is hereby GRANTED . I. BACKGROUND This case arises from the United States Navy's mandatory COVID -19 vaccination policy . Plaintiffs are thirty -five Navy Special Warfare servicemembers, including SEALs, Special Warfare Combatant Craft Crewmen, Navy Divers, and an Explosive Ordinance Disposal Technician. Compl. 1, 8-9, ECF No. 1. Together, they sue President Biden, Secretary of Defense Austin, Secretary of the Navy Del Toro, and the United States Departme nt of Defense. A. Factual Background 1. The Navy's Vaccination Policy In August 2021, the Department of Defense (\"DoD\") issued a vaccine mandate directing all DoD servicemembers to be vaccinated against COVID -19. Pls.' App. 146 -47, ECF No. 17. The Department of the Navy also implemented its own mandate requiring all active -duty Navy servicemembers to be fully vaccinated before November 28 or face the \"full range\" of disciplinary action . Pls.' App. 149 -50, ECF No. 17. For servicemembers assigned to Special Operations duty , the Navy's vaccination policy reads: [Special Operations] personnel refusing to receive recommended vaccines . . . based solely on personal or religious beliefs are disqualified. This provision does not pertain to medical contraind ications or allergies to vaccine administration. 3 Before the Court are the Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction (ECF No. 15), filed November 24, 2021; Defendants' Response (ECF No. 43), filed December 10; and Plaintiffs' Reply (ECF No. 58), filed December 17. The Court held a hearing on the matter on December 20. ECF No. 61. Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 2 of 26 PageID 2541Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 2 of 26 PageID 2541 3 Manual of Medical Department (\"MANMED\") \u00a7 15-105(3)(n)(9); Pls.' App. 838, ECF No. 17. In addition to those with medical exemptions, \"[m]embers who are actively participating in COVID -19 clinical trials are exempted from mandatory vaccination\" until the trial concludes. Pls.' App. 149 -50, ECF No. 17. For those with pending religious exemption requests, being \"disqualified\" means becoming permanently nondeployable.4 Unlike those with medical exemptions and allergies to the vaccine, an unvaccinated servicemember seeking a religious exemption (the \"religious servicemember\") continues to be nondeployable , even if he receives the accommodation he requests . Pls.' App. 159 , 838 (Trident Order 12 - Mandatory Va ccination for COVID -19), ECF No. 17. To regain his \"deployable\" status, the religious servicemember must first receive his religious accommodation , and then seek a medical waiver under the Navy's MANMED . Defs.' App. 278 , ECF No. 44 -3. Each of these steps, by themselves, is monumental. Religious exemptions to the vaccine requirement are virtually non -existent. In the past seven years, the Navy has not granted a religious exemption to any vaccine requirement. Pls.' App. 295, ECF No. 17. 2. Plaintiffs' Religious Accommodations Requests By early November, 99.4% of active -duty Navy servicemembers had been fully vaccinated against COVID -19. Pls.' App. 284, ECF No. 17. Plaintiffs are part of the remaining 0.6%. Representing the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant branches of Christianity, Plaintiffs object to receiving the COVID -19 vaccine based on their religious beliefs. Id. These beliefs fall into the following categories : (1) opposition to abortion and the use of aborted fetal cell line s in 4 See Decl. of SEALs 1 -19, 21 -26, Pls.' App. 870 -5, EOD 1, App. 1016 -22; Decl. of ND 1 -3, App. 1004 -15.

See Davis v. Fort Bend Cnty. , 765 F.3d 480, 478 (5th Cir. 2014) (citing United States v. Ballard , 322 U.S. 78, 86 (1944)). Plaintiffs filed their religious accommodation requests as early as August and as late as December. See Supp. Decl. of SEALs, SWCC, EOD, ND, Supp. App. 1023 -1134. In many cases, the Plaintiffs' commanding officers recommended th eir requests be approved. See Supp. Decl. of SEAL 18, Supp. App. 1075 ; Hr'g Test. of SEAL 3 . Even so, as of December 17, the Navy has summarily denied at least twenty -nine of the thirty -five accommodations requests , the majority of which have been appealed . Supp. of SEALs, SWCC, EOD, ND, Supp. The Navy has made no final determinations on appea l. To adjudicate a religious accommodation request , the Navy uses a six -phase , fifty -step process. See Supp. Decl. of Andrew Stephens, Ex. 1, EC F No. 62. Although \"a ll requests for accommodation of religious practices are assessed on a case -by-case basis ,\" Phase 1 of the Navy guidance document instructs an administrator to update a prepared disapproval template with the requester's name and rank. Id. Based on this boilerplate rejection , Plaintiffs believe that this process is \"pre -determined\" and sidesteps the individualized review required by law . Id. 5 See Decl. of SEALs 1 -3, 5, 6, 8 -15, 17 -19, 21 -24, 26, App. 871 -84, 890 -97, 903 -37, 944 -72, 978 -80; Decl. of SWCC 1 -4, App. 1, App. 1016 -22; Decl. of ND 2, Ap p. 1009 -11. 6 See Decl. of SEAL 5, 9 -11, 13 -15, 18, 22, 25, 26, App. 890 -93, 909 -20, 926 -37, 948 -51, 961 -64, 974 - 80; Decl. of SWCC 1, 5, App. 982 -85, of EOD 1, App. 3, App. 1004 -07, 1013 -15. 7 See Decl. of SEAL 7 and 19, App. 899 -900, 954. 8 See Decl. of SEAL 13, App. 927; Decl. of EOD 1, App. 1018.

Procedural History On November 9, 2021, Plaintiff s filed this lawsuit challenging the Navy's vaccination mandate. See Compl. 38, ECF No. 1. In response to the Court's order for a status report, Plaintiffs filed their Motion for Preliminary Injunction (ECF No. 15), on November 24, 2021. Defendants respond ed on December 10. See Defs.' Resp., ECF No. 43. Plaintiffs filed their reply December 17. See Pls.' Reply, ECF No. 58. The parties presented evidence and arguments before the Court in a hearing on December 20. See ECF No. 61. Accordingly, the Motion is no w ripe for the Court's review. II. LEGAL STANDARD A preliminary injunction is an \"extraordinary remedy\" and will be granted only if the movant s carry their burden on all four requirements. Nichols v. Alcatel USA, Inc. , 532 F.3d 364, 372 (5th Cir. 2008) . The Court may issue a preliminary injunction if the movant s establish (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) a substantial threat of irreparable harm; (3) that the balance of hardships weighs in the movant s' favor; and (4) that the iss uance of the preliminary injunction will not disserve the public interest. See Daniels Health Health (5th also Fed. R. Civ. P. 65 . \"The decision to grant or deny a preliminary inju nction is discretionary with the district court.\" Miss. Power & Light Co. v. United Gas Pipe Line , 760 F.2d 618, 621 (5th Cir. 1985) . The movant s must make a clear showing that the injunction is warranted, and the issuance of a preliminary injunction \"is to be treated as the exception rather than the rule.\" Miss. Power & Light , 760 F.2d at 621. \"Only in rare instances is the issuance of a mandatory preliminary injunction proper.\" Harris v. Wilters , 596 F.2d 678, 680 (5th 1979) (per curiam).

ANALYSIS Plaintiffs ask the Court to enjoin Defendants from enforcing the vaccination policy , which they say violates RFRA and the First Amendment. Mot. 2, ECF No. 15; Pls.' Br. 2, ECF No. 16. They also assert that the Defendants' permanent medical -disqualification policy fails strict scrutiny. Defendants contend that Plaintiffs have not exhausted their intra -military rem edies and that their claims are nonjusticiable. Even if these claims are reviewable, Defendants argu e, a preliminary injunction would be inappropriate, because Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claims. A. Jurisdiction and Reviewabilit y There are two threshold questions before the Court. The first is whether this Court has jurisdiction over the parties, and the second is whether Plaintiffs' claims are justiciable under the Mindes test. 1. Relief Against President Citing Newdow v. Roberts , Defendants argue this Court lacks jurisdiction to enjoin the President. 603 F.3d 1002, 1013 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (\" With regard to the President, courts do not have jurisdiction to enjoin him and have never submitted the President to declaratory relief .\" (citation omitted) ). \"[W] e cannot issue a declaratory judgment against the President. It is incompatible with his constitutional position that he be compelled personally to defend his executive actions before a court. \" Franklin v. Massachusetts , 505 U.S. 788, 827 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in part). Defendants are correct . This Court has no declaratory or injunctive power against President Biden , and he is therefore DISMISSED as party to this case. 2. Justiciability Under Mindes Defendants also argue th at this case is nonjusticiable because Plaintiffs have not exhausted military remedies, and because they seek to have the Court intrude on internal military affairs. All Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 6 of 26 PageID 2545Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 6 of 26 PageID 2545 7 Plaintiffs have submitted religious accommodation requests. The Navy has denied twenty -nine of those requests. It has granted none. Defendants say the Court must wait for the Navy to decide each request . As explained below , the record indicates the denial of each request is predetermined. As a result, Plaintiffs need not wait for the Navy to engage in an empty formality. In addition, whether the vaccine mandate violates Plaintiffs' First Amendment rights is a legal question well suited for the courts , not the Navy's administrative process . The Court finds that exhaustion is futile and will not provide complete relief , and therefore the case is justiciable. Generally, courts refrain from reviewing internal military affairs. The rationale is simple: \"[J]udges are not given the task of running the Army,\" or, in this case, the Navy. Orloff v. Willoughby , 345 U.S. 83, 93 (1953). Some military issues, however, are appropriate for judicial review. The Fifth Circuit has developed a test to determine whether a given military issue is justiciable , and appropriate for judicial review . That test f irst requires plaintiff s to pass a two -part threshold test by showing (1) \"an allegation of the deprivation of a constitutional right, or an allegation that the military has acted in violation of applicable statutes or its own regulations, \" and (2) \"exhaus tion of available intraservice corrective measures. \" Mindes v. Seaman , 453 F.2d 197, 201 (5th Cir. 1971). Then, if both criteria are met, the Court weighs four factors to determine whether the issue is justiciable: (1) the nature and strength of the plaint iffs' challenge; (2) the potential injury to the plaintiff s if review is refused; (3) the type and degree of anticipated interference with the military function; and (4) the extent to which the exercise of military expertise or discretion is involved. Id. at 201 -02. Before applying the Mindes test, the Court addresses Plaintiffs' argument that Mindes does not apply to RFRA. Plaintiffs suggest that applying Mindes here effectively reads an exhaustion Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 7 of 26 PageID 2546Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 7 of 26 PageID 2546 8 requirement into RFRA. See Pls.' Reply 7 -8, ECF No. 58. Pl aintiffs confuse statutory exhaustion and judge -made exhaustion. When a statute imposes an exhaustion requirement, \"Congress sets the rules.\" Ross v. Blake , 578 U.S. 632, 639 (2016). Courts simply apply the text. They may not \"add unwritten limits \" or exce ptions to the statute's \" rigorous textual requirements .\" Id. If RFRA had an exhaustion requirement, the Court would apply it. But \"judge -made exhaustion doctrines,\" such as Mindes , are different. Id. The military exhaustion requirement in Mindes is a longs tanding prudential doctrine that applies to constitutional, statutory, and regulatory claims involving \"an 'internal military decision.'\" 332, 340 (5th Cir. 2000). The out -of-circuit cases Plaintiffs cite are unpersuasive . They discuss whether RFRA requires exhaustion,9 or whether certain RFRA claims satisfy prudential ripeness analysis.10 They do not analyze whether Mindes , a \"judicial abstention doctrine\" for military issues, applies to RFRA. Id. at 339. Plaintiffs challenge internal military decisions, so, in this Circuit, the Court must apply Mindes . a. The Two-Part Threshold Test Having determined that Mindes applies, the Court turns to the two -part threshold test. Defendants agree that Plaintiffs satisfy the first part \u2014they have alleged deprivation of their First Amendment rights and violations under RFRA. See Defs.' Resp. 24, ECF No. 43. The parties dispute the second par t\u2014whether Plaintiffs have exhausted their military remedies. The military exhaustion requirement is like other judge -made exhaustion doctrines. \"The major purpose of the exhaustion doctrine is to prevent the courts from interfering with the 9 Singh v. Carter , 168 F. Supp. 3d 216, 226 (D.D.C. 2016) (\"RFRA certainly provides no textual support for the defendants' position that the plaintiff is required to exhau st administrative remedies . . . .\"). 10 Oklevueha Native Am. Church Inc. v. Holder , 676 F.3d 829, 838 (9th Cir. 2012) (declining \"to read an exhaustion requirement into RFRA\" for free exercise claims against the Drug Enforcement Administration). Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 8 of 26 PageID 2547Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 8 of 26 PageID 2547 9 administrative process until it has reached a conclusion.\" Von Hoffburg v. Alexander , 615 F.2d 633, 637 (5th Cir. 1980). Military exhaustion is a matter of comity between the branches, \"to maintain the balance between military authority and the power of federal courts.\" Id. Application of the exhaustion requirement is therefore fact -intensive, requiring \" an understanding of its purposes and of the particular administrative scheme involved. \" McKart v. United States , 395 U.S. 185, 193 (1969). In contrast to statutory exhaus tion requirements, \"judge -made exhaustion doctrines, even if flatly stated at first, remain amenable to judge -made exceptions.\" Ross , 578 U.S. at 639. The Fifth Circuit has identified at least four such exceptions to military exhaustion: futility, inadequa cy of administrative remedies, irreparable injury, and a substantial constitutional question. Von Hoffburg , 615 F.2d at 638. First , plaintiff s need not exhaust military remedies \"when resort to the administrative reviewing body would be futile.\" Hodges v. Callaway , 499 F.2d 417, 420 (5th Cir. 1974). They are required to exhaust only those remedies that would \"provide a real opportunity for adequate relief.\" Id. For example, exhaustion is \"obviously\" futile when the administrative body does not have the auth ority to grant the relief sought. Id. at 420 -21. In that situation, military relief is a legal impossibility. Similarly, exhaustion may be futile when military relief will not \" obviate the need for judicial review. \" Id. at 423. Although that \" is not usually a reason for bypassing \" the exhaust ion requirement, id., when the record all but compels the conclusion that the military process will deny relief, \" exhaustion is inapposite and unnecessary,\" id. at 420. The facts overwhelmingly indicate that the Navy will deny the religious accommodations. The Navy has denied twenty -nine of Plaintiffs' thirty -five accommodations requests.11 Outside of Plaintiffs' requests, the Navy has , to date , never granted a religious accommodation request for the 11 Supp. Decl. of SEALs, SWCC, EOD, ND, Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Page 9 of 26 PageID 2548Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 9 of 26 PageID 2548 10 COVID -19 vaccine.12 In fact, in the past seven years, the Navy has never granted a single religious exemption for any vaccine.13 Several Plaintiffs have been directly told by their chains of command that \"the senior leadership of Naval Special Warfare has no patience or tolerance for service members who refuse COVID -19 vaccination for religious reasons and wants them out of the SEA L community.\"14 The Navy's accommodation process confirms those fears. The Navy uses a fifty -step process to adjudicate religious accommodation requests.15 Under the standard operating procedures for the process, the first fifteen steps require an adminis trator to update a prepared disapproval template with the requester's name and rank. In essence, the Plaintiffs' requests are denied the moment they begin. That prepared letter is then sent to seven offices for review. After those offices review the disapp roval letter, the administrator packages the letter with other religious accommodation requests for final signature. The administrator then prepares an internal memo to Vice Admiral John Nowell, asking him to \"sign . . . letters disapproving immunization waiver requests based on sincerely held religious beliefs.\"16 Then, at step thirty -five of the process, the administrator is told \u2014for the first time \u2014to read through the religious accommodation request. At that point, the disapproval letter has already been written, the religious accommodation request and related documents has already been reviewed by several offices, the disapproval has already been packaged with similar requests, and an internal memo has already been drafted requesting that Vice Admiral No well disapprove the religious accommodation request. The administrator is then tasked with reading the request and recording 12 Id. 13 Pls.' App. 295, ECF No. 17. 14 Id. at 879. 15 See Supp. Decl. of Andrew Stephens, Ex. 1, ECF No. 62. 16 See id. Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 10 of 26 PageID 2549Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 10 of 26 PageID 2549 11 any pertinent information in a spreadsheet. At no point in the process is the administrator given the opportunity to recommend anyt hing other than disapproval. The materials are then sent to Vice Admiral Nowell. The entire process belies the manual's assertion that \"[e]ach request is evaluated on a case by case basis.\"17 Defendants argue that the process is not futile. They say, \" The fact that Plaintiffs may not anticipate a favorable outcome does not render the remedies futile .\" Defs.' Resp. 25, ECF No. 43. That dramatically understates the record. At the preliminary injunction hearing, counsel for Defendants suggested that exhaustion is not futile so long as the Navy has not denied the request. But that the Navy could hypothetically grant a request does not, on this record, \"provide a real opportunity for adequate relief.\" Hodges , 499 F.2d at 420. Plaintiffs need not exhaust military remedies when doing so would be futile . Second , plaintiff s need not exhaust military remedies when \"available administrative remedies are inadeq uate\" to grant him the relief he seeks. Von Hoffburg , 615 F.2d at 640. The inadequacy exception and futility exception sometimes overlap. For example, \" an administrative remedy may be inadequate where the administrative body is shown to be biased or has ot herwise predetermined the issue before it. \" McCarthy v. Madigan , 503 U.S. 140 , 148 (1992). That the Navy has predetermined denial of the religious accommodations may indicate that the administrative process is both inadequate and futile. But the Fifth Circ uit has distinguished the two exceptions. See Von Hoffburg , 615 F.2d at 640. That distinction is particularly salient here. Even if the religious accommodations are granted, Plaintiffs will not receive the relief they seek. Again, the record is replete wi th examples. Those who receive religious accommodations are still \"medically disqualified.\"18 That means Plaintiffs would be permanently barred from 17 See id. 18 Pls.' App. 159, 838, ECF No. 17. Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 11 of 26 PageID 2550Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 11 of 26 PageID 2550 12 deployment, denied the bonuses and incentive pay that accompany deployment, and deprived of the very reason they chose to serve in the Navy.19 By contrast, those receiving medical accommodations are not medically disqualified \u2014they receive equal status as those who are vaccinated.20 Some Plaintiffs were told by their chains of command that if their religious accommodation s were approved , they would lose their SEAL Tridents.21 Others will lose their Tridents merely for requesting the exemption.22 Evidently, even successfully exhausting the religious accommodation process would not grant Plaintiffs the relief they seek. In some instances, it may invite more harm. At best, the available remedies would accord Plaintiffs second -class status in a peerless community. Thus, t he available administrative remedies are inadequate. The Fifth Circuit has discussed two more exce ptions to the exhaustion requirement. These last two exceptions overlap somewhat with the first and second factors of the Mindes test, so the Court merely outlines them here. The third exception is that \"exhaustion is not required when the petitioner may s uffer irreparable injury if he is compelled to pursue his administrative remedies.\" Von Hoffburg , 615 F.2d at 638. That resembles the second Mindes factor, which considers \"[t] he potential injury to the plaintiff if review is refused. \" Mindes , 453 F.2d at 201. The fourth exception to exhaustion is when \" the plaintiff has raised a substantial constitutional question. \" Von Hoffburg , 615 F.2d at 638. That inquiry raises the same issues as the first Mindes factor, the \" nature and strength of the plaintiff 's challenge to the military determination ,\" which generally favors review of substantial constitutional questions. Mindes , 453 F.2d at 201. The Court discusses these issues in greater detail in the next section. Here, the Court simply notes that to the exten t the analysis on 19 Id. at 928-29. 20 Id. at 159, 838. 21 E.g., id. at 906, 1021. 22 E.g., id. at 892, 900.

At least four recognized exceptions to the exhaustion requirement apply. If one is insufficient, the combination of the four re adily supports the Court's finding that the traditional justifications for military exhaustion are not served by the Navy's religious accommodation process. Plaintiffs have therefore satisfied parts one and two of the threshold Mindes test. b. The Four Minde s Factors Having passed the threshold test, Plaintiffs must next show that the four Mindes factors weigh in favor of justiciability. The factors are (1) the nature and strength of the plaintiff's challenge; (2) the potential injury to the plaintiff if revi ew is refused; (3) the type and degree of anticipated interference with the military function; and (4) the extent to which the exercise of military expertise or discretion is involved. Mindes , 453 F.2d at 201 -02. First , the nature and strength of Plaintiff s' claims weigh in favor of judicial review. As to the nature of the claim, \"[c]onstitutional claims [are] normally more important than those having only a statutory or regulatory base.\" Id. at 201 -02. But \"not all constitutional claims are to be weighed e qually.\" NeSmith v. Fulton , 615 F.2d 196, 201 (5th Cir. 1980). Courts tend to favor review of constitutional claims \"founded on infringement of specific constitutional rights, such as the Fifth Amendment privilege against self -incrimination or the First Am endment freedoms of speech and press,\" as opposed to constitutional claims that, for example, \" a serviceman 's due process rights were violated by arbitrary and capricious official action .\" Id. Plaintiffs move for a preliminary injunction based on specific violations of their constitutional rights under the Free Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 13 of 26 PageID 2552Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 13 of 26 PageID 2552 14 Exercise Clause, plus similar violations of RFRA. Plaintiffs' claims are squarely in the category of claims most favorable to judicial review.23 Moreover, Plaintiffs' claims are strong. \" An obviously tenuous claim of any sort must be weighted in favor of declining review. \" Mindes , 453 F.2d at 201. The Court discusses the strength of Plaintiffs' claims in Section III.B as part of the preliminary injunction analysis. As a brief preview, the vaccine mand ate fails strict scrutiny. The mandate treats comparable secular activity (e.g., medical exemptions) more favorably than religious activity. First, the Navy has granted only secular exemptions \u2014it has never granted a religious exemption from the vaccine. Second, even if the Navy were to grant a religious exemption, that exemption would still receive less favorable treatment than its secular counterparts. Those who receive reli gious exemptions are medically disqualified. Those who receive medical exemptions are not. But the activity itself \u2014forgoing the vaccine \u2014is identical. Given the irrationality of the mandate, \"[i]t is unsurprising that such litigants are entitled to relief.\" Tandon v. Newsom curiam) . Under the first Mindes factor, the Plaintiffs have shown that the nature and strength of their claims weigh strongly in favor judicial review. Second , the potential injury to Plaintiffs if revie w is refused weighs in favor of judicial review. \"The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably 23 As mentioned in the previous section, that Plaintiffs raise substantial constitutional claims also warrants excusing the military exh austion requirement. See Von Hoffburg v. Alexander , 615 638 (5th Warner , 481 F.2d 642, 643 (9th Cir. 1973) (excusing administrative exhaustion because \"[r]esolving a claim founded solely upon a constitutional right is singularly suited to a judicial forum and clearly inappropriate to an administrative board\"); Roe v.

Burns , 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976) (plurality opinion). This factor overlaps wit h the preliminary injunction analysis, so (again) the Court does not discuss it at length here. Two points bear mention. First, Plaintiffs are currently suffering injury while waiting for the Navy to adjudicate their requests. Plaintiffs have been declared nondeployable and suffer withheld promotions and travel.24 In one egregious example, Navy SEAL 26 was approved for a four-week program in Maryland to treat deployment -related traumatic brain injury.25 He told his commanding officer that he could travel in his own vehicle to the medical facility, which did not have a vaccine requirement for its patients. His commanding officer told him he was not allowed to travel because he was unvaccinated. SEAL 26 missed the opportunity to receive treatment, despite his pending religious accommodation request. Second, some Plaintiffs have suffered injury because they submitted religious accommodation requests. Many Plaintiffs have been told that merely requesting a religious accommodation will result in their removal from the Naval Special Warfare community and loss of their Trident.26 Withholding judicial review is particularly illogical when participation in the administrative process invites the very harm Plaintiffs seek to avoid. Third , the type and degree of anticipated interference with the military function weighs in favor of judicial review. \"[I] f the interference would be such as to seriously impede the military in the performance of vital duties, it militates strongly against relief. \" Mindes , 453 F.2d at 201. Defendants argue that judicial review would interfere with the military's decisions regarding duty assignments and medical fitness. See Defs.' Resp. 28 -30, ECF No. 43. But \"[i] nterference per se is insufficient since there will always be some interfer ence when review is granted .\" Mindes , 453 F.2d at 201.

The Navy already provides secular accommodations. Whether denying religious accommodations violates the First Amendment is a distinct legal question that would not \" seriously impede the military in the performance of vital duties .\" Id. Fourth , the extent to which the exercise of military expertise or discretion i s involved weighs in favor of review. \" Courts should defer to the superior knowledge and experience of professionals in matters such as promotions or orders directly related to specific military functions. \" Mindes , 453 F.2d at 201 -02. This is not a suit in which \"commanding officers would have to stand prepared to convince a civilian court of the wisdom of a wide range of military and disciplinary decisions.\" United States v. Shearer , 473 U.S. 52, 58 (1985). Neither does this case involve \"complex, subtle, and professional decisions as to the composition, training, equipping, and control of a military force.\" Chappell v. Wallace , 462 U.S. 296, 302 (1983) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Whether the vaccine mandate passes muster under the Firs t Amendment and RFRA requires neither \" military expertise or discretion .\" Mindes , 453 F.2d at 201. It is a purely legal question appropriate for judicial review. In sum, all four Mindes factors favor justiciability. To be sure, \"courts must \u2014at least initia lly\u2014indulge the optimistic presumption that the military will afford its members the protections vouchsafed by the Constitution, by the statutes, and by its own regulations.\" Hodges , 499 F.2d at 424. But they need not indulge that presumption to the point of absurdity. The record overwhelmingly demonstrates that the Navy's religious accommodation process is an exercise in futility. Plaintiffs need not wait for the Navy to rubber stamp a constitutional violation before 27 Id. at 284.

And this is pr ecisely the type of legal challenge that Mindes contemplates is appropriate for the courts to decide. Plaintiffs' claims are justiciable. B. Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits. Having established that Plaintiffs' claims are justiciable, the Court must consider the first of the four requirements under the preliminary injunction standard: whether Plaintiffs have established a \"substantial likelihood of success on the merits.\" Daniels Health Scis. , 710 F.3d at 582. In their motion, Plaintiffs make tw o substantive claims. First, they allege the vaccine mandate violates RFRA and the First Amendment. Second, they allege the mandate's permanent medical - disqualification provision fails strict scrutiny . The Court concludes Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on both claims . Because the mandate treats those with secular exemptions more favorably than those seeking religious exemptions , strict scrutiny is triggered, and Defendants fail to show a compelling interest with respect to the servicemembers before the Court. 1. Religious Freedom Restoration Act Plaintiffs allege that the vaccine mandate substantially burdens their religious exercise without satisfying the compelling interest required under RFRA . Defendants respond that even if Plaintiffs' beliefs are substantially burdened, the Navy has a compelling interest in keeping its force fit and responsive to national security threats . And while Defendants assert that vaccination is the least restrictive means to achieve this end, Plaintiffs suggest alterna tives exist . The Court concludes that Defendants have not demonstrated a compelling interest justifying the substantial burden imposed on the Plaintiffs' religious beliefs . Therefore, there is no need to discuss narrow tailoring. Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 17 of 26 PageID 2556Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 17 of 26 PageID 2556 18 The Religious Freedom Re storation Act \"was designed to provide very broad protection for religious liberty.\" Hobby Lobby , 573 U.S. 682, 706 (2014) . Passed in 1993 with nearly unanimous support, RFRA provides that the: Government may substantially burden a person 's exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person \u2014(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 000bb -1. RFRA extends to the military, because under the text of the statute, \"government\" includes any \"branch, department, agency, instrumentality, and official (or other person acting under color of law) of the United States.\" Id. \u00a7 2000bb -2. Defendants do not dispute this. Defendants have substantially burdened Plaintiffs' religious beliefs . The government burdens religion when it \"put[s] substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.\" Thomas v. Rev . Bd. of Ind . Emp't Sec. Div. , 450 U.S. 707, 718 (1981). That is especially true when the government imposes a choice between one's job and one's religious belief. See Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U.S. 398, 404 (1963). Here, Plaintiffs must decide whether to lose their live lihoods or violate sincerely held religious beliefs. Because they will not compromise these religious beliefs, Plaintiffs have been threatened with separation from the military and other disciplinary action . 3, ECF No. 1 - 3. Because the Plaintiffs have demonstrated a substantial burden, Defendants must show that this burden further s a compelling interest using the least restrictive means. Plaintiffs claim Defendants cannot demonstrate a compelling interest as to these particular servicemembers. Although they acknowledge that preventing the spread of COVID -19 was, at one time, a compelling interest, Plaintiffs argue t hat an indefinite state of emergenc y cannot justify this Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 18 of 26 PageID 2557Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 18 of 26 PageID 2557 19 compelling interest two years into the pandemic . Pls.' Br. 23-24, ECF No. 16. In response, Defendants argue that the Navy has a vital national security interest in keeping its force healthy and ready to deploy. Because Plaintiffs are members of Special Operations teams, these individuals must stay healthy to carry out highly specialized missions. Defs.' Resp . 33, ECF No. 43. Although \"[s]temming the spread of COVID -19 is unquestionably a compelling interest,\" its limits are finite. Roman Cath. Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo , 141 S. Ct. 63 (2020). Courts must \"look beyond broadly formulated interests,\" and instead consider the \"asserted harm of granting specific exemptions to particular religious claimants.\" Hobby Lobby , 573 U.S. at 726 -27 (cleaned up) (internal quotations omitted). In other words, Defendants must provide more than a broadly formulated interest in \"national security .\"28 They must articulate a compelling interest in vaccinating the thirty -five religious servicemembers currently before the Court . Without individualized assessment, the Navy cannot demonstrate a compelling interest in vaccinating these particular Plaintiffs . By all accounts, Plaintiffs have safely carried out their jobs during the pandemic.

Even if Defendants have a broad compelling interest in widespread vaccination of its force, they have achieved this goal without the participation of the thirty -five Plaintiffs here. At least 99.4% of all active -duty Navy servicemembers have been vaccinated. Pls.' App. 284, ECF No. 17. The remaining 0.6 % is unlikely to undermine the Navy's effort s. Today, Plaintiffs present a lower risk of infection and transmission than in the earlier days of the pandemic. Severa l Plaintiffs have tested positive for antibodies, showing the presence of natural immunity. See Decl. of SEALs 10, 22; SWCC 2, 4; Supp. Decl. of SEAL 12. With a 99.4 % vaccination rate, the Navy's herd immunity is at an all -time high. COVID -19 treatments are becoming increasingly effective at reducing hospitalization and death. See Pfizer Novel COVID -19 Oral Antiviral Treatment Study, Pls.' App. 310. Moreover, the Navy is willing to grant exemptions for non -religious reasons. Its mandate includes carveouts for those participating in clinical trials and those with medical contraindications and allergies to vaccines. Pls.' App. 154 -59.

Without a compelling interest, the Court need not address whether Defendants have used the least restrictive means . 2. First Amendment The Court turns now to the Plaintiffs' First Amendment claim. Plaintiffs argue that the Navy's mandate triggers strict scrutiny, because it is not neutral or generally applicable. Defendants insist they have carried their burden to demonstrate their compelling interest and the least restrictive means. The Court f inds that for the same reasons Plaintiffs succeed on their RFRA claim, they also prevail on the ir First Amendment claim. To assess neutrality and general applicability, courts consider both the structure of the law and any disparate outcomes it creates. \"A law is not generally applicable if it invites the government to consider the particular reasons for a person 's conduct by providing a mechanism for individualized exemptions.\" Fulton v. City of Phila ., 141 S. Ct. 1868, 1877 (2021) ( cleaned up). \"[G]overnment regulations are not neutral and generally applicable, and therefore trigger strict scrutiny under the Free Exercise Clause, whenever they treat any comparable secular activity more favorably than religious exercise. \" Tandon , 141 S. Ct. at 1296 (citing Roman Cath. Diocese of Brooklyn , 141 S. Ct. at 67 -68). The Navy's mandate is not neutral and generally applicable. First, b y accepting individual applications for exemptions, t he law invites an individualized assessment of the reasons why a servicemember is not vaccinated. See Pls.' App. 15 3-55 (NAVADMIN 190/21) ( describing the exemption process and authority to grant exemption ). Consequently , favoritism is built into the mandate. Second , the \"comparable secular activity\" includes refusing the vaccine for medical reasons or participation in a clinical trial. These medically exempt, unvaccinated servicemembers Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 21 of 26 PageID 2560Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 21 of 26 PageID 2560 22 are immediately deployable while unvaccinated servicemembers with religious objections are not. See MANMED \u00a7 15 -105(3)(n)(9 ); Pls.' App. 838. Defendants justify this discrepancy by contrasting the number of requests : \"Whereas there are only seven permanent medical exemptions for al l Navy and Reserve personnel from the COVID -19 immunization duty, there are more than three thousand pending requests for a religious exemption . . . .\" Defs.' Resp. 35 (citation omitted) . But a n influx of religious accommodation requests is not a valid re ason to deny First Amendment rights. No matter how small the number of secular exemptions by comparison, any favorable treatment \u2014in this case, deployability without medical disqualification \u2014defeats neutrality. For these reasons , the mandate triggers strict scrutiny under the First Amendment. As discussed in Section III.B.1, Defendants fail to satisfy the compelling interest requirement, so there is no need to consider least restrictive means. The Court will not repeat its strict scrutiny analysis here. Plaintiffs have established a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their RFRA and First Amendment claims, satisfying the first requirement of the preliminary injunction standard. 3. Medical -Disqualification Provision The parties' briefing on the medical -disqualification issue echoes the RFRA and First Amendment analysis discussed at length in Sections III.B.1 and III.B.2 above. In short, the Court finds that, for the same reasons Pla intiffs' RFRA and First Amendment challenges to the mandate itself succeed, Plaintiffs' challenge to the medical -disqualification provision follows. A servicemember with a religious accommodation is permanently medically disqualifie d while a servicemembe r with a medical exemption is not. See MANMED \u00a7 15-105(3)(n)(9 ); Pls.' App. 838. In other words, Plaintiffs \u2014even if they were all to be granted religious accommodations immediately \u2014would remain nondeployable and would be forced to seek a medical waiver to have this penalty removed. In short, this disparate treatment triggers strict scrutiny . Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 22 of 26 PageID 2561Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 22 of 26 PageID 2561 23 Defendants are unable to overcome strict scrutiny because they have not presented a compelling interest, as explained in previous sections. Thus, Plaintiffs are substa ntially likely to succeed on the merits of their medical -disqualification challenge. C. Plaintiffs face a substantial threat of irreparable harm. Under the second prong of the preliminary injunction standard, the movant s must establish a substantial threat of irreparable harm. Here , Plaintiffs argue th ey have suffered irreparable injury based on (1) infringement of religious liberties; (2) their nondeployable status, which reduces pay and advancement opportunities; and (3) the threat of court -martial and dis honor accompanying it. Defendants claim that Plaintiffs' harm is merely speculative because the religious exemption requests have not been finally adjudicated. Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs have improperly relied on BST Holdings , which applies only to civilian employment. It is incorrect to say that Plaintiffs' harm is merely speculative at this stage. Plaintiffs are already suffering injury while waiting for the Navy to adjudicate their requests. In some cases, Plaintiffs have suffered injury because they seek religious accommodation. Plaintiffs testify that they have been barred from official and unofficial travel, including for training29 and treatment for traumatic brain injuries;30 denied access to non -work activities, like family day;31 assigned unpleasant schedules and low -level work like cleaning;32 relieved of leadership duties and denied opportunities for advancement;33 kicked out of their platoon s;34 and threatened with immediate 29 Supp. Decl. of SEAL Supp. 1032; SEAL 26, ECF No. 31 of SEAL 26, Supp. App. 1103.

Alguire , 647 F.3d 585, 600 (5th Cir. 2011). As Defendants note, even a general discharge from the military \u2014the ultimate threat here \u2014is not an irreparable harm. See McCurdy v. Zuckert , 359 F.2d 491, 494 (5th Cir. 1966). No matter how remote the possibility, Plaintiffs could be compensated for their losses. They could be reinstated with backpay, retroactively promoted, or reimbursed for lost benefits like medical insurance and the GI Bill. But because these injuries are inextricably intertwined with Plaintiffs' loss of constitutional rights, this Court must conclude that Plaintiffs have suffered irreparable harm. Plaintiffs have suffered the more serious injury of \"infringement of their r eligious liberty rights under RFRA and the First Amendment . . . .\" Pls.' Br. 28, ECF No. 16. The crisis of conscience imposed by the mandate is itself an irreparable harm. See BST Holdings , 17 F.4th at 618; Sambrano v. United Airlines , 19 F.4th 839, 842 (5th Cir. 2021) (Ho, J., dissenting) (citing Sampson v. Murray , 415 U.S. 61, 92 n.68 (1974) ). \"The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.\" Elrod , 427 U.S. at 373 (plurality opi nion). The same is true of RFRA. Opulent Life Church v. City of Holly Springs , 697 F.3d 279, 295 (5th Cir. 2012). Thus, any losses the Plaintiffs have suffered in connection with their religious accommodation requests sufficiently demonstrate irreparable i njury. 35 Supp. Decl. of SEAL 24, Supp. EOD 1, Supp. App. 1126. 36 Test. of SEAL 3, Hr'g Ex. 9.

Resp . 45, ECF No. 43. But the principle the Supreme Court ar ticulated in Elrod v. Burns applies broadly , and the Fifth Circuit has acknowledged that any loss of First Amendment freedom satisfies the irreparable injury requirement , even in the national security context. See Def. Distributed v. U.S. Dep't of State , 838 F.3d 451, 457 (5th Cir. 2016). Thus, the second requirement for injunctive relief has been satisfied. D. The balance of hardships weighs in Plaintiffs' favor, and the issuance of the preliminary injunction will not disserve the public interest. The final two elements of the preliminary injunction standard \u2014the balance of the harms and whether an injunction will disserve the public interest \u2014must be considered together. \"These factors merge when the Government is the opposing party.\" Nken v. Holder , 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). When balancing the harms, courts must consider whether the movant's injury outweighs the threatened harm to the party w hom they seek to enjoi n. The public interest element is broader in scope. Plaintiffs seek to preserve the status quo. They argue the balance of harms tips in Plaintiffs' favor, and an injunction is always in the public interest when it prevents deprivatio n of constitutional rights. Pls. Br. 29, ECF No. 16; see Jackson Women's Health Org. v. Currier , 760 F.3d 448 , 458 n.9 (5th Cir. 2014) . By contrast, Defendants claim that an injunction will cause the Navy significant harm, including illness, hospitalizatio n, and death among its ranks. Given the public interest in military readiness and national defense, they argue, the injunction should be denied. This Court does not make light of COVID -19's impact on the military. Collectively, our armed forces have lost 8 0 lives to COVID -19 over the course of the pandemic. Defs.' App. 263 , Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 25 of 26 PageID 2564Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 66 Filed 01/03/22 Page 25 of 26 PageID 2564 26 ECF No. 44 -3. But the question before the Court is not whether a public interest exists. Rather, this Court must address whether an injunction will disserve the public interest. An injun ction does not disserve the public interest when it prevents constitutional deprivations. Jackson Women's Health , 760 F.3d at 458 n.9. The Plaintiffs' loss of religious liberties outweighs any forthcoming harm to the Navy. Even the direst circumstances ca nnot justify the loss of constitutional rights. Fortunately, the future does not look so dire. Nearly 100% of the Navy has been vaccinated. Hospitalizations are rising at a much slower rate than COVID -19 cases. COVID -19 treatments are becoming more effecti ve and widely available. Thus, Plaintiffs have satisfied the final two requirements for preliminary injunction. IV. CONCLUSION For the reasons stated, the Motion for Preliminary Injunction is GRANTED . Defendants are enjoined from applying M ANMED to Plaintiffs . Defendants are also enjoined from taking any adverse action against Plaintiffs on the basis of Plaintiffs' request s for religious accommodation . Mot. 2 - 3, ECF No. 15.

NAVY COVID-19 UPDATE March 31, 2022 As of March 30, 2022, 4,282 active component and 3,267 Ready Reserve service members remain unvaccinated. As a result of the recent class action certi\u0000cation and corresponding injunction issued by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, NAVADMIN 083/22 , released March 30, 2022, suspends separation processing and adverse administrative consequences for Navy service members who submitted requests for religious accommodation from the COVID-19 vaccine requirement. As of March 24, 2022, there have been 732 separations for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine. There have been 689 Active Component Sailors and 21 Reserve Component Sailors separated, all with an honorable characterization of service. Guidance for separating Navy service members refusing the vaccine was set by the COVID-19 Consolidated Disposition Authority and is detailed in NAVADMIN 283/21 . There have been 22 Entry Level Separations (ELS). In accordance with the Naval Military Personnel Manual (MILPERSMAN) 1910-154 and NAVADMIN 225/21 , this re\u0000ects service members who, since the time of the vaccine mandate, were separated during initial training periods within their \u0000rst 180 days of active duty. Nine religious accommodation requests for members of the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) have been conditionally approved. A conditional approval means that the individual is not required to be vaccinated while in the IRR, but must be fully vaccinated as de\u0000ned in NAVADMIN 190/21 prior to returning to service.

Administrative (Admin): To include Permanent Change of Station (PCS), Emergency Leave, Separation, and Admin Temporary, etc. Admin PCS: For individual already checked out of the command due to permanent change of station and awaiting to be gained at their next command. (Individuals should be vaccinated prior to permanent change status whenever possible). Admin Temporary: For individual that is operationally unavailable for vaccination. For example, deployed to a location or region where the mandatory vaccine is unavailable. Religious Accommodation: A religious accommodation is a category of administrative exemptions that provides an accommodation to a service member for an otherwise applicable military policy, practice, or duty. In accordance with The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, if such a military policy, practice or duty substantially burdens a service member's exercise of religious, accommodation unless: 1. The military policy, practice, or duty is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest (e.g. mission accomplishment, safety, force health). 2. It is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.

I transitioned to the reserves in 2014. 4.Over the course of my career, I have received the following awards: Meritorious ServiceMedal, Air Medal with 4 Oak Leaf Clusters, Aerial Achievement Medal, Air Force Com-mendation Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, Meritorious Unit Award, AF Outstanding UnitAward with 4 Oak Leaf Clusters, and Combat Readiness Medal with 4 Oak Leaf Clusters. 5.I have also been considered a top performer amongst my peers with numerous accoladessuch as Top Gun awards, Company Grade Officer awards, Flight Commander of the Year,outstanding flight check rides, mission commander, considered the \"Subject Matter Ex-pert\" in enemy Integrated Air Defense Networks, and was designated as a \"DistinguishedGraduate\" during the course of my Professional Military Education at Maxwell Air ForceBase. 6.I am an instructor pilot and mission commander in the F-16. As a combat F-16 fighterpilot, I have deployed numerous times in support of operations across the globe. Namely,two deployments to Iraqi 2007 and 2008, one to Afghanistan in 2016, another to Pakistanin 2011, Romania in 2018, and even an exchange tour to Poland in 2017. During one de - ployment to Iraq, I promoted to the rank of Captain, which was captured as a notableevent in the Air Force Times. https://www.f-16.net/f-16-news-article2367.html.

To borrow the phrase; it is the lion's share of flight experience in the F-16. 7.At no time during my career have I received any form of punishment or reprimand. 8.I am presently assigned to Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, Texas, where my job title is F-16 Instructor Pilot. I have been assigned to that unit since September 2014. 9.On August 24, 2021, the Secretary of Defense issued a mandate for all members of the Armed Forces under Department of Defense authority on active duty or in the Ready Re - serve, including the National Guard, to immediately begin full vaccination against COVID-19. 10.On September 3, 2021, the Secretary of the Air Force issued a similar mandate (\"COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate\") requiring that commanders in the Air Force take all steps neces-sary to ensure all uniformed Airmen and Guardians received the COVID-19 vaccine, which included issuing unit-wide and individual orders to their military members. 11.On October 5, 2021, my commander issued me an order to receive the COVID-19 vac - cine. 12.In response to the COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate, service members were permitted to sub-mit a request for either a religious or medical exemption. 13.On October 12, 2021, I submitted a Religious Accommodation Request (\"RAR\") to be exempted from the COVID-19 vaccine requirement. DocuSign Envelope ID: 298C83B0-01D7-46F9-93C0-7119C75CAEA0 40Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 153 PageID 141Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 44 of 153 PageID 14114.In my RAR, I requested a religious accommodation from immunizations which utilize aborted fetal tissue in their development, manufacturing, testing, or research. Additional- ly, I sought exemptions from immunizations that alter the body's natural process for ac-quiring immunity by using synthetic or artificial processes. This appeal is not seeking ex-emption from all immunizations, only those narrowly defined above. 15.My turning point came after the death of my newborn daughter Vaea in January 2021 af-ter my wife contracted COVID-19. A few months after my daughter's death, my wifeand I visited a memorial Cook's Children Hospital established to immortalize childrenlike my daughter who died, but through their organ donations, could save the lives ofothers. Surrounding the name of my daughter are the names of hundreds of children;each with their own story of grieving parents. Through the death of my daughter, I real-ized that I can no longer turn a blind eye to the pain that our Father in heaven must feelwhen he sees the senseless death of innocent children to create or develop these vaccines. 16.In light of the vaccine mandates that threaten, \"vaccinate or lose your job,\" I am remind-ed of scripture. In Revelations 13:17, it is clear that during the end of days, \"No one canbuy or sell or engage in commerce, unless he has the mark.\" Without these vaccines, so-ciety is saying that we cannot travel, eat in local restaurants, or even hold a job withoutthem. In essence; engage in commerce. While the mark is not fully defined, I sincerelybelieve that vaccines will lead to the mark of the beast known throughout the book ofRevelation. My hope is to abstain from actions that would condone the mark and leadthose who are not yet believers down a path which ultimately would condemn them tohell, separated from Christ, for eternity. Scripture is clear to those that would take the DocuSign Envelope ID: 298C83B0-01D7-46F9-93C0-7119C75CAEA0 41Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 153 PageID 142Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 45 of 153 PageID 142mark of the beast, \"He also will drink the wine of God's wrath, poured full strength into the cup of his anger, and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment goes up for-ever and ever, and they have no rest, day or night, these worshipers of the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name.\" Revelation 14:10-11. It is unknown if I have natural immunity, but I currently have not been infected despite constant expo-sure to my wife and child in the NICU, both of whom were COVID positive. 17.As a requirement of the RAR process, on or about October 24, 2021, I was interviewed by the 301 FW/Wing Chaplain regarding my sincerely held religious beliefs. 18.On October 24, 2021, the chaplain determined that my religious beliefs were sincere. 19.As an additional requirement of the RAR process, on October 17, 2021, I was counseled by Lieutenant Colonel Jason Rogers, 301FW Medical Group, about the risks of not being vaccinated and becoming ill with COVID-19. 20.On October 20, 2021, I was counseled by my commander that noncompliance with im - munization requirements may adversely affect readiness for deployment, assignment, in-ternational travel, or result in other administrative consequences. \"Administrative conse - quences\" include adverse administrative actions such as, Letters of Admonishment, Let-ters of Counseling, and Letters of Reprimand, which, if received, would detrimentally impact my career and could negatively impact my chances of promoting to the next rank. 21.In addition to administrative consequences, I could face nonjudicial punishment, which is a career ender. I would not be able to promote further despite a promising career to this point. I would no longer be considered for command, nor for career broadening educa - DocuSign Envelope ID: 298C83B0-01D7-46F9-93C0-7119C75CAEA0 42Case 4:22-cv-00453-O 153 PageID 143Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 46 of 153 PageID 143tional experiences. To use the vernacular, I would have a scarlet letter on my record. The DoD has indicated that an increasing level of pressure will be implemented to encourage vaccination, but ultimately resulting in discharge from the military, or in my situation as a reservist; placed involuntarily into the Individual Ready Reserves (IRR) without due process or recourse. While in the IRR, reservists are placed in a \"no pay-no points\" sta-tus, which will prevent me from accumulating points to earn a \"good year.\" The conse-quence of this action is that despite still being \"in the military,\" I would not be allowed to satisfy the requirements of military service despite remaining in the military beyond 20 years of service. In essence, the command would prevent me from earning a retirement despite the fact that I am mere months from retirement eligibility after 19 years of honor-able service, not withstanding the four years served at the Air Force Academy beginning in 1999. 22.I performed my job duties with no interruptions and no harm to my job performance fromMarch 2020, when COVID-19 mitigation measures were put into effect, until May of thisyear, when I was removed from attending a training exercise to San Antonio due to AirForce Reserve Command (AFRC) policy that prevents non-vaccinated members fromperforming any temporary duty (TDY). Prior to this, I successfully carried out my unit'smission and at no time was there an impact to the mission as a result of COVID-19 to in-clude a TDY to Savanna Georgia to support Presidential protection under Operation No-ble Eagle (ONE). In fact, on December 6, 2021, Lieutenant Colonel David Snodgrass,USAF, Commander of the 457th Fighter Squadron, the squadron to which I am attached,submitted a memorandum to the Surgeon General of the Air Force in support of granting DocuSign Envelope ID: 298C83B0-01D7-46F9-93C0-7119C75CAEA0 43Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 153 PageID 144Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 47 of 153 PageID 144a religious accommodation. In his memo, Lt Col Snodgrass affirmed that granting my RAR would have no impact on my ability to carry out my duties at home station. He also affirmed granting my RAR would have no impact on my ability to carry out my duties at a deployed location, unless a COVID-19 vaccination was mandatory for deployment. In that event he affirmed I would be just as vital to mission accomplishment by remaining at home station and training the second rotation pilots for deployment. He affirmed granti-ng my RAR would not impact the squadron's ability to accomplish the wing mission of training and deploying combat ready airmen. He affirmed that due to the persistent shortage of fighter pilots, granting my RAR would improve the overall military readiness of the squadron while failing to do so would reduce overall squadron readiness and in - crease workload on the remaining pilots. He affirmed that granting my RAR would have no impact on unit cohesion or good order and discipline. He affirmed that the single-seat F-16 mission does not require close contact or sharing confined space with other person - nel. He affirmed that means less restrictive than requiring the COVID-19 vaccination - wearing a mask, social distancing, and periodic testing - had been effective for the squadron for the preceding 19 months and could meet the government's interests. He re-peatedly asserted that granting my RAR and allowing the squadron commander to man - age how squadron personnel are employed would provide the best outcome for his squadron's readiness and ability to execute its mission. Thus far, my local command has remained amicable and supportive during this process. 23.Since March of 2020, my job duties included F-16 Instructor Pilot and 301FW Flight Safety Officer while stationed at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, Texas. DocuSign Envelope ID: 298C83B0-01D7-46F9-93C0-7119C75CAEA0 44Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 153 PageID 145Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 48 of 153 PageID 14524.After submitting my RAR on October 12, 2021, on December 1, 2021, I received the ini - tial denial of my RAR. 25.The denial was issued by Lieutenant General Richard W. Scobee, USAF, Commander Air Force Reserve Command, and the reasons cited were risk to the mission, specifically the health, safety and readiness of the force which he claimed is the compelling government interest. 26.However, I was perplexed General Scobee cited those reasons when considering the March 1st DoD guidance which eliminates masking and other requirements for service members, federal civilian workers, and contractors, and also does not require vaccination status to be a factor in the workplace. These same federal civilian contractors, whose vaccine mandate is not presently in effect, are permitted to work in close proximity in our squadron on a daily basis. Thus, General Scobee considers the unvaccinated a threat to mission accomplishment yet part of that mission includes a large civilian workforce that are not vaccinated. For example, our squadron outsources our F-16 simulators to BGI LLC, a government contractor, with numerous employees in close proximity to military members. Other members of my unit are Air Reserve Technicians (ARTs) whose posi-tions are tied to a military position; usually a Traditional Reservist (TR). As an ART, their status falls under the Federal Civilian Employee that holds dual status as a member of the Reserves. Thus, one position is tied to the other. Crew Chiefs, who are responsi-ble for preparing the aircraft prior to each flight, are often ARTs. Several crew chiefs in my unit were placed on a \"no pay no points\" military status after being denied their own religious accommodation to vaccination, but are still performing their roles in a civilian DocuSign Envelope ID: 298C83B0-01D7-46F9-93C0-7119C75CAEA0 45Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 153 PageID 146Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 49 of 153 PageID 146capacity; yet oddly, still required to wear the military uniform while doing so. They are currently barred from reenlistment, thus will lose their civilian jobs at the completion of their Federal Civilian Employee contract because their military position is being taken from them. It is a back-door way to circumvent the March 1st guidance. 27.On 7 December 2021, I submitted a Freedom of Information Act request for my packagein anticipation of a denial. 28.On 7 March 2022, I received a highly redacted file that offered no insight into the delib-eration process of my accommodation request. 29.On December 8, 2021, I submitted my appeal to the Air Force Surgeon General and amawaiting a final response. 30.Pursuant to Department of the Air Force Instruction 52-201, Religious Freedom in the Department of the Air Force, dated June 23, 2021, paragraph 2.10, I would expect to re-ceive my appeal denial any day now, which means that administrative consequences willswiftly follow. That paragraph specifically states that \"[a]ppeal of a disapproved reli-gious accommodation request must be resolved no later than 30 business days followingthe member's written notification of intent to appeal to the next higher decision authorityin the chain of command.\" 31.My civilian employment is as a pilot for American Airlines. I am a first officer flying theAirbus 320 domestically out of Dallas Fort Worth International Airport. Under the exec-utive mandate issued by POTUS, I was directed to vaccinate by American Airlines, orrisk termination. I submitted for and was granted an accommodation against vaccinationutilizing the same arguments I presented in my RAR to the Air Force. The stipulations of DocuSign Envelope ID: 298C83B0-01D7-46F9-93C0-7119C75CAEA0 46Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 153 PageID 147Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 50 of 153 PageID 147the approved accommodation ask that I simply assess my health prior to each flight, and if I am sick, to stay home, while additionally adhering to CDC social distancing and face mask guidance. Thankfully, regardless of my vaccination status, I am allowed to fly anywhere in the world that does not require a vaccine, which thus far has had zero impact on my domestic routes. 32.While I was mentally distraught over having to decide between my career to be able to provide for my family of four, or violating my sincerely held religious beliefs, I made the difficult decision to hold true to my faith and did not receive a COVID-19 vaccine. The emotional distress this decision is having on me and my family is overwhelming. I go to bed each night thinking my next flight will be my last, and that I then will be forced out of the military, losing my medical coverage and educational benefits for my children. The joy in our family has been replaced by frustration, stress, and confusion over how we have fought for a country that espouses religious freedoms, yet discriminates against those that are now fighting to protect it. I am told my lack of vaccination status is not conducive towards military service despite numerous studies stating that these vaccines do not prevent infection or transmission of COVID-19. 33.However, others who perform the same duties as me and who were granted medical ex-emptions to the COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate are still able to fly fighters for the Air Force. In fact, I have personal, first-hand knowledge that some of those individuals have been granted medical exemptions and can perform their job duties. 34.Without immediate relief, I am facing administrative consequences to include letters of council and letters of reprimand being placed into my permanent military file; being DocuSign Envelope ID: 298C83B0-01D7-46F9-93C0-7119C75CAEA0 47Case 4:22-cv-00453-O 153 PageID 148Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 51 of PageID 148forced into a \"no pay, no points\" status; and then being involuntarily forced into the Indi- vidual Ready Reserve (IRR) without ability to appeal, and eventually being administra-tively separated from the Air Force despite an honorable 19 year career when I could oth-erwise retire with honor after 20 years of service.

I am over the age of eighteen and am competent to make this declaration. 2. I presently reside in Newark, Texas.3. I have served in the Department of the Air Force (\"Air Force\") as an active-duty service member since May 31, 2006. 4. Over the course of my career, I have received the following awards: The Air Education and Training Command Commander's Trophy for being the top graduate in my pilottraining class, the Air-to Air Weapon System Evaluation Program \"Top Gun\" Award forbeing the top performer in the exercise, the Academic Excellence Award from MQ-9ATraining as the top academic graduate, multiple Company Grade Officer, Field GradeOfficer, and Instructor Pilot of the Quarter awards, two Air Force CommendationMedals, and three Meritorious Service Medals. 5. I have also been a Distinguished Graduate in multiple programs throughout my career. I was a Distinguished Graduate from the United States Air Force Academy, UndergraduatePilot Training, Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals, and RQ-170 Initial QualificationTraining. I have also been considered a top performer throughout my career and beenranked #1 twelve times by my squadron and group leadership. I was competitivelyselected to be an inaugural Combat Air Force's Fellow and most recently asked tocommand the Air Force's premier Combat Training Squadron (\"CTS\"), the 414 th CTS (RED FLAG), where I commanded a 72-member squadron responsible for training17,100 United States, Joint, and Coalition personnel annually in the largest Department 51Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 55 of 153 PageID 152Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 PageID 152of Defense live-fly air-air large-force-exercise. This position is normally filled by a senior Colonel and I accomplished the job as a new Lieutenant Colonel. 6. At no time during my career have I received any form of punishment or reprimand, other than the punishment I recently received related to the Air Force's COVID-19 vaccinationrequirement, which is explained in more detail below. 7. I am presently assigned to the 90th Flying Training Squadron at Sheppard Air Force Base (\"Sheppard\") in Wichita Falls, Texas. I have been assigned to Sheppard since October of2021. I was previously assigned to Nellis Air Force Base (\"Nellis\") in Nevada from June2017 to October 2021 where I last served as the Deputy Commander and thenCommander of the 414th Combat Training Squadron. 8. From March of 2020 until October 2021, my job duties included commanding a 118- member military, civilian, and contractor team, leading multiple large-force exercises for372 United States, Allied, and Coalition units, directing operational control and logisticssupport for 1,200 aircraft and 17,100 personnel annually while overseeing a $23.5 millionannual budget. My duty station was Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. 9. As of October 2021, my job duties include assisting with squadron scheduling duties. However, my job duties would be instructing student pilots in the T-38C and a significantleadership role within the 80th Flying Training Wing if I was not removed frominstructor pilot training. 10. Since COVID-19 mitigation measures were put into effect in March of 2020, there have been no interruptions to my job duties or my job performance. In fact, I successfullycarried out my units' missions, and at no time was there an impact to the mission as aresult of COVID-19. I was responsible for saving two RED FLAG exercises during the 52Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 56 of 153 PageID 153Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 56 of 153 PageID 153time when COVID mitigation efforts were in effect by creating rule -sets that allowed world-class air-combat training to 3,100 service members (https://www.nellis.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2721513/red-flag-21-3-uses-joint-training-to-enhance-interoperability/). 11. On August 24, 2021, the Secretary of Defense issued a mandate for all members of the Armed Forces under Department of Defense authority on active duty or in the Ready Reserve, including the National Guard, to immediately begin full vaccination against COVID-19. 12. On September 3, 2021, the Secretary of the Air Force issued a similar ma ndate (\"COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate\") requiring commanders in the Air Force to take all steps necessary to ensure all uniformed Airmen and Guardians received the COVID -19 vaccine, which included issuing unit-wide and individual orders to their military members. 13. In response to the COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate, service members were permitted to submit a request for either a religious or medical exemption. 14. On September 8, 2021, my then-supervisor, the Commander of the 414th Combat Training Squadron at Nellis, issued me a verbal order during a phone call to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. At that time, I was the Deputy Commander of the 414th Combat Training Squadron. 15. During the call, I told my Commander that my intention was to seek a Religious Accommodation Request (\"RAR\"). My Commander stated that he would support and recommend approval of my RAR. 53Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 57 of 153 PageID 154Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 57 of 153 PageID 15416. As a requirement of the Air Force's RAR process, on September 15, 2021, I was interviewed by the Nellis Deputy Wing Chaplain to discuss my sincerely held religious beliefs. Our conversation resulted in the chaplain affirming my sincerely held beliefswhile supporting and recommending approval of my RAR. He also stated in thememorandum that memorialized my interview that \"[a]ccommodation for immunizationwaivers have been made previously for currently serving members of the USAF andDoD.\" 17. That same day, I was counseled by my commander that noncompliance with immunization requirements may adversely affect deployment, assignment, internationaltravel, or result in other administrative consequences. \"Administrative consequences\"include written counseling and administrative separation, which, if received, woulddetrimentally impact my career. Noncompliance could also result in nonjudicialpunishment under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. This is where thecommander offers to issue a service member punishment subject to the member's consentto be tried exclusively by the commander. As part of this process, the member coulddecide to turn down this offer and elect to be tried by court-martial. 18. However, on September 21, 2021, my commander issued a memorandum for all review authorities determining that there was not a compelling government interest to disapprovemy RAR. He recommended approval of my request, stating that he took into account thefact that the Air Force has a compelling government interest in mission accomplishmentand the effect my accommodation would have on readiness, unit cohesion, good orderand discipline, health, and safety of the unit and myself, and the impact on my duties. Healso stated that there were less restrictive means that can be used to meet the 54Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 58 of 153 PageID 155Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 58 of 153 PageID 155government's compelling interest by mandating that I continue to practice social distancing and disciplined mask wear. 19. On September 20, 2021, as an additional requirement of the Air Force RAR process, I attended medical counseling at the 99th Medical Group at Nellis. The purpose of thecounseling was to inform me of the dangers of COVID-19 if I were to remainunvaccinated and the benefits of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. 20. On September 22, 2021, I submitted my RAR requesting to be exempted from the COVID-19 vaccine requirement. However, as I explain below, I later found out that myRAR was never processed while I was assigned to Nellis. 21. While my RAR was pending, on or about October 1, 2021, I traveled on official orders to my now-duty station at Sheppard. 22. On October 5, 2021, I arrived at Sheppard, and on October 6, 2021, I went on temporary duty orders to Wright-Paterson Air Force Base in Ohio for training purposes. I traveledback to Sheppard during the evening hours of October 7, 2021. 23. On October 8, 2021, I began Pilot Instructor Training (\"PIT\") at Sheppard. The purpose of me being assigned to Sheppard was so I could become qualified as an instructor pilotand train student pilots on the T-38C. 24. On October 18, 2021, while still in training, my commander, 90th Flying Training Squadron, reached out to me via text message asking what my vaccination status was. Iimmediately returned his call and told him that I had submitted a RAR at Nellis inSeptember of 2021 and that I was not vaccinated. My commander's response was that Icould continue training at that time. 55Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 59 of 153 PageID 156Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 59 of 153 PageID 15625. On October 20, 2021, my commander asked me to meet with him in his office. He immediately removed me from PIT and placed me on \"Admin Hold\"1 because of an August 31, 2021, 19th Air Force Commander policy stating that any officer in a formal flying course will be placed on Admin Hold because of their unvaccinated status while seeking an exemption. I was removed from PIT despite the fact that all certified instructor pilots who work and instruct in the same spaces and around the same personnel as PIT students like myself at Sheppard who were seeking RARs at that time were allowed to keep performing their duties without being placed on \"Admin Hold.\" 26. On October 27, 2021, I filed an Equal Opportunity complaint against the 19th Air Force Commander on the basis that his August 31, 2021, policy was discriminatory and in direct violation of Department of the Air Force Instruction 52-201, para. 1.3, Department of Defense Instruction 1300.17, para. 1.2b, and Air Force Policy Directive 52-2, para. 1.6. My Equal Opportunity complaint argues that my removal from training is a clear case of religious discrimination as I am either being ordered to violate the tenants of my religious faith or face punitive action and denial of training that I had been scheduled to attend for over two years. Instead, I was assigned to other tasks such as assisting the squadron front office and scheduling duties, which are normally reserved for a Lieutenant, rather than attend required upgrade training for my job as an assigned T-38C instructor pilot. 27. In the meantime, on October 26, 2021, I received the results of my COVID -19 antibody test, which substantiated that I had overwhelming antibodies to the COVID -19 virus. 1 Admin Hold is a policy commanders can use to pause students in their training for purposes other than medical needs or performance below minimums . This is typically used when students are dealing with major life events that would detract from training or other similar situations. 56Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 60 of 153 PageID 157Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 60 of 153 PageID 15728. On November 1, 2021, I received a phone call from my commander letting me know that my major command, Air Education Training Command (\"AETC\"), was requesting to take over my RAR processing from my prior major command, Air Combat Command (\"ACC\"). 2 29. On November 2, 2021, I submitted all of my original RAR documents to my 90th Flight Training Squadron commander. 30. On or about November 7, 2021, I updated my RAR to include a memo requesting that I be exempt from all vaccines and medicines produced or developed using /or containing fetal cell lines or mRNA technology. 31. In my RAR, I explained that I am a devout Christ follower who believes in the sanctity of human life from the point of conception. Any attempt to end that life equates to murder, in my mind. I cannot be a part of any process that utilizes or creates benefit from murdering a baby. Each life is created in God's image. Further, I explained that utilizing mRNA technology in vaccines usurps God's creation of the human genome. 32. On November 29, 2021, my commander informed me that the Religious Resolution Team (\"RRT\") completed their review of my RAR. But the next day, my commander called me to confirm which RAR I wanted to submit (either my original RAR regarding only the COVID-19 vaccine or the updated version where I requested an exemption to all vaccines). I informed him that I was seeking the exemption to all vaccines to fetal cell lines or mRNA technology, which prompted the need for me to reaccomplish my medical counseling and chaplain interview. 2 My unit at Sheppard falls under AETC, and my prior unit at Nellis falls under ACC. 57Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 61 of 153 PageID 158Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 61 of 153 PageID 15833. On December 2, 2021, I completed my medical counseling over the phone with Sheppard Flight Medicine. I was counseled on the risks, benefits, and alternatives of receiving or declining vaccinations that utilize genomic technologies or incorporate fetal cell matterfor vaccine development or manufacture. I was later advised that I did not need tocomplete another chaplain interview. 34. December 6, 2021, was the first day of required COVID-19 testing for unvaccinated Airmen. All of the unvaccinated were required to meet in the Operations Groupauditorium for testing each week. I have tested negative for COVID-19 every weekthrough May 16, 2022, which was my most recent test date. 35. During the 2021 Christmas break, I learned that the Centers for Disease Control (\"CDC\") guidance stated that if you have allergies to ingredients in the COVID-19 vaccine, youshould not get the vaccine. 3 This information was significant because in my family, my wife and some of my children have significant allergies and autoimmune diseases.Specifically, my wife and some of my children have Celiac disease, and we have knownallergies to gluten and dairy. My children also have sensitivities to mold, heavy metals,and many other substances. One of my daughters, had a severe allergic reaction to avaccine when she was two years old. Her entire body broke out in a rash, she vomitedprofusely, and had trouble breathing. Given these unique circumstances, we have spentthe last 11 years seeking answers and healing for our family. This journey led us tofunctional medicine which seeks whole body solutions and healing rather than justtreating symptoms. It has solidified our belief in a medical model to promote, seek, andmaintain optimal wellness. Due to these concerns, my spouse and children are not 3 https://www.cdc.gov/ coronavirus/2019 -ncov/vaccines/ recommendations/specific -groups/allergies.html 58Case 153 PageID 159Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 62 of 153 PageID 159vaccinated. One of my other daughters was recently hospitalized in April 2021. My mother was vaccinated four days prior to visiting us for a few days. On the second day of her visit, my daughter became very lethargic and within 48 hours had broken into a whole-body rash, her eyes became completely bloodshot, she had a high fever, and her resting heartrate was in the 160s. We rushed her to the emergency room where she was immediately admitted to the ICU. She was hospitalized for seven days and was diagnosed with Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) as a result of being around my vaccinated mother, according to the attending physician. We had two other doctors confirm this link to her disease. She now has to be seen by a cardiologist for the rest of her life due to damage to her heart. I was, and still am, sincerely concerned for the health of myself and my family due to shared genetics and the link to the vaccine. 36. Considering my family's long history with vaccine-related issues, a close friend informed me that it was possible to test for allergies to the specific components of the COVIDvaccine to find out if there would be an adverse reaction. I was relieved, because therewas finally a valid avenue in place to address my and my family's medical concerns. 37. Based on my friend's recommendation, I decided to see Dr. Alfred Johnson, D.O., who was a doctor other service members had used for allergy testing. On Dr. Johnson'swebsite, a few of his credentials are stated as follows: \"A fellow, former board member,and Instructional Course Director of the American Academy of Environmental Medicine,Dr. Johnson is also a member of the American college of Osteopathic Internists, the JointCouncil of Allergy and Immunology, Pan American Allergy Society (and a former boardmember), the American Osteopathic Association and the Texas Osteopathic Association, 59Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 63 of 153 PageID 160Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 63 of 153 PageID 160in which he formerly served as vice president of the Dallas chapter. \" (https://www.johnsonmedicalassociates.com/about-dr-johnson/) 38. On January 12, 2022, I met Dr. Johnson and had testing done. 39. On January 14, 2022, I received a letter from Dr. Johnson showing that I tested positive for having a reaction to polyethylene and polysorbate, which are ingredients in the COVID-19 vaccines. 40. On January 18, 2022, I visited with my squadron's assigned flight surgeon to complete my annual physical. During the visit, I showed the doctor my allergy test results andreceive a 365-day temporary medical exemption. He told me that the exemption was in accordance with Air Force and Sheppard procedures and that he could create theexemption. 41. On January 19, 2022, I let my commander know that I had an approved medical exemption and that I would like to start training on February 8, 2022 , the start of the next PIT class. 42. On February 7, 2022, when I arrived at work, I checked my Individual Medical Readiness status. It stated that I was grounded from flying with no explanation. Iimmediately went to my commander who said he was unaware of this development and that I should still expect to start training the following day. 43. Later that day, my commander called me and advised that I was removed from training and that I was back on \"Admin Hold.\" I was told to continue my telework schedule. The catalyst for this grounding and removing me from training again was directly related tomy submission of allergy testing and subsequent temporary medical exemption. 60Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 64 of 153 PageID 161Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 64 of 153 PageID 16144. On February 9, 2022, my commander issued me my initial denial of my RAR. I did not sign it but acknowledged that I had five days to appeal. I then sent my commander an email request for Privacy Act documents related to my RAR denial and ask ed for an extension of time to file my appeal until I had all the documents related to my denial. The commander denied that request. 45. The initial denial of my appeal was issued by Lieutenant General Marshall Webb, AETC Commander, and the reasons cited were that, although my beliefs are sincere, the Air Force's compelling government interest outweighs my individual beliefs and that there are no lesser means to satisfy the government's interests. Additionally, he stated that an exemption would undermine my authority and credibility as an officer, detracting from good order and discipline. 46. However, Lieutenant General Webb did not state that any consideration was given to the fact that the extreme measures needed to combat COVID-19 by AETC during its early stages were no longer required (i.e. maximum telework was no longer directed or required, occupancy limitations were no longer in effect, I have zero need to interact with Basic Military Training personnel, and I will never have to attend Professional Military Education again to successfully serve through retirement). Further, he did not consider my ability to socially distance within the 90 th Flying Training Squadron and successfully complete my duties (my current duties include working in the same spaces and interacting with the same personnel that I would be if I was accomplishing duties as an instructor pilot), he did not consider that there are zero stateside restrictions that would impact my ability to go on temporary duty, he did not consider the fact that I am not deployable as a PIT trainee or that I could opt-out of future deployments, he did not 61Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 65 of 153 PageID 162Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 65 of 153 PageID 162consider my natural immunity, he did not consider that \"herd immunity\" has been created in the 90th Flying Training Squadron with a 95.5% vaccination rate, and he did not consider my offer to continue to test weekly as a lesser restrictive means through retirement. 47. That same day, February 9, 2022, I was advised that I needed to meet with my commander the next day. When we met, I was issued formal notice that I was under a Commander Directed Investigation (\"CDI\"). The reasons for the CDI were that it was alleged I, with the intent to deceive, made a false official statement, to wit: proffering a doctor's memorandum reflecting an allergy to polyethylene glycol and polysorbate, which record was totally false, and then known by me to be false and that I feigned an allergy to the COVID-19 vaccine for the purpose of avoiding the mandatory COVID-19 vaccine. 48. At no time did I proffer a false doctor's memo and at no time did I feign an allergy to the COVID-19 vaccine for the purpose of avoiding the mandatory COVID-19 vaccine. Dr. Johnson has provided other service members with allergy testing that established the basis for such members' presently valid medical exemptions. For Reservists, the testing has been paid for by the DoD's TriCare Reserve Select insurance. 49. On February 11, 2022, my commander told me that once I appealed my RAR, I would no longer be eligible for a retirement option when the appeal is denied. 50. On February 14, 2022, I submitted my appeal to the Air Force Surgeon General. 51. On or about that same day, I met with the Investigating Officer for the CDI and gave a short statement regarding my visit with the allergy doctor. 62Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 66 of 153 PageID 163Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 66 of 153 PageID 16352. From February 15 until February 22, 2022, while on leave in Las Vegas to visit my wife and kids who had not yet moved to Texas, I met with a different allergy, asthma, and immunology doctor, Dr. Matt Morgan, who was a board-certified allergist, for a secondopinion on Dr. Johnson's allergy test. These confirmatory test results again reflected thatI tested positive for a reaction to polyethylene and polysorbate. 53. On March 21, 2022, my appeal to the Air Force Surgeon General was denied. It was clear that the March 1 DoD guidance that eliminates masking and other requirements forservice members, federal civilian workers, and contractors and also does not requirevaccination status to be a factor in the workplace was not considered as part of theSurgeon General's decision. Also, federal civilian worker and federal civilian contractorvaccination mandates were not and are still not presently in effect, and those individualsare permitted to work in close proximity with the vaccinated on a daily basis. I know ofone unvaccinated federal employee who I worked with daily during my time at Nelliswho continues to work in close proximity to active-duty Air Force officers and pilots. 54. After receiving my appeal denial, I was given five days to get a COVID-19 vaccine or face disciplinary action. 55. The reasons cited for the denial were that the government had a compelling government interest to vaccinate me and that there were no lesser restrictive means to accommodatemy request, specifically teleworking or maintaining adequate social distancing. 56. On March 23, 2022, I had a phone interview with an Air Force allergist to determine whether I had an allergy to the COVID-19 vaccines. I told him about the confirmatorytest results from Dr. Morgan, and he asked me to submit those as part of my Air Forcemedical records. I did so on or about March 28, 2022. 63Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 67 of 153 PageID 164Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 67 of 153 PageID 16457. On March 28, 2022, I was given the results of the CDI, which were heavily redacted. The results stated that I submitted a false official statement by submitting my record of testing from Dr. Alfred Johnson, D.O.; attempted to disobey a lawful order to receive themandatory COVID-19 vaccine; and committed an overt act by negligently feigning anallergy to components of the COVID-19 vaccine without proper medical testing orapproval. I was given two weeks to respond to the findings, so I worked with my AreaDefense Counsel (\"ADC\") and delivered a response on April 11, 2022. My responsereiterated my Christian beliefs, summarized my family's diverse medical history,explained my medical concerns and potential link to my daughter's MIS-C diagnosis, myexperience being made aware of CDC guidance about allergies to components of theCOVID-19 vaccines, and my experience and trust in Dr. Johnson's allergy testing. At nopoint did I ever intend to deceive, nor did I deceive, nor did I make a statement that Iknew to be false. Acknowledging my family's history of allergies, vaccine reactions, andhistory of autoimmune issues (specifically in my children), I sought out medical advicefrom an allergist so that I could be tested for the components of the COVID vaccine. Inever once tried to hide the fact that I was trying to see if I was allergic to the COVIDvaccine. 58. Additionally, the findings of the CDI determined that Dr. Alfred Johnson was not deemed a legitimate doctor by the Air Force. There was and is no evidence of this based on myown research. He is a doctor of internal medicine who received over a 4.0/5 rating online, he has a legitimate website, he is licensed to practice in three states, and he sat onthe Texas State Medical Board. There was no reason for me to believe that Dr. Johnson'stesting was fraudulent or not reliable, and before going to his office, I had no idea what 64Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 68 of 153 PageID 165Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 68 of 153 PageID 165my test results were going to be. Had they turned out negative, it would have alleviated the grave concern I had for my and my family's health. When the test results came back positive, I had no reason to disbelieve the test results and every reason to trust the test results, particularly since other service members have active medical exemptions based on Dr. Johnson's testing. I submitted the test results to my flight doctor, he accepted the results, and I received a medical exemption from taking the COVID vaccine. At every single step in these processes, I was always taking the legal method s and avenues that were available to me. 59. On April 7, 2022, a doctor at the San Antonio Military Medical Treatment Facility called me and let me know he reviewed Dr. Morgan's testing and results. He confirmed that everything was accomplished according to standard allergist care. We collectively decided that I should do in-person allergy testing at that military medical facility. An appointment was then made for May 12 and 13, 2022 for confirmatory allergy testing. 60. On May 2, 2022, I was given a Letter of Admonishment (\"LOA\") from my wing commander for attempting to disobey a direct order because I went to an out of network doctor (Dr. Johnson) who was deemed illegitimate by the Air Force and for seeking a medical exemption in January 2022 rather than September 2021. Specifically, my wing commander determined that my submission of the allergy test results from Dr. Johnson was an attempt to disobey the direct order to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. 61. On May 9, 2022, my ADC submitted my LOA response to my wing commander. 62. On May 11, 2022, I traveled to the San Antonio military facility for my third allergy test. While I had responses to polyethylene, the allergist there determined that I was not allergic and the recommendation was that I return the following day for a q uick follow up 65Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 69 of 153 PageID 166Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 69 of 153 PageID 166to receive the Pfizer vaccine with a 4-hour observation period post vaccine administration. 63. On May 13, 2022, I declined the Pfizer vaccine and, at that point under significant duress, let the San Antonio allergist know that I would consider the Johnson and Johnsonvaccine. Due to the military allergist witnessing my vasovagal syncope (a sudden drop inheart rate and blood pressure leading to fainting) during skin testing, he stated that Ishould find an allergist to administer the shot or a flight medicine doctor or clinic that isfamiliar with allergies and vasovagal syncope. I am advised to not go to a pharmacy toreceive a COVID-19 shot. 64. That same day, my ADC asked me to get a Memorandum for Record from the San Antonio military allergist memorializing that my visit with him was appropriate, giventhe results of my prior allergy test. The military allergist stated that his notes in mymedical records would be a more appropriate source document legitimizing my visit tothe San Antonio clinic. 65. On May 14, 2022, the pressure to get vaccinated continued to mount, and the stress was becoming unbearable. I informed my commander about the results of the San Antonioallergy test and that I was seriously considering getting the Johnson and Johnson shot. Iinformed him that the San Antonio allergist recommended that I receive the vaccine onlyfrom an allergist or doctor familiar with allergic reactions. However, I was unable to finda local allergist or clinic that would observe me and had the Johnson and Johnson vaccineavailable. 66. I informed my commander that I was unable to find an allergist to administer the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and he recommended that I just get the vaccine at a pharmacy and 66Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 70 of 153 PageID 167Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 70 of 153 PageID 167then drive to an allergist to be observed or hire an allergist to accompany me to the pharmacy. I looked through the CDC vaccine finder website for clinics that had experience with allergies and had the appropriate vaccine, I called the Sheppard Immunizations Clinic to see if they had the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, I called the local health district, and I called pharmacies that had the Johnson and Johnson vaccine to ask if they would sell me a vial of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine so I could bring it to an allergist, clinic, or my MTF for administration of the vaccination and subsequent observation, all to no avail. 67. On my drive home from work that day, my commander called me and suggested that I should be careful where I get the vaccine and that the establishment should be \"abovereproach,\" like a CVS or Walgreens. He stated that he had conversations with some folksand that I needed to be careful on where I got the vaccine (so that the establishmentwould not be questioned). This advice on going to a pharmacy like CVS or Walgreenswas completely contrary to the San Antonio allergist's recommendations. 68. At this point, I felt hopeless and like I had zero options left and that I had no choice but to violate my sincerely held religious beliefs and receive the vaccine. I felt it was the onlyway I could keep my job and continue to provide for my family and to be able to supportthem in the future. I immediately started praying for forgiveness and for protection forboth myself and my family. 69. On May 17, 2022, my ADC sent my wing commander the San Antonio allergist's notes confirming that I had a valid reason for the visit and the follow-up allergy testing. MyADC then informed me that the wing commander was planning on upholding my LOA 67Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 71 of 153 PageID 168Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 71 of 153 PageID 168and that the Staff Judge Advocate (the wing commander's legal advisor) stated that \"it wouldn't hurt\" my chances of the LOA being rescinded if I were to receive the vaccine. 70. I then received multiple texts and a call from my commander asking if I got the vaccine. I told him that I had until close of business on May 18, 2022, to receive it, but he told meI must get it first thing in the morning on May 18 to not jeopardize the 5-day timeline. Iwas still very troubled by having to violate my sincerely held beliefs and the addedpressure of having to get the vaccine the following morning was overwhelming. 71. On May 19, 2022, my commander sent me a text message asking me if there are any vaccines available overseas that meet my religious concerns. I was not aware of any ofthe top of my head, but told him I would look into the World Health Organizationapproved vaccine lists. I found one vaccine, COVAXIN, available in India, that (basedon limited research) looked as though it might meet my religious concerns andcommunicated that to my commander via text message. He d id not respond. 72. On May 23, 2022, my commander issued me a Letter of Counseling (\"LOC\") stating that I am expected to comply with the order directing me to get the COVID-19 vaccine nowthat my appeal has been denied, that my unwillingness to follow orders is an act ofinsubordination, and that any future misconduct may result in more severe action toinclude administrative actions and involuntary separation, which I can be subject to atany given moment from this day forward. In fact, I suspect that involuntary separationwill be the next step my commander will take since he has punished a fellow airman inthis manner for also refusing the COVID-19 vaccine. During the meeting with mycommander while receiving the LOC, he ask ed if I had thought about the overseas vaccine option. I told him that I did not know what he meant by that statement because he 68Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 72 of 153 PageID 169Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 72 of 153 PageID 169had only asked me if there were any available overseas that met my religious requirements. He asked if I knew a certain captain in the 80 th Flying Training Wing. I did not, but my commander told me to look him up and call him as soon as possible. My commander then stated that I must make the decision about the overseas vaccine option without delay. I clarified that if I chose to travel for a vaccine, that it would be self-funded, and he affirmed. After the LOC issuance, I made a few phone calls to people I work with on base to inquire about this captain. I learn ed that his commander offered and granted him Permissive Temporary Duty (where the member does not need to take time off, but the government does not fund the trip) to travel to India to receive the COVAXIN vaccine. He is now deemed in compliance with the vaccine mandate. 73. Having a LOA and LOC on my record has already significantly impacted my ability to attend future professional military education opportunities and my opportunity to promote to Colonel, thereby depriving the Air Force of a leader with impeccable character and demonstrated leadership ability. 74. While I have been mentally distraught over having to decide between my career, being able to provide for my family of eight on only my income, and violating my sincerely held religious beliefs, I have made the difficult decision to hold true to my faith and not receive a COVID-19 vaccine. My family has been under unimaginable stress and mental anguish throughout this entire process. I have had to constantly defend my faith, while still working in an environment and around the same people (all-the-while remaining healthy and free of COVID-19). Further, I had to defend my integrity and credibility as a Christian, officer, father, husband, and human being for seeking a legal process to validate my immense medical concerns for myself and family. Every single day is filled 69Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 73 of 153 PageID 170Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 73 of 153 PageID 170with stress due to the unpredictable and punitive nature of seeking a religious and medical accommodation from the COVID-19 vaccine while trying to figure out and manage my family's future. 75. Further, I have been grounded and unable to fly or complete my instructor training since October 2021. I cannot get flight hours necessary for me to seek employment with theairlines should I be administratively separated from the Air Force. I will not receive apaycheck should I be kicked out (we are a single income family that relies on my incometo survive - my wife is a stay-at-home mom who homeschools our six children) and willnot have access to other benefits, such as healthcare. I will be unable to complete myremaining 4 years of service and receive retirement income should I be kicked out\u2014thisequates to about $3 million in income should I live until the normal life expectancy in theUnited States. Should I receive anything other than an honorable discharge, I will losethe GI bill that I transferred to my daughter. Additionally, I am eligible for retentionbonuses this year that would equate to between $105K and $140K given I serve through20 years of service; I will be unable to receive this should I be kicked out. 76. Without immediate relief, I am facing further adverse administrative actions, and the imminent likelihood of involuntary separation. These actions will undoubtedly put an end to my career, will have a significant impact on my ability to send my 18 -year-old daughter to college later this year, and will eliminate any chance of seeking retentionbonuses or a retirement income. Should a bad conduct code be added to my DD214 uponseparation, as is happening across the DOD, it would affect my ability to garner anymeaningful employment outside of the military. Only immediate injunctive relief at thispoint can stop the progression of these real harms from happening. 70Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 74 of 153 PageID 171Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 74 of 153 PageID 171 I declare (or certify, verity, or state) under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

I have been assigned to that office since November 1, 2015 . 6.On August 24, 2021, the Secretary of Defense issued a mandate for all members of the Armed Forces under Department of Defense authority on active duty or in the Ready Reserve, including the Nati onal Guard, to immediately begin full vaccination against COVID -19. 7.On September 3, 2021, the Secretary of the Air Force issued a similar mandate (\"COVID -19 Vaccine Mandate\") requiring that commanders in the Air Force take all steps necessary to ensure all uniformed Airmen and Guardians receive d the COVID -19 vaccine, which include d issuing unit -wide and individual orders to their military members. 74Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 78 of 153 PageID 175Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 78 of 153 PageID 1758.On October 7, 2021 , my commander issued me an order to receive the COVID -19 vaccine. 9.In response to the COVID -19 Vaccine Mandate, service members were permitted to submit a request for either a religious or medical exemption. 10.On October 24, 2021 , I submitted a Religious Accommodation Request (\"RAR\") to be exempted from the COVID -19 vaccine requirement. 11.In my RAR, I explained my sincerely held religious objection to receiving medication that was developed with the aid of aborted fetal cells . I also explained my sincere belief that my body is a temple unto the Lord, and that I should refrain from injecting substanc es into it that might compromise my body . 12.As a requirement of the RAR process, on November 8, 2021 , I was interviewed by the Ramstein Air Force Base chaplain regarding my sincerely held religious beliefs. 13.On November 8 , 2021, the chaplain determined that my religious beliefs were sincere and that my beliefs would be substantially burdened if I was required to take a COVID -19 vaccine . The chaplain rep ort noted that my broader theological convictions are consistent with my system of belief. He went on to underscore my position that, if there were not a \"morally dubious\" vaccine, I would be open to receiving the vaccine. 14.As an additional requirement of the RAR process, on November 5, 2021 , I was counseled by Philip Oro, M D of the 86 th Medical Group about the risks of not being vaccinated and becoming ill with COVID -19. 15.On October 29, 2021 , I was counseled by my commander that noncompliance with immunizat ion requirements may adversely affect readiness for deployment, assignment, international travel, or result in other administrative consequences. \"Administrative 75Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 79 of 153 PageID 176Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 79 of 153 PageID 176consequences\" include non -judicial punishment, which, if received, would detrimentally impact my career and retirement benefits which I have earned . 16.On December 7, 2021 I received a memo from my commander listing alternative vaccines which are WHO -approve d, not FDA -approved and which do not carry Emergency Use Authorization. This memo in quired as to my willingness or unwillingness to accept any of these alternatives to those available in the United St ates. As was within m y rights, I declined to make what I saw as a commitment to take a foreign alternative which I knew nothing about. Furthermore, as a career c ivilian pilot, the Federal Aviation A dministration (FAA) makes mention only of the t hree Covid -19 shots available in the US and does not appear to have reviewed those foreign alternative vaccines . By taking one, I may be putting my FAA Medical Certificate in je opardy. 17.Furthermore, it is contradictory that the Air Force is willing to subject me to a foreign product which has n ot been tested and approved by the US gov ernment, while at the same time discounting the natural immunity to Covid -19 which I have attained after having recover ed from the illness in January of 2022 , and for which I can provide documentation . 18.On December 12, 2021 I sent my commander an addendum letter to General Harrigian in which I further de tailed the traumatic memories my family and I had been forced to relive by th e Air Force 's process f or Religious Accommodation . In that me mo I further offered a way forward, namely to perform my duties one last time from Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio, TX and then to retire on January 1, 2023. 19.As explained more fully below, I am at the end of a 20 -year career with the Air Force \u2014 my anniversary is December 20, 2022. Receipt of an administrative action is a terrible 76Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 80 of 153 PageID 177Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 80 of 153 PageID 177way of ending my career a mere several months before the end. It would taint my spotless service record, which is something that no amount of money can rectify . Additionally, I believe that, in accordance with a December 7, 2021 , memorandum from the Secretary of the Air Force, my command is refusing to act on my application for retirement , which is set for January 1 , 2023 , until I receive the vaccine. 20.Since COVID -19 mitigation measures were put into effect in March of 2020, there have been no interruptions to my job duties or my job performance. I n fact, I successfully carried out my unit's mission on a mostly remote basis and at no time was there an impact to the mission as a result of COVID -19. 21.From March of 2020 until most recently , my job duties included classified intelligence review and providing analysis to my command. My assigned duty station has remained Ramstein Air Force Base and I have performed my duties remotely from Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio Texas in o rder to support my unit of assignment's mission. 22.After submitting my RAR on October 24, 2021 , on March 2, 2022 , I received the initial denial of my RAR. 23.The denial was issued by Gen. Jeffrey Harrigian and the reasons cited were that my remote working sol ution was not a \"long -term solution\" and that my refusal to obtain a vaccine would place Department of Defense (\"DoD\") personnel at risk . 24.However, Gen. Harrigian's decision did not state that any consider ation was given to my addendum memorandum dated December 12, 2021. In that memorandum, I detail, at length, the trauma my family faced due to loss of pregnancy and how abortion personally affects deeply held religious conviction . The decision also did not consider and the March 1 , 2022 , DoD guidance that eliminates masking and other requirements for service 77Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 81 of 153 PageID 178Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 81 of 153 PageID 178members, federal civilian workers, and contractors and also does not require vaccination status to be a factor in the workplace. Also , the federal civilian worker and federal civilian contractor v accination mandates are not presently in effect and that those individuals are permitted to work in close proximity with me on a regular basis in the physical context s referenced by Gen. Harrigian's decision . Furthermore, as stated above, I am able to provide documentation of Covid -19 Antibodies due to having had Covid -19 in January 2022. 25.On March 8, 2022 , I submitted my appeal to the DAF Surgeon General. 26.On April 10, 2022 , my appeal was denied , and I was advised of its denial on April 22, 2022. I was then ordered to begin the Covid -19 vaccine regimen within one week or submit for voluntary separation from the Air Force. I was further advised that per Secretary of the Air Force guidance, if a membe r chooses to retire, that member must retire no later than the first day of the fifth month following their final denial of a religious accommodation. Therefore, since my request for retirement falls outside of this timeline, I am ineligible to retire and must either take the vaccine in violation of my sincerely held religious beliefs or request voluntary separation rather than retirement. 27.The reasons cited for the denial were that my non -vaccinated status would prevent the Air Force from effectively le veraging me and that remote work would not be an acceptable solution. 28.On April 29, 2022, I submitted a request for reconsideration as my circumstances had changed . After I submitted my exemption requests, and before I received my final denial, I completed my full -service requirement to satisfy a \"good year\" per the Air Force Reserve and I have a pending retirement application. The practical consequence of this is 78Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 82 of 153 PageID 179Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 82 of 153 PageID 179that I have alleviated all of the concerns outlined in the initial denial of my exemption requests: 1) I have already completed my retirement requirements, and 2) I have already completed my last day in uniform. I now simply require an accommodation to reach my 20th year of service on December 20, 2022 , and retire on January 1, 2023. 29.This process has caused me to be immense ly mentally and emotionally distraught . As outlined in my addendum to my initial application, this ordeal has forced me to relive painful memories from my early childhood. By being forced to choose between my career and the vaccine, I am being forced to relieve these memories for which no amount of money can make me whole. 30.My commander has indicated to me that the Air Force will process a Letter of Reprimand against me and that it will be delivered to my file soon , which means I could receive it today . This could have a detrimental effect to both my career and retirement. 31.Without immediate relief, I am fac ing irreparable harms . Receiving administrative action (Letter of Reprimand) in contravention of my constitutional rights is not something that can be rectified later with money. If I were to receive the vaccine to stop the Letter of Reprimand from hitti ng my file, then I have taken an action that cannot be undone, and it would have been a functionally -compelled action in violation of my sincerely held religious belief. In addition, reliving, and continuing to relive the trauma of my childhood due to this ordeal is not something that can be rectified later or rectified with funds. 32.In fact, I have already faced the harms that come from extreme mental and emotional anguish, and the burden of having to choose between saving a distinguished twenty -year 79Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 83 of 153 PageID 180Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 83 of 153 PageID 180military career or violating my sincerely held religious belief.

On September 24, 2021, my commander issued me an order to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. 10. In response to the COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate , service members were permitted to submit a request for either a religious or medical exemption. 11. On October 12, 2021 , I submitted a Religious Accommodation Request (\"RAR \") to be exempted from the COVID-19 vaccine requirement. 12. In my RAR , I explained that my religious beliefs include eating clean meat in accordance with Leviticus 11, keeping the commandments of God per 1 Corinthians 7: 19 and Revelation 14:12 , and the sancity of human life. Other applicable beliefs I referenced included , \"Be Holy because I am Holy\" from Leviticus 11 :44 and 1 Peter 1: 15-16 which relates to not eating unclean animals , keeping the Sabbath and loving our brothers and avoiding sorcery among other things. I explained 2 Corinthians 6: 17 says , \"Come out from them be separate , says the Lord. Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you ... let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit , perfecting holiness out ofreverence for God. \" I explained I believe that our \"bodies are the Temples of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6: 19)\" and we are directed to \"be Holy because I [the Lord] am Holy\" ( 1 Peter 1 : 16) which draws from Leviticus 11 :44 ( clean and unclean foods) , Leviticus 19:2 (keeping the Sabbath and various rules towards loving your brother as yourself), Leviticus 20:7 Uudg , ment towards persons that seek mediums and spiritists). I explained I believe we are \"fearfully and wonderfully made (Psalm 139:14) \" in \"the image of God (Genesis 9:6)\" and our bodies are \"temples of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6: 19).\" Thus, we should not do harm to our bodies and souls by intentionally ingesting or injecting unclean foods/animal cells, aborted fetal cells, gelatins from pigs or other unclean animal cells, or known toxins among other things. I explained it is my 92Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 96 of 153 PageID 193Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 96 of 153 PageID 193belief that the COVID-19 vaccines contain some or all of these unclean things , and it is my belief that receiving the COVID-19 vaccines would be unholy and desecrate my body as a temple of the Holy Spirit. 13. In my RAR 1 explained that on the mornin g of September 6, 2020, while I was in Colorado hunting with my father, I was startled awake from a dream. I began praying and the interpret ation of the dream from the Holy Spirit was, \"They are going to force unclean things on you.\" Dreams are consistent with my faith as Joel 2:28 states , \"it will come to pass that I will pour out My Spirit on all mankind ; and your sons and daughters will prophesy , your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions. \" explained I believe that this dream and its interpretation applies to the COVID-19 vacc inations and is a command from God that I am not to receive the vaccinations. 14. In my RAR, I explained that l believ e that injecting unnatura l substances such as ( 4- hydroxybutyl)a zanediyl)bis(hexane-6 , -diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate ), as well as a man- made mRNA coded particle have both negative spiritual and physical implications. The spiritual consequences, while not visible, are significant and can manifest into our physical lives. I explained I belie ve violating the g uidance of the Holy Spirit by receiving the COVID-19 vaccines would be to separate myself from the Lord's will and walk in violation of His will for my life. This is important because Jesus warns us that, \"Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord , Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven will enter (Matthew 7:21).\" Thus, ifl do not do the Father's will, I may be excluded from the promise. I explained this spiritual act of disobedience manifests itself in the physical world as Paul describes to the disobedient church at Corinth, \"For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and many have fallen asleep [in death] (1 Corinthians 1 I :30).\" Thus , accepting this vaccine is both 93Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 97 of 153 PageID 194Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 97 of 153 PageID 194spiritually and physically uncle an and sinfu l to me, a clear violation of God's Word , a violation of my conscience and my sincerely held religious belief. 15. As a requirement of the RAR process, on September 8, 2021, and October 4, 2021 , I was interviewed by the Vance Air Force Base chap lain regarding my sincerely held religious beliefs. 16. On Octobe r 4, 2021, the chap lain determined that my religious beliefs were sincere and that my belief s would be substantia lly burdened if I was required to take a COV ID-19 vaccine. He also determined I would be sinning against God if I were to receive the currently available COVID-19 vaccines and recommended that I be granted a religious accommodation waiver from having to receive the COVID -19 vacc ination . 17. As an additiona l requirement of the RAR process, on September 29, 2021 , I was counseled by Major Alyssa Turner , USAF, NC, Aeromedica l Nurse Practitioner, Vance Air Force Base, about the risks of not being vaccinated and becoming ill with COV ID-19. 18. On September 29, 2021, I was counseled by my commander that noncompliance with immuni zatio n requirements mr.f adverse ly affect readiness for deployment , assignmen t, international travel , or result in other administrative consequences. \"Administrative conseque nces\" include written counseling and adm inistrat ive separation, which , if received, would detrimentally impact my career. Noncompliance could also result in nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice . This is where the commander offers to issue a service member punishment subject to the member 's consent to be tried exclusively by the commander. As part of this process , alternatively, the member could tw-n down this offer and elect to be tried by court- martial. 94Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 98 of 153 PageID 195Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 98 of 153 PageID 19519. Since COVID-19 mitigatio n measures were put into effect in March of 2020, my vaccination status did not prevent me from continuin g to exec ute the miss ion to train pilots or support the Air Forc e Reserves in that end ,-:avor. Since March of 2020 , I have flown 35 I sorties which totaled to 497 flight hours and provided approx imately 684 hours of instructi on to s tudent pilots in trainin g. Addit ionally, I have carried out my primary duties within my squadron by writing numerou s orders for 1 2 traditional reservists and ensured travel vouchers were comp leted, leave was processed, awards and perfo rmance evaluations were written , a ch ange of command was planned down to individuals seats and other nuanced duties of daily operat ions. The re have been no interrupt ions to my job duties or my job performance throughout this time . In fact, I successfully carried out my urut's mission and at no time was there an impac t to the mission as a result of COVID-19 . 20. In Marc h of 2020 until October 2020, my job duties included teaching princip les of flying and evaluating overall stude nt performance and training as a T-6 IP. In October of 2020, I became part of Squadron leader ship as Assistant Flight Command er and assist the flights 16 reserve T-6 IPs in support of the mission. My purpose is to lead, mentor, & evaluate flight members. Addit ionally, I ensure their operational, administrative, personnel and training issues with the reserve system are taken care of along with their day-to-d ay order and pay issues are resolved. 21. Presently, my job duties include all the aforementioned Assistant Flight Commander duties minu s being an Instructor Pilot due to th e fact that I have been suspended from aviation dutie s. 22. After submit ting my final RAR docum ents on Octobe r 7, 2021, on January 7, 2022, I received the initial de nial of my RAR. I was offic ially notified of the denial on January 9, 2022. 95Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 99 of 153 PageID 196Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 99 of 153 PageID 19623. The denial was issued by Lieutenant General Richard W. Scobee , USAF, Commander Air Force Reserve Command , and the reason cited was mission accomplishment, specifically the health , safety, and readiness of the force. 24. However , Lieutenant General Scobee did not address or attempt to rationalize the 2 pilots within my unit that have the same potential to impact mission success but are medicall y exempt from taking the COVID- 19 vaccine and can still perform flying duties. There was never a requirement, to my knowledge , that they would be required to submit documents and rationale for how many people they came in contact with on a daily basis or meetings that they would attend or teleworking because the risk was too high for the vaccinated to be in there presence. Furthermore , the base and flying squadrons have both gove rnment civilian employees and contractors working among the same offices and buildings with unknown immunity status . The same threat to spread and infection exists among those employees , however , it was not even addressed in General Scobee ' s denial letter. 25. On January I 4, 2022 , I submitted my appeal to the Air Force Surgeon General. In my appeal I explained I have personally recovered from the SARS-COV-2 virus (a mild case with no lasting effects), as evidenced by two serological tests taken one year apart, dated October 20, 2020 and October 12, 2021. Results from the first sero logical test are in my official medical record . 26. On March 31, 2022 , my appea l was denied . On April 15, 2022, Lieutenant Colonel Marcus D. Hutson , Commander 5th Flying Training Squadron, ordered me to receive an initial dose of a COV ID-1 9 vaccine and provide proof of same by April 20, 2022 . 27-The reasons cited for the denial of my appeal were prevention of the spread of disease among the force ; that my present duty assignment requires interm ittent to frequent contact with others and is not fully achievab le via telework or adequa te distancing ; that 96Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 100 of 153 PageID 197Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 100 of 153 PageID 197my required in-person meeting attendance includes prolonged , intermittent contact with multiple individuals ; that my instructor role requires frequent contact and immersion with multiple individuals, which would significan tly impact training accomp lishment if I, my trainees , or my fellow instructors were exposed or active ly infected; that my status as a non-imm unized individual , aggregated with other non-immuni zed individuals in steady state operations, would place health and safety, unit cohesion, and readiness at risk; and that foregoing the immuni zation requirem ent woukl have a real adverse impact on military readiness and public health and safety . The denial did not state that any cons ideration was given to the natural immunity I acquired by contracting and recovering from the SARS-COV-2 virus. 28. While I have been mentally distraught over having to decide between my career, providing for my family of six and violating my since rely held religious beliefs , I made the difficult decision to hold true to my faith and what the Lord has warned me that I should not receive a COV ID-19 vaccine. Throughout this ordeal I have lost hour s of sleep and quality time with my fami ly writing, researching and reading everything I can find on the subject voraciously. I have loathed putting by uniform on and going to work to do a job I used to find fulfilling. The entire religious accommodat ion process has felt like a futile effort and waste of man-hours leading to the almost certain conc lusion where I am denied a religious accommodatio n with mere quotations of mere regulations rather than using the actual gravity of the situation . Through all this, however , my faith and Jesus and God ' s will for me remains. The Lord is good and has a plan for me and my family and my hope is not in this document , a religious accommodat ion process , a general, an el ection, a politician or a judge. My hope is in the Lord because His people are His portion and His delight. 97Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 101 of 153 PageID 198Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 101 of 153 PageID 19829. As a result of not takin g the vacc ine, on April 21, 2022 , I was suspe nded from aviation service and my flight incenti ve pay and dutie s were suspen ded. My aviation incentive pay amounts to ($1,000) per month . My Aviation Retention Bonus amounts to ($2,917) per month . I was later notified via a memo from my Commande r on May 4th citing AFMAN 11-402 paragraph 6.2.2.4 for the suspens ion. This reference directs commanders to suspend aviati (n service for Involuntar y Discharge proceedings . However , I emai led and explained to my Commander that this reference was not appropr iate since I am technically not being Involuntarily Discharged . If that were the case, then I should receive due process and be provided a Board of Inquiry to prese nt my case for retention . After another individua l broug ht up this issue , my commander notified me via a m emo on May 9th that the reason for my suspension had changed to paragraph 6.2.2.5. This paragraph states that a member should be suspended from aviation service when there are pending Uniform Code of Military Justice (\"UCMJ\" ) actions. However , I have not been notified of any \"pending \" UCMJ actions , Article 15' s or investigations. Ultimately, they are n ot following the regulation on the subject , and I have submitt ed an Inspector G,neral comp laint asking that they reinstate my aerona utical order and aviat ion pay based on the regulation. 30. It is my understanding that a Letter of Reprimand has been written for me, is being reviewed by the 22nd AF Commander, and will be delivered and placed in my permanent personnel file within the next few weeks , which guarantees I will not be promoted. I was also removed from my duties as an Instructor Pilot and presen tly do all the required office , meetings and paperwork as the Assistant Flight Commander. 31. Currently , I am awaiting a Letter of Reprimand within a week or two for not receiv ino c:, the COVID -19 vaccine. The Letter of Reprimand will be untimel y due to a Promotion 98Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 102 of 153 PageID 199Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 102 of 153 PageID 199Board that my record is about to go to in June for consideration for the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. Add ition ally, my Squadro n Comma nder wld me that 1 was ranked last against my peers withjn the squadron instead of 211d or 3rd (out of 5) because my Appea l to the denied RAR was not likely to succeed. The Operations Group Comma nder , that is one tier in the chajn of command above my squadron commander, deemed that the overall recommendation of \"Definitely Promote \" be taken from me and given to another person more deserving because the Letter of Reprimand is pending. However , I have not received the Letter of Reprimand or been given an opportunity to make a rebuttal. If I were to receive a Letter of Reprimand at this point , an Unfavorab le Information File will be established with in my official record containing the Letter of Reprimand and I will not promote. If by chance , I do not receive the LOR until after the Promotion Board , my Commander told me, that it is possible that the Pro,notion Board 's recommendation for Lieute nant Colonel will be rescinded and that I would not be able to assume the rank. While an LOR and losing rank is likely a career -killer, the ultimate harm will be the process to curtai l (i.e. cancel) my AGR orders that will imm ediately follow. I will lose my position in the unit of which there are only 5 AGR positions that I could fill at the rank of Major and 4 other AGR positions that I could fill as a Lieutenant Colo nel. However, the Lieutenant Colonel positions are for progression and leadership usually picked from the service member s in the position filled by Majors . The Major positions tend to fill quickly and stay filled for 3 or 4 years w1til they move into a Lieutenant Colonel position making it difficult to reacquire a position after I have been removed from it. Or, I have been passed over for the positio:. because I have falle n out of favo r. More irnpo1tantly , however , I will lose my primary source of income and my health insurance.

The other individual is cu rrently n ot able to go on Temporary Duty trips unless they are d eemed essen tial. Both of these service members brief in and attend packed st aff meeting offices where social distancing is not even feasible. 33. My Lieutenant Colonel Prom otion board is scheduled for June. Without imm ediate relief, a Le tter of Repr imand will be placed in my perso nnel file and will ensure I am not prom oted. I was also told by my Command er, that an L OR after my p romo tion boar d could r esult in the promoti on be ing rescinded. Additi onally, I h ave submi tted an application for a Lieutenant Colonel A ctive Guard Reserve position w ithin my w1it.

I am currently serving in the 5th Flight Training Squadron at Vance Air Force Base (\" AFB \") in Enid, Oklahoma. I am a Traditional Reservist, meaning that I am not full time in the Air Force Reserve , and I have always maintained a civilian job for the past 20 years, in addition to my military service. I am currently employed as a commercial airline pilot fo r United Airlines on the Boeing 737. 4.United Airlines granted my request for a religious accommodation, and I am currently attending training to become a Captain for United Airlines on the Boeing 737 . Unfortunately , I am being distracted from my airline training on a daily basis by the current threat of losing my Air Force career and retirement. 5.My military career began on February 27, 2001, when I was enlisted in the Maryland Air National Guard . On April 26, 2002 , I received my commission as a 2nd Lieutenant , and served as a Pilot on the C -130J. I was activated and placed on active -duty orders for both Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, where I deployed on five combat rotations in theater during three different theatres of oper ation . I have flown the C-130J to over 47 countries. I was qualified as an Aircraft Commander, which is the civilian equivalent of the \"Pilot In Command\" or the equivalent of an Airline Captain.

I transferred from the Maryland Air National Guard to the U.S. Air Force Reserve and attended Pilot Instructor Training and became a T -6 Instructor Pilot at Vance AFB in Enid, Oklahoma. 9.At no time during my career have I received any form of punishment or reprimand, other than the punishment I will now face as a result of the Air Force's COVID -19 vaccination requirement, which is explained in more detail below. 10.I have served honorably for over 21 years, and I will contin ue to do so, God willing. Throughout my career, I deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, and participated in numerous humanitarian assistance/disaster relief missions, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , flying to the gulf coast within hours of the storm. I have ac crued over 13 years of Active - Duty Service points towards my retirement, during my 21 years of Guard and Reserve service.Authentisign ID: 6C66903A-9FDC-EC11-B656-501AC586DF9D 105 Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 109 of 153 PageID 206Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 109 of 153 PageID 20611. As a T -6 Instructor Pilot in the Air Force Reserve, I am required to work a minimum of 6 days a month , 72 days a year, in addition to my United Airlines schedule. I typically work a minimum of 20 to 24 days a month in total between my flying with United Airlines and my Air Force Reserve service commitment. 12. On August 24, 2021, the Secretary of Defense issued a mandate for all members of t he Armed Forces under Department of Defense authority on active duty or in the Ready Reserve, including the National Guard, to immediately begin full vaccination against COVID -19. 13. On September 3, 2021, the Secretary of the Air Force issued a similar mandat e (\"COVID -19 Vaccine Mandate\") requiring that commanders in the Air Force take all steps necessary to ensure all uniformed Airmen and Guardians received the COVID -19 vaccine, which included issuing unit -wide and individual orders to their military members. 14. I was initially ordered by my Squadron Commander to receive a COVID -19 vaccine on September 28, 20 21, following the August 24, 2021 , Secretary of Defense issued a mandate for all members of the Armed Forces under Department of Defense authority on active duty or in the Ready Reserve, including the National Guard, to immediately begin full vaccination against COVID -19. 15. On October 1, 2021, I submitted a Religious Accommodation Request (\"RAR\") to be exempted from the COVID -19 vaccine requirement. 16. In my RAR, I explained that I am a Christian and a member of the Roman Catholic Church, that I believe my body is a temple to the Holy Spirit, that life is sacred at all stages (starting at conception) and that using a vaccine that was tested using aborted fetal Authentisign ID: 6C66903A-9FDC-EC11-B656-501AC586DF9D 106 Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 110 of 153 PageID 207Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 110 of 153 PageID 207cells is repugnant to my religion, that blood is sacred and that it is against my faith to inject my blood with DNA -altering materials. Also, I explained that I had already contracted COVID in April of 2020 and that I had natural immunity, thereby allowing me to safely perform my job without a vaccination (as I had done for 19 months before I was ordered to receive the vaccine). 17. As a requirement of the RAR process, on October 13, 2021, I was interviewed by the Vance Air Force base chaplain regarding my sincerely held religious beliefs. 18. On October 14, 2021, the chaplain determined that my religious beliefs were sincere and that my beliefs would be substantially burdened if I was required to take a COVID -19 vaccine. 19. As an additional requiremen t of the RAR process, on October 1, 202 1, I was counseled by Captain Andrew Carey, Flight Surgeon at Vance Air Force Base about the risks of not being vaccinated and becoming ill with COVID -19. 20. On October 1, 2021, I was counseled by my commander, and in hi s memorandum he stated that, \"...noncompliance with immunization requirements may adversely affect assignment, international travel, or result in other administrative consequences.\" \"Administrative consequences\" include written counseling and administrative separation, which, if received, would detrimentally impact my career. Noncompliance could also result in nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. This is where the commander offers to issue a service member punish ment subject to the member's consent to be tried exclusively by the commander. As part of this process, alternatively, the member could turn down this offer and elect to be tried by court -martial.

Receipt of administrative action or nonjudicial punishment would be detrimental to my career. I am two years away from a full retirement that I wish to complete. Voluntarily retiring now would negatively impact my family's financial position. If I do not acquiesce and retire now, I will be placed in the Inacti ve Ready Reserve (\"IRR\") where I am no longer allowed to purchase Tri -Care for my family's medical needs or have access to other military benefits . 22. On January 13, 2022 , I received an initial denial Memorandum stating that Lieutenant General Scobee, the Air Force Reserve Command Commander , had denied my RAR and that I had until January 15, 2022 to appeal or receive my vaccination within 5 days. Specifically, the Memorandum stated, \"since less restrictive means of protecting our force from COVID -19 are unav ailable, all uniformed Airmen must be fully vaccinated against COVID -19 and other infectious diseases.\" 23. However, General Scobee and his team did not state that any consideration was given to my natural immunity (note that I had tested positive for antibodi es as recently as January 15, 2022, without a second illness) and my ability to have successfully executed my mission for the past 19 months without a vaccine as I stated in my initial RAR and subsequent appeal. 24. I appealed the initial denial on January 15, 2022. 25. After I submitted my appeal , there have bee n increases in restrictions to the duty I am allowed to perform. As of March 2022, unvaccinated members of my squadron are no longer allowed to perform temporary duty assignments , despite the fact that we have been traveling off station to accomplish necessary flight training operations for the past 24 months without issue.

This provid es real world, first-hand experience for Air Force Students at busy Civilian Air Traffic Control locations other than Vance, AFB. Typical travel includes travel to states within a 7 00 mile radius from Enid, Oklahoma. I believe that this type of duty is being taken away because it is viewed as a \"good deal\" by Air Force management. Flying student sorties to other locations allows us to instruct students , while flying to other locations such as Albuquerque NM, Denver, CO, Texas, New Orleans LA, Destin FL, and a variety of other locations that are more desirable to visit than Enid, OK. Th ese overnight trips are an added perk of instructing in the T -6 that makes the job desirable and the Air Force is restricting this . This TDY policy is inconsistent because we are still allowed to do day trips to other locations for training, but we are required to return to Vance the same day. I recently flew to Santa Fe, NM to pick up a T-6 aircraft and return the same day. This TDY order restriction is clearly not a health and safety requirement and is retaliatory and discriminatory . 26.TDY and duties that involve travel c an also include special duty assignments. Two recent job opportunities that I w ould have applied for required travel to Georgia or Texas. However, I was told that I am not allowed to be considered because of my vaccination status . 27.As of March 22, 2022 , extended Active -Duty Orders for unvaccinated reservists have been severely limited in my squadron. I am no longer being permitted to serve on additional active -duty tours of over 30 days due to my unvaccinated status, which is discriminatory treatme nt because orders longer than 30 days include additional special pays and benefits that I will not receive if I perform duty for 29 days.Authentisign ID: 6C66903A-9FDC-EC11-B656-501AC586DF9D 109 Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 113 of 153 PageID 210Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 113 of 153 PageID 21028. Since October 1, 2021, I served on two different sets of full-time orders , (November 5, 2021 to December 2 6, 2021 and February 6, 2022 to March 25, 2022) totaling over 92 days of active duty so far this year , which is in addition to my normal reserve duty 72-day requirement . These orders required serving at Vance AFB as a full time T -6 Instructor Pilot . Because of the March 2022 policy change limiting my duty time to 29 consecutive days, I will only be allowed to serve on orders that are 29 days or less doing the exact same job. This is signific ant to me financially because active -duty orders must be over 30 days or more in order to receive full active duty pay and benefits (described below) . 29. In a March 22nd, 2022 email from the 5 th Flight Training Squadron Director of Operations in my squadron , Lieutenant Colonel Ian Bass, to our flight commanders outlining this new policy, he stated: \"Unvaccinated members may accomplish MPA and strings of MPA that DO NOT require a COW (Continuous Orders Worksheet) , orders must be 29 days or less. ...Unfortunately, this means that a member will have to work all weekends and federal holidays, will not accrue leave, will not be eligible for TRICARE Prime, and will only get Type 2 BAH. Please make sure that your member is aware of this before they sign up for this plan.\" BAH stands for Base Housing Allowance and BAH 2 is worth approximately 60% of full time BAH 1 if we are on long term orders. This coercive policy is retribution for not receiving the COVID -19 vaccine , as it is only for unvaccinated memb ers and has no bearing on our mission effectiveness other than to punish us financially. Prior to my final RAR denial by the Surgeon General, I was still allowed to come in on short tours of active duty and perform the same duties. 30. The loss of long-term orders over 30 days amounts to a loss of approximately a $500 per month difference between BAH Type I and reduced BAH Type II (housing allowance ).

In addition to weekends off, members also earn 2.5 days of paid annual leave per month of long -term orders . Full-time members are entitled to \"Tricare Prime \" health insurance coverage which is free to the member, which is an additional saving s me of over $3 00 per month as a family of six . 31. I am aware of two members in my 5FTS squadron that have received Medical Exemptions to the COVID -19 shot requirement . Both of these members are on long term orders and I know both of them personally. The first individual has a previous history in her medical record of allergic reactions to previous vaccinations. To my knowledge, she did not request a RAR , but she did tell me personally that her Medical Exemption was approved. She is a Delta Airlines Pilot on military leave and is currently on full -time orders at the 5FTS. She does not want to be highlighted for fear of having her exemption cancelled. She is not allo wed to conduct any TDY travel. 32. The other member also did not submit a RAR, but requested a Medical Exemption due to proof of past infection from COVID -19 in November of 2021. According to Air Force regulation AFI 48 -110, members are exempt from vaccinat ion with proof of immunity. It states, \"Evidence of immunity (for example, by serologic antibody test ); documented previous infection (for example, chickenpox infection); natural infection presumed (for example, measles, if born before 1957).\" He receive d a 120-day exemption from receiving the COVID -19 vaccine . He told me directly that he has passed the expiration date of his exemption and he has not been pursued by our Squadron or the Vance AFB Medical Group to receive his shot at this time. He believes he has fallen through the Authentisign ID: 6C66903A-9FDC-EC11-B656-501AC586DF9D 111 Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 115 of 153 PageID 212Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 115 of 153 PageID 212cracks and he does not want to be highlighted and be forced to get the shot. He is currently on full -time orders and is currently allowed to TDY to stateside and international locations for his work duties. 33. I also have previously contracted COVID -19 in April of 2020 and I have submitted all of my positive tests with my RAR request accompanied by AFI 48 -110. I have a positive PCR Test from April 13, 2020 indicating I had COVID -19, along with multiple Positive Anti-body tests from as early as May 15, 2020 and most recently as January 12, 2022 still testing positive for antibodies . I am blessed that I am one of the people that recovered from COVID -19 due to my healthy immune system that God has given me, and I am protected from getting COVID -19 due to natural immunity and a reliance upon God's protection consistent with Psalm 91, Isaiah 53:5, and Psalm 103 . 34. On April 2 8th, 2022, my appeal was denied, and I was given until May 3, 2022, to receive a COVID -19 vaccine. 35. The reasons cited for the denial of my appeal were that telework is not an option, and my aircraft instruct or duties would place me in confined spaces with other Air Force members. 36. On April 28, 2022, I requested that the Air Force allow me extra time to consider my options while I am not available to be on military status due to my five week 737 Captain upgrade training p rogram for United Airlines . 37. This request was denied on the same day. My Squadron Commander expected me to sign and complete paperwork for the Reserve Squadron while I am not on a paid status with the Air Force.

Now that my appeal is denied, my Squadron Commander advised me that I will soon receive a Letter of Reprimand (\"LOR\") that will go in my permanent record and will negatively impact my discharge , which will be \"less-than-honorable .\" This service characterization will make obtaining new flying employment exceedingly difficult if not impossible should I need to seek other employment . This LOR destroys a record and career that I have worked hard to build over two decades. 39. I have already been placed on No Points No Pay status , which means I cannot perform any type of duty in a pay status and co nduct Reserve Duties or earn points towards retirement. 40. As a result of my appeal denial, on May 4, 2022, I was not only adversely placed on No Points No Pay status for failing to receive a vaccination, but I was also removed from my duties as an aviator a nd presently am not allowed to provide any service to the Air Force. At present, my otherwise flawless and distinguished service record is now capped with an entry in my personnel record stating that I have been \"suspended\" from flying service, and that \" Permanent Disqualification Action Pending.\" This means that I am no longer allowed to fly and instruct in a position that I love. It means that since recovering from COVID in the past 24 months, I have flown more than 290 hours in the T -6 Texan as an Instructor Pilot without catching COVID again, but I am suddenly no longer suitable to fly because of my vaccination status . It means that I will not to get a traditional military retirement ceremony for my friends and family to attend. This is typically where the pilot goes on one last \"fini -flight\", where the pilot gets to fly the plane, taxi to a stop in front of family, and then her or she is ceremon ially hosed down with a fire truck and its fire Authentisign ID: 6C66903A-9FDC-EC11-B656-501AC586DF9D 113 Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 117 of 153 PageID 214Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 117 of 153 PageID 214hose in the hands of the pilot's spouse and children. Because I am no longer on flying status, it means I will not receive this recognition for 21 years of service to my country. 41.I would like to reiterate th at Since COVID -19 mitigation measures were put into effect at the beginning of the pandemic, in March of 2020, and until the recent revocation of my flight orders , there have been no interruptions to my job duties or my job performance. In fact, I success fully carried out my unit's mission and at no time was there an impact to the mission as a result of COVID -19. 42.From March of 2020 until May 4, 2022 , my job duties included serving as a T -6 instructor and evaluator pilot at Vance Air Force Base with no is sue. 43.While I was mentally distraught over having to decide between my career, being able to provide for my family of 4 children and my wife, or violating my sincerely held religious beliefs, I made the difficult decision to hold true to my faith and did not receive a COVID -19 vaccine. This has been an incredibly s tressful ordeal . Due to the stress, my wife and I have begun going to marriage counseling . Due to the time -consuming nature of seeking an exemption, I have missed man y family activities with my children. Additionally, my wife and I have had to sell some of our property to ensure that we can sustain ourselves in the event that I am ultimately kicked -out of the Air Force . 44.Without immediate relief, I am facing an imminen t issuance of a LOR to my file , which will negatively impact my discharge characterization . The stress, mental, and emotional harm to my family continues to increase every day. And being forced to choose between tarnishing my n early two-and-a-half-decade long career or violating my sincerely held religious belief s in order to provide for my family is a harm that cannot be repaired with money, and it is a harm that happens every day that this process drags on.

Sosebee, under penalty of perjury, declare as follows: 1. I am over the age of eighteen and am competent to make this declaration.2. I presently reside in Monument, Colorado.3. I have served as a Department of the Air Force (\"Air Force\") active-duty member sinceFebruary of 2013. 4. Over the course of my career, I have received the following awards: Detachment CompanyGrade Officer of the Month (#1/19) during my first deployment, Flight Outstanding Contributor (#1/14 peer Captains) during Squadron Officer School, 94th Flying Training Squadron (\"FTS\") Instructor Pilot of the Quarter and Instructor Pilot of the Year (#1/19), 94th FTS Flight Commander of the Year, 306th Flying Training Group (\"FTG \") Instructor Pilot of the Quarter and Instructor Pilot of the Year (#1/132), 12th Flying Training Wing (\"FTW \") Instructor Pilot of the Quarter (#1/559), as well as the 306th Flying Training Group's High-Flyer Award for calendar year 2021. 5. I have also been considered a top performer over the course of my career. In a little over ayear at my first operational duty location, I was rated the #1/7 Standards and Evaluation Liaison Officers and was the 3rd Airlift Squadron Commander's #1/27 Junior Company Grade Officers. During my time at Dover Air Force Base, I was also rated #1/5 Training Officers, #1/4 Wing Airlift Directors, #2/20 year group Company Grade Officers, and #2/20 Company Grade Officers. After I moved to the United States Air Force Academy (\"USAFA\"), I earned the rating of the #1 Instructor Pilot in the Squadron in just over a year. Since then I have been rated as #2/8 Captains in the Squadron and #4/23 Flight Commanders in the Flying Training Group. Additionally, I earned a spot in the top 10% of Captains in the Flying Training Group (#11/121) DocuSign Envelope ID: 09562778-4FC9-4D11-8491-1013872D1AB1 141Case 4:22-cv-00453-O 153 PageID 242Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 145 of 153 PageID 242and I was selected as Initial Cadre for the newest Mission Designation Series in the Air Force, the TG-17A. Most recently, I was selected to promote to the rank of Major, with a line number of 321 out of around 1100 peers across the Air Force. 6. At no time during my career have I received any form of punishment or reprimand other than the punishment I received as a result of the Air Force's COVID-19 vaccination requirement, which is explained in more detail below. 7. I am presently assigned to 94th Flying Training Squadron at the USAFA in Colorado where my current job title is Chief of Training for the 306th Flying Training Group. I have been assigned to the 94th Flying Training Squadron since September of 2018. My duties entail: leading over 250 officers, enlisted, civilians and cadet instructor pilots in North America's largest sailplane operation; developing leaders by introducing the basics of flight/instruction and mentoring the Air Force's youngest instructor pilots; coordinating, planning and executing 20,000 missions annually while overseeing a $3M maintenance and tow-plane contract; executing 9 AETC syllabi for 1300 cadets yearly. Additional duties include: Soaring Control Officer (\"SCO\"), Supervisor of Flying (\"SOF\"), Operations Supervisor, Aerobatic Instructor Pilot, Cross-Country Instructor Pilot, and triple-qualified Evaluator Pilot for the TG-15/16/17. My sailplane qualifications expired as a result of my deployment to Saudi Arabia last year and, due to current guidance surrounding those applying for religious accomm odation requests to the COVID-19 mandates, I have not been allowed to re-qualify in any of the sailplanes at USAFA. 8. On August 24, 2021, the Secretary of Defense issued a mandate for all members of the Armed Forces under Department of Defense authority on active duty or in the Ready Reserve, including the National Guard, to immediately begin full vaccination against COVID -19. 9. On September 3, 2021, the Secretary of the Air Force issued a similar mandate (\"COVID -19 DocuSign Envelope ID: 09562778-4FC9-4D11-8491-1013872D1AB1 142Case 153 PageID 243Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 146 of 153 PageID 243Vaccine Mandate\") requiring that commanders in the Air Force take all steps necessary to ensure all uniformed Airmen and Guardians received the COVID-19 vaccine, which included issuing unit-wide and individual orders to their military members. 10. On October 27, 2021, my commander issued me an order to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.11. In response to the COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate, service members were permitted to submit arequest for either a religious or medical exemption. 12. On October 29, 2021, I submitted a Religious Accommodation Request (\"RAR\") to beexempted from the COVID-19 vaccine requirement. 13. In my RAR, I explained that I sincerely hold the belief that the use of cells, cellular debris,protein, and DNA from willfully aborted human children is unacceptable. Past and ongoing research on vaccines containing these ingredients violate core tenants of the Bible. I hold that supporting vaccination and vaccine development is an endorsement of the sacrifice of human souls, which I cannot reconcile with my deeply held religious beliefs. Moreover, I have a religious obligation to honor God with my body and respect His wishes in regard to my body. The COVID-19 vaccine mandates are in direction opposition to these foundational, core beliefs and taking the vaccine would be a massive violation of my sincerely held religious beliefs. I have used many alternative COVID-19 mitigation measures with great success. I have social distanced, worn masks, teleworked, and used selective scheduling measures to reduce contacts with others throughout the pandemic. I have used these measures so effectively that even though I have deployed to the Middle East, gone on numerous temporary duty location trips (\"TDYs \"), and flown countless glider sorties with cadets, permanent party, and guests alike, not once did I test positive for COVID-19 throughout the entire duration of the pandemic. I did so well with these procedures that on one of the TDYs I was running, Major General Craig Wills, then 19th DocuSign Envelope ID: 09562778-4FC9-4D11-8491-1013872D1AB1 143Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 153 PageID 244Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 147 of 153 PageID 244Air Force Commander, came and visited us and complemented us on the exemplary job we were doing implementing these alternative COVID-19 mitigation procedures. 14. As a requirement of the RAR process, on October 28, 2021, I was interviewed by theUSAFA chaplain regarding my sincerely held religious beliefs. 15. On the same day, the chaplain determined that my religious beliefs were sincere and thatreceiving the COVID-19 vaccine would present a substantial burden on my free exercise of religion. He also stated that he recommended for my RAR to be approved. 16. As an additional requirement of the RAR process, on or about October 27, 2021, I wascounseled by a provider at the 10th Medical Group at the USAFA about the risks of not being vaccinated and becoming ill with COVID-19. I apologize that my date for this point may not be accurate. My wife and yet-to-be-born infant son had just undergone in-utero fetal surgery to correct a hindbrain herniation (Chiari II malformation) as a result of our son's myelomeningocele spina bifida, and we were living in the Ronald McDonald house close to the Children's Hospital to ensure both my wife and son had access to immediate medical care in the precarious post-surgery stage directly following the open fetal surgery. 18. Currently, I am a top performing individual who is on the \"command track\", expected to takea command position as soon as I am eligible and to most likely continue the upward trajectory of my career following that command position. Not only would administrative action/nonjudicial punishment derail the current trajectory of my career, but it would forever remove command from the realm of possibility. Additionally, it has not only the potential but the likelihood of withholding future assignments and promotions as well. 19. Since COVID-19 mitigation measures were put into effect at the beginning of the pandemic DocuSign Envelope ID: 09562778-4FC9-4D11-8491-1013872D1AB1 144Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 153 PageID 245Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 148 of 153 PageID 245in March of 2020, there have been no interruptions to my job duties or my job performance. In fact, I successfully carried out my unit's mission, and at no time was there an impact to the mission as a result of COVID-19. As I previously stated, I have never tested positive for COVID-19. 20. Between March of 2020 until now, my job duties have included: AM -250/251 Flight Commander, Director of Advanced Soaring, and Assistant Director of Operations for the 94 FTS; Air Defense Liaison to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; Deputy Chief of the Commander's Action Group (\"CAG\") for the Commandant of Cadets; and Chief of Training for the 306 FTG. My duty station during this entire time has been at the USAFA. 21. Presently, in addition to my roles at the 94th, my job duties include: Auxiliary Training Manager for the 306th, Crew Resource Management monitor, and Special Projects Manager to include the USAFA Preparatory School flying program and Integrated Training Device sustainment. 22. After submitting my RAR on October 29, 2021, on March 8, 2021, I received the initial denial of my RAR, which is dated March 4, 2021. 23. The denial was issued by Lieutenant General Webb, Air Education and Training Command commander, and the reasons cited were 1) that I am required to have close contact with students and other personnel; 2) an exemption would detract from good order and discipline by creating the perception that there are different standards for those in leadership roles; 3) unit cohesion would be negatively impacted as my ability to train and mentor pilots would be limited; 4) my lack of personal readiness would impact my ability to deploy, go in temporary duty orders, and be transferred overseas; 5) it increases the risk to my own personal health and safety and that of DocuSign Envelope ID: 09562778-4FC9-4D11-8491-1013872D1AB1 145Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 153 PageID 246Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 149 of 153 PageID 246those around me; and ultimately that 6) the Air Force's compelling gove rnment interest outweighs my individual belief and no lesser means satisfy the government's interest. 24. On March 11, 2022, I submitted my appeal to the 94th Flying Training SquadronCommander, and he routed it up the chain to the Air Force Surgeon General on March 14, 2022. 25. When it was found that I was appealing the denial decision, I was immediately fired from myposition by Ms. Kate Russell, Lead Personnelist for USAFA/Cadet Wing, on the grounds of an assumed appeal denial and subsequent discharge (she made several discriminatory statements to me in her office such as, \"If I had known you weren't going to get the vaccine, I never would have hired you.\"). 26. On April 8, 2022 my appeal was denied. My commander notified me of this on April 14,2022, and I was given five days to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, apply for voluntary separation, or face mandatory disciplinary action, which would include a mandatory discharge process. 26. The reasons cited for the denial were 1) the Department of the Air Force has a compellinggovernment interest in requiring me to comply with the requirement for the COVID-19 immunization because preventing the spread of disease among the force is vital to mission accomplishment; 2) my present duty assignment requires intermittent to frequent contact with others and is not fully achievable via telework or with adequate distancing; 3) institutionalizing remote completion of duties permanently would be detrimental to readiness, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion; 4) my health status as a non-immunized individual in this dynamic environment, and aggregated with other non-immunized individuals in steady state operations would place health and safety, unit cohesion, and readiness at risk; and 5) there are no less restrictive means available in my circumstances as effective as receiving immunizations in furthering these competing government interests.

However, Lieutenant General Miller, the Air Force Surgeon General, did not state that any consideration was given to the March 1 DoD guidance that eliminates masking and other requirements for service members, federal civilian workers, and contractors and also does not require vaccination status to be a factor in the workplace. Neither did General Miller consider the fact that the federal civilian worker and federal civilian contractor vaccination mandates are not presently in effect and that those individuals are permitted to work in close proximity with others. At the Air Force Academy we are surrounded by civilian workers and civilian contractors who may be unvaccinated, even employing several of them at the 94th, not to mention the staff in the control tower, the cleaning service, and the aircraft and facilities maintenance crews. 28. While I was mentally distraught over having to decide between my career, being able toprovide for my family of six, and violating my sincerely held religious beliefs, I made the difficult decision to hold true to my faith and did not receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Being forced to go through this process has placed untold amounts of stress and anxiety on us over the past year, a year that came with monumental stressors of its own, including the marriage of my sister-in-law, the death of my wife's grandfather, the birth of my child, an extraordinarily complicated and hazardous medical diagnosis, selling a home, and a deployment. This difficult process has been harmful to our family, our mental and emotional health, and our psyche. In a time that, more than anything, should be dedicated to the care, nurture, and restoration of my family, I am spending my mornings, evenings, and weekends preparing briefs, MFRs, and reference papers to justify to a branch of the United States government why I should be allowed to exercise my First Amendment rights. 29. As a result of not taking the COVID-19 vaccine, on April 28, 2022, I received adverse DocuSign Envelope ID: 09562778-4FC9-4D11-8491-1013872D1AB1 147Case 4:22-cv-00453-O 153 PageID 248Case 4:22-cv-00453-O Document 6 Filed 05/27/22 Page 151 of 153 PageID 248administrative action in the form of a Letter of Reprimand from Colonel Rowe, 12 FTW/CC, because I \"failed to obey a lawful order to receive the COVID-19 vaccine\". I was also fired from my position in USAFA/Cadet Wing in Brig. Gen. Moga's Commander's Action Group when it was learned that I was appealing Lieutenant General Webb's denial of my RAR, and presently I am working for the 306th Flying Training Group as their Chief of Training. 30. My command also will not let me fly or train students in the sailplane until the RAR processis brought to a conclusion, either by judicial relief or by my forced separation from the Air Force. 30. Without immediate relief, I am facing immediate and mandatory discharge from the armedservices, the loss of my constitutional rights, and the abhorrent violation of my deeply held religious beliefs. Mandating my discharge would inflict irreparable injury on us including but is not limited to: financial instability from the loss of all pay, special incentives and bonuses in a time of great financial hardship and unrest; loss of all medical and dental benefits, including the six-month grace period generally given for those separating from the service, jeopardizing the medical care of our infant son with special medical needs during a critical time in his life; and questions around future employment brought about by the nature of the mandatory discharge. The Air Force has been deliberate in their actions against service members who sought this religious accommodation to the COVID-19 vaccination mandates. I have exhausted every avenue for relief afforded me by military statutes, and now only injunctive relief can stem this tide and prevent my being forcibly discharged from the Air Force. Most any adverse paperwork in an officer's official file would be a career ending event.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN, in his official capacity as President of the United States, et al. , Defendants . ORDER Plaintiffs , comprised of the S tates of Georgia, Alabama, Idaho, Kansas, South Carolina, Utah and West Virginia; the governors of several of those states ; and various state agencies, including the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia, filed this suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against enforcement of Executive Order 14042, which require s, inter alia , that contractors and subcontrac tors performing work on certain federal contracts ensure that their employees and others working in connection with the federal contracts are fully vaccinated against COVID -19. (Docs. 1, 54.) Upon filing the lawsuit, Plaintiffs requested that this Court issue a preliminary injunction. (Docs. 19, 55.) Additionally, Associated Builders and Contractors, Inc. (hereinafter, \"ABC\") , a trade organization, and one of its chapters, Associated Builders and Contractors of Georgia, Inc. a Motion to Intervene in the action, (doc. 48), and also filed their own Motion for Preliminary Injunction, (doc. 50). The Court established an expedited briefing schedule and, following the submission of responses by the Defendants to all motions, (docs. 61, Case 1:21-cv-00163-RSB-BKE Document 94 Filed 12/07/21 Page 1 of 282 63), and the submission of replies by Plaintiffs and by the Proposed Intervenors, (docs. 76-78), the Court conducted a hearing on the Motions on December 3, 2021. As another Court that has preliminarily enjoined the same measure at issue in this case has stated, \"[t]his case is not about whether vaccines are effective. They are.\" Kentucky v. Biden, No. 3:21- cv-55, *9 (E.D. Ky. Nov. 30, 2021). Moreover, the Court acknowledges the tragic toll that the COVID -19 pandemic has wrought throughout the nation and the globe. However, even in times of crisis this Court must preserve the rule of law and ensure that all branches of government act within the bounds of their constitutionally granted authorities. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has recognized that, while the public indisputably \"has a strong interest in combating the spread of [COVID -19],\" that interest does not permit the government to \"act unlawfully even in pursuit of desirable ends.\" Ala. Ass'n of Realtors v. 2485, 2490 (2021) (citing Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 582, 585-86 (1952) ). In this case, Plaintiffs will likely succeed in their claim that the President exceeded the authorization given to him by Congress through the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act when issuing Executive Order 14042. Accordingly, a fter due consideration of the motions, supporting briefs, responsive briefing, and the evidence and argument presented at the hearing, 1 the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART the Motion to Intervene, (doc. 48), GRANTS ABC 's Motion for Preliminary Injunction, (doc. 50), and GRANTS Plaintiffs' Amended Motion for Prelimin ary Injunction, (doc. 55). 1 On December 2, 2021, the American Medical Association, which is not a party to this case, was granted leave of Court to file an amicus curiae brief in opposition to Plaintiffs' Amended Motion for Preliminary Injunction. (Doc. 86.) Case 1:21-cv-00163-RSB-BKE Document 94 Filed 12/07/21 Page 2 of 28 3 BACKGROUND On January 20, 2021, President Biden signed Executive Order 13991, establishing the \"Safer Federal Workforce Task Force\" ( hereinafter, \"Task Force\"). Fed. Reg. 7,045-48 (Jan. 20, 2021). The Task Force's stated mission is to \"provide ongoing guidance to heads of agencies on the operation of the Federal Government, the safety of its employees, and the continuity of Government functions during the COVID-19 pandemic.\" Id. at 7,046. On September 9, 2021, President Biden signed Executive Order 14042 (hereinafter, \"EO 14042\"). 86 Fed. Reg. 50,985-88 (Sept. 9, 2021). Therein, the President stated that his order would \"promote[] economy and efficiency in Federal procurement by ensuring that the parties that contract with the Federal Government provide adequate COVID -19 safeguards to their workers performing on or in connection with a Federal Government contract or contract -like instrument,\" which would \"decrease worker absence, reduce labor costs, and improve t he efficiency of contractors and subcontractors at sites where they are performing work for the Federal Government.\" Id. at \u00a7 1. EO 14042 mandate d that the Task Force provide, by September 24, 2021, guidance regarding \"adequate COVID -19 safeguards ,\" whic h must be complied with by federal contractors and subcontractors. Id. at 50,985. This executive order specified that the Task Force's g uidance would be mandatory at all \"contractor or subcontractor workplace locations\" so long as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (hereinafter, the \"OMB\") approved the guidance and determined that it would \"promote economy and efficiency in Federal contracting.\" Id. EO 14042 states that it applies , with some specified exceptions, to \"any new contract ; new contract -like instrument; new solicitation for a contract or contract -like instrument; Case 1:21-cv-00163-RSB-BKE Document 94 Filed 12/07/21 Page 3 of 284 extension or renewal of an existing contract or contract -like instrument; and exercise of an option on an existing contract or contract- like instrument. \" Id. On September 24, the Task Force issued its Guidance for Federal Contractors and Subcontractors (hereinafter, the \"Task Force Guidance\") pursuant to EO 14042. See Safer Federal Workforce Task Force, COVID-19 Workplace Safety: Guidance for Federal Contractors and Subcontractors , available at https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/downloads/Draft%20contractor%20guidance%20doc_20 210922.pdf (last visited Dec. 4, 2021). The Task Force Guidance requires all \"covered contractors\"2 to be fully vaccinated by January 18 , 2022,3 unless they are \"legally entitled to an accommodation.\" Safer Federal Workforce Task Force, COVID-19 Workplace Safety: Guidance for Federal Contractors and Subcontractors (Updated November 10, 2021), at p. 5, available at https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/downloads/Guidance%20for%20Federal%20Contractors _Safer%20Federal%20Workforce%20Task%20Force_20211110.pdf (last visited December 4, 2021). The Task Force Guid ance applies to all \"newly awarded covered contract [s]\" at any 2 \"Covered contractor\" means \"a prime contractor or subcontractor at any tier who is party to a covered contract.\" Safer Federal Workforce Task Force, COVID-19 Workplace Safety: Guidance for Federal Contractors and Subcontractors , at p. 3. 3 While the in itial Task Force Guidance announced a deadline of December 8, 2021, on November 10, 2021, an updated version was issued which pushed the deadline for full vaccination to January 18, 2022. See Safer Federal Workforce Task Force, COVID-19 Workplace Safety: Guidance for Federal Contractors and Subcontractors (Updated November 10, 2021), available at https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/downloads/Guidance%20for%20Federal%20Contractors_Safer% 20Federal%20Workforce%20Task%20Force_20211110.pdf (last visited December 4, 2021). This means that covered contractors' employees would need to receive their Johnson & Johnson vaccine or the second dose of a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine by January 4 to be fully vaccinated by the deadline. See The White House, Fact Sheet: Biden Administration Announces Details of Two Major Vaccination Policies, https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statementsreleases/2021/11/04/fact- sheet -biden - administration -announces- details -of-two-major -vaccination-policies/ (last visited Dec. 4, 2021).

On September 28, the Director of the OMB issued a notice of her determination \"that compliance by [f]ederal contractors and subcontractors with the COVID -19 workplace safety protocols detailed in th[e] [Task Force G]uidance will improve economy and efficiency by reducing absenteeism and decreasing labor costs for contractors and subcontractors working on or in connection with a Federal Government contract.\" 86 Fed. Reg. 53,691-92. In order to implement the policies and requirements it established, EO 14042 directed the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (hereinafter, the \"FAR Council\") to \"amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to provide for inclusion in Federal procurement solicitations and contra cts subject to this order [a] clause\" requiring compliance with the Task Force Guidance (including the vaccination requirements ). 86 Fed. Reg. 50,986. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (hereinafter, the \"FAR\") is the set of policies and procedures that governs the drafting and procurement processes of contracts for all executive agencies ; it also contains standard solicitation provisions and contract clauses . See United States General Services Administration, Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/regulations/federal- acquisition - regulation- far (last visited Dec. 4, 2021). On September 30, 2021, the FAR Council issued a memo to various agencies, providing direction on when and how to use the new clause, (hereinafter, the \"FAR Memo\") . to-Implement- EO-14042.pdf (last visited Dec. 4, Case 1:21-cv-00163-RSB-BKE Document 94 Filed 12/07/21 Page 5 of 286 2021). The FAR Memo explains that EO 14042 directed the FAR Council to \" develop a contract clause requiring contractors and subcontractors . . . to comply with [the Task Force Guidance] and to provide initial policy direction to acquisition offices for use of the clause by recommending that agencies exercise their authority under FAR subpart 1.4, Deviations from the FAR.\" Id. at p. 2. According to the FAR Memo, \"[t]he FAR Council has opened a case (FAR Case 2021-021, Ensuring Adequate COVID -19 Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors) to make appropriate amendments in the FAR to reflect the requirements of [EO 14042] ,\" id. at p. 3, and it has \"developed [a] clause\" \u2014which it included as an attachment to the memo \u2014\"pursuant to section 3(a) of the order to support agencies in meeting the applicability requirements and deadlines set forth in [EO 14042] ,\" id. at p. 2. The attachment is entitled \" FAR Deviation Clause . . . [52.223- 99 Ensuring Adequate COVID -19 Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors . . .],\" and it states, inter alia : (c) Compliance. The Contractor shall comply with all guidance, including guidance conveyed through Frequently Asked Questions, as amended during the performance of this contract, for contractor or subcontractor workplace locations published by the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force (Task Force Guidance) at https:/www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/contractors/ . (d) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (d), in subcontracts at a ny tier that exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation 2.101 on the date of subcontract award, and are for services, including construction, performed in whole or in part within the United States or its outly ing areas. Id. at pp. 4-5. The FAR Memo lists the types of solicitations and contracts in which the agencies \"are required to include\" the new clause, id. at p. 2 (emphasis added) , but it also states that, \"[t] o maximize the goal of getting more people va ccinated and decrease the spread of COVID -19, the Task Force strongly encourages agencies to apply the requirements of its guidance broadly, Case 1:21-cv-00163-RSB-BKE Document 94 Filed 12/07/21 Page 6 of 287 consistent with applicable law, by including the clause in\" other types of contracts that are not otherwise covered by EO 14042, id. at p. 3 (emphasis added). Plaintiffs filed their Complaint initiating this action on October 29, 2021, (doc. 1), and they filed their initial Motion for Preliminary Injunction on November 5, 2021, (doc. 19). On November 10, 2021, the OMB Director issued a revised Determination that (1) revoked the prior OMB Determination; (2) provided additional reasoning and support for how the Task Force Guidance will promote economy and efficiency in government contracting; (3) gave covered contractors additional time to comply with the vaccinat ion requirement; and (4) provided a public comment period through December 16, 2021. See 86 Fed. Reg. 63,418. In light of the revised OMB Determination, Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint, (doc. 54), and an Amended Motion for Preliminary Injunction, (doc. 55). Meanwhile, the Proposed Intervenors filed their Motion to Intervene as Plaintiffs, (doc. 48), and their Motion for Preliminary Injunction, (doc. 50). All parties were given an opportunity to file responsive briefs and to present evidence and ar gument during the hearing on December 3, 2021. During the hearing, Plaintiffs presented testimony from representatives of three universities within the University System of Georgia : Augusta University, Georgia Institute of Technology (hereinafter, \"Georgia Tech\") , and the University of Georgia . (See also doc. 55-12, p. 4 ( these three institutions' federal contracts generated approximately $736,968,899.00 in revenue in fiscal year 2021).) These witnesses each testified generally about their respective research institution's participation in and reliance on federal contracting, and they provided data regarding the number of employees who work on federal contracts at their institution and the amount of funds received by their institution as a result of its various federal contracts. Case 1:21-cv-00163-RSB-BKE Document 94 Filed 12/07/21 Page 7 of 288 (See, e.g. , Transcript of Dec. 3, 2021 Hearing (hereinafter, \" Tr.\"), pp. 22-27 (testimony of Michael Shannon, V ice President and Deputy C hief Business O fficer at Georgia Tech, that Georgia Tech has roughly 16,000 employees who work on contracts with the Department of Defense, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Health and Human Services , the National Aeronautics and Spac e Administration (hereinafter \"NASA\") , the Centers for Disease Control , and other agencies, and, in fiscal year 2021, it received approximately $664 million in federal contracts, which constitutes approximately 68% of its externally sponsored revenue); id. at pp. 67-70 (testimony of Jason Guilbeault , Director of Post-A ward Services at Augusta University, that his institution receives over $17 million per year on federal contracts, which represents about 10% of its total sponsored programs funding, and that it has roughly 5,802 employees working on federal contracts, which represents about 95% of its workforce) ; id. at p. 93 (testimony of Sige Burden, Senior Managing Director for Workforce Engagement at UGA, that UGA has 14,728 employees working on or in connection with federal contracts .) They also each provided even more detailed testimony about the laborious undertakings they have had to perform to comply with the mandate, particularly with the impending January 18 deadline. (See, e.g. , id. at pp. 24-27 ( testimony of Shannon that Georgia Tech had to \" shift a tremendous amount of resources \" in order to build a \"team comprised of [members of the] information technology [department ], [the human resources department ], . . . medical and health services folks, [ Georgia Tech's] legal team, [and its] emergency services folks\" to portal \"marry [human re sources] data and medical data together\" ); id. at pp. 70 (testimony of Guilbeault about the data analytics he performed to identify the wide variety of employees who are covered by the mandate, and the software program he has Case 1:21-cv-00163-RSB-BKE Document 94 Filed 12/07/21 Page 8 of 289 helped implement to permit employees to log in and enter their vaccination information and a scan of their vaccine card or to log in and submit questions).) Finally, they testified to having a number of employees who have not yet provided proof they are vaccinated or are in the process of becoming vaccinated , and the concern it causes them that many employees will ultimately decline to be vaccinated, meaning the institution will ultimately be non -compliant and may lose valuable employees . (See, e.g. , id. at pp. 30-33 ( about 20% of Georgia Tech's employees who may be covered have not provided proof they are vaccinated ); id. at pp. 71-72 (about 39% of Augusta State employees who may be covered have not provided proof ); id. at pp. 92-93 (fewer than half of the University of Georgia's employees who may be covered have provided proof of vaccination) .) The Court, which heard testimony from each of these witnesses about their background and job experience and was able to observe them during both direct and cross - examination, found the se witnesses to be credible. LEG AL AUTHORITY & DISCUSSION I. Motion to Intervene Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2), a party is permitted to intervene as of right if (1) its application to intervene is timely; (2) it has an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action; (3) it is so situated that disposition of the action, as a practical matter, may impede or impair its ability to protect that interest; and (4) its interest is represented inadequately by the existing parties to the suit. Tech. Training Assocs., Inc. v. Buccaneers Ltd. P'ship, 874 F.3d 692, 695-96 (11th Cir. 2017). Where a party is not entitled to intervene as of right, subsection (b) of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24 gives a court discretion to nonetheless permit the party to intervene, on timely motion, \"when a statute of the United States Case 1:21-cv-00163-RSB-BKE Document 94 Filed 12/07/21 Page 9 of 2810 confers a conditional right to intervene,\" or \"when [the] applicant's claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b). Accordingly, when there is no right to intervene under Rule 24(a), it is wholly within the Court 's discretion to allow permissive intervention under Rule 24(b). Worlds v. Dep't of Health & Rehab. Servs., 929 F.2d 591, 595 (11th Cir. 1991). Subsection (b) of Rule 24 instructs only that the Court must \"consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the original parties' rights.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(3). First, the Court finds that ABC, a trade organization representing tens of thousands of contractors and subcont ractors that regularly bid on and work on federal contracts for services, (doc. 49- 1, pp. 2-3), has an interest relating to the transaction which is the subject of the action . See N.Y. Pub. Interest Research Grp. v. Regents of Univ. of N.Y., 516 F.2d 350, 352 (2d Cir. 1975) ( intervening organizations may properly assert the interests of their members ). That interest is described in detail in Discussion Section II, infra , where the Court explains its conclusion that ABC has standing. Next, the Court finds that ABC's ability to protect its interests would be impaired without intervention. In ABC's own words, \"in the event that the Proposed Intervenors cannot intervene[,] and this Court issues an adverse decision, the Proposed Intervenors will have no further recourse\" and it members will have to comply with EO 14042, (doc. 49, p. 16), which \u2014 as explained throughout this Order \u2014the Court finds costly, laborious and likely to result in a reduction in available members of the workforce. See Huff v. Comm'r of IRS , 743 F.3d 790, 800 (11th Cir. 2014) (\"All that is required under Rule 24(a)(2) is that the would- be intervenor be practically disadvantaged by his exclusion from the proceedings.\" ). Additionally, the Motion to Intervene was timely . ABC filed its Motion to Intervene roughly twenty days after Plaintiffs filed Case 1:21-cv-00163-RSB-BKE Document 94 Filed 12/07/21 Page 10 of 2811 suit and prior to any substantive decisions having been made by the Court. At the time the Motion to Intervene was filed, Defendants had not yet responded (or been required to respond) to any substantive requests for relief in the case. Indeed, the day after ABC filed its Motion to Intervene, Plaintiffs filed their Amended Complaint (and Amended Motion for Preliminary Injunction), superseding their prior pleadings. Finally, the Court finds that ABC 's interest s are represented inadequately by the existing Plaintiffs . ABC represents private entities, many of whom are considered small businesses, while the Plaintiffs are all governmental officials, entities , and agencies. ABC s eeks to assert a clam for violation of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, which the existing Plaintiffs have not asserted (and may not be able to assert even if they desired to do so). (See doc. 48- 1, p. 40.) Additionally, the evidence presented to the Court indicates that ABC's members generally bid on and perform different type s of contract s as compared to the wider -ranging types of contracts the Plaintiffs typically bid on and perform , and Plaintiffs and ABC also have different administrative systems and costs when it comes to managing their employees and workforce. Accordingly, ABC's membe rs (as private entities) have economic interests and concerns that differ from those of the Plaintiffs.4 See, e.g. , Kleissler v. United States Forest Serv. , 157 F.3d 964, 973-74 (3d Cir. 1988) (\"[T]he government represents numerous complex and conflicting interests in matters of this nature. The straightforward business interests asserted by intervenors here may become lost in the thicket of sometimes inconsistent governmental policies.\") ; W. Energy Alliance v. Zinke, 877 F.3d 1157, 1168 (10th Cir. 2017) 4 As a specific example, one differing interest and strategy that was readily apparent during oral argument concerned the scope of any preliminary injunction. The existing Plaintiffs indicated they would be satisfied if the Court issued a preliminary injunction only effective in Georgia, Alabama, Idaho, Kansas, South Carolina, Utah and West Virginia, while ABC, whose members work on contracts throughout the country, urged that any preliminary injunction would need to be nationwide in order to afford it adequate relief. Case 1:21-cv-00163-RSB-BKE Document 94 Filed 12/07/21 Page 11 of 28 12 (\"Also, we have held that the government cannot adequately represent the interests of a private intervenor and the interests of the public.\"). ABC -Georgia, however, has failed to show that it has standing to bring the claims it seeks to assert in its pro posed complaint. No evidence was presented to show that any specific member of the chapter would have standing (i.e., no evidence was presented showing that any member regularly bids on or performs contracts that would be covered under EO 14042, much less that any member wishes to bid on any upcoming contracts that would be covered by EO 14042 but believes it cannot feasibly do so due to the vaccine requirement). In light of the foregoing, the Court finds that ABC is entitled to intervene as of right in this case pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a) . Even if it were not permitted to intervene as of right, the Court would exercise its discretion pursuant to subsection (b) of Rule 24 to permit it to intervene because, for the reasons described above, its claim s and the main action \"have a question of law or fact in common,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b), and its intervention will not result in any undue delay or prejudice to the adjudication of the original parties' rights . The Court, however, finds that ABC -Georgia lacks standing to assert its claims and thus is not entitled to intervene. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART the Motion to Intervene. (Doc. 48.) II. Standing \"[The] standing doctrine . . . requir[es] plaintiffs to 'alleg[e] such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to . . . justify [the] exercise of the court 's remedial powers on [their] behalf. '\" Town of Chester, N.Y. v. Laroe Estates, Inc., 137 S. Ct. 1645, 1650 (2017) (quoting Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights Org ., 426 U.S. 26, 38 (1976)). To establish Article III standing a Case 1:21-cv-00163-RSB-BKE Document 94 Filed 12/07/21 Page 12 of 2813 plaintiff must show that it: \"(1) suffered an injury i n fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\" Spokeo v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 338 (2016). Defendants have focused much of their standing challenge on arguing that Plaintiffs have not \"provide [d] [any] evidence that they are (1) parties to a federal contract that already has the challenged clause; or (2) parties to an existing covered contract that is up for an option, extension, or renewal that mu st include the clause,\" and that they have not \"identif [ied] any specific, covered solicitations that they plan to bid on or contracts that they plan to enter into in the immediate future. \" (Doc. 63, p. 3.) Notably, however, prior to the hearing, Plaintiffs filed the \"Supplemental Declaration of Michael Shannon,\" which shows that Georgia Tech is a finalist in response to a solicitation, in excess of $250,000, issued by NASA. (Hearing Exhibit (hereinafter, \"Exh.\") P-22 (also available at doc. 76- 1).) According to the Declaration (and as confirmed during Mr. Shannon's live testimony at the hearing and supported by exhibits to his Supplemental Declaration), in October 2021, \"the solicitation was amended to include Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.223- 99\" and \"Georgia Tech was required to agree to FAR c lause 52.223- 99 to maintain its eligibility for the contract award pursuant to the NASA solicitation.\" (Id.; see also Tr., pp. 23- 24, 43) Accordingly, Plaintiff Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia has standing because it has shown that o ne of its institutions (Georgia Tech) is a finalist for a contract with NASA and it has been advised that, if it is awarded the contract, the at -issue clause must be included in the contract.5 5 At the hearing, counsel for Defendants conceded that this bestows at least limited standing to certain Plaintiff(s), but she argued that the standing is \"limited to that particular contract.\" (Tr. , pp. 17-18.) Case 1:21-cv-00163-RSB-BKE Document 94 Filed 12/07/21 Page 13 of 28 14 Additionally, ABC, which the Court permits, through this Order, to intervene as a Plaintiff, has standing. An organization may sue \"on behalf of its members when: (a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization' s purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.\" Greater Birmingham Ministries v. Sec'y of Ala. , 992 F.3d 1299 (11th Cir. 2021). ABC, a construction industry trade association, has provided sworn declarations showing that at least two of its members \"intended to bid\" on specified upcoming federal construction projects, but, following EO 14042, have concluded that it is not practical for them to do so because they likely will not have sufficient employees to perform the job if they enter into a contract that requires all of the covered employees to be vaccinated. ( See Exh. ABC -3 (declaration of President of McKelvey Mechanical , Inc., explain ing that his company, which is a member of ABC, \"traditionally bids many federal projects per year and usually performs 4-6 per year, \" but a majority of his employees are not vaccinated and many unvaccinated employees have stated that they will quit if they are required to be vaccinated ); see also Exh. ABC -2 (declaration of Executive Vice President of Cajun Industries Holdings, LLC, explain ing that there are \"a number of forthcoming solicitations by the Army for construction projects of the type that Cajun would normally bid upon and perform, and which [it] desire [s] to bid for \" but because the projects would fall under EO 14042, it will likely be unable to bid because it has reason to believe that many of its unvaccinated wor kers (over half its total workforce) will quit if they are required to be vaccinated) .) ABC also provided evidence \u2014using information gathered from the General Services Administration's Website for federal contracts \u2014that the federal government frequently and routinely issues solicitations and pre-solicitations for bids on Case 1:21-cv-00163-RSB-BKE Document 94 Filed 12/07/21 Page 14 of 2815 construction contracts (which ABC's members would normally bid on and be qualified to perform ) that would be covered by EO 14042. (Exh. ABC -4.) Coupl ing that evidence with the sworn testimony provided by ABC , the Court finds that ABC has members that would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right . The Court also concludes that, as a trade association for thousands of contractors, the interests ABC seeks to protect in this lawsuit are germane to its purpose . The Court also finds that neither the claim s asserted nor the relief requested (declaratory and injunctive relief) require the participation of individual members in the lawsuit. Greater Birmingham Ministries , 992 F.3d at 1316 n.29 (\"[P]rospective relief weigh[s] in favor of finding that associational standing exists.\"). Accordingly, ABC has standing. It is well- established that, where there are multiple parties petitioning for injunctive relief, \"[o]nly one petitioner needs to have standing to authorize review.\" Massachusetts v. E. P.A., 549 U.S. 497, 498 (2007); see also Town of Chester, 137 S. Ct. at 1650. Here, two parties petitioning for declaratory and injunctive relief (ABC and the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia) have standing; accordingly, Defendants' challenge to the lawsuit on this ground fails. Even without these showings about specific bids and/or contracts, the Court would be inclined to find that Article III standing exists based on the ample evidence (including declarations and live testimony presented at the hearing) showing that the State Plaintiff s (including many of their agen cies) and members of ABC (as described in the preceding paragraph) routinely enter into contracts that would be covered by EO 14042,6 have current contracts that could easily fall under 6 According to the Declaration of Bill Anderson, the President and CEO of ABC's Georgia chapter, \"[a]ccording to recent data posted on the government website www.usaspending.gov, ABC member general contractors compose a crucial segment of the construction industry's federal contracting base as ABC members won 57% of the $118 billion in direct federal U.S. construction contracts exceeding $25 million Case 1:21-cv-00163-RSB-BKE Document 94 Filed 12/07/21 Page 15 of 28 16 the requirements of EO 14042 (if, for instance, they are renewed, modified, or have options that are exercised), and have shown that they would typically continue to seek out contract opportunities with the federal government that now will be covered by EO 14042. ( See, e.g. , doc. 55-6 (University of Idaho has federal contracts totaling approximately $22 million per year , based on average of last three years ); doc. 55- 10 (Utah Department of Health has federal contracts totaling $811,000); doc. 55- 14 (Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries has federal contracts and has leased land to the United States Department of Agriculture continuously for the past 26 years).) See Adarand Contractors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 211 (1995) (When a claim involves a challenge to a future contracting opportunity, the pertinent question for determining whether an alleged injury is sufficiently imminent is whether Plaintiffs \"ha[ve] made an adequate showing that sometime in the relatively near future [they]will bid on another Government contract [of the type at issue in t he case].\") . Based on all the foregoing, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have standing. The Court addresses the parties' debate over whether Plaintiffs have shown a sufficient injury- in-fact at length in Discussion Section III.C, infra , and, for the reasons provided therein, concludes that a sufficient injury has been shown. III. Motions for Preliminary Injunction A. Standard of Review To be entitled to a preliminary injunction, Plaintiff s must show: (1) a substantial likelihood of ultimate success on the merits; (2) an injunction or protective order is necessary to prevent awarded during fiscal years 2009-2020.\" (Doc. 49- 1, p. 4 (citing USASpending.gov data (accessed Dec. 22, 2020) cross- referenced with ABC membership).)

Schiavo ex rel. Schindler v. Schiavo, 403 F.3d 1223, 1225-26 (11th Cir. 2005). In the Eleventh Circuit, an \"injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy not to be granted unless the movant clearly established the 'burden of persuasion' as to the four requisites.\" Horton v. City of Augustine , 272 F.3d 1318, 1326 (11th Cir. 2001). If a plaintiff succeeds in making such a showing, then \"the court may grant injunctive relief, but the relief must be no broader than necessary to remedy the constitutional violation.\" Newman v. Alabama, 683 F.2d 1312, 1319 (11th Cir. 1982). B. Likelihood of Success on the Merits The likelihood of success on the merits is generally considered the most important of the four factors. Garcia- Mir v. Meese, 781 F.2d 1450, 1453 (11th Cir. 1986). If Plaintiffs cannot satisfy their burden with respect to this factor, the Court need not consider the other three factors . GeorgiaCarry.Org, Inc. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng' rs, 788 F.3d 1318, 1329 (11th Cir. 2015). Although P laintiffs raise multiple claims against Defendants, Plaintiffs need only show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits on one claim. See Schiavo , 357 F. Supp. 2d at 1383, aff'd 403 F.3d (11th that \"[t]o obtain temporary injunctive relief, [the plaintiffs] must show a substantial likelihood of success on at least one claim\"). 1. Whether the Procurement Act Authorized the President to Issue EO 14042 The President expressly relied on the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 et seq. (hereinafter, the authority to issue EO 14042 \"in order to promote economy and efficiency in procurement by contracting with sources that provide adequate COVID -19 safeguards for their workforce .\" 86 Fed. Reg. 50,985-88. The Case 1:21-cv-00163-RSB-BKE Document 94 Filed 12/07/21 Page 17 of 2818 Procurement Act was \"designed to centralize Government property management and to introduce into the public procurement process the same flexibility that characterizes such transactions in the private sector. These goals can be found in the terms 'economy' and ' efficiency ' which appear in the statute and dominate the sparse record of the congressional deliberations.\" Am. Fed'n of Labor and Congress of Indus. Orgs. v. Kahn, 618 F.2d 784, 787-88 (D.C. Cir. 1979).7 In Khan , the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit examined the history of and apparent congressional intent behind the Procurement Act, and stated its belief that, \" by emphasizing the leadership role of the President in setting Government -wide procurement policy on matters common to all agencies, Congress intended that the President play a direct and active part in supervising the Government' s management functions.\" Id. at 788. The court acknowledged that, \"To define the President 's powers under Section 205(a) [(40 U.S.C. \u00a7 121(a) )], some content must be injected into the general phrases 'not inconsistent with ' the [Procurement Act] and ' to effectuate the provisions' of the Act.\" Id. After considering the Procurement Act's emphasis on promoting \"economy\" and \"efficiency\" and ensuring contracts are awarded on terms that are \"most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered,\" the Kahn court stated that the Procurement Act \"grants the President particularly direct and broad -ranging authority over those larger administrative and management issues that involve the Government as a whole. And that direct presidential authority should be used in order t o achieve a flexible management system capable of making sophisticated judgments in pursuit of economy and efficiency.\" Id. at 789. 7 The Court has been unable to find\u2014and the parties have not pointed to\u2014any relevant case law from the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit grappling with the scope of the authority granted to the President in the Procurement Act. Case 1:21-cv-00163-RSB-BKE Document 94 Filed 12/07/21 Page 18 of 28 19 While the Procurement Act explicitly and unquestionably bestows some authority upon the President, the Court is unconvinced, at this stage of the litigation, that it authorized him to direct the type of actions by agencies that are contained in EO 14042. Pursuant to clear United States Supreme Court precedent, Congress is expected to \"speak clearly\" when authorizing the exercise of powers of \"vast economic and political significance.\" Ala. Ass'n of 2489 Regul. Grp. v. E.P.A., 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014). The Court has already described in detail the extreme economic burden the Plaintiffs have suffered and will continue to suffer in endeavoring to comply with EO 14042 (not to mention the impediment it will likely pose to some Plaintiffs' (in particular, ABC's members') ability to continue to perform federal contract work). Additionally, the direct impact of EO 14042 goes beyond the administration and management of procurement and contracting ; in its practical application (requiring a significant number of individuals across the country working in a broad range of positions and in numerous different industries to be vaccinated or face a serious risk of losing their job), it operates as a regulation of public health. I t will also have a major impact on the economy at large, as it limits con tractors' and members of the workforce's ability to perform work on federal contracts . A ccordingly, it appears to have vast economic and political significance. The issue, then, is whether Congress, through the Procurement Act, has \"clearly\" authorized the President to issue the directives contained in EO 14042, or whether, instead, EO 14042 \"bring[s] and transformative expansion in . . . regulatory authority authorization,\" Utility Air Regul. Grp. , 573 U.S. at 324. Looking to the Kahn court for guidance, the Court considers whether EO 14042 fits within Congress 's grant Case 1:21-cv-00163-RSB-BKE Document 94 Filed 12/07/21 Page 19 of 2820 to the President , through the Procurement Act, of \"particularly direct and broad-ranging authority over those larger administrative and management issues . . . that . . . should be used in order to achieve a flexible management system capable of making sophisticated judgments in pursuit of economy and efficiency .\" Kahn , 618 F.2d at 789 (emphases added) . The Court finds that Plaintiffs have a likelihood of proving that Congress , through the language it used, did not clearly authorize the President to issue the kind of mandate contained in EO 14042, as EO 14042 goes far beyond addressing administrative and management issu es in order to promote efficiency and economy in procurement and contracting, and instead , in application, works as a regulation of public health,8 which is not clearly authorized under the Procurement Act.9 8 During oral argument, counsel for Defendants urged that vaccine mandates are needed in order to \"efficiently manage our way out of this pandemic.\" (T r., p. 153.) However , the issue here is far more nuanced and requires a finding that Congress clearly gave the President authority to require all individuals who work on or in connection with a federal contract (valued over $250,000) to be fully vaccinated against COVID -19. 9 The Court acknowledges that, one day prior to the entry of this Order, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion, in a separate case, refusing to preliminarily enjoin enforcement of an interim rule issued by the Secretary of Health and H uman Services requiring facilities that provide health care to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries to ensure that their staff are fully vaccinated against COVID -19. See Florida v. Dep 't of Health and Human Servs, No. 21-14098- JJ, 2021 WL 5768796, at *1 (11th Cir. Dec. 6, 2021), available at . Defendants in this case notified the Court that the Florida opinion \"supplements their merits arguments\" (though they neglected to elaborat e as to how ), but the Court finds the case at hand to be materially diff erent, in numerous ways, from the case before the Eleventh Circuit. First, in the Florida opinion, the court addresse d very different statutory and regulatory schemes , the Medicare and Medicaid statutes and the regulations governing conditions for facilit ies to participate in those programs. Id. at *1- 2. Nothing in the Florida case bears on whether the President is authorized, under his authority pursuant to the Procurement Act , to require private companies that enter into federal contracts to, in turn, require virtually all of their employees to be vaccinated. Additionally, in the Florida case and unlike in the case at hand, the challenged directive is similar to the authorizing statutes, because they \"both directly relate to efforts to prevent the spread of disease at facilities treating Medicare or Medicaid patients to protect the health and safety of those patients.\" Id. at *13; see also id. at *1-2 (\" For both the Medicar e and Medicaid programs, Congress charged the Secretary with ensuring that participating facilities protect the health and safety of their patients ,\" and the at -issue interim rule issued by the Secretary \" amend [ed] the infection- control regulat ions for facilities or Medicaid . . . [to] require [] that facilities certified to participate in Medicare or Medicaid ensure their staff are fully vaccinated against COVID -19, unless an employee is exempt . . . .\"). By contrast, here, while EO 14042 relates to efforts to prevent the spread of disease in any place an individual is working on or in connection with a federal contract, the at- issue claimed authorizing statute relates to the President's authority to take actions to \"achieve a flexible Case 1:21-cv-00163-RSB-BKE Document 94 Filed 12/07/21 Page 20 of 28 21 Even if, however, EO 14042 did not trigger the specific requirement that Congress \"speak clearly\" in authorizing the challenged executive action, the Court additionally finds that Plaintiffs have a likelihood of proving that EO 14042 does not have a sufficient nexus to the purposes of the Procurement Act and thus does not fall within the authority actually granted to the President in that Act. For essentially the same reasons recited in the preceding subsection, the Court finds that the directives contained within EO 14042 were not authorized by the Procurement Act. Defendants claim that, \"[t] o anyone who has lived through the COVID -19 pandemic and its resulting economic turmoil, the nexus between reducing the spread of COVID -19 and economy and efficiency is self -evident.\" (Doc. 63, p. 16.) They emphasize EO 14042's explanation that \"[the] safeguards [in the Task Force Guidance] will decrease the spread of COVID -19, which will decrease work absence, reduce labor costs, and improve the efficiency of contractors and subcontractors\" and they argue that this \"easily satisfies [the] lenient standard\" of a sufficiently close nexus between the executive order and the purpose of the Procurement Act. ( Id. (quoting 86 Fed. Reg. 50,985-88).) Defendants are correct that the President has typically been afforded deference when courts review executive orders issued pursuant to the Procurement Act. See, e.g. , Chamber of Com. v. Reich , 74 F.3d 1322, 1333 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (\"The President 's authority to pursue 'efficient and economic' procurement . . . certainly reach[es] beyond any narrow concept management system capable of making sophisticated judgments in pursuit of economy and efficiency\" in government procurement and contracting, see Kahn , 618 F.2d at 789. Put simply, the authorizing statute in the Florida case authorized the executive to implement a health and safety measure while the relied upon statute in this case does not. The differing results in this case, the Florida case, and other cases challeng ing governmental actions to address the COVID -19 pandemic underscore the point that the focus of these cases is not on the effectiveness of vaccines and other measures but rather the legality of the Government's actions. Case 1:21-cv-00163-RSB-BKE Document 94 Filed 12/07/21 Page 21 of 2822 of efficiency and economy in procurement.\") (collecting examples). However, that deference was expressly not intended to operat e as \"a blank check for the President to fill in at his will.\" Kahn , 618 F.2d at 793. The President's directives still must be \" reasonably related\" to the purposes of the Procurement Act, Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Friedman, 639 F.2d 164, 170 (4th Cir. 1981) (emphasis added), and Defendants have not cited to a case upholding the use of the Procurement Act \"to promulgate such a wide and sweeping public health regulation as mandatory vaccination for all federal contractors and subcontractors ,\" Kentucky v. Biden , 2021 WL 5587446, at *9 . Nor have Defendants cited to a case upholding some action or requirement undertaken pursuant to the Procurement Act that the Court finds analogous to the mandates in EO 14042. While the Court is aware of cases where courts have held that a variety of types of executive orders were authorized under the Procurement Act, none have involved measures aimed at public health and none have involved the level of burdens implicated by EO 14042, which has already required and will continue to require extensive and costly administrative work by employers and will force at least some individuals to choose between getting medical treatment that they do not want or losing their job (and facing limited job replacement options due to the mandate ). Cf. UAW -Labor Emp. & Training Corp. v. Chao, 325 F.3d 360, 366-67 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (sufficiently close nexus between Procurement Act and executive order requiring federal contractors to post notices at all of their facilities informing employees of rights under federal labor law that protect employees from being forced to join a union or to pay mandatory dues for costs unrelated to representational activities ); Kahn , 618 F.2d at 786-87 (sufficiently close nexus between Procurement Act and executive order that required certain fede ral contractors to comply with wage and price controls ). Following the Defendants' logic and reasoning, the Procurement Act would be construed to give the President Case 1:21-cv-00163-RSB-BKE Document 94 Filed 12/07/21 Page 22 of 2823 the right to impose virtually any kind of requirement on businesses that wish to contract with the Government (and, thereby, on those businesses' employees) so long as he determines it could lead to a healthier and thus more efficient workforce or it could reduce absenteeism. Simply put, EO 14042's directives and resulting impact radiate too far beyond the purposes of the Procurement Act and the authority it grants to the President. Accordingly, the Court concludes, based on the limited record before it, that Plaintiffs are more likely than Defendan ts to succeed on the issue of whether there is a sufficiently close nexus between EO 14042 and the purposes of the Procurement Act. 2. Other Grounds Upon Which Plaintiffs Challenge EO 14042 In further support of their request for a preliminary injunction, Pl aintiffs also claim that Defendants issued the Task Force Guidance and the FAR Deviation Clause, which they claim constitute final agency action, without complying with the Administrative Procedure Act's notice - and-comment requirements. (Doc. 55, pp. 17-2 2.) The Court declines to wade into this issue given its determination that Plaintiffs have a likelihood of success on the merits on other grounds. Additionally, Plaintiffs allege that, if the Procurement Act does indeed authorize the directives issued in EO 14042, then the Procurement Act and EO 14042 are unconstitutional under the non- delegation doctrine and because they exceed Congress's authority and intrude on st ate sovereignty. This Court need not and does not issue any determination as to those challenges to resolve the motions before it. However, it is worth noting that other Courts have either expressed agreement with or at least concern about these arguments , see, e.g., BST Holdings, LLC v. Occupational Safety and Health Admin ., 17 F.4th 604, 1:21-cv-00163-RSB-BKE Document 94 Filed 12/07/21 Page 23 of 2824 C. Irreparable Injury Requirement In order to satisfy the irreparable injury requirement, a party must show that the threat of injury is \"neither remote nor speculative, but actual and imminent.\" Ne. Fla. Chapter of Ass 'n of Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of Jacksonville, 896 F.2d 1283, 1285 (11th Cir. 1990) (quoting Tucker Anthony Realty Corp. v. Schlesinger, 888 F.2d 969, 973 (2d Cir. 1989)); see also Church v. City of Huntsville, 30 F.3d 1332, 1337 (11th Cir. 1994) (In order to obtain injunctive relief, a plaintiff must show \"a real and immediate \u2014as opposed to a merely conjectural or hypothetical\u2014 threat of future injury.\"). Defendants argue that losing contracts would not be irrepar able harm \u2014because there are administrative processes through which Plaintiffs can seek to challenge the contractual provision and to recover losses on contracts\u2014and they claim that Plaintiffs have not \"demonstrated that the compliance costs they claim to have incurred are in fact tied to such contracts .\" (Doc. 63, p. 4.) As referenced previously in this Order, the Court heard from three witnesses who described the incredibly time -consuming processes they have undertaken (typically requiring major input a nd assistance from numerous other departments across their institution) to identify the employees covered by the mandate and to implement software and technology to ensure that those employees have been fully vaccinated (or have requested and been granted an accommodation or exemption) by the deadline in January. Not only must Plaintiffs ensure that their own employees satisfy the mandate, but they also must require that any subcontractors' employees working on or in connection with a covered contract are in compliance. The declarations of representatives of ABC members Cajun Contracting and McKelvey show similar administrative burdens and costs \u2014 though on a smaller scale. ( See Exhs. ABC -2, ABC -3.) Moreover, \"complying with a regulation Case 1:21-cv-00163-RSB-BKE Document 94 Filed 12/07/21 Page 24 of 2825 later held invalid almost always produces the irreparable harm of nonrecoverable compliance.\" BST Holdings , 17 F.4th at 618 (citing Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d 405, 433 (5th Cir. 2016)). The Court finds that the time and effort spent on these measures in the past \u2014and going for ward \u2014 constitute compliance costs resulting from EO 14042, which appear to be irreparable . See id. (\"[T]he companies seeking a stay in this case will also be irreparably harmed in the absence of a stay, whether by the business and financial effects of a lost or suspended employee, compliance and monitoring costs associated with the Mandate, [or] the diversion of resources necessitated by the Mandate . . . .\"); see at 1289 (\"[N]umerous courts have held that the inability to recover monetary damages . . . renders the harm suffered irreparable.\"). D. Balancing of the Harms Defendants contend that, even assuming Plaintiffs have shown a risk of irreparable injury, no injunction should issue because more harm would result from enjoining EO 14042 and further delaying the vaccination of the thousands of currently- unvaccinated individuals working on federal contracts (thereby permitting the continued spread of COVID -19). The Court disagrees. Enjoining EO 14042 would, essentially, do nothing more than maintain the status quo; entities will still be free to encourage their employees to get vaccinated, and the employees will still be free to choose to be vaccinated. In contrast, declining to issue a preliminary injunction would force Plaintiffs to comply with the mandate, requiring them to make decisions which would significantly alter their ability to perform federal contract work which is critical to their operations. Indeed, it appears that not granting an injunction could imperil the financial viability of many of ABC's members. Additionally, requiring compliance with EO 14042 would likely be life altering for many of Case 1:21-cv-00163-RSB-BKE Document 94 Filed 12/07/21 Page 25 of 2826 Plaintiffs' employees as Plaintiffs would be required to decide whether an employee who refuses to be vaccinated can, in practicality, be reassigned to another office or another task or whether the employee instead must be terminated. \"[A]ny abstract 'harm' a stay might cause . . . pales in comparison and importance t o the harms the absence of a stay threatens to cause countless individuals and companies.\" BST Holdings, 17 F.4th at 618. Accordingly, the Court finds that the balancing of the harms weighs heavily in favor of enjoining the enforcement of EO 14042. E. Publi c Interest \"For similar reasons, a stay is firmly in the public interest. From economic uncertainty to workplace strife, the mere specter of [EO 14042] has contributed to untold economic upheaval in recent months \" and \"the principles at stake when it come s to [EO 14042] are not reducible to dollars and cents.\" Id. at 619. F. Scope of Injunctive Relief The Court now must determine the appropriate scope of the injunctive relief. Generally, the Court treads lightly when issuing injunctive relief and resists th e entry of \"universal\" or \"nationwide\" injunctions, and recognizes the need to \"allow legal questions to percolate through the federal court system,\" Kentucky, 2021 WL 5587446, at *14 (citing Trump v. 138 Ct. 2392, 2424 (2018) (Thomas, J., concurring) and Dep't of Homeland Sec. v. New York, 140 S. Ct. 599, 600 (2020) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) ). While the original Plaintiffs to this case are (or are based in ) a limited number of states, the Court has, in this Order, permitted ABC, a trade association with members \"all over the country,\" (doc. 50-1, p. 3), to intervene as a Plaintiff . Not only is the geographic scope of ABC's membership broad, their involvement in federal contracts is as well. As noted above, they were awarded 5 7% of federal contracts exceeding $25 million Case 1:21-cv-00163-RSB-BKE Document 94 Filed 12/07/21 Page 26 of 2827 during fiscal years 2009 -2020. Accordingly, if the Court were to enjoin the enforcement of the mandate only in the Southern District of Georgia or only in Georgia, Alabama, Idaho, Kansas, South Carolina, Utah and West Virginia, then ABC's members would not have injunctive relief as to covered contracts in other states .10 Furthermore, given the breadth of ABC's membership, the number of contracts Plaintiffs will be involved with, and the fact that EO 14042 applies to subcontractors and others, limiting the relief to only those before the Court would prove unwieldy and would only cause more confusion. Thus, on the unique facts before it, the Court finds it necessary, in order to truly afford injunctive relief to the parties before it, to issue an injunction with nationwide applicability. CONCLUSION In light of the foregoing, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART the Motion to Intervene, (doc. 48), GRANTS ABC's Motion for Preliminary Injunction, (doc. 50), and GRANTS Plaintiffs' Amended Motion for Preliminary Injunction, (doc. 55). 11 Accordingly, the Court ORDERS that Defendants are ENJOINED , during the pendency of this action or until further order of this Cou rt, from enforcing the vaccine mandate for federal contractors and subcontractors in all covered contracts in any state or territory of the United States of America. The Court further DIRECTS the Clerk of Court to UPDATE the docket to reflect the addition of Associated Builders and Contractors, Inc., as a Plaintiff in this case. Because the proposed 10 The Court is mindful of the fac t that at least some of ABC's members are already able to benefit from the injunctive relief recently afforded by the District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky as to covered contracts in Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennes see.

I requested temporary duty (TDY) orders that would permit me to travel by car to this treatment program, which is scheduled for January 31, 2022. My request was still pending at the time I filed my last declaration . 5. I received word on January 3, 2022 that my request was officially denied by my command because I am unvaccinated against COVID-19. I am informed that command is denying TDY orders to travel for medical care for unvaccinated service members. 6. My Religious Accommodation request is still pending on appeal, so I cannot be classified as a \"refuser.\" 7. One of the officers in my command was trying to see if I could at least get leave approved so I could attend the program out of my own pocket. 8. On January 20, 2022, my senior chief called to tell me that NICoE gave my slot to someone else. 9. The same day, I called NICoE myself to verify this information. The woman I spoke with confirmed that they had to fill my slot because I was unable to get approval to go and their treatment slots are limited. She said she had recently received a lot of calls from high -ranking Naval officers asking if they refuse treatment to unvaccinated people. NICoE does not require vaccination in order to get treatment. 10. I have now been kept from receiving TBI treatment at this program twice because of the Navy's implementation of the COVID -19 vaccination mandate and associated policies restricting travel for unvaccinated service members , both before and after this Court's preliminary injunction was entered. // // Pls.'

Even though the COVID-19 mandate has now been repealed, consequences of the mandate still exist and personally impact my career in the Navy. 5. Since September 2019, I have ranked as an E-7. In November 2021, I was officially serving in a milestone position as Platoon Chief of SEAL Team 7 . A milestone position is a leadership position that must be successfully completed before promoting to the next rank. To be eligible for a milestone, one must screen positive through interviews with Team Master Chiefs, have a good reputation, and successfully complete prior leadership positions. This position was incredibly meaningful to me, as I just deployed with these same men and began my career as a Navy SEAL in the same Platoon and Team I was now leading. Serving as one of the Platoon Chiefs of SEAL Team 7 was an honor. 6. To promote from an E-7 to an E-8, I must fulfill a series of requirements, including service in a milestone position. Until the imposition of the COVID-19 requirements I was on track to fulfill those requirements and complete my milestone, therefore becoming eligible to promote to an E-8. 7. When I submitted my Religious Accommodation Request (RAR) in October of 2021, I was removed from that SEAL team and milestone position and sent back to a training command. I was told by my Command Master Chief in December that regardless of whether my religious accommodation request was granted, I could not serve on a SEAL team. 8. Transferring out of that position and back to a training command ended my potential to promote from an E-7 to an E-8. If I remain non-operational because I am unvaccinated, I will be unable to ever attain this promotion. 9. Prior to the COVID-19 vaccine mandate, I consistently received excellent evaluations and awards, including Sailor of the Year for SEAL Team Seven. Therefore, I was Pls.'

I was eligible for this program as an E-7 with fourteen years of dedicated, exemplary service to the Navy and excellent physical qualifications. 10. In support of my warrant package, I received recommendations from Officers, Warrant Officers, and my Commanding Officer. I received this recommendation because I demonstrated outstanding performance as a SEAL, excellent leadership abilities, and the capacity to serve as an Officer of the United States Navy. True and correct copies of my recommendations are attached to this declaration as Exhibit A. After this recommendation, my warrant package was sent to a selection board at Naval Personnel Command. 11. Among those of us seeking warrant packages before the selection board, I screened second in the group for a position, meaning it was incredibly likely that I would be selected. Ultimately, I did not receive a warrant package, even though people that screen ed below me did. I was told by a CWO3 that my name was removed from consideration because they assumed that I was soon going to be separated from the military because of my RAR. I then received a phone call from a CWO4 explaining how I had frustrated a lot of people that supported my package and that my Commander would not be recommending me any longer. I reached out to the selection board for further clarification about why I was not selected for appointment as a Warrant Officer, but I did not receive a response. 12. There is a prime time for an enlisted sailor to seek appointment as a Warrant Officer, of which I was in. Once an enlisted sailor is appointed as a Warrant Officer, promotion and rank are based on time alone and not on merit or performance. Had I been selected to be a Pls.' Opp. to Assertion of Mootness App. 0105Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 225 Filed 02/13/23 Page 109 of 162 PageID 7610 4 Warrant Officer, I would likely have retired as a W-4, which would have provided me and my family with substantially higher retirement pay than my current position as an enlisted member. 13. Because I am unvaccinated and non-operational, it would be a near impossibility for me to pursue the Warrant Officer program again or even to promote from an E-7 to an E-8. Since submitting my RAR, I lost time necessary for promotion eligibility, regressed in my skills as a SEAL , and have experienced personal hostility within my command that would make it impossible to prepare another warrant package. Within my community, my reputation is so negatively tarnished for being unvaccinated that I feel as if I have transitioned from an exemplary SEAL to a problem that my leadership and command have no desire to deal with. Therefore, I don't believe I will be able to promote again in my career. There is nothing that I have the power to do that can remedy this loss. Further, there is nothing in my personnel file that the Navy can simply remove to remedy this loss of opportunity. 14. The stigma surrounding my unvaccinated status extends beyond my command and my ability to promote. In March of 2022, I was in need of medical treatment and contacted my hospital corpsman (HMC) to schedule an appointment. A HMC serves as a first step in the process for seeking any sort of medical treatment and is able to approve certain treatments based on his or her initial assessment. I was told by my HMC that he would not approve my requested appointment because I was not vaccinated. I offered to test in advance of any medical appointments, yet my treatment was still not approved. Eventually, I went around the HMC to seek medical care. Although I eventually received the requested appointment, I have lost trust in my ability to receive fair medical treatment because of the stigma surrounding my vaccination status. 15. I am in the process of officially transferring from Temporary Assigned Duty orders at Training Detachment-One (Tradet-1) to Naval Special Warfare Group-One (NSWG-1). to Assertion of Mootness App. 0106Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 225 Filed 02/13/23 Page 110 of 162 PageID 7611 5 1 is historically where the Navy sends SEALs with family, character, or performance issues and otherwise is seen as an assignment for those that cause trouble for other commands. I am one of three unvaccinated NSW personnel transferring from Tradet-1 to NSWG-1. Currently, our role in NSWG-1 is complete random tasks assigned to us within the command. I am currently working for a Trident cell that, during the week of February 6, 2023, traveled to a cold weather training trip to Montana that I was not allowed to attend. Instead, I remained at my command and was tasked to move from our old building to a new one a few miles away. 16. I am specifically concerned about my inability to train as a SEAL during the mandate. Because of the highly-specialized nature of Navy SEAL skills, it is nearly impossible to lose two or more years of training opportunities and still maintain the skill level required of a Navy SEAL. Not training prevents me from keeping my skills sharp and at the level my rank and job duties would require. 17. Before the COVID-19 vaccine mandate, my skills were the sharpest they had ever been, and I was teaching skydiving to west coast SEAL Teams and joining other blocks of tactical training. Because I lost so much training time, I do not feel confident that my skills would be sharp enough to lead a SEAL platoon right now, even if I were operational. In a position where I would need to gain the trust and confidence of the men I would lead, I would need to be the tactical subject matter expert. This is the main responsibility of a Platoon Chief. I would need to be refreshed on my skills and new weapon systems before leading junior members of a platoon that are current and up to date. A leader cannot be the weakest link in a platoon. Loss of leadership and skills are quick ways to be fired from a position. These issues and concerns have not changed since the Secretary of Defense rescinded the COVID-19 vaccination mandate on January 10, 2023. Pls.'

I have numerous NSW qualifications which are considered \"critical qualifications,\" including Master Training Specialist, NSW Sniper, NSW Explosive Breacher, NSW Dive Supervisor, Air Ops Trainer Examiner, Military Freefall Jumpmaster, among others. Each SEA L team and SEAL platoon needs to have a certain number of members with these qualifications to be considered fully mission capable. If I remain non-operational because I am not vaccinated, I am jeopardizing the ability of my team to complete missions. 19. Because I remain unvaccinated, the leadership surrounding me is looking for me to mess up or make a mistake so I can be reprimanded. The repeal of the mandate does not change that. 20. My current status is uncertain to both my command and me. Despite the new Force Health Protection Guidance regarding travel, my command still believes that I cannot travel. When I asked my Senior Chief about travel, he sent me to a website that was last updated on November 30, 2022, and stated that this was the policies that Navy was working off of. 21. One of my most recent tasks assigned is moving laptops from one building to another - a job that my command publicly demeaned. I have also been told that I will be heavy task saturated and closely watched. I believe these tasks will be equally menial to those such as moving buildings and transporting laptops. 22. While I was once a committed naval service member with excellent evaluations, several service awards, and a progressing career, that has been lost because of the mandate. This has caused me and my family many sleepless nights, anxiety, and loss of purpose. My career is suffering and will continue to suffer if my leadership continues to make operational, assignment, and deployment decisions while considering my unvaccinated status. These are the decisions that have already damaged my career, and I expect they will continue based on the Secretary's January Pls.'

After commissioning, I began as a Surface Warfare Officer (\"SWO\") working on the USS Roosevelt, a guided missile destroyer. Onboard, I was the Electrical Officer and collaterally the Religious Lay Leader. This was my first deployment, which lasted nine months. As the Religious Lay Leader, I was leading five services per week in the absence of chaplains. 6. During my second tour from February 2016 to February 2018, I served as Navigator, Administrative Officer, Electrical Officer, and Training Officer onboard the USS Devastator, a mine sweeper out of Manama, Bahrain. I also served as the command's Religious Lay Leader; however, due to being mostly pier-side, our Sailors had access to base chaplains on a continual basis. 7. In 2017, I committed to serving in the Navy until on or about 2026. As part of that commitment, I screened for Department Head on my first look and was accepted, which is very difficult to accomplish because it is a highly competitive process. I also applied for a Talent Management Selection Board and was selected to attend the Naval Postgraduate School. 8. As part of accepting my offer to attend Naval Postgraduate School, I obligated myself to fulfill the role of a Department Head at sea for three years after graduation from Department Head school and accepted a retention bonus of $105,000, that would be dispersed incrementally, to do so. The NAVADMIN that applies to my Department Head Retention Bonus is from 2016 and is entirely unrelated to any COVID-19 vaccination guidance. 9. The retention bonus I was awarded has been paid in installments since 2017. To date, I have received six of eight total installments. The last installment I received was in November of 2021. I expected to receive a $15,000 payment in November of 2022; however, it was withheld for reasons explained below. No one in my chain of command has discussed with me the fact that my bonus payments stopped. The total amount I have received so far is $75,000. Pls.'

From March 2018 until 2019, I attended the Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey where I received a degree in National Security Studies writing a thesis paper comparing contemporary Russian and Soviet Naval strategy and completed my Joint Professional Military Education at the Navy War College. During my time in postgraduate school, I was the President of the Surface Navy Association, Monterey Bay. In the Surface Warfare community, that's a non-governmental entity that meets for fellowship with a mission of promoting coordination and communication between military professionals with a specific interest in Naval Surface Warfare. 11. After postgraduate school, in October 2019, I was assigned to Commander Amphibious Squadron Eight out of Norfolk, Virginia as the Future Operations Officer. During my deployment with that command from December 2019 through June of 2020, I was primarily responsible for mission and exercise planning. 12. From the time COVID-19 began in March 2020 through May 2020, I was still deployed and located in Bahrain, functioning as a naval liaison officer between Task Force 51.5 and Commander Amphibious Squadron Eight, and moved over 400 personnel to and from ships back to the United States across multiple theaters of operations. My additional duties included delivering meals to personnel who were quarantining coming to and from the United States to our ships and from our ships to the United States , getting care for injured and mentally ill Sailors and Marines, and finding ways to get service members home to their dying loved ones when commercial air routes were non-existent. 13.

I also moved approximately 200 Marines from their ships and quarantined them on base in Greece before sending them to the United States. 15. Although I was constantly exposed, I did not catch COVID-19 until July 2022 and had a very mild case, with symptoms lasting only three days. I have not had COVID-19 since. 16. After my deployment, in June 2020 until August of 2021, the same month the Department of Defense COVID-19 vaccination mandate went into effect, I returned to Norfolk, Virginia and assumed duties as the Staff Administrative Officer, Senior Watch Officer, and Anti- Terrorism Officer. The Senior Watch Officer position is a highly regarded position that is normally reserved for a higher-ranking officer, specifically a post-Department Head O-4, Lieutenant Commander, at the Staff level, but was given to me in my current position as an O-3, Lieutenant. 17. In August of 2021, as part of my commitment to serve in the Navy until 2026, I was transitioned to Department Head School in Newport, Rhode Island where I began my studies in October of that year. I graduated in April of 2022. However, because my Religious Accommodation Request (\"RAR\") to not receive the COVID-19 vaccines was denied, my orders to be Chief Engineer, which is a Department Head position, onboard LCS 11 were canceled, Exhibit A, and I have since been stashed at the Surface Warfare School Command's engineering department (N74) as an instructor without a definitive set of orders or an end date in sight. 18.

My RAR was denied in December of 2021, and I submitted my appeal that same month. 21. I received the final denial of my RAR in February of 2022. 22. After receiving my final denial, later in February 2022, I received a Page 13 counseling, a Report of Misconduct, and was given a Notice to Show Cause. 23. After receiving those documents, on March 4, 2022, I attempted to leave my responsive statement package to my Notice to Show Cause with the Director of the Department Head School, as required. The Director was expecting me to hand deliver papers that morning, so, I knocked on the Director's door to his office, said, \"Sir . . . hello,\" and received no response. Then another officer walked into the Director's office and he and the Director had a conversation. I waited outside the Director's office for him and the officer to complete their conversation. When the Director finally walked out, he looked at me and then continued walking past me without saying a word. This is typical of the treatment I have received from senior leadership throughout the course of this litigation. 24. The Notice to Show Cause initiated my Board of Inquiry, which is the Navy's process for discharging Sailors. I had the option to be administratively separated in exchange for an Honorable discharge (for Commission of a Serious Offense) but declined. 25. Thankfully, the Board of Inquiry process was suspended as a result of this Court's issuance of the class-wide preliminary injunction on March 29, 2022. It is only because of this Court's intervention that I have been able to maintain my career in the Navy. However, the injunctive relief does not cure the fact that I could be forced to pay the Navy the bonus monies I already received along with the costs of my post-graduate and Naval War College education.

Because I am not vaccinated, I have not been able to become a Department Head, as originally expected when I signed my commitment in 2017, which triggers the Recoupment and Repayment Policy referenced at paragraph 9 of NAVADMIN 206/16. 27.

Subsequent guidance in NAVADMIN 102/22, which has not been canceled or suspended, states that because I am unvaccinated, my bonus installment payments would end and \"become unearned.\" This guidance was implemented after class-wide injunctive relief was granted on March 29, 2022. 29. The relevant sections of NAVADMIN 102/22 that apply to me are as follows: \"RMKS/1. Purpose. To provide additional guidance regarding the actions directed in references (a) through (h) for Navy service members who requested religious accommodation from the COVID-19 vaccination requirement.

To ensure compliance with the court order in reference (i), this NAVADMIN continues to suspend separation processing and certain adverse administrative consequences of COVID-19 vaccine refusal for Navy service members who submitted requests for religious accommodation from the COVID-19 vaccine requirement.

This NAVADMIN applies only to Navy service members who have submitted requests for religious accommodation from the COVID-19 vaccine requirement in line with references (k) and (l).\" 32. \"4.b.3. Bonus, Special Pays, and Incentive Pays. Bonuses, special pays and incentive pays are considered unearned for personnel who have been removed from assignment based on deployment and other operational decisions. Reference (c) [NAVADMIN 256/21, which has not been canceled] provides guidance on required actions for members with unearned bonuses, special pays and incentives.\" 33. NAVADMIN 256/21 states at paragraph \"8. [that] Bonuses, Special Pays and Incentive Pays. Navy service members refusing the vaccine may not enter into any new agreements for bonuses, special pays, or incentive pays and any unearned portion of current bonuses, special pays and incentive pays will be recouped in accordance with references (r) through (u). Examples include, but are not limited to, the following: career retention bonuses, enlistment bonuses and incentive pays (such as flight pay). Bonuses, special pays and incentive pays become unearned when a Navy service member refusing the vaccine is no longer performing duties for which they are receiving such a bonus, special pay, or incentive pay (i.e. removed from assignment).\" 34. NAVADMIN 256/21 further states at paragraph \"9.a. [that] Institutional Education. Navy service members refusing the vaccine who incurred a service obligation for an education benefit (e.g. USNA, ROTC, Naval Postgraduate School, Health Professional Scholarship Program or in-residence Professional Military Education), will have any unearned portion of that education benefit recouped if separated before completing the service obligation.

Note: Current USNA and ROTC Midshipmen will be adjudicated by governing instructions as discussed in para. 3.a.\" 35. Because vaccination status is still being considered, current Navy policies indicate that I will be required to reimburse the cost of the education received, plus my retention bonus, which amounts to $75,000 and whatever the Navy determines I owe for studies at Naval Postgraduate School and the Naval War College for Joint Professional Military Education. 36. I have ranked ahead of my peers since I commissioned in 2013 until submission of my RAR. 37. While I was selected in May of 2022 for Lieutenant Commander, O-4, my understanding is that my promotion will be withheld. I have reason to believe that it will be withheld because I have firsthand knowledge of another Lieutenant, selected for Lieutenant Commander, whose promotion is still being withheld as a result of submitting a RAR, despite the mandate being rescinded. Further, I have not received any additional information or guidance from my command or my detailer to suggest otherwise. My command had no idea that I was even selected for Lieutenant Commander and did not celebrate that achievement with me, which is the normal course of action when officers are selected to promote to the next grade. 38. Until the implementation of the August 24, 2021, vaccine mandate, throughout my career, I have been very well-respected and held in high regard among my peers and those in leadership positions. 39. The fact that I will be required to repay my bonus and cost of my postgraduate education is discriminatory, will be damaging to my career and personally financially crippling, and has caused me significant and officially documented anxiety and depression with PTSD-like Pls.'

The cost of repayment will completely wipe out all of my investment accounts and savings, which could further hamper my ability to provide for my wife and four children. 40. As indicated in Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro's speech on December 6, 2022 to the Navy League, the Navy will not allow me and others who are unvaccinated for COVID- 19 to return to full operational duty, despite the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act rescinding the COVID-19 vaccination mandate. (https://news.usni.org/2022/12/07/pentagon- unclear-how-military-would-handle-end-of-mandatory-covid-19-vaccines). I have done everything in my own power to complete the necessary schools and prepare myself for the job that the Navy will not let me do, which is Department Head. 41. The fact that I cannot become a Department Head is discriminatory and is having a detrimental impact on my entire career, my family's financial security, and our mental wellbeing. If my career continues down this path, I may be forced out of the military and may not promote. I have spent the entirety of my career, up to this point, preparing to become a Department Head. As Navigator, I was a non-billeted Department Head, i.e., a Department Head in practice but not official title. I had all the rights and duties onboard the ship, which my second tour Division Officer counterparts did not. As the Future Operations Officer (N5) and Administrative Officer (N1) at Commander Amphibious Squadron Eight, I was treated as and functioned as a staff Department Head, but like being a Navigator, I was not a billeted Department Head. I had the same duties and responsibilities as my billeted staff Department Head counterparts; however, my time in those positions did not count for me like it did for them. 42. What brings me sufficient anxiety and depression is that I know that if I am unable to ever fulfill the role of Department Head, I will not be able to achieve my next career milestones or take command of a warship, and I will have a heavy financial burden to pay back to the Navy, Pls.'

When I received my bonuses, I paid taxes on those bonuses. When the Navy claws back those bonuses, my understanding is that they will do so based on the original amount - meaning I will be out even more than what I was paid. I will essentially pay taxes on those sums of money, twice. 43. Like my career initially ended in 2009 due to an injury, I'm afraid that my career has essentially ended again. It is my understanding that if I cannot promote by 2025, I may be faced with meeting a career continuation board. My understanding is that this board convenes to decide whether or not I can stay in the Navy and may eventually lead to my early separation from the Navy because I have not been performing the job that I was trained to do. Because I have 10 more years before retirement, this means that I could lose out on all of my retirement benefits, which includes retirement pay, medical benefits for me and my family, loss of my GI bill education benefits if I receive a general discharge. A general discharge characterization could also have negative collateral impacts beyond the military context. 44. Further, the treatment I have sustained as an unvaccinated member of the Navy has given me enough anxiety and depression that it is now documented in my record, with PTSD-like symptoms. I have been consistently sought after to update Page 13s, be counseled on my RAR, RAR appeal, Report of Misconduct, Notice to Show Cause, and Board of Inquiry. The manner in which I was discriminated against led to my peers constantly questioning what was going on, why I was being targeted, etc. 45. Due to the small size of my family's base housing, which was supposed to be temporary, half of our belongings are required to be kept in Non-Temporary Storage (\"NTS\"). For context, my wife and I are currently living in a 1,400 square foot home with four boys. Our NTS has almost converted to be entirely our expense (not the Navy's) on two occasions because the Pls.'

I have asked my detailer, who is my correspondent with personnel command and is the person who assists with managing my career, a number of times about this and every time he claims it is impossible for me to be issued orders. This has placed further stress on me and my family. 46. Finally, throughout this entire ordeal, neither the Commanding Officer nor Executive Officer of Surface Warfare Schools Command have personally sat down with me to discuss my RAR, my RAR denials, or my RAR appeal. With the exception of signing Page 13s given to me by an O-5 Commander, as a result of the RAR denials, all conversations were delegated to an O-4, Lieutenant Commander, who has no real positional significance in my command. My upper-level leadership continuously demonstrates that I mean nothing to them as a person or a SWO, despite the fact that I have continued to successfully perform my duties, albeit with a tremendously heavy and anxious heart, but while also receiving high remarks from students, peers, and my immediate leadership. 47. At one point during the mandate, I was required to wear stickers on my badge that signified that I was unvaccinated and that I was allowed to enter the building. 48. Although the Secretary of Defense rescinded the COVID-19 vaccination mandate on January 10, 2023, nothing about my above-referenced circumstances has changed. In light of the fact that the Navy will continue to consider my vaccination status for deployment, assignment, and operational decisions, I think that, without court intervention, all of the negative consequences for being unvaccinated, as listed above, will persist.

I am a Master -at- Arms, which is a Navy law enforcement officer. I am stationed in the Norfolk, Virginia area and assigned to the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D Eisenhower . 3. I have a sincere religious objection to receiving the COVID -19 vaccine as mandated by the Navy. I n September 2021, I submitted a religious accommodation request .

We decided that it would be better if I just allowed the Navy to separate me, and it seemed that I would be out sooner if I did not appeal. I submitted the paperwork required to start the separation process with PERS-832 on January 7, 2022. On January 28, 2022, my separation package was routed off -ship. The same day, I signed my notice of separation, and I was in formed that I should expect to be out of the Navy by February 14, 2022. 4. In reliance on that, my husband and I gave our landlord 30 days ' noti ce and moved out of our apartment at the end of Februar y. My husband went to stay with my parents in New York . Because I could not leave the area, I moved onto the berthing barge for the Eisenhower . 5. The conditions on the barge are deplorable, m uch like the USS George Washi ngton, which is anchored in the same shipyard . 1 There is mold everywhere and the barge 's toilets back up ( see Exhibit A) and leak (see Exhibit B). The water leaks out of the base of the toilet and collects near my rack and out into the hall. On bad days, it goes into the berthings on the other side. The leaks seem to be sewage\u2014 it sme lls like sewage and looks like it too. See Exhibit C (water I've mopped up from under my rack). There is some sort of worm thriving in the stagnant water in the toilet bowls and on the floor in the leaked water around the base of the toilets. See Exhibit D. 6. Needless to say, I do not feel comfortable or safe in this environment and I have contacted mental health services multiple times. 7. There are nine other individuals in my department who submitted religious accommodation requests. One of those individuals, Jesse Flores, is a L ogistics Specialist (LS1). He bought a new home for his family in Texas believing the Navy' s representatio ns that he would be 1 See \"Report: Hundreds of USS George Washington sailors living aboard ship to be moved off,\" Navy Times , Being Moved Off Carrier After Surge of Suicides, Captain Tells Crew ,\" Military Times Page 15 of 120 PageID 5323Case 4:21-cv-01236-O Document 178 Filed 06/08/22 Page 15 of 120 PageID 5323separated soon. He has been living on the same berthing as me in similar conditions . Waiting to be separated with no end in sight has been extremely hard and has made it impossible to try to make plans for jobs or homes after we leave the Navy. 8. My husband recently suffered a work- related injury and has lost almost all vision in his left eye. He may not be able to work and I need to be able to be with him to help. 9. Sometime in April, we were told by the Navy that we would not be able to separate due to the class action . In May, I asked if I could be se parated if I withdrew my religious accommodation request and I was told that I could not do that. 10. Thus, I have not withdrawn my request. I do want \u2014des perately \u2014to be separated from the Navy as soon as possible , but I struggle with withdrawing my request as I feel it c ould signal that my religious objection was somehow not genuine, and it is .

I have been assigned to this unit since November 1, 2020. I was previously assigned to the 97th Flying Training Squadron at Sheppard AFB, which is also part of the 340th Flying Training Group from November 26, 2014 to October 31, 2020. 5.As an Assistant Flight Commander, my duties include assisting the Flight Commander with managing the T-38 Flight, which is comprised of approximately 12 other Instructor Pilots (IPs). I write travel orders for the Flight, ensure that everyone is paid for work performed, and process the other IPs' travel vouchers. 6.As a T-38 IP, my duties include maintaining my own proficiency in flying the T-38 and teaching the next generation of future fighter and bomber pilots. The T -38 is a two-seat fighter-type aircraft. When I instruct students in the aircraft, I sit in the rear cockpit and a student sits in the front cockpit. Flight instruction includes a pre-flight briefing and a post- flight debriefing that takes place in person, without masking or social distancing. 7.When I am on orders, my duties also include attending weekly Squadron Leadership meetings in person, without masking or social distancing. 8.On October 14, 2021, I submitted a Religious Accommodation Request (\"RAR\") to be exempted from the COVID-19 vaccine requirement. On January 7, 2022, I received the initial denial of my RAR from Headquarters Air Force Reserve Command.

On April 15, 2022, my RAR appeal was ultimately denied. The reasons cited for the denial were mission readiness and that no lesser accommodation in existence. 9.On May 18, 2022, I was granted a medical exemption to the Air Force' s COVID-19 vaccine requirement. I have been granted that exemption until at least June 21, 2023. 10.With my medical exemption in place, I am able to work, fly, and earn pay and points in my normal role as a traditional reservist and T-38 IP. In other words, I can perform all of my assigned duties that I would otherwise perform if I was vaccinated. The only restriction placed on me due to my unvaccinated status is that I am not allowed to go on Temporary Duty orders away from Vance AFB. This means that while I can fly missions domestically and perform all the duties of an IP, I am not permitted to stay overnight anywhere other than Vance AFB when I am on orders. This restriction on travel policy is in place for unvaccinated service members across the Air Force. However , I am allowed to travel to Vance AFB from my home in Colbert, WA to perform my duties as an IP and Assistant Flight Commander at the Air Force's expense. 11.There is another IP in my squadron at Vance AFB who also has a COVID-19 vaccine medical exemption and is also allowed to work and fly in accordance with her regular duties. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on June 23, 2022. ________________________________________ Michael B.

As explained in Plaintiffs' briefing, the appeals for numerous class members are still being processed by the Navy. As part of this process, commanding officers have the option to submit endorsements in favor of an appeal. Attached is an endorsement from a Navy Commander urging the Navy to approve SWCC 3 's religious accommodation request , which was received by SWCC 3 on November 16, 2022. In analyzing the Navy's asserted compelling interests, the Commander concludes no such compelling interest exists when SWCC 3 's age, fitness, and medical history is considered alongside the marginal benefit of the vaccine to protect individuals against the Omicron variant of the virus, which now accounts for most COVID -19 infections. The Commander also concludes that the mandate is not the least restrictive means of accomplishing the Navy's interest because natural immunity, masking, and good hygiene are less restrictive alternatives. Indeed, according to the Commander, enforcing the mandate will result in the loss of personnel necessary for accomplishing the Commander's mission. This endorsement further illustrate s that the Navy has failed to satisfy RFRA's rigorous standard . Counsel also points the Court to the recent decision in Doster v. Kendall , No. 22 - 3497/3702, 2022 (6th Cir. Nov. 29, 2022). In Doster , a unanimous panel of t he Sixth Circuit upheld preliminary injunctions for both individual Air Force servicemembers and a class of Air Force servicemembers.

The Sixth Circuit noted that the Air Force (like the Navy here) asked it \"to read RFRA as if it simply codified the ' great deference' that the Supreme Court had previously given to the military under the Free Exercise Clause. . . .

Executive Summary: I acknowledge up front the length of this endorsement. This is owed to several reasons: a. This jd:w,1-s final administrative opportunity for accommodation of his religious beliefs, and l believe it is my responsibility to comprehensively and accurately address this matter. b. The law requires a good faith, case-by-case review. c. My force, the Naval Special Warfare Reserve Component, is grappling with retention challenges due in part to the manner in which religious accommodation requests like that from S\\\\\u00a58M have thus far been processed and adjudicated by the Navy. for mission-related reasons subsequently discussed, I cannot afford to lose more quality Sailors. I take no comfort in my role in this process, which effectjvely places me between well\u00ad intentioned Navy and DoD policies addressing unvaccinated Sailors and the duly enacted law of the land that outlines a standard which, when applied i11 MIU ''> specific case, dictates an outcome contrary to that contemplated by the Navy's more generalized policies. I believe my role in this process is twofold: 1) to carry out Navy policy and the orders of those above me; and, 2) to honestly apply the law -the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) -to the specific facts on the ground and, as the NSW commander closest to this Sailor, his unit, and the operational requirements he is needed to fill, to candidly communicate my ground-level observations. I do not take this role -nor my charge of command and oath -lightly, and 5 OF DENIAL FOR WAJVER OF POLICY IN SUPPORT OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE this lengthy, cumbersome document -which has been staffed, re-staffed, and then staffed some more -evidences the seriousness with which I approach this matter. Further, I sincerely hope the forthcoming analysis and ground-level detail on \u00a711@ his unit, my force, and my manning challenges illuminates a path to reconcile our considerable efforts to foster a diverse and inclusive force with our interests to protect the health and safety of that force. 2. Standard of Review: I initially reviewed and endorse<l ffl11@'s request for religious accommodation on 15 December 2021. I carefully applied the guid_ance in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and implementing DOD, SECNAV, and BUPERS instructions, which led to the conclusion that approval of his request was justified by both fact and law. Now, reviewinr fflff@'s appeal with nine months' worth of additional data and observations to inform my decision-making and recommendations, the grounds justifying approval of his religious exemption request are even stronger. To be clear, I have personally recommended that all my teammates, including f:\u00bb'Ii@, get one of the COVID shots. Alas, my personal preferences must subordinate to the Constitution -to which I have repeatedly sworn an oath -and must acquiesce to the duly-enacted laws of the nation, passed by Congress and signed by the President. In f4\\11@ 'c; case, the governing law is RFRA, passed with bipartisan support in the House and then by a 97-3 vote in the Senate before being signed into law by President Clinton in November 1993. Drafted and passed with the express purpose of bolstering the Constitution's protections of the Free Exercise of religion against government intrusions 1, this unambiguous and purposefully-crafted statute places the burden of proof on the government -defined to encompass every \"branch, department, agency, instrumentality, and official (or other person acting under color oflaw) of the United States\" -when government action or mandate substantially burdens a citizen's First Amendment rights to free religious exercise. RFRA forbids any substantial government burden on an individual's Free Exercise unless the government \"demonstrates\" the substantial burden it's imposing ( 1) \"is in furtherance of a compelling government interest\" and (2) \"is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling government interest.\" Underscoring that the burden of proof rests on the government, not the individual, RFRA defines \"demonstrates\" as \"meets the burdens of going forward with the evidence and of persuasion.\" 3. Case law further underscores that the government's charge under RFRA is considerable, and the bar it must clear to substantially burden an individual's free exercise rights is high. As the Supreme Court has reiterated, RFRA affords even \"greater protection for religious exercise than is available under the First Amendment\" and provides that the \"Government may substantially burden a person's exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person-{!) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\" Holt v. Hobbs, 574 U.S. 352, 357 (2015). Once an individual entitled to the protections of RFRA -as \u00a7\\II@ unquestionably is -demonstrates a substantial burden on his exercise of religion -as he unquestionably has -\"RFRA requires the Government to demonstrate that the compelling interest test is satisfied through application of the challenged law 'to the person' -the particular claimant whose sincere exercise of religion is being substantially burdened.\" Gonzales v. 0 1 Expressly-stated in the statute, reference (a), RFRA is intended\"( I) to restore the compelling interest test ... in alJ cases where free exercise ofreligion is substantiaily burdened[] and (2) to provide a claim or defense to persons whose religious exercise is substantially burdened by government.\" 6 OF DENIAL FOR WAlVER OF SUPPORT OF RELIGIOUS PRACTIC E Centro Espirita Benejicente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 430-431 By focusing on \"the burden to the person,\" RFRA's burden of proof requires the government justify its action or policies burdening Free Exercise not with generalizations and conclusory statements about its compelling interests or about. broadly, the absence of less restrictive means to further those interests. \"RFRA demands a 'more focused' inquiry and requires scrutiny of the \"marginal interest in enforcing' the challenged government action in that particular context. Colonel Financial Management Officer v. Austin, 8:22-CV-1275 -SDM-TGW (M.D. Fla. Aug. 18, 2022) (citing Holt, 574 U.S. at 363 (citing Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 694-95 (2014))). Applying the court's admonition from an ongoing case concerning the Marine Corp's discharge of its RFRA obligations to the present matter, \"RFRA requires in practice that the [Navy] articulate -that is, display for informed review -the [Navy's] calculation ofthe extent of the adverse effect on the health and readiness of the force that results from alJowing a particular [Sailor] to faithfully observe the [Sailor]'s sincere religious belief while serving any reasonable health and safety practice the [Navy] might prescribe and explain why incurring that marginal adverse effect unacceptably impairs some compelling governmental interest.\" Colonel Financial Management Officerv. Austin, 8:22-CV-1275-SDM~TGW (M.D. Fla. Aug. 18, 2022) (emphasis mine). 4. While I personally disagree with f\u00a7\\lWls calculus on the SARS-CoV-2 shots and while I do not fully understand all of his religious beliefs, I respect them and their constitutional -ction: Furthermore, I hav. e no reason to question the veracity and deep-seated nature of\u00ad 's religious convictions nor the religious grounding of his objection to compelled inoculation, noting simply that a respected military chaplain supporting - - has assessed and confirmed the religious sincerity of his objection. As such, the ensuing question is whether the Navy's requirement that@jWI receive an approved COVID-19 pharmaceutical intervention substantially burdens his First Amendment rights to free exercise of his Christian faith. The government burdens the free exercise of religion when it \"put[s] substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.\" Thomasv. Rev. Bd. Of Ind. affirmatively compels [an individual], under threat of criminal sanction, to perform acts undeniably at odds with fundamental tenets of their religious beliefs,\" Wisconsin v. Yoder,. 406 U.S. 205,218 (1972), where the government forced an individual to choose between their job and their religious beliefs, see Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 404 (1963), and, where an individual is \"coerced to act contrary to their religious beliefs by threat of civil or criminal sanctions.\" Navajo Nation v. US. Forest Serv., 535 F.3d I 058, 1069-70 (9th Cir. 2008). \"Of course, the injection into the body of a substance against which Ill -harbors a sincere religious objection ... burdens Free Exercise. And the burden is substantial ... because the order to accept injection of the vaccine forces [him] to choose between betraying a sincere religious conviction and suffering court martial or separation from the military\" along with an array of collateral consequences including, but not limited to, severance of his and his family's entitlement to valuable medical benefits and of the opportunity to realize a retirement pension. Colonel Financial Management Officer at 33-34. 5. Because the choice forced upor, NII@-to violate his sincerely held religious convictions or surrender his career as a Navy Reservist along with its accompanying entitlements -substantially burdens his religious exercise, the government must demonstrate that placing this burden on@IIWI both furthers a compelling government interest and does so by the least 7 CUI// OF DENIAL FOR W AlVER OF POLICY IN SUPPORT OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE restrictive means. Before addressing whether these tests are satisfied \"to the person\" of- 11111 specifically, I would be remiss to not address the manner in which the Navy, generally, has processed notjust@Wl's religious accommodation request but, by a1l indications, those of the over 40 service members supporting my claimancy who similarly sought the protection of Rf RA and petitioned for accommodation of their Free Exercise rights. Whereas an \"individualized assessment\" of each religious accommodation applicant is required in discharging the compelling interest and least-restrictive means tests, the Chief of Naval Personnel (CNP) has, per public reports, denied every one of the thousands of religiously -based exemption requests of Navy service members, apparently while utilizing a SOP (enclosure (1)) that directed creation of a disapproval letter draft before a servicemember's request was even read. I recognize the difficulty of the task faced by the Chief of Naval Personnel (CNP) and subordinate Religious Accommodations staff, which I have to assume was not staffed as necessary to process thousands of requests, such as Nll@'s. I understand the time-intensity and nuance required to afford each and every request the individualized examination and good faith analysis required by RFRA- and to make an individualized, fact-based assessment of \"not whether [the Navy has] a compelling interest in enforcing its [ vaccination] policies generally, but whether it has such an interest in denying an exception to [ each individual Sailor, like II -who made an actionable request].\" Fulton, 141 S. Ct. at 1881. But, that is what the law\u00ad and our own implementing instructions -requires. As recently as 2020, Justice Ali to emphasized that the government has a \"high bar\" to clear in RFRA cases. The Supreme Court and federal appellate courts have repeatedly emphasized that the bar is raised even higher ''[w]here a regulation already provides an exception from the law for a particular group[.]\" McAllen Grace Brethern Church v. Salazar, 764 F.3d 465,472 (5th Cir. 2014) (citations omitted); see also Fulton v. City of Phi/a., 141 S. Ct. 1868, 1878-83. I fear that is precisely the situation at play here, where the Navy has granted hundreds of temporary or permanent medical exemptions -and exempted, at least temporari ly, those who participated in clinical trials, even those in the control group -while summarily denying those petitioners seeking accommodation under the First Amendment and RFRA. 6. Having established that the Navy's requirement to receive an FDA-approved SARS-CoV-2 pharmaceutical intervention substantially burdens@J\\11Wl's First Amendment rights to free exercise of religion, we must next ask whether enforcing this requirement, againstfflllW specifically, furthers a compelling government inkrest. Although not explicitly defined in this context, \"compelling\" has often been described as \"essential\" or \"necessary\" rather than a matter of choice, preference, or discretion. See Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429, 432 (1984) (\"Such classifications are subject to the most exacting scrutiny; to pass constitutional muster, they must be justified by a compelling governmental interest and must be 'necessary ... to the accomplishment' of their legitimate purpose,\" citing McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U.S. 184, 196 (1964).) (In the context of the Free Exercise.ofreligion, the Court in Wisconsin v. Yoder allowed Amish parents to withdraw their children from school at age fourteen, despite the state requiring school attendance until sixteen, finding that the state's interest in an additional two years of education, and the benefits therefrom, was not compelling enough to burden the free practice of religion. 406 U.S. 205 (1972).) 7. Since the emergence of COVID-19 in 2020 and the 2021 mandate (reference (b)) that all Sailors \"be fully vaccinated ... with an FDA approved vaccination against COVID-19,'' Senior Navy officials have, as justification for mandated inoculation, at various times invoked APPEAL OF DENIAL FOR WAIVER OF POLICY IN SUPPORT OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE of compelling government interests, often in broad terms, which could generally be categorized as follows: a. the health and safety of the force, b. the health and safety of the individual Sailor, and c. organizational readiness, unit cohesion, and mission accomplishment. As noted in paragraph (3), above, \"RFRA, however, contemplates a 'more focused' inquiry: It 'requires the Government to demonstrate that the compelling interest test is satisfied through application of the challenged law 'to the person'-tbe particular claimant whose sincere exercise ofreligion is being substantially burdened.\" Burwell, 573 U.S., at 694-95, O Centro, 546 at 430-431 (quoting [RFRA]). \"This requires us to 'loo[k] beyond broadly formulated interests' and to 'scrutiniz[e] the asserted harm of granting specific exemptions to particular religious claimants ]-in other words, to look to the marginal interest in enforcing the [government] mandate.\" Id., citing O Centro, supra, at 431. 8. Does the Navy's requirement tflat@\\\u00a5191 specifically, receive an injection with one ofthe COVID-19 pharmaceuticals further a compelling Navy interest in the health and safety of the force -that is, ofS\\)tlWl's shipmates? Is it necessary that @\\'lfM receive one of these drugs -over hls sincere religious objection -to protect the health and safety of the force? While I readily acknowledge the Navy's interest in protecting the \"health and safety of the force,\" and have previously recommended denial of a number of religious accommodation requests on these grounds, I must also recognize the evolving factual reality of the virus. Whereas in the initial weeks of the vaccines' rollout one could argue that mandatory injection of the Pfizer-Biontech or Moderna pharmaceuticals furthered the Navy's compelling government interest in health and safety by curtailing infection and spread of SARS-CoV-2, Omicron and the growing body of data now available has voided that narrative. 9 CUI II HlPAA APPEAL OF DENIAL FOR WAIVER OF POLICY IN SUPPORT OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE 9. As the CDC metrics below unambiguously illustrate, Omicron bas crowded out Delta and all other strains of the SARS-Co V-2 virus; it is not only the dominant variant, but effectively , the sole variant currently active in our country and almost every country on Earth. Any new cases of non-Omicron variants no longer register in the CDC's national data. And, as Omicron has asserted dominance, it has become irrefutably clear that the vaccines do little to reduce the transmission of the disease. In lieu of painstakingly cataloging the wealth of evidence illustrating the futility of the currently-available vaccinations against Omicron infection, I'll add a more personal anecdote. Every senior member of this command -including the triad and every individual on the review chain for this correspondence -has recently caught. and recovered from, Omicron. We had all received double doses ( or more). of the same pharmaceuticals NII@ ~eeks exemption from taking, but all of our interventions - United Slatu: 611912022 -11/24/2022 i 1<. u ~ d, ~ ~ ~ \" \" P. r :;; \"' ;. -were impotent against such a contagious and vaccine-resistant virus. Enclosure (2) tracks the COVID-19 infection s and vaccination status of personnel in our small Headquarters element -hardly an endorsement for the efficacy of the vaccines in preventing infection, and impossible to ignore when honestly assessing whether compelled injection of Sailors like NIIMI is necessary to protect his fellow Sailors. 10. Mirroring the anecdotal conclusions unavoidably drawn from Naval Special Warfare Group ELEVEN 's (NSWG-11) infection data (and that of my subordinate SEAL Teams), reference (c) emphasizes \"it is increasingly clear that current vaccines provide, at most, partial and transient protection against infection , which decreases precipitously after a few months, with secondary transmission largely unaffected (in other words: an infected vaccinated person poses similar risks to others as an infected unvaccinated person). The CDC states: 'anyone with Omicron infection, regardless of vaccination status or whether or not they have symptoms, can spread the virus to others.' It is therefore inaccurate to infer a sustained or long-term reduction in transmission from a short-term reduction in infection.\" Beyond the numerous studies making this point, a multitude 10 CUI//HIPAA Case: APPEAL OF DENIAL FOR WANER OF POLICY IN SUPPORT OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE of real world case data has reflected, and public health and pharmaceutical authorities have admitted, the inefficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines in preventing infection . For instance, despite being hailed as one of the most vaccinated (and \"boosted\") nations on Earth, Israel saw its largest ever case counts as Omicron spread throughout its borders. Despite a supermajority of its population vaccinated with the same Pfizer-Biontech formula mandated upon ffl11N Israel nevertheless saw its infection counts surge more than ten-fold the numbers of any prior wave, including waves before any SARS-Co V-2 shots were available (Enclosure (2)). In Iceland, an island nation with over 93% of adults vaccinated and 70% \"boosted,\" Omicron ushered in a 32,611 % surge in cases since May 2021, when our nation's Director of the National Institution of Allergy and Infectious Diseases remarked that if 70% of adults receive at least a single vaccination dose, \"the chances of a surge are extraordinarily low.\" (Enclosure (3) ). My intent in rehashing statements like this is to illustrate just how comprehensively Omicron has changed the public health landscape and upended guidance and recommendations that were once considered almost axiomatic. Even vaccine manufacturers have conceded this: \"We know that the two doses of the [Pfizer-Biontech] vaccine offer very limited protection, if any [from disease transmission].\" That statement was made in a Yahoo Finance TV interview on 11 January 2022 by Albert Bourla, the CEO of Pfizer. Two days earlier, in an interview on CNN, Rochelle Wolinsky, Director of the CDC, conceded, \"What [the vaccines] can't do anymore is prevent transmission.\" Why would the Navy suggest otherwise? 11. To maintain the trust and conficlence of my subordinates, it is critical I speak truthfully and rationally, particularly in matters impacting their personal health and safety and their unalienable liberties. Bearing this in mind, I note that dozens of Sailors in my claimancy have already submitted religious exemption requests and received virtually identically worded digitally-signed letters from the Chief of Naval Personnel disapproving those requests. Suggesting that Sailors like AA\\1f M disproportionately risk spreading COVID-19 to their shipmates, these disapproval letters all argue that \"a waiver of immunizations would have a predictable and detrimental effect on your readiness and the readiness of the Sailors who serve alongside you\" and that \"you will inevitably be expected to live and work in close proximity with your shipmates.\" Further, some ofrny Sailors requested and received copies of the documentation ostensibly undergirding those disapproval decisions and boilerplate letters2. Even as Omicron continued to spread and grow in dominance, I noticed a static focus on the notion that the Pfizer\u00ad Biontech phamaceutical prevents the spread of SARS-Co V-2 and conveys immunity. For instance, one of my claimancy Sailors, whose religious accommodation request was disapproved after Omicron had become the dominant strain, received \"board notes\" containing this paragraph articulating why compelled injection is, apparently, the only viable tool to prevent the spread of, or infection with, SARS-Co V-2: \"All alternative measures for preventing spread of disease are insufficient due to unique circumstances in naval service. Vaccination is the only viable option for achieving the compelling interest. Immunity is not instantaneous, and Sailors assigned to shore must be ready to deploy at a moment's notice.\" Suggesting the approved vaccines convey immunity and prevent spread of disease, this assertion is not simply outdated, it's observably false when applied to Omicron. While one might credibly argue the vaccines offer some marginal therapeutic benefit in the event a service member subsequently contracts the virus (and ffllV notes in his appeal that he has not received decisional documentation relating to the denial of his religious accommodation. He argues, \"[t]his severely limits my ability to appeal my denial because I do not know what it is that I am appealing or on what grounds my request was denied.\" 11 CUI OF DENIAL FOR WAJVER OF POLICY IN SUPPORT OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE this would need to be an individually-tailored assessment, not one applied broadly to all Sailors, each with their own unique health characteristics and differing levels of immune protection), any such benefit is an individual benefit, not a collective benefit. 3 12. The evidence is manifest and unambiguous that, at present, Omicron is COVID. It is, for all intents and purposes, the only variant posing infection risk to my Sailors -all my Sailors, regardless of vaccination status. Given the widely acknowledged inefficacy of the vaccines in conveying immunity and stopping the spread of COVID-19, the Navy does not have a compelling interest in forcing@11Wf to receive one of these drugs, in violation of his religious beliefs, in the name of protecting the health and safety of his fellow service members. 13. Does the Navy's requirement t/,atf3\\18M, specifically, receive an injection with one of the COVID-19 pharmaceuticals further a compelling Navy interest in protecting his health and safety? Stated another way, is it necessary that f\u00a7\\18N receive one of these drugs -over his sincere religious objection -to protect his own health and safety? In answering this question, RFRA requires an \"individualized assessmen t,\" an honest analysis -to the person, \u00a7\\\u00a51-W-of the marginal risk of remaining unvaccinated. Generalized statements that the vaccines are effective at reducing COVID case severity, hospitalization, and death rates have been repeated regularly by DON personnel. Perhaps these statements are accurate in many situations and for many individuals. yet RFRA requires more. Just how much risk to f\u00a7\\\u00a58@\u00ad a 28 year-old and a member of one of the most elite and healthy communities in the entire Navy, is there from the relatively -mild Omicron variant and its dominant strain, BA.5? Noting that the CDC's 11 August 2022 guidance aligned with the findings of over two hundred medical studies in acknowledging that \"persons who have had CO VID-19 but are not vaccinated have some degree of protection against severe illness from their previous infection, \" reference (f), to what degree is this risk (which statistically is very small for a healthy male ofl;;\\\\11@'s age) even further mitigated by the protection provided by his prior SARS-Co V-2 infection? When\u00ad -s original request for accommodation was denied, was his level of fitness properly assessed and weighed. as RFRA requires? His personal health? His assignment? His body fat percentage? Was whether his young age, sex, athletic background, and prior infection might render him more vulnerable to certain known complications or adverse events from the vaccines properly assessed and weighed? 14. Stated another way, for the Navy to have a compelling interest in forcing ffl\u00a58tll's injection at the expense of his Constitutional right to free exercise, RFRA effectively requires a risk-benefit analysis.4 Just how great is the current risk posed tnQIN by COVID re- 3 Additionally , \"[t]o be ethically acceptable , such severe restrictions of individual liberty [i.e., mandated vaccination under threat of employment loss] need to be justified not only by an individual benefit but by the expectation that vaccination reduces harm to others.

The expected harms to individuals and the hanns of coercive mandates themselves are not counterbalanced by a large public health benefit; such harms and restrictions of liberty are therefore disproportionate and ethicaJJy unjustifiable... . The arguments presented above are relevant not only to D booster mandates but also to [] policies that maintain primary two-dose Covid-19 vaccine mandates in 2022 in the face of high rates of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection\" (Reference (d)). ' In addition to RFRA effectively requiring a risk-benefit analysis, such an analysis also has strong ethical underpinnings . \"There is an even stronger rationale for thorough and transparent risk-benefit assessment when interventions are mandated or when (given uncertainty or relevant population differences) some people might face 12 CUI// APPEAL OF DENIAL FOR WAIVER OF POLICY IN SUPPORT OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE infection?

Just how great is the risk tn S\\\\IIWI currently posed by SARS-Co V-2? With nearly 10 months of Omicron data to inform, there is no question that Omicron poses much less risk to those infected compared to the Delta, Alpha, or original viral strains. The body of evidence unambiguously reaching thls conclusion is considerable; one such study, published in The Lancet, provides valuable insightc; stratified by age and prior vaccination status (Enclosure (5)8). For those in\u00a7\\18MW,;; age range (20-29), the hospital admission rate from Omicron infection was 0.60%, and the death rate 0.002% (Enclosure (6), Table S4). \\1/hile these numbers do not differentiate between vaccinated and unvaccinated populations, they similarly do not differentiate between those with natural immunity and those without, nor do they account for the underlying health, fitness, and co-morbidities (or lack thereof) of those within this age band. These data limitations notwithstanding, the study offers conclusive findings on the relative lack of severity of Omicron compared to earlier strains, the vaccine resistance of Omicron, and the considerable benefits of natural immunity. 16. The study's authors summarize its findings as follows: '\"The risk of severe outcomes following SARS-Co V-2 infection is substantially lower for omicron than for delta, with higher reductions for more severe endpoints and significant variation with age. Underlying the observed risks is a large reduction in intrinsic severity (in unvaccinated individua1s) counterba1anced by a reduction in vaccine effectiveness. Documented previous SARS-CoV-2 infection offered some protections against hospitalization and high protection against death in unvaccinated individuals .... \" Regarding the finding estimating larger severity reductions for Omicron compared with Delta, the authors note this \"agrees with observations that the proportion of bospita1ized COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care or mechanical ventilation (or both) has been substantially lower during the omicron wave ... than the preceding delta wave. The 80% overall reduction in the intrinsic risk of death that we estimate for omicron infection harms not outweighed by individual benefits. In such cases, risk-benefit assessments should be stratified by demographic factors and updated as new data become available to reduce uncertainty\" (Reference (d)). 5 \"The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods oftime, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.\" Roman Catholic Diocese o/Brooldyn v.

(W]e maintain that if mandates remain then there is an ethical obligation ... to provide evidence that the intervention confers an expected net benefit to individuals younger than 40 years in the context of the prevailing SARS-CoV-2 variants and pre-existing immunity. Without this, it is problematic to simply claim that Covid-19 vaccines are 'safe and effective' without specific risk-benefit analyses for different age categories and with consideration for individual health status, including evidence of prior infection, because risks of both disease and vaccination are highly variable according to these factors\" (Reference (d)). 8 At the time of its publication, this was the \"largest national study quantifying the risk of hospitalization or death after infection with omicron compared with delta, based on individual -level data on 1,516,702 COVID-19 cases, of whom 1,067,859 were APPEAL OF DENIAL FOR WAIVER OF POLICY IN SUPPORT OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE compared with that of delta will make the goal of living with COVID-19 in the absence of socially and economically disruptive public health interventions substantially easier to achieve at the current time.\" Further, the study \"estimated a larger reduction (comparing omicron with delta) in the risk of hospitalization and death in unvaccinated cases than for all cases \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 The relative risk of hospitalization or death in vaccinated cases compared with unvaccinated cases was lower for delta cases than for omicron cases []. These estimates indicate that the overall observed reductions in hospitalization and mortality risk understate the intrinsic reduction in the risk of severe infection outcomes associated with the delta to omicron transition, due to those reductions being partially counteracted by reductions in vaccine effectiveness.\" Addressing the protection provided by natural immunity, the study notes: \"In unvaccinated cases, documented past infection provides moderate protection against hospitalization and higher protection against death .... An imputation-based sensitivity analysis to examine the effect of under-ascertainment of past infections gave ... estimates indicating a larger protective effect of past infection against all endpoints for unvaccinated individuals, and against hospital admission and death in vaccinated individuals.\" 17. The government's interest was at its most compelling when the risk from the disease was at its most pronounced. Just this week, the CDC published data underscoring just how much lower the risk from the weaker current subvariants is compared with the virus we were dealing with at the time the Navy's vaccine mandate was instituted (Enclosure (7)9). \"Using [data from 678 hospitals], CDC assessed in-hospital mortality risk overall and by demographic and clinical characteristics during the Delta (July-October periods among patients hospitalized primarily for 9 Jmportantly, this report filtered out deaths from other causes in order to isolate mortality rates for those individuals hospitalized \"primarily for COVID-19.\" Many reputable immunologists and researchers argue \"that the daily death toll attributed to COVID is exaggerated because many deaths blamed on the disease are actually from other causes. Some of the people who died for other reasons happened to also test positjve for the coronavirus. 'We are now seeing consistently that more than 70% of our COVJD hospitalizations are in that category,' says Dr. Shira Doron, an infectious disease specialist at the Tufts Medical Center and a professor at the Tufts University School of Medicine. 'If you're counting them all as hospitalizations, and then those people die and you count them all as COVlD deaths, you are pretty dramatically overcounting.' If deaths were classified more accurately, then the daily death toll would be closer to the toll the flu takes during a typical season, Doron says. lf this is true, the odds of a person dying if they get a COVLD infection -[] the case fatality rate -would be about the same as the flu now, which is estimated to be around 0.1 %, or perhaps even lower'' (Reference (e)). 14 OF DENIAL FOR W AIYER OF POLICY IN SUPPORT OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE COVID-19 .... Crude mortality risk (cMR) (deaths per 100 patients hospitalized primarily for COVID-19) was lower during the early Omicron (13.1) and.later Omicron (4.9) periods than during the Delta (15.1) period (p<0.001 ). Adjusted mortality risk was lower during the Omicron periods than during the Delta period for patients aged ~ 18 years, males and females, all racial and ethnic groups, persons with and without disabilities, and those with one or more underlying medical conditions .... During the later Omicron period, 81.9% of in-hospiral deaths occurred among adults aged~ 65 years and 7 3. 4% occurred among persons with three or more underlying medical conditions .\" In short, the CDC's researchers conclude, \u00ab[r]isk for severe COVID-19 increases with age, disability, and underlying medical conditions . The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is more infectious but has been associated with less severe disease.\" What is perhaps most notable about Omicron is just how contagious and transmissible it is, a characteristic unabated by the vaccines, as documented above. While wildly contagious to both the vaccinated and l,lilVaccinated, the risks of Omicron are disproportionately borne by the elderly and infirm (certainly not by the young, healthy, and previously-infected/recovered such as@!IWf .) Indeed, recent CDC data documents the death risk posed to those in fflllWls age group is 60 times less than those aged 65 to 74, 140 times less than those aged 75 to 84, and 330 ti.mes less than those over 85 -and this doesn't even take into account the health and fitness or natural/vaccinated immunity levels of those within@IIWPs age group (Enclosure (8)). A welcome reality of the \"later Omicron\" landscape is that hospitalizations and deaths from SARS\u00ad CoV-2 in young, healthy individuals, like allll, are so rare as to hardly register on the CDC's own charts (see below)10 Although some may point to \"long COVID,, as a risk justifying compelled vaccination of even the young and healthy, Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, is quick to push back, Q.

Another critical factor suggesting the actual death rate -for all age groups -may be even lower yet is the underreporting of infections due to the emergent prevalence of at-home testing, which reduces the documented number of con finned cases -i.e., the denominator in the number of deaths over confinned cases (the APPEAL OF DENIAL FOR WAIVER OF POLICY IN SUPPORT OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE noting that \"much of the estimated risk for long COVID comes from people who got seriously ill at the start of the pandemic\" and that \"if you account for that, the risk oflong term health problems may not be greater from COVID than from other viral infections like the flu .... 'It was really severe COVID that led to long COVID. And as the disease has become milder, we're seeing lower rates oflong COVID\"' (Reference (e)). 18. Acknowledging that the risk posed by the Omicron variant for those aged 20-29 without multiple comorbidities is very low, and that both a healthy, active lifestyle and prior SARS-CoV- 2 infection and recovery further reduce this low risk, I nevertheless acknowledge that the risk is not non-existent. What, then, would be the expected benefit of injection with the Pfizer or Modema vaccines?11 Dr. Paul Offit, vaccine developer, pediatrician, and a member of the FDA's Vaccine Advisory Committee, said the following in a CNN interview on 1 September 2022: \"Who are those people -who are those people who are getting hospitalized? It really falls into three groups. One is the elderly, meaning people over 65. Two is the kind of people who have serious health problems -say, chronic lung disease-which, when they get a mild or moderate infection lands them in the hospital. And, there is people who are immune compromised. When you're asking people to get a vaccine, I think there has to be clear evidence of benefit.. .. You'd like to have at least human data where you see a clear and dramatic increase [of protection] .... If you don't have that, if there's not clear evidence of benefit, then it's not fair to ask people to take it no matter how small the benefit -the benefit should be clear.\" Stated differently, \"A thorough ethical evaluation ofrisks and benefits requires relevant empirical data, especially where risks and benefits can be quantified to a reasonable degree of certainty. Relevant data include not only those regarding average individual vaccine safety and effectiveness but also age-stratification of these data as well as the protective effect of prior infection and the effectiveness of vaccines against transmission\" (Reference (d)). 19. Critically, any benefits of the mandated vaccines should only be discussed in relation to the Omicron variant of SARS-Co V-2, the only present variant of concern. As the aforementioned Lancet-published study exhaustingly documented, vaccine effectiveness across all age groups has been considerably worse against the Omicron variants, particularly the currently dominant BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, compared to Delta and earlier SARS-CoV-2 strains. According to CDC data (reference (f)) presented on l September, data patterns revealed vaccine effectiveness was \"waning substantially,\" LCDR Ruth Link-Gelles said while presenting the data to the CDC's vaccine advisory panel. In particular, this trend of diminishing vaccine efficacy was even more pronounced in data drawn from the months during which the dominant BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants displaced prior Omicron subvariants. For instance, across all age groups, even the elderly, \"irnmunocompetent\" adults -the adult population with the immunocompromised 111 recognize that \"Comirnaty\" and \"Spikevax\" are the brand names for, respectively, Pfizer's and Modema's SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and that these branded vaccines have been approved by the FDA. I also recognize that the fonnulations of these branded, FDA-approved phannaceuticals are ostensibly the same as the fonnulations for the non-branded Emergency Use Authorized (EUA) pharmaceuticals the overwhelming majority of Sailors in my claimancy have received. Throughout this endorsement , I refer to the vaccines by their manufactures ' names simply because the actual FDA-approved pharmaceuticals -those labeled either \"Comirnaty\" or \"Spikevax\" -remain largely unavailable in the United States. The professed intercbaogability of the formulations notwithstanding, the specific vials my Sailors receive have \"been granted an EUA by the FDA, but are still not fully approved [unlike those specifically labeled \"Comirnaty\" or \"Spikevax\"] and, therefore, provide a less \"transparent legal route to adequate compensation\" in case of injury (Reference (d)). 16 APPEAL OF DENIAL FOR WAIVER OF POLICY IN SUPPORT OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE excluded -realized only 44% protection against emergency room and urgent care visits during the months ofBA.4 and BA.S subvariant dominance. This protection waned to a mere 26% after 150 days from receipt of the second dose. Similarly, protection against hospitalization declined during the months ofBA.4 and BA.5 subvariant dominance, with immunocompetent adults, such a~ S\\'tJIWf realizing a mere 25% protective benefit against hospitalization beyond 150 days from receipt of the second dose. Invoking Dr. Offit's words in the paragraph above, is this benefit clear enough to justify infringement of constitutionally protected liberties? 20. Similarly, recent data sets from the health departments of many states underscore the worsening performance of the current shots as increasingly vaccine-evasive Omicron subvariants, like BA.4 and BA.5, emerge and assert dominance. Like the CDC data discussed in the paragraph above, this state-level data is mostly recent, accounting for the current dominant subvariants. This contrasts with much of the data informing references (g), (h), and (i), a great deal of which references numbers from the Delta wave and earlier waves of variants for which the vaccines demonstrated higher effectiveness. Further, in 25 states reporting \"breal1:hrough\" data (in either SARS-CoV-2 cases, hospitalizations, or deaths), the vaccinated comprise a majority of at least one of these breakthrough metrics (and, in some cases, all). In over half of these 25 states, the percentage of vaccinated residents comprising one of these breakthrough categories exceeds the statewide vaccination 12 percentage. Stated another way, in a majority of these states, vaccinated individuals now appear more likely to either contract SARS-Co V-2, be hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2, or die of SARS-Co V-2 compared to their unvaccinated counterparts. Although these raw numbers often (but not always) do not account for factors such as age, and although not all states conveniently report all three metrics ( cases, hospitalizations, and deaths) by vaccination status, the cumulative impact of the reported data -both the more recent CDC data and the statewide breakthrough data -does not provide a resounding endorsement for the efficacy of the vaccines against BA.4 and BA.5. 21. As noted above, in a number of states the percentage of at least one metric -post vaccination SARS-CoV-2 cases, hospitalizations , or deaths- has exceeded the vaccinated percentage of the state popuJation in recent months. a. In Minnesota, from 5 June to 3 July 2022, 71 % of SARS-CoV-2 cases (29,660 cases) and 80% of deaths (107 deaths) were observed in the vaccinated population. 66% of Minnesotans were vaccinated during this period (Reference G)). b. In Oklahoma, from 5 June to 5 July 2022, 64% of SARS-Co V-2 hospitalizations (277) were observed in the vaccinated population. 51 % of Oklahomans were vaccinated during this period (Reference (k)). c. In Wisconsin, during June 2022, 65% of new cases (31,702), 64% percent of hospitalizations (634), and 66% of deaths (69) were observed in the vaccinated population. 61.5% of Wisconsin residents were vaccinated during this period (Enclosure (9)). 12 For the purposes of this comparison and the data vignettes in the below paragraph, those who are \"boosted\" are included in the \"vaccinated \" category. 17 OF DENIAL FOR W AIYER OF POLICY IN SUPPORT OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE d. In Idaho, from 5 June to 2 July 2022, 53% of hospitalizations (89) were observed in the vaccinated population . 52% of Idaho residents were vaccinated during this period (Enclosure (10)). e. In Rhode Island, during June 2022, 76% of deaths (22) were observed in the vaccinated population. 75.6% of Rhode Island residents were vaccinated during this period (Reference (I)). Minnesota Cases Hospitalizations from 5 June to 26 June 2022, 67% of cases (17,856) and 67% of hospitalizations (623) were observed in the vaccinated population. 62% of Utah residents were vaccinated during this period (Reference (m)). g.

In Mississippi , from 1 April through 1 August 2022, 54% of deaths were observed in the vaccinated population. 51.7% of Mississippi residents were vaccinated during this period (Enclosure (13)). k. In South Dakota, during June 2022, 74% of hospitalizations (141) and 66.6% of deaths (8) were observed in the vaccinated population. 58% of South Dakota residents were vaccinated during this period (Reference ( o )). I. In Louisiana, during the week of21 July, 61% of deaths were observed in the vaccinated population . 52% of Louisiana residents were vaccinated during this period (Enclosure (14)). 13 Although Alaska's Department of Health had regularly posted quarterly COVID-19 updates, which included breakthrough data, this update from March 2022 (available at: https://bealth.alaska.gov/dph/Epi/id/siteassets/pages /HumanCoV/COVID monthly update.pd t) is the last such update posted on the Department's webpage. 18 APPEAL OF DENIAL FOR WAIVER OF POLICY IN SUPPORT OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE 22. Although the reporting formats and reporting periods differ from state to state (most nevertheless encompass periods of BA.4 and BA.5 dominance), and although the percentages of vaccinated personnel accounting for breakthrough metrics does not exceed the statewide vaccination rate in 11 of 25 states, the statewide breakthrough data -across the board -conveys an unmistakable shift from the earlier stages of the pandemic, when unvaccinated individuals comprised the overwhelming majority of state-reported SARS-CoV -2 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths and when the vaccines apparently performed better against the then-dominant variants and subvariants ofSARS -CoV-2. Accordingly, the weight ofrecent CDC and statewide data undermines the argument that the Navy's interest inf:\u00bb\u00a51-Ws health and safety is somehow compeiling enough to justify his injection in violation of his religious beliefs. Might the vaccines provide him snme benefit? Indeed. Nevertheless, good faith (and a wealth of data) requires acknowledgement that the risk he faces from the current subvariants is not all that great. The protection offered from the current FDA-approved vaccines is not all that good or long\u00ad lasting. And, @II@ already has some protective benefit from his prior infection and recovery. Furthermore, this analysis only considers the potential health benefits oflllll's injection, yet the risks accompanying injection must also be considered. 14 23. As discussed above, in order to properly assess (to the degree RFRA requires) whether the Navy's requirement that @1181 specifically, receive an injection furthers a compelling Navy interest in protecting health and safety at the individual level -i.e., \u00a7ttJl@'s own health and safety -we must assess whether it is necessary th~t @I@ receive one of these drugs -over his sincere religious objection -in order to protect his own health and safety. In order to properly make this assessment \"to the person,\" we must weigh the risk the current form of the virus presents tn MIN as well as the benefits the currently available FDA-approved vaccines would reasonably provide /(lMIM Nevertheless, any analysis that fails to consider and weigh the risks these drugs present to @)IIWI would be incomplete. As noted above, \"RFRA requires an 'individualized assessment,' an honest analysis -to the person,. ill-of the marginal risk of remaining unvaccinated.\" An individualized assessment of the marginal risk of getting vaccinated logically follows. 24. We have been often told that the current FDA-approved vaccines are \"safe and effective.\" While this may be true generally, the known risks presented by the vaccines continue to mount and often operate in an age-specific manner. Additionally, it merits acknowledgement that the current FDA-approved vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, both utilizing Messenger RNA (mRNA) technology (a novel platform with \"unknown unknowns\"), are quite different in several respects from other vaccines, most notably the flu vaccine, my Sailors receive annually. These m.RNA vaccines are certainly more reactogenic, with a higher proportion of Sailors forced to miss work following injection and a higher number of adverse events compared to, for instance, the flu vaccine. For example, one of my subordinate commanding officers, a relatively young and exceedingly fit SEAL who, like MIN, had previously contracted and recovered from SARS-Co V-2, experienced signifiGant adverse reactions to the mRNA injection, falling far more ill than at any point during his prior SARS-Co V-2 infection. My intent in sharing this anecdote is not to suggest his experience is universal or that these pharmaceuticals are more harmful than 14 \"While harms from Covid-19 vaccines are rare they should be factored into policy recommendations\" (Reference (d)). 19 APPEAL OF DENIAL FOR WAIVER OF POLICY IN SUPPORT OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE the virus but, rather, to simply illustrate in a personally-observed manner that these shots can cause harmful adverse reactions, especially to those who had previously contracted SARS-Co V- 2. \"In those with a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, post-vaccination symptoms causing missed work or daily activities are reported two-to -three-fold more often than those without a history of infection, a major concern given that the seropreval ence among adults aged 18-49 is now well above the February 2022 estimate of 67%\" (Reference ( d) ). Another distinguishing characteristic of the two mandated SARS-Co V-2 vaccines is the fact they are formulated to counteract past strains of SARS-Co V-2 (hence their waning efficacy). And, perhaps most significantly, the known risks of these mRNA phannaceuticals appear greatest in the young, those who generally face the lowest risk from the virus itself. 25. Vaccination-associated myo/pericarditis is often referenced as \"rare. (typically) 'mild' and followed by rapid recovery with anti-inflamm:;itory treatment. [However, t]he reviews have not framed vaccine-associated risks versus infection-associated risks using compatible denominators based on exposure (vaccination) and infection (seroprevalence), thus the infection-associated risks have been overstated by at least a factor of four according to CDC estimates of the burden of Covid-19 illness. (Reference (p)] However, it has been found to occur in as many as 1 in 2652 males aged 12-17 years old and 1 in 1862 males aged 18-24 years old after the second dose [Reference (q) 15] (and as high as 1/1300 after the second dose in a Pfizer-Moderna combination).

According to the CDC, incidence of myocarditis is significantly elevated for males in- 11111' sage group, even with the shortcomings in the VSD's-search algorithm discussed in footnote (I 5). 1\u00b75 ''We identified additional valid cases ofmyopericard itis following an mRNA vaccination that would be missed by the VSD's search algorithm, which depends on select hospital discharge diagnosis codes. The true incidence of myopericarditis is markedly higher than the incidence reported to US advisory committees in the fall of 2021. The VSD should validate its search algorithm to improve its sensitivity for myopericarditis.\" (Emphasis mine) 16 Although r acknowledge statements to the contrary, such as that in reference (v), these overly-broad and generalized statements that \"COVID-19 infection poses higher risk for myocarditis than vaccines\" ignore the difference between, for instance, a 28-yearold man and an 88-year old woman. Lumping everyone together bides critical safety signals, such as the emergent reality that, in the age of weaker Omicron subvariant dominance, the mRNA vaccines now can cause more myocarditis in men under 40 than COVID-19 infection. This conclusion (which is especially pronounced \"after a second dose of the [Modema] vaccine\") is supported by the data in reference (t), which requi.tes careful parsing (especially Table 2) due to the reporting format. Additional ly, by lumping all men under 40 together, the study obscures the outsized harm of myocarditis posed, for instance, to OF DENIAL FOR W AIYER OF POLICY IN SUPPORT OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE I VSD Incidence rates of verified myocardltls/perlcarditls 0-7 days following mRNA t2 Similarly, German hospital data captured significan tly elevated rnyocarditis events in German 16 to 39 year-olds during the summer of 2021, a period of relatively low SARS-CoV-2 infection activity in Germany ~ compared to the same period during the summer of 2020, when no one had yet received an m.RNA vaccine. If the 2021 spike in myocarditis was caused by SARS\u00ad Co V -2 infection, why is no prior infection-in duced spike reflected in these numbers? (In -' the myocarditis case rates in this age group were consistently at or below the pre-SARS-Co V-2 average until implementation of mass mRNA vaccination of this age group.) m.RNA vaccines now can cause more myocarditis in men under 40 than COVID- 19 infection.

Furthermore, data from the Pfizer and Moderna phase III clinical trials, much of which was not available until relatively recently, also illustrates the excess risk of serious adverse events resulting from these manufacturers ' mRNA vaccines. A recent study of this data \"used a simple 22 APPEAL OF DENIAL FOR WAIVER OF POLICY IN SUPPORT OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE harm-benefit framework to place [its] results in context, comparing risks of excess serious AESis [(adverse events of special interest) 17] against reductions in COVID-19 hospitalization\" (Reference (x)). Most notably, \"In the Moderna trial, the excess risk of serious AES Is (15.1 per I 0,000 participants) was higher than the risk reduction for COVID-19 hospitalization relative to the placebo group (6.4 per 10,000 participants). In the Pfizer trial, the excess risk of serious AESis (10.1 per 10,000) was higher than the risk reduction for COVID-19 hospitalization relative to the placebo group (2.3 per 10,000 participants).\" The study's authors later conclude , \"These results raise concerns that mRNA vaccines are associated with more harm than initially estimated at the time of emergency authorization....

Of particular relevance to the risk-benefit analysis with respect to@lj@, \"harm-benefit ratios would presumably shift towards hann for those with lower risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes -such as those with natural immunity, younger age or no comorbidities. Similarly, waning vaccine effectiveness, decreased viral virulence, and increasing degree of immune escape from vaccines might further shift the harm-benefit ratio toward harm.\" (Emphasis in original.) 30. Tying these threads together, the key question is not whether the current FDA-approved vaccines are l 00 percent safe and effective. Multiple states and western countries believe they are not 18, but many vaccines with lower effectiveness can still reduce disease. The key question, is whether the Navy's interest in &J\\18-s individual health and safety is sufficiently compelling , given the present factual landscape, to justify injecting him with one of these drugs over his sincere religious objection. It is not. a. SARS-Co V-2 has always operated in a highly age-specific manner. That remains true with the dominant BA.5 (and less dominant BA.4) Omicron subvariant. b. @SN is in an age group at one of the lowest risk levels, and with one of the lowest public health burdens, from SARS-Co V -2 and is at statistically miniscule risk of severe disease or death from the less-dangerous Omicron variant. c. As natural immunity has repeatedly been documented to provide protection from SARS\u00ad Co V-2 re-infection, hospitalization, and death (as recently acknowledged by the CDC) - protection that's longer-lasting than that from the quickly-waning mRNA vaccines --fil\"\"\") who has contracted and recovered fiom SARS-Co V-2, is at even less risk from this relatively mild virus than the generalized statistics for bis age group suggest. 17 \"ln 2020, prior to COVlD-19 vaccine rollout, the Brighton Collaboration created a priority list, endorsed by the World Health Organization, ofpotential adverse events relevant to COVID-19 vaccines. We adapted the Brighton ColJaboration list to evaluate serious adverse events of special interest observed in mRNA COVID-19 vaccine triab\" (Reference (x)). 18 If they were, it's difficult envisioning multiple European countries, the state of Florida, and Kaiser Northwest restricting or cautioning against the use ofModema shots in younger populations and Denmark effectively restricting both vaccines for almost everyone under the age of 50. 23 CUI// APPEAL OF DENIAL FOR WAIVER OF POLICY IN SUPPORT OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE d. In addition to his young age and natural immunity, @IIWls personal health and fitness level and absence of comorbidities further reduces the statistically miniscule risk he faces from SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. e. While there may yet be some negligible benefit from the m.RNA vaccines in this omicron-dominant SARS-CoV-2 landscape, there certainly isn't the \"clear and dramatic increase [of protection]\" (Dr. Offit's verbiage) to justify these drugs for@f@ While these are the same vaccines from 2020 and 2021, this is not the same virus. Today's variants are less lethal and far better at evading yesterday's vaccines. f. As such, the leaky vaccines \"provide a low impact on hospitalization and a low impact on transmission for an age group with a low prospect of benefit\" (Reference (d)). g. Furthermore, the vaccines carry risks of their own, particularly to young males, like. 1111, who have already contractedSARS-CoV-2. h. Beyond their documented post-injection reactogenic qualities, causing symptoms and requiring work absences at significantly heightened rates for those with prior SARS-Co V-2 infection, the risk of adverse events, captured in real world and clinic trial data, is too great to ignore. 31. I will not argue the risks of the shots exceed the risk of Omicron to @iN I will, however, acknowledge the growing body of scholarly, data-driven research credibly making that argwnent. Returning to the core question posed by RFRA, in light of the aforementioned data, scholarly studies, and hundreds of observable touchpoints across my claimancy since Omicron became the dominant variant, I believe that whatever the marginal benefit these shots might providefflJIN they are not necessary to prote-ct his personal health and safety. Broadly speaking, these shots might advance \"military readiness ,\" \"health and safety,\" and \"good order and discipline19.\" Applied to the person of@N against the present factual landscape, however, these generalized interests do not clear the \"high bar\" required by RFRA. 32. Does the Navy's requirementt/tat\u00a711-- specifically, receive an injection with one of the COVID-19 pharmaceuticals further a compelling Navy interest in organizational readiness, unit cohesion, and mission accomplishment? Stated another way, is it necessary that MIMI receive one of these drugs -over his sincere religious objection -to avoid a predictable and detrimental impact to his Navy Reserve Unit (NRU) or to the Navy's military readiness and ability to execute its missions? For the reasons discussed below, I do not believe it IS. 19 A federal official \"cannot simply utter[] magic words ... and as a result receive unlimited deference from tbose of us charged with resolving these disputes.\" Davila v. Gladden, 777 F.3d 1198, 1206-07 (II th Cir. 2015) (citing 0 Centro, 546 U.S. at 438). \"Instead, the government must proffer 'specific and reliable evidence' (not formulaic and generic commands, policies, and conclusion ,s) demonstrating that the marginal benefit flowing from a specific denial furthers a compelling government interest.\" Colonel Financial Management Officer at 35 (citing Davila, OF DENIAL FOR W AIYER OF POLICY IN SUPPORT OF RELIGIOUS PRACTlCE 33. I've observed broad, generalized concerns that accommodation of Sailors like f,jfJIN would possibly \"have an adverse impact on mission accomplishment, including military readiness, unit cohesion and good order and discipline\" or \"have a predictable and detrimental effect on the readiness\" of accommodated Sailors and their shipmates -but, specifically, how so? At this point, nearly three years into the new COVID reality, I remain uncertain as to what the specific concern is with grantinp NJIWf a religious accommodation. I certainly appreciate the Navy's \"broadly formulated interests\", but I cannot ascertain just what, specifically, is \"the marginal interest in enforcing the [government] mandate[.]\" Burwell, 573 U.S., at 694-95, citing O Centro, 546 U.S., at 431 (emphasis mine). Nor can I ascertain what, spec~fica lly, is the marginal risk off\u00a7S11N ,;;erving his country without these specific vaccrnes. 34. Acknowledging that RFRA requires a \"more focused\" inquiry, how, specifica lly, would a:ccommodat inr@II@ have a \"predictable and detrimental\" impact on the \"Sailors who serve alongside\" him? Surely, given the widely-acknowledged and documented inefficacy of the vaccines in preventing the spread ofSARS-CoV-2 (discussed in paragraphs eight through 12, above), one cannot credibly argue that@I-Ws vaccination status somehow places the health and safety of his mostly-vaccinated shipmates at outsized risk of contracting COVJD. Additionally, given how miniscule the risk posed to ffl11N's own health and safety by SARS-CoV-2 is (discussed in paragraphs 13 through 31), one cannot credibly argue that, in spite of his young age, exemplary health and fitness, and natural immunity NJWis vaccination status somehow places his own health and safety at outsized risk and that this marginal risk, if any, would predictably and detrimentally impact his own military readiness or that of his shipmates. 35. Given the shortcomings of the above-mentioned \"health and safety\"-rooted arguments when posited against the evolving factual backdrop of a much-weakened virus, the statistically negligible SARS-CoV-2 risk to. 1111, and the documented deficiencies of the vaccines relative to BA.4, BA.5, and newer subvariants, I can only conclude formulated interests\" like \"military @l@'s \"deployability,\" and that of other religiously-objecti ng Sailors like him. Although the Chief ofNaval Personnel's templated denial of@Jl@ 's religious accommodation request to \"health and safety\" concerns for @\u00a5IN :md those shipmates he \"will inevitably be expected to live and work in close proximity with,\" the denial letter in response to the religious accommodation appeal of another of my Sailors notes that \"[}Jack of worldwide deployability affects organizational readiness\" and also that the Sailor's Selected Reserve (SELRES) status requires that he \"be continuously screened for immediate voluntary or involuntary mobilization availability.... By regulation, you are required to be prepared to report to your supporting Navy Reserve Center within 24 hours of receiving mobilization orders.\" No doubt, \"worldwide deployability affects organizational readiness.\" Nevertheless, applying this argument as grounds for deprivingfi\"11N of his free exercise rights and denying his appeal would be disingenuous, because the proximate and most\u00ad immediate cause of@11WW5 present non-deployability is not that he is unfit, unqualified, or unable to deploy but, quite simply, that the military won't allow him to deploy. And herein lies the rub: on one hand is the Navy's COVID travel policies, which I will unequivocally enforce as directed; on the other is my oath and my charge of command. I will carry out my orders as delivered, yet my role in this process -and my obligation s under RFRA and implementing 25 APPEAL OF DENIAL FOR WAIVER OF POLICY IN SUPPORT OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE instructions, places me well outside my comfort zone, as it's difficult to reconcile my support for this policy broadly and my intent to live up to my oath and to my charge of command. On one hand, I acknowledge this policy (a policy I believe was implemented with noble intentions) effectively preventing the official travel, much less the mobilization, ofl3\\IIMI :md Sailors like him so long as he remains unvaccinated -and, personally, I want this Sailor to get the vaccine. On the other band, I must also acknowledge the \"high bar\" of RFRA and the \"to the person\" inquiry it imposes and, from my vantage point as WIWI' s Commander ( and, essentially, as your sensor at the point of impact), I must concede the COVID travel policy does not meet the high bar for this individual Sailor in this individual situation. 36. As the Commander of Naval Special Warfare's (NSW) Reserve Component (RC), I am responsible for mobilizing SELRES members to fill validated and vetted NSW and Special Operations Command (SOCOM) requirements, a task that is growing more difficult for reasons I will later address. In the interests of fairness and transparency, NSWG-11 mobilizes SELRES members to fill requirements in order-of dwell status -that is, the qualified SELRES member out of dwelJ the longest is the member who is \"tagged\" for mobilization. Recognizing that. lflll will be coming out of dwell later this year, I would like to be able to deploy him and NSWG-11 claimancy Sailors like him, and I am confident he presents no outsized risk to the health and safety of my force or that of our partner force personnel. Similarly, I am confident he presents no outsized risk to the missions my RC force supports nor to relations with our foreign partners. Although I want and need to deploy Sailors likP-\u00a7fll@ fo mobilization billets for which they are well suited temperamentally and experiential ly, current policy-specifically references (y) and (z) -prevents me from doing so. The country entry requirements for all the nations where I might mobilizP @IN <lraw no significant distinction between vaccinated and unvaccinated travelers, so his vaccination status doesn't prevent him from entering these countries, yet our travel policies20 effectively preclude me21 from sending him and leveraging his valuable skillset in service of our nation abroad.22 In short, while ffllilc: deployability might currently require vaccination against SARS-Co V-2, that is only because we've chosen to implement such a requirement. The military \"cannot evade RFRA by defining the conditions of service to exclude the possibility of an accommodation. This definitional sleight of hand evades the inquiry that RFRA demands: whether the [Navy's] generalized interest in worldwide deployability is materially impaired by tolerating a few religious objectors and accommodating 20 Reference (z) provides \"guidance on mis,ion-critical travel for unvaccinated individuals ,i' in the name of protect[ing] the health and safety of the force, maintain[ing] mission readiness and comply[ing] with federal, Department of Defense (DoD), Department of the Navy (DON) and Host Nation (HN) guidelines. \" Yet. with a litany of countries (including all where I'd conceivably send @JI@) permitting unvaccinat ed travel (most with no SARS-CoV-2 testing or quarantine requirements ), only our own military guidelines actually preclude bis mobilization and travel 21 Although I acknowledge the theoretical possibility th<1t Miff\" mobilization could be authorized, the path implemented to actually effectuate that course of action is so onerous, and approval authority so highly-elevated, as to chasten and discourage trying. \"[T]ravel ofunvaccinated individuals should be minimized .

To reiterate, I will carry out my orders as delivered and will continue to enforce the Navy's policy on the travel of unvaccinated Sailors. As I understand my role under RFRA and implementing instructions, however, I owe it to you to be the Navy's point man-to explain the facts on the ground, as the Commander closer to this individual Sailor and to the operational requirements he might reasonably be called to fulfill, to illuminate the ground-level consequences this policy is having on my force and, hopefully, to help illuminate a path forward that respects RFRA and mitigates these consequences. Again, I acknowledge the atypical length and detail of this endorsement; by putting this level of effort into this at my (and my staff's) level and providing this level of detail, I am trying to serve as your sensor at the point of impact to convey how this policy impacts this individual and, further, how it impacts his unit and my Force. 37. While I am comfortable and confident thatf#Jtt11Mf remaining unvaccinated will not impair mission accomplishment or readiness, generalized policy -which does not account for \u00a7\\1ills age, his health, his fitness, his prior infection, specific mission or training requirements, location of mission, country entry requirements , or any number of other salient factors -has dictated otherwise, his deployment not deemed \"mission critical,\" per reference (z). The costs of this policy-and, more broadly, the costs of the growing perception of how unvaccinated members seeking accommodation for their faith have thus far been treated by the Navy-cannot be discounted or ignored. Most immediately, these policies-and nothing else\u00ad prevent me from traveling talented, experienced, capable, and healthy operators and support personnel to training evolutions to maintain their proficiency and from deploying them downrange to fill validated and vetted requirements23. 1be consequences of these policies have caused manning shortfalls, which are now compounding24 1111 is a high-demand, low\u00ad density asset in whom the Navy has invested a considerable amount of time, effort, and money, and he has operational value in the locations I might send him but for this policy. He is a good Sailor and I do not want to lose him but, if these policies persist without exceptions for those, like f#Vt11MI, who merit them, I fear that is what will happen and, as a result, my ability to support validated DEPORD and other NSW/SOCOM requirements may be jeopardized . 38. Furthermore, the costs of current policy to my ability to recruit and retain SEAL and SWCC members in my fenced community are manifest and profound. NSWG-11 closely tracks a number of data sets and metrics spanning three to 10 years, which we have used to reliably project inventory for our fenced SELRES force -enlisted Special Operators (SO), enlisted Special Warfare Combatant Crewmen (SWCC), and SEAL Officers (1135). Leading into fiscal year 2022, this data projected a net annual gain of 10 personnel in our fenced community. Fiscal year 2022 ended with a net loss of 28 personnel. This 38-person divergence from our data- 23 For instance, the# 1 SEAL Officer on dwell list and the # I SEAL enlisted member on dwell list are both healthy, fit, capable, experienced, and respected special operators who exercised their right to submit religio\u00b5s accommodation requests and have since caught and recovered from SARS-CoV-2, with test results evidencing SARS-Co V-2 antibodies. 24 Toe prohibition on mobilizing the above-mentioned SEAL Officer to fill an upcoming deployed SOF Task Element Officer in Charge (OJC) billet left me with no appropriate SELRES SEAL officer out:;ide of dwell. As a result, an active duty NSW command will be asked to provide a SEAL officer to fill this SELRES role. While this course of action may buy time, it does not mitigate the growing manning issues or their primary root causes - policies curtailing unvaccinated travel combined with declining recruiting and retention metrics. 27 CUI II HIPAA OF DENIAL FOR WAIVER OF POLICY lN SUPPORT OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE driven projections prompted me to launch a \"Naval Special Warfare Reserve Component Retention Survey\" to better understand the factors driving SELRES members out of the Navy; this trend, ifleft unabated, will negatively impact force readiness and the ability to provide strategic depth and qualified SELRES members to fill NSW mobilization requirements. Over 40% of my total force, comprised of SEALs, SWCCs, and Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) Sailors, completed the survey, with especially strong support from members ofmy fenced community. 79% ofSELRES SEALs completed the survey and provided valuable feedback. Enclosure (15) is a force-facing summary of those results; this document does not include an additional 67 pages of illuminating, and often constructive, open-ended comments from the survey respondents. For privacy reasons, I will not include this longer document as an enclosure but am happy to provide a copy upon request. 39. In the context off\u00a7\\IIWWs request for accommodation ofhis religious exercise and similar requests from other Sailors of faith in my claimancy, two survey questions merit specific mention. Question 10 asked respondents to what degree their values align with those of today's Navy, and question 14 asked them to select \"up to 5 factors influencing, or that might influence, you to leave NSW or the Navy.\" The answers to both -in particular, the often-lengthy comments my members took the time to provide -are concerning and unambiguously expose the scar tissue resulting from the manner in which they have seen their religious accommodation requests, and those of their brothers and sisters in uniform, adjudicated25 by the Navy. Given the persistent challenges presented by life in the Selected Reserve, which requires juggling and balancing a civilian career, a military career, and a personal/family life, I would have expected \"work/life balance issues\" to be the most-selected factor influencing SELRES members to leave the Navy. It wasn't. Of 36 possible answer choices, '\"Politicization of the military\" was the most-selected factor, chosen by 37.86% of all respondents, and feedback regarding the Navy's treatment ofreligious exercise in the context ofSARS-CoV-2 permeated the comments. Similar sentiments were unambiguously conveyed in my DEOCS survey results and correspondent focus groups. This is having a predictable and detrimental effect on the morale and readiness of the NSW Reserve Force. 40. Reference ( d) argues, \"Strong coercion creates significant social harms. Covid-19 vaccine mandates have often involved a high degree of coercion, effectively ostracizing unvaccinated individuals from society26 When such mandates are not supported by a compelling public health justification and where exemptions are not easily available, the likelihood of reactance and negative social effects are increased.\" (Emphasis in original.) I've seen \"unit cohesion\" raised as a compelling interest justifying the injection of Sailors over their sincere religious objections, yet over the past two-plus years I've observed these policies, and the manner in which religious 25 Paragraphs 5 and 11 pet1ain. 26 A recurring theme in survey comments. One example, from a SEAL respondent: \"DOD and DON's actions on pushing the COVID vaccines has done undetermined damage to the community and breached my trust plus many of my teammates, especially those who are religious. I myself took the vaccine and have since regretted it. The long term health effects of the vaccine are still to be determined. 1 can only hope that the improperly tested and researched vaccine will not have long term consequences. furthermore, I've observed members of my community who did appropriately research the vaccine and as a result, refused to take the vaccine. Instead of being praised for their moral courage, these members have been ostracized by the DOD with an undetermined fate in the military and a mark as 'undeployable'. Furthermore, the amount of mental and emotional stress these members have endured (not to mention the countless hours they devoted) to request the appropriate religious accommodations is unjustifiable.\" 28 APPEAL OF DENIAL FOR WAIVER OF POLICY IN SUPPORT OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE accommodations requests have been processed and adjudicated, tear and fray at the fabric of unit cohesion to a far more detrimental extent than the presence of a few unvaccinated Sailors, like &Jt41N Similarly, I've seen \"good order and discipline\" asserted as a compelling interest justifying the denial of religious accommodation requests; I shudder at the inescapable inference that asserting one's rights under RFRA and the constitution threatens good order and discipline, much as would criminal violation s of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. I personally know the considerable efforts we as a Navy have made to emphasize diversity and inclusion, having previously spearheaded these efforts for the NSW community- and I know how quickly these efforts can be diminished and undennined if protected classes, such as Sailors of deep faith asserting their constitutional ly and legislatively-protected Free Exercise rights, are treated with less deference and respect than other groups of Sailors. I recognize that change often moves slowly in bureaucratic organizations as large as ours -but when the constitutionally-protected rights and liberties of our Sailors are placed in jeopardy by the organization's reliance on systems and processe s' that have produced consistently monolithic results all in the same direction -against the individual's Free Exercise rights-and by the organization 's failure, or reluctance, to quickly adapt to changing real-world realities, we risk irreparable harm not only to Sailors of faith, likeSJ\\'41@ but to our reputation -to our organizational credibility- and to the strides we have taken to foster a genuinely inclusive Naval force. While acknowledging the difficulty of the task faced by CNP and staff, l sincerely hope that appeals, like@11@' s, will receive the individualized scrutiny RFRA requires and that the \"high bar\" the Navy is required to meet not be lowered. Anything less risks rendering our efforts to foster true diversity and inclusion as lip service. 41. To this point, I've primarily addressed the first prong of the two-prong test proscribed by RFRA -whether the Navy has a \"compelling government interest\" in forcing Sailors of deep faith, such asf;\u00bb11WI to receive a pbannaceutical injection in violation of their faith. For the reasons discussed above, it is apparent that the Navy can no longer clear that \"high bar.\" Accordingly, while I see no imperative in exhaustively addressing the second prong of the RFRA test -that is, whether vaccinating@SIW over his religious objection is \"the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest\" -I must nevertheless acknowledge that the \"least-restrictive-means standard is exceptionally demanding,\" Burwell, 573 U.S., at 695-96, and also that, to this point, the Navy appears to have made, at best, a generic effort to address that standard, as the letter denyinp MI-W!'i religious accommodation request contains the same wording as the letters my other requesting Sailors received, wording that asserts broad and general observations rather than addressing the particular context of each Sailor's request \"to the person.\" 42. As repeatedly noted throughout this endorsement, 1111 has previously contracted and recovered from SARS-Co V-2. The overwhelming number of studies examining natural immunity following symptomatic Si\\RS-Co V-2 infection support the proposition that natural immunity provides strong and often superior protection against SARS-Co V-2 relative to vaccinated immunity. \"In February 2022, the CDC estimated that 67% of adults 18-49 had infection-induced SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, up from 30% in September 2021. [Reference (bb).] By now D, the majority of young adults, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, have most likely already been infected with Covid-19. Evidence increasingly shows that prior SARS-Co V-2 infection provides at least similar clinical protection to current vaccines [references (cc), (dd), and (ee)], something that is not acknowledg ed in current [Navy] policies. It is not 29 APPEAL OF DENIAL FOR WAIVER OF POLICY IN SUPPORT OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE vaccination of previously infected individuals provides any meaningful benefits with respect to severe disease, especially for healthy young people. [Reference (fl)]\" (Reference (d)). (Emphasis mine.) 43. Enclosure (16), an oft-cited real-world Israeli study that, while not peer-reviewed bas nevertheless been shown to use accurate methodology (Enclosure (17)) and which remains perhaps the most comprehensive on the topic, establishes that contracting SARS-Co V-2 and naturally mounting an immune response to it during recovery, as fi\"11WI did, offers greater protection from future reinfection and severe disease than the MRNA vaccines. Additionally, most of the studies cited in paragraphs 13 through 29 of this endorsement acknowledge the protective benefits of natural immunity with Omicron as the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant, and the CDC's acknowledgements mirror these findings. Reference (aa). a CDC report, analyzed SARS-CoV-2 cases in New York and California from 30 May to 20 November 2021, comparing the risk ofinfection against several cohorts. The data clearly illustrated that natural immunity provided more protection against infection during the Delta wave compared to vaccinated imrrnmity- 35x protection compared to 8.3x protection, respectively, in California . More recently, the CDC's 11 August 2022 guidance acknowledges the protection provided by prior infection and recovery, as discussed in paragraph (13). Furthermore, as reflected in Enclosure (18), the CDC concedes it has no record of anaone with natural immunity transmitting SARS\u00ad CoV-2, which undermines the argument thatWI@ would place his shipmates at greater risk of contracting the virus by remaining unvaccinated. 44. While Navy Medical officials have argued that \"prior infection is n?t a reliable source of immunity,\" discounting the considerable body of evidence and, most recently, the CDC's own guidance documenting natural immunity's benefits, neither are the approved vaccines. Furthermore, \"[u]sing a national population-wide dataset in Qatar, both previous infection alone and vaccination alone were found to provide >70% protection against severe, critical or fatal Omicron (BA.I or BA.2). [Reference (gg).] Prior infection alone was 91% effective whereas protection from two or three doses of vaccine alone was 66% and 83%, respectively. Covid-19 does cause acute illness, and may have long-term effects for some, particularly those who develop critical illness, but vaccination appears to confer at best modest protection against longer-term sequelae [ reference (hh)] and the existing data are non-randomized, from variants that predate Omicron and with unclear relevance for current adults under age 40\" (Reference (d)). (Emphasis mine.) In sum, if the lion's share of evidence, and our own CDC's guidance, argues that natural immunity offers meaningful protection from contracting or spreading SARS\u00ad CoV-2 (which the vaccines do not) and also from hospitalization and death from the virus, how can I credibly argue thatfi\"11WWs naturally inquired immunity is ilot sufficient to acquit the Navy's interests in health, safety, and readiness? It is certainly less restrictive than injecting him with a pharmaceutical at the expense of his religious convictions and observance. 45. Non-pharmaceutical measures such as proper wear of N-95 masks and vigilant personal hygiene also have shown efficacy io slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and helpenf3Vl1Wf and the rest of my NSW RC Sailors complete mission during the height of the pandemic in 2020, when no SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were available. Although I dislike the optics of requiring only unvaccinated personnel, a large percentage of whom are religious objectors like S\\\\11N to wear masks, as this singles-out and ostracizes these Sailors of faith, especially in consideration of CDC's grudance that no longer differentiates between vaccinated and unvaccinated due to the 30 CUI//HIPAA OF DENJAL FOR WAIVER OF POLICY IN SUPPORT OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE prevalence of breakthrough infections. I nevertheless acknowledge that masking; along with an array of other safety protocols, helped my claimancy weather the worst of the COVID storm. There are also CDC-recommended antiviral and other therapeutics that can be taken to help reduce incidence of hospitalization and death after diagnosis. Although these non\u00ad pharmaceutical measures have obvious shortcomings, implemented in conjunction with 1111 1111' s natural immunity from prior infection they are as, if not more, effective as the vaccines alone in maintaining military readiness and the. health of the force and are unquestionably less restrictive than compelled injection. 46. In closing, I recognize the .length of this endorsement may appear unorthodox. Nevertheless, my staff and I have invested this time and effort because applying risk-benefit analyses accounting for@1fWP\" age, health status, mobilization potential, mission requirements, and prior infec.tion, amongst other variables, is necessary to abide by the governing law and because, frankly, I have already seen the negative impacts on my manning, the stress on the force, and the man hours lost due to the one-size-fits-all manner in which religious accommodation requests have been adjudicated at higher -echelons. I cannot afford to unnecessarily lose more quality Sailors of faith from my ranks.27 I sincerely hope that you consider in good faith and with an o'pen mind the positive value proposition of (and legal basis for) granting this Sailor's religious accommodation request and reach similar conclusions to mine -that denying fflllN accommodation does linle to further the Navy's compelling interests nor is injection the least restrictive means of furthering these interests.
