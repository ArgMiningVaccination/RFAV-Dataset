Given the limitation of existing anti-influenza therapies, there remains to be a requirement for new drugs. Compound Yi-Zhi-Hao pellet (CYZH is a famous traditional Chinese medicine (TCM used in the clinic, whose formula has been recorded in Complication of National Standard for Traditional Chinese Medicine to treat common cold. In this study, we found that CYZH exhibited a broad-spectrum anti-influenza activity and inhibited the expression of viral RNA and proteins in vitro. Mechanistically, CYZH had no inhibitory activities against viral protein hemagglutinin and IAV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Instead, it induced activation of erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2 and nuclear factor kappa B which subsequently upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1 expression. Also, CYZH protected cells from oxidative damage induced by reactive oxygen series. In conclusions, CYZH inhibits IAV replication in vitro, at least partly by activating expression of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.

[Different Influences on Tacrolimus Pharmacokinetics by Coadministrations of Zhi Ke and Zhi Shi in Rats](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=3035000) Lin, Shiuan-Pey; Wu, Ping-Ping; Hou, Yu-Chi; Lee 2011-01-01 Tacrolimus, an immunosuppressant with narrow therapeutic window, has been used widely in transplant patients. Grapefruit juice and pomelo have been reported to increase the blood levels of tacrolimus. Zhi Ke and Zhi Shi, the ripe peels and unripe fruits of Citrus aurantium which is chemotaxonomically related to grapefruit and pomelo, are in wide use in clinical Chinese medicine. To investigate the possible interaction of these two Citrus herbs with tacrolimus, male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally given tacrolimus (1.5 mg/kg) with and without Zhi Ke and Zhi Shi decoctions in a cross-over design. Blood samples were withdrawn via cardiopuncture at specific time and quantitated by a microparticle enzyme immunoassay. In addition, to explore the mechanism of interaction, LS 180 cell line was used for the transport study of rhodamine 123, a typical substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The results showed that Zhi Shi significantly decreased the C max and AUC0t of tacrolimus by 72.4% and 72.0%, respectively, whereas Zhi Ke did not affect tacrolimus pharmacokinetics. LS 180 cell line study indicated that Zhi Shi increased the efflux activity of P-gp, enabling us to explain the decreased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus caused by Zhi Shi. Hence, we suggest that Zhi Shi be contraindicated for transplant patients treated with tacrolimus to reduce the risk of allograft rejection.

Li Zhi's Theory of Growing up in Spirit](http://www.istic.ac.cn/suoguan/detailed.htm?dbname=zw_qk&wid=0120100379580677) [Institute of Scientific and Technical Information of China (English)](http://www.istic.ac.cn/suoguan/DataPortal.htm) Wang Junjiang 2006-01-01 The theory of growing up in spirit is the core of Li Zhi's thought.The theory attempts to get rid of the limit of the rigid ethical doctrine of Confucianismand to encourage growth in a helpful person for the benefit of the country,which demands both a free environment of society and enough courage and insight of the individual.At the same time,the criterion of growing up in spirit indicates the limitation of Li Zhi's thought.His free exploration,however,provides various revelations for us. 2007-01-01 Typhoon Man-Yi was pummeling the Japanese island of Okinawa with winds between 230 and 295 kilometers per hour (125-160 knots, 144-184 miles per hour) and heavy rain on the morning of July 13, 2007, when the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA's Terra satellite captured this image. The immense storm covered hundreds of kilometers with spiraling bands of thunderstorms, though it had lost the distinctive cloud-free eye it exhibited the day before. Typhoons are common in Japan, but powerful typhoons usually strike the island nation later in the year. The Japan Meteorological Agency said that Man-Yi is the fourth typhoon of the 2007 season and may be the most powerful ever observed in the northwest Pacific in July, reported Kyodo News. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center expected the typhoon to strike Kyushu, a southern Japanese island, on July 14, and then curve northeast along the eastern shore of Japan. By the time the storm reaches Tokyo on July 15, it should be degraded to a tropical storm. As of July 13, Typhoon Man-Yi had injured eight and flooded twenty houses in Okinawa, and forced airlines to cancel hundreds of flights, said Kyodo News. The storm was expected to bring heavy rain to Japan's Pacific coast. NASA image created by Jesse Allen, using data provided courtesy of the MODIS Rapid Response team.

The variability is largely genetically determined. With the development of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics, widespread research have provided us a wealth of information on drug-related genetic polymorphisms, and the very important pharmacogenetic (VIP) variants have been identified for the major populations around the world whereas less is known regarding minorities in China, including the Yi ethnic group. Our research aims to screen the potential genetic variants in Yi population on pharmacogenomics and provide a theoretical basis for future medication guidance. In the present study, 80 VIP variants (selected from the PharmGKB database) were genotyped in 100 unrelated and healthy Yi adults recruited for our research. Through statistical analysis, we made a comparison between the Yi and other 11 populations listed in the HapMap database for significant SNPs detection. Two specific SNPs were subsequently enrolled in an observation on global allele distribution with the frequencies downloaded from ALlele FREquency Database. Moreover, F-statistics (Fst), genetic structure and phylogenetic tree analyses were conducted for determination of genetic similarity between the 12 ethnic groups. Using the 2 tests, as the significantly different loci for further analysis. The global allele distribution revealed that the allele \"A\" of rs1540339 and rs9934438 were more frequent in Yi people, which was consistent with the most populations in East Asia. F-statistics (Fst), genetic structure and phylogenetic tree analyses demonstrated that the Yi and CHD shared a closest relationship on their genetic backgrounds. Additionally, Yi was considered similar to the Han people from Shaanxi province among the domestic ethnic populations in China. Our results demonstrated significant differences on [Anti-virus effect of traditional Chinese medicine Yi-Fu-Qing granule on acute respiratory tract infections.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20103834) Li, Anyuan; Qi, Fanghua; Zhao, Lin 2009-08-01 Yi-Fu-Qing granule is a traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of acute respiratory tract infections. The present study sought to investigate the anti-virus effects of Yi-Fu-Qing granule on acute respiratory infections with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human adenoviruses type 3 (Ad3). The cytotoxicity of Yi-Fu-Qing granule was evaluated by the neutral red assay on HeLa cells. The antiviral effect of Yi-Fu-Qing granule was tested by observing the cytopathogenic effect (CPE) with a compound mixture of Isatis leaf as the positive control drug. The results indicated that the highest non-toxicity concentration of Yi-Fu-Qing granule on Hela cells that Yi-Fu-Qing granule inhibited RSV and replication at a concentration of 1:100. Thus, Yi-Fu-Qing granule may have a significant antivirus effect on acute respiratory tract infections with RSV and Ad3 infections and this could prove useful for further antivirus research on acute respiratory tract infections.

[County town -- jian-zhi town differentials and migration to towns in China.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12286536) Ma, R 1993-07-01 China's urbanization process is unique in having been due to economic systems and migration policies. Towns and townships in rural areas are different from cities in their social and economic characteristics and their structure and function. The urban system in China is initially described with the distinction drawn between cities, \"jian-zhi towns\", (organic town) which are officially recognized, and rural areas. Analysis is provided f the economic and residential registration status of town residents and migration in northern China. Data were obtained from a 1987 survey of 1314 households in Wongnioute Banner in Inner Mongolia, and a 1985 migration survey of 2089 rural households in 41 villages. The study area was selected because jian-zhi town status was easily obtained and the are needed more towns for local administration and trade; the area was similar in geographic, social, economic, and cultural characteristics to other northern and northwestern regions. The Wongnioute Banner comprises 5 towns (Qiaotou, Wufendi, Hairesu, Wuduentaohai, and Wutonghua) and 1 country town (Wudan). All citizens from birth have an agricultural or nonagricultural status, which can be changed by passing national exams or completing a university education, joining the military and becoming an officer, marrying someone with a nonagricultural status, reunifying the family, or holding a special program. Quotas are set annually for status changes, e.g. in Tibet Autonomous Region the annual quota was 3%. Town residents may have either status. In the sample, 56.6% lived in town and had a nonagricultural status; 17.7% of heads of household town residents had an agricultural status and had stronger ties to villages because of family connections. Commuters are a third group and comprise 8.9%. County towns and jian-zhi towns are grouped the same, but are quite different in population size.

To study the effect of the Chinese herb Yi-qi-huo-xue on cardiomyopathy in diabetic rats. Methods. Rats were fed a high fat and high glucose diet and injected with 50 ml/kg streptozotocin (STZ to induce diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM, followed by treatment with Yi-qi-huo-xue for 4 weeks. We measured the rats' heart weight index, observed the myocardial morphology using hematoxylin eosin (HE staining, and determined the content of collagen types I and III in the myocardium using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA. We determined Bcl-2, Bax, and P53 protein expression by Western blot analysis and the cardiomyocyte apoptosis rate via a flow cytometry assay. Results. Compared with the rats in the control group, the diabetic rats gained weight and had increased blood sugar levels, an enhanced heart weight index, and increased myocardial pathophysiological damage. There was a decrease in their Bcl-2 expression, and their Bax and P53 expression increased. The Bcl-2/Bax ratio was enhanced, and there was an increase in the content of collagen types I and III in the myocardium. After treatment with Yi-qi-huo-xue, all levels listed above returned to normal. Conclusion. The Chinese herb Yi-qi-huo-xue degraded the myocardial interstitial collagen types I and III to protect the myocardium of the diabetic rats, thus delaying the role of myocardial fibrosis. Yi-qi-huo-xue could play an important role in protecting the myocardium of DCM rats by enhancing the expression of the Bcl-2 protein, inhibiting the expression of the Bax and P53 proteins, increasing the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, and inhibiting the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. [Prevalence of overweight and obesity among Chinese Yi nationality: a cross-sectional study](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/11/919) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70) Gao Yun 2011-12-01 Full Text Available Abstract Background Overweight and obesity are considered a serious health problem. There are little data on the prevalence of overweight and obesity among the Yi ethnic group in China. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiologic features of overweight/obesity among Chinese Yi nationality. Methods A cross-sectional study, including 1255 subjects aged 20-75 years, was carried out in Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan province from 2007 to 2008. Overweight/overall obesity was defined by World Health Organization (WHO or the Working Group on Obesity in China. Results Overall, the prevalence of overweight and obesity was 19.0% and 2.9%, respectively, based on the WHO definition, while it was 21.0% and 7.4%, respectively, according to the Working Group on Obesity in China, which is similar to data reported in the 2002 Chinese National Nutrition and Health Survey. Urban residents had a significantly higher prevalence of obesity (WHO criteria: 4.3% vs 1.7% p = 0.008; China criteria: 11.4% vs 3.7%, p p p Conclusions The prevalence of overweight/obesity in the Yi nationality is similar to that in Chinese adults 5 years ago. However, urban residents have a much higher prevalence of overweight/obesity than their rural counterparts. Lifestyle and diet patterns associated with socioeconomic status may explain the difference between urban and rural residents. The prevention of overweight/obesity among urban inhabitants deserves more attention in national health education programs. [The Species Identity of the Widely Cultivated 2012-01-01 Ling-zhi, a widely cultivated fungus in China, has a long history in traditional Chinese medicine. Although the name 'Ganoderma lucidum', a species originally described from England, has been applied to the fungus, their identities are not the same. This study aims to clarify the identity of this medicinally and economically important fungus. Specimens of Ling-zhi from China (field collections and cultivated basidiomata of the Chinese 'G. lucidum'), G. lucidum from UK and other related Ganoderma species, were examined both morphologically and molecularly. High variability of basidioma morphology was found in the cultivated specimens of the Chinese 'G. lucidum', while some microscopic characters were more or less consistent, i.e. short clavate cutis elements, Bovista-type ligative hyphae and strongly echinulate basidiospores. These characters were also found in the holotype of G. sichuanense, a species originally described from Sichuan, China, and in recent collections made in the type locality of the species, which matched the diagnostic characters in the prologue. For comparison, specimens of closely related species, G. lucidum, G. multipileum, G. resinaceum, G. tropicum and G. weberianum, were also examined. DNA sequences were obtained from field collections, cultivated basidiomata and living strains of the Chinese 'G. lucidum', specimens from the type locality of G. sichuanense, and specimens of the closely related species studied. Three-gene combined analyses (ITS+IGS+rpb2) were performed and the results indicated that the Chinese 'G. lucidum' shared almost identical sequences with G. sichuanense. Based on both morphological and molecular data, the identity of the Chinese 'G. lucidum' (Ling-zhi) is considered conspecific with G. sichuanense. Detailed morphological descriptions and illustrations are provided in addition to discussion of nomenclature implications.

Agriculture is the primary mode of production and animal husbandry is an important secondary industry. Prior to Liberation, slavery was an integral part of Yi society. The standard of living was low, mortality high, and population growth slow. After Liberation from 1956-1980, the population grew 47.1%, 90% of which was a natural increase. The primary reason for the growth was a post-1960s annual average birth rate of 46/1000 and a mortality rate that fell from 35/1000 before Liberation to 13.3/1000 in 1976. The age structure also became younger. The average age in 1964 was 24 years, with a median age of 21.8 years, as compared to a 1980 average age of 23.8 years and a median age of 17 years. 47.2% of the population were aged from birth to 14 years; 2.9% were over 65 years. At the same time, 28% of the female population were of childbearing age. By 2000 Meigu County's population will reach 259,000. Although the primary reasons for the relatively rapid population increase are due to the destruction of the slave system and a higher standard of living, factors peculiar to Yi society are also significant: 1) the destruction of the slave system permitted the population to grow without the restraints of strict codes of class stratification; 2) the high value placed on having many offsprings, and of favoring male children still prevails; 3) the attitude of early marriage and the custom of widows marrying a relative of her deceased husband still prevail; 4) and infant mortality and the mortality rate of fertile women have declined. Elements which influence the population development of Meigu County include economic factors such as the need to support the old and the young, or the inability to produce enough food to keep up with the needs of an expanding population. [[A review for a traditional Chinese medical journal Shou Shi Yi Bao].](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19583941) Xiao, Mei-Hua; Sun, Wen-Zhong 2009-06-01 Shou Shi Yi Bao was a journal of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) during the period from 1935 to 1937, and was originated by Chen Huan-yun, a TCM physician in Suzhou. It is mainly to transmit the knowledge of TCM and to promote the epidemic prevention capacity of local public. The editorial characteristics and historical value of the journal were explored in initial background, staff writers, editorial policies, contents and the Editor Chen's medical ideas. Shou Shi Yi Bao was supported by many famous TCM physicians, although the journal was originated from the civil society. It was an academic TCM journal with perfect practicability for orientating to the public and highlighting the academic spirit. Chen Huan-yun was a resolute defender of TCM, and had many opinions on clinical practice and lots of scientific suggestions on TCM development. Shou Shi Yi Bao reflected the main characteristics of TCM journals in 1930s. The journal was one of the important documents to study the TCM history during the period of the Republic of China in Jiangsu Province, and it also set a stage for the struggle between TCM and Western medicine at that time. The documentary information of the journal has literature and history values in reflecting the historical process of TCM self-improvement. The success of the journal was due to not only the broken-up sectarian bias and cooperation of the TCM practitioners but also the preponderant geographic and cultural circumstances of Suzhou as well as Chen Huan-yun's profound knowledge in traditional Chinese culture and medicine.

These polysaccharides of 'Zi Zhi' were shown to be of ability to protect nucleated bone marrow cells from micronucleus formation in irradiated mice. For Swiss mice, a dose reduction factor (DRF) was found to be 1.72 in the range of 0 to 4.728 Gy and for LACA mice, to be 1.73 in the range of 0 to 3.152 Gy. Such findings indicate that these polysaccharides are comparable to L-cysteine in their effeciency of protection [Effect of the 3'APOB-VNTR polymorphism on the lipid profiles in the Guangxi Hei Yi Zhuang and Han component of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicrons. Many genetic polymorphisms of the Apo B have been described, associated with variation of lipid levels. However, very few studies have evaluated the effect of the variable number of tandem repeats region 3' of the Apo B gene (3'APOB-VNTR) polymorphism on the lipid profiles in the special minority subgroups in China. Thus, the present study was undertaken to study the effect of the 3'APOB-VNTR polymorphism on the serum lipid levels in the Guangxi Hei Yi Zhuang and Han populations. Methods A total of 548 people of Hei Yi Zhuang were surveyed by a stratified randomized cluster sampling. The epidemiological survey was performed using internationally standardized methods. Serum lipid and apolipoprotein levels were measured. The 3'APOB-VNTR alleles were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels, and classified according to the number of repeats of a 15-bp hypervariable elements (HVE). The sequence of the most common allele was determined using the PCR and direct sequencing. The possible association between alleles of the 3'APOB-VNTR and lipid variables was examined. The results were compared with those in 496 people of Han who also live in that district. Results Nineteen alleles ranging from 24 to 64 repeats were detected in both Hei Yi Zhuang and Han. HVE56 and HVE58 were not be detected in Hei Yi Zhuang whereas HVE48 and HVE62 were totally absent in Han. The frequencies of HVE26, HVE30, HVE46, heterozygote, and short alleles (VNTR-LS (carrier of one long and one short alleles) than in VNTR-LL (the individual carrying two long alleles) genotypes. The levels of TC, triglycerides (TG), LDL cholesterol, and Apo B in Hei Yi Zhuang were higher in both HVE34 and HVE36 alleles than in HVE32 allele. The levels of TC, TG, HDL-C and Apo B in Hei Yi Zhuang were also higher in [Effects of Gui Zhi Ma Huang Ge Ban Tang on the TLR7 Pathway in Influenza Virus Infected Mouse Lungs in a Cold Environment.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29849712) Qin, Hong-Qiong; Shi, Shan-Shan; Fu, Ying-Jie; Hou, Guang-Hui; Jiang, Zhen-You 2018-01-01 We wished to investigate the effects of the traditional Chinese medicine Gui Zhi Ma Huang Ge Ban Tang on controlling influenza A virus (IAV) infection and improving inflammation in mouse lungs. Mice were maintained in normal and cold environments and infected with IAV by intranasal application, respectively. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to measure mRNA expression of TLR7, myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF- B)p65 in the TLR7 signaling pathway and virus replication in lungs. Western blotting was used to measure expression levels of TLR7, MyD88, and NF- B p65 proteins. Flow cytometry was used to detect the proportion of T-helper (Th)1/Th2 and Th17/T-regulatory (Treg) cells. Application of Gui Zhi Ma Huang Ge Ban Tang in influenza-infected mice in a cold environment showed (i) downregulation of TLR7, MyD88, and NF- Bp65; (ii) coding for TLR7, MyD88, and NF- Bp65; (iii) reduction in the proportion of Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg cells. Gui Zhi Ma Huang Ge Ban Tang had a good therapeutic effect on mice infected with IAV, especially in the cold environment. It could reduce lung inflammation in mice significantly and elicit an anti-influenza effect by downregulating expression of the key factors in TLR7 signaling pathway.

These virtual platforms have become important nodes for information and networking, especially in light of economic and intellectual migration and the corresponding trans-local quality of relationships and networks, and contribute to a further diversification of China's cultural landscape. China's ethnic minorities, too, have been employing internet platforms as a means to promote, and to reflect on, their own culture. For some groups these platforms signify an extension of early, non-virtual ethnic networks and platforms in urban contexts, which provide a renewed incentive for the affirmation of ethnicity/ethnic identity by engaging netizens in an ongoing dialogue on ethnic cultural contents, which transcends physical space. The article introduces two major internet platforms of the so-called Yi minority, www.yizuren.com and http://yizucn.com, and probes into their potential for ethnic identity promotion, and into general parameters of the relationship between the Yi and the internet.

Tree-level amplitudes of arbitrary multiplicities and polarizations involving up to three gravitons and up to two color traces are reduced to partial amplitudes of pure Yang-Mills theory. In fact, the double-trace identities apply to Einstein-Yang-Mills extended by a dilaton and a B-field. Our results generalize recent work of Stieberger and Taylor for the single graviton case with a single color trace. As the derivation is made in the dimension-agnostic Cachazo-He-Yuan formalism, our results are valid for external bosons in any number of spacetime dimensions. Moreover, they generalize to the superamplitudes in theories with 16 supercharges.

Nuosu culture is synonymous with the Liangshan Mountains of southern Sichuan Province. Since the 1980s several dozen Nuosu poets have emerged to form what can be called the 'Liangshan School' of contemporary Chinese poetry. Drawing on theory from Ethnopoetics, Ecoliterature, and Folkloristics the paper introduces major themes in the works of these Nuosu poets and introduces poems by three poets who distinctly utilize nature imagery from a common pool of Yi cultural traditions. These traditions include oral literature, ritual, folk costume, and traditional ideas about social hierarchy and gender relations. Much of the nature imagery is related to folk knowledge of native animals and plants. A major theme in the poetry is the response to changes in tradition and the local environment brought about by rapid growth and development in China.

Peripheral blood samples of 102 HIV negative persons of Chinese Yi nationality, 87 males amd 15 females, aged 23 (12-37), and 68 HIV carriers, 61 males and 7 females, aged 27 (17-51). The regulatory and structural regions of the HIV coreceptor CCR5 gene were amplified from the genomic DNA by nested PCR, each of the two regions was divided into three gene fragments which were overlapped. High throughput DHPLC was used for screening of unknown mutations in each gene fragment. The PCR products showing different peak traces from wild types in DHPLC were sequenced by forward and reverse primers respectively. The sequences were analyzed with the help of Sequence Navigator software to search for SNP loci. Statistical analysis by SPSS and PPAP softwares were made to study the association between these SNPs and HIV infection. Five SNPs (A77G, G316A, T532C, C921T, G668A) and a AGA deletion of the 686-688 nucleotides were discovered in the coding region of this gene in Chinese Yi ethnic group. C921T mutation was a nonsense mutation, and the other SNPs (A77G, G316A, T532C, and G668A) are sense mutation, with amino acid changes of K26R, G106R, C178R, and R223Q. Only the frequency of R223Q allelic gene was high (0.08) but those of the others were low (less than 0.01). There was no significant difference in the allele frequency between the HIV negative and HIV positive groups (all P > 0.05). Five SNP loci (T58934G, G59029A, T59353C, G59402A, and C59653T) were found the regulatory region of CCR5 gene with high allelic frequencies of 0.1912-0.2941. Between the HIV negative and HIV positive groups, there were no differences in the SNP loc (all P > 0.05). Statistical analysis of the association between the linkage of mutation loci with HIV infection suggested a significant difference in the haplotype frequency Kasnodihardjo 2014-05-01 distributed to the people who came to the house who conducted the \"selametan\" and distributed also to the neighbouring households.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the association of AZFc polymorphisms and male infertility in the Yi ethnic population, residents within Yunnan Province, China. A total of 224 infertile patients and 153 fertile subjects were selected in the Yi ethnic population. The study was performed by sequence-tagged site plus/minus (STS+/-) analysis followed by gene dosage and gene copy definition analysis. Y haplotypes of 215 cases and 115 controls were defined by 12 binary markers using single nucleotide polymorphism on Y chromosome (Y-SNP) multiplex assays based on single base primer extension technology. The distribution of Y haplotypes was not significantly different between the case and control groups. The frequencies of both gr/gr (7.6% vs. 8.5%) and b2/b3 (6.3% vs. 8.5%) deletions do not show significant differences. Similarly, single nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis shows no significant difference of gene copy definition between the cases and controls. However, the frequency of partial duplications in the infertile group (4.0%) is significantly higher than that in the control group (0.7%). Further, we found a case with sY1206 deletion which had two CDY1 copies but removed half of DAZ genes. Our results show that male infertility is associated with partial AZFc duplications, but neither gr/gr nor b2/b3 deletions, suggesting that partial AZFc duplications rather than deletions are risk factors for male infertility in Chinese-Yi population.

We show that the resulting biconformal Yang-Mills gravity theories describe 4-dim, scale-invariant general relativity in the case of slowly changing fields. In addition, we systematically extend arbitrary 4-dim Yang-Mills theories to biconformal space, providing a new arena for studying flat-space Yang-Mills theories. By applying the biconformal extension to a 4-dim pure Yang-Mills theory with conformal symmetry, we establish a 1-1, onto mapping between a set of gravitational gauge theories and 4-dim, flat-space gauge theories [[Research on maternal health behaviors for Yi-nationality women in poor rural areas based on the theory of reasoned action].](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26733030) Wu, Yuju; Hao, Gang; Sun, Shuai; Chen, Liu, Qiaolan; Yang, Yang; Zhou, Huan 2015-08-01 To analyze the status of maternal health behaviors and it's risk factors for Yi-nationality women in poor rural areas of Sichuan province.

This is no longer true in Einstein-Yang-Mills theory. We discuss sequences of neutral and charged SU(N) Einstein-Yang-Mills black holes, which are static spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat, and which carry Yang-Mills hair. Furthermore, in Einstein-Maxwell theory static black holes are spherically symmetric. We demonstrate that, in contrast, SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills theory possesses a sequence of black holes, which are static and only axially symmetric [KESIMPULAN DALAM PEMERIKSAAN Audit Guidelines-For Audits Performed separately yang pada critical static stall angle, vortex yang terbentuk pada [Center for Theoretical Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02139 (United States); Basu, Pune 411008 (India); Van Physics Gravity, University of Groningen, Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen (Netherlands) 2016-04-11 We investigate the symmetry structure of the non-relativistic limit of Yang-Mills theories.

In this paper, it is shown that, for non-semisimple groups, the number of Yang-Mills fields can be larger. These additional Yang-Mills fields are not irrelevant because they appear in the gauge transformations of the original Yang-Mills fields. Such non-semisimple Yang-Mills theories may lead to physical consequences worth studying. The non-semisimple group with only two generators that do not commute is studied in detail.

Serbian silver dinar wasfound together with a group of Venetian silver coins and it was wronglyclassified to Byzantine Empire which was an effective culture in thatera. Most probably, Serbian silver coin which was dated back to the endof the 13th century, might have come to the Anatolia with a trade ofVenetia. The coin which is protected in the Museum is the reflection of arich culture of Anatolia which is the center of overseas trade betweenEast and West.When Byzantine Empire began to lose its power in 12th century,the idea of independence between Balkan communities developed.Serbian Kingdom which was established in 12th century was gettingstronger gradually and its borders were extended. Therefore, SerbianKingdom reached a balance situation between the West and ByzantineEmpire. As the Serbian Kingdom, was located on the overland journeybetween the West and the East, it had effective relations with itswestern alliances. Because of its strategical location, Byzantine Empirehad to have good relations with them.This rare silver dinar most probably came to Anatolia with theVenetian merchants who were dominant in the sea trade in that era.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the form of field survey in four townships selected from Yi ethnic area of Sichuan during 2014-2015. Participants were children aged 1-13 years by sample size of 900 and were screened for HIV antibody, HBV surface antigen and HCV antibody, and laboratory comfirmation was conducted. The area, age, gender and ethnic group specific infection rates were compared by using Fisher's exact test, and multiple comparisons were corrected by using Bonferroni correction. Results: A total of 677 children aged 1-13 years were surveyed. The infection rates of HIV, HBV and HCV were 1.03 % (7/677, 95 %CI : % -1.12 % ), 6.65 (45/677, 95 %CI : 4.89 % -8.79 % ) and 0.15 % (1/677, 95 %CI : 0 % -0.82 % ), respectively. The infection rates of HIV differed among townships ( P =0.000), the infection rate was higher in township D than in township B, the difference was significant ( P HBV and HCV infections were not significant among different townships, age, gender and ethnic groups. The difference in HBV viral load between age group 5-9 years and age groups 10-13 years was not significant ( U =115.000, P =0.967). Conclusions: The burden of HIV and HBV infections in children aged 1-13 years was heavy in rural area of Yi ethnic area in Sichuan. Therefore, it is necessary to take effective measures to block the vertical transmission of HIV and HBV as well as to increase the coverage of HBV vaccination.

[Two Opposing Effects (Yin and Yang) Determine Cancer Progression.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29604942) Huang, Shujun; Kurubanjerdjit, Nilubon; Xu, Wayne 2017-01-01 In this review, we introduce a new vision of cancer describing opposing effects that control progression. Cancer is a paradigm of opposing of \"Yin\" and \"Yang,\" with Yin being the effect to promote cancer and Yang that to maintain the normal state. This Yin Yang hypothesis has been used to select Yin and Yang genes to develop multigene signatures for determining prognosis in lung and breast cancer. Most of the Yin genes are involved in cell survival, growth, and proliferation, whereas most Yang genes are involved in cell apoptosis. Furthermore, Yin and Yang pathways have been identified in breast cancer and compounds that can inhibit the Yin pathways or activate the Yang pathways have been examined, suggesting a new promising targeting therapy for cancer. We are building a Yin Yang model to represent the dynamic change of Yin and Yang genes and pathways. [Yang-Mills theory in Coulomb Exchange (ETDEWEB)](https://www.etde.org/etdeweb/fieldedsearch.jsp) C. 2006-07-01 In this thesis we study the Yang-Mills vacuum structure by using the functional Schroedinger picture in Coulomb gauge. In particular we discuss the scenario of colour confinement, which was originally formulated by Gribov. After a short introduction, we recall some basic aspects of Yang-Mills theories, its canonical quantization in the Weyl gauge and the functional Schroedinger picture. We then consider the minimal Coulomb gauge and the Gribov problem of the gauge theory. The gauge fixing of the Coulomb gauge is done by using the Faddeev-Popov method, which enables the resolution of the Gauss law - the constraint on physical states. In the third chapter, we variationally solve the stationary Yang-Mills Schroedinger equation in Coulomb gauge for the vacuum state. Therefor we use a vacuum wave functional, which is strongly peaked at the Gribov horizon. The vacuum energy functional is calculated and minimized resulting in a set of coupled Schwinger-Dyson equations for the gluon energy, the ghost and Coulomb form factors and the curvature in gauge orbit space. Using the angular approximation these integral equations have been solved analytically in both the infrared and the ultraviolet regime. The asymptotic analytic solutions in the infrared and ultraviolet regime are reasonably well reproduced by the full numerical solutions of the coupled Schwinger-Dyson equations. In the fourth chapter, we investigate the dependence of the Yang-Mills wave functional in Coulomb gauge on the Faddeev-Popov determinant. (orig.)

In this respect, from the economical point of view a positive Yin phase represents the cash flow, brings nutrition, gentleness and protection, while a negative Yin phase means capital loss, sloth and passive obedience, a positive Yang phase is translated as an action based on funds, emphasising the creation, the construction and the development of infrastructure thanks to an economical action plan, while a negative Yang phase leads to conflicts, to excessive product stocks and to a stock market collapse, causing, in this line, crisis and inflation by increasing prices and decreasing purchasing power. In the European Union, Greece faces a Yang negative phase. When having too much positive Yin monetary stimulus from the EU, the Yin-Yang balance turns in favour of a negative Yang bankrupcy and unemployment. Thus, I explore not only the Greece's economical dimension, but also its geographic role, the synergy between culture and DNA and the last, but not the least, the human's ability in creating a new positive Yin-Yang flourishing future. static solutions to non-minimally extended Einstein-Yang-Mills equations. The obtained solution to the Yang-Mills subsystem is interpreted as a non-minimal Wu-Yang monopole solution. We focus on the analysis of two classes of the exact solutions to the gravitational field equations. Solutions of the first class belong to the Reissner-Nordstroem type, i.e., they are characterized by horizons and by the singularity at the point of origin. The solutions of the second class are regular ones. The horizons and singularities of a new type, the non-minimal ones, are indicated [Alteration of radiation-induced hematotoxicity Jang, Jong Sik; Kim, Sung Ho 2008-01-01 The purpose of this study reported here was to investigate the ability of Bu-Zhong-Yi-Qi-Tang (BZYQT), known to elevate hematopoietic functions, to protect mice undergoing treatment with whole body single gamma-irradiation.

In the present study, we set out to investigate the role of Chinese herbs as anticancer medicines and/or chemotherapeutic adjuvants to increase therapeutic efficacy and/or ameliorate given side-effects in animal model. Twelve kinds of herbs were chosen from the ingredients of major Chinese herbal medicines, and their effects on the antioxidant activity were investigated. To obtain the anticancer effects of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) when consumed with minimal side-effects, we investigated the combination effect of Scutellaria baicalensis and Qing-Shu-Yi-Qi-Tang that may enhance the anticancer activity of 5-FU on subcutaneous tumour growth in C57BL/6 mice challenged with Lewis lung carcinoma cells. Qing-Shu-Yi-Qi-Tang, a multiple-component herbal extract, was shown to have high anti-oxidation activity, while S. baicalensis (Chinese skullcap) was demonstrated to have high tumour-growth inhibition activity. Thus, S. baicalensis and Qing-Shu-Yi-Qi-Tang were evaluated for their combinaton effects on the cancer-induced cachectic murine upon receiving 5-FU chemotherapy. As a result, tumour masses and losses of carcass and/or gastrocnemius muscle were found to be significantly decreased. This combination otherwise increased both Th1/Th2 ratio and NK cytotoxicity. In the mice receiving with or without 5-FU, the serum levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) increased by all means but otherwise decreased when the herbal combination was administrated. Additionally, the expressions of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) and muscle RING finger protein-1 (MuRF-1) decreased in the gastrocnemius muscle when the herbal combination was applied. Our results revealed that the combination of S. baicalensis and Qing-Shu-Yi-Qi-Tang is able to ameliorate cachectic symptoms and positively stimulate anti-tumour immunity while undergoing atorvastatin and ....

[Kualitas Air Hujan dan Faktor Lingkungan yang Andrew 2018-05-01 In this paper, we study the homogeneous interiors of black holes possessing SU(2) Yang-Mills fields subject to corrections inspired by loop quantum gravity. The systems studied possess both magnetic and induced electric Yang-Mills fields. We consider the system of equations both with and without Wilson loop corrections to the Yang-Mills potential. The structure of the Yang-Mills Hamiltonian, along with the restriction to homogeneity, allows for an anomaly-free effective quantization. In particular, we study the bounce which replaces the classical singularity and the behavior of the Yang-Mills fields in the quantum corrected interior, which possesses topology R \u00d7S2 . Beyond the bounce, the magnitude of the Yang-Mills electric field asymptotically grows monotonically. This results in an ever-expanding R sector even though the two-sphere volume is asymptotically constant. The results are similar with and without Wilson loop corrections on the Yang-Mills potential.

A brane probe of the geometry shows that the scalar potential of the gauge theory is stable. We discuss the infra-red behaviour of the solution. The geometry describes a Schroedinger equation potential that determines the glueball spectrum of the theory; there is a mass gap and a discrete spectrum. The glueball mass predictions match previous AdS/CFT Correspondence computations in the non-supersymmetric Yang Mills theory, and lattice data, at the 10% level.

If we put a specific region and society in a specific period under a microscope and increase the magnifying power, we can understand the numerous network connections among the body, illness management, and medicine and how multilayered were the knowledge and power applied to them. And this approach of using microhistory to illuminate medical history can be more effective than any other historical approach. This article focuses on Yi Mun-gn's extensive volumes of Mukchaeilgi (Mukchae's diary) in approaching medical history from the perspective of microhistory. Simply defined, this work is a Confucian scholar-doctor's diary. Its author, Yi Mun-gn, played the role of a Confucian doctor, although not professionally, during his 23-year exile, after serving in a high governmental office on the senior grade of the third court rank. Thanks to this extensive and detailed diary, we can now get adetailed andthorough picture of his medical practice in the Sngju region, 270 kilometers southeast of Seoul, where he was exiled. This article aims to understand the state of medical practice in the Sngju region in the 16thcentury through the\"zoom-in\" method adopted by microhistory. In particular, I will focus on the following three aspects:1) Yi Mun-gn's motivation for and method of medical study, 2)the character of Yi Mun-gn'spatient treatment as hwarin (the act of life-saving), and 3) the plural existence of various illness management methods, including pyngjm (divination of illness), sutra-chanting, exorcism, and ch'oje (ritual toward Heaven). All three aspects are closely related to Confucianism.

This paper attempts to clarify this basic concept and reconcile the differing descriptions of it through an exploration of material from other disciplines. A remarkable similarity exists between the surfaces on the human body that are defined by the pathways of the yin and yang meridians and those that have evolved from the ventral and the dorsal aspects of early vertebrate structure. Many of the evolutionary changes described have parallels in our embryological development and are evident in the underlying anatomy of our limbs. The degree of convergence between the two descriptions strongly supports the definition of the yin and yang surfaces as those traversed by the yin and yang meridians. It also goes a long way towards reconciling the conflicting definitions found in the literature. Finding a solution to this question of yin and yang surfaces that is based on anatomy and evolutionary theories has several advantages. It can throw light on differences in the clinical effects of points on the yin and yang meridians and enable the identification of anomalies in the pathways of the main meridian network.

[International Nuclear Information Y; Guan, X W; Batchelor, M T 2011-01-01 Using Yang and Yang's particle-hole description, we present a thorough derivation of the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations for a general SU() fermionic system in one dimension for both the repulsive and attractive regimes under the presence of an external magnetic field. These equations are derived from Sutherland's Bethe ansatz spin-string hypothesis. The Bethe ansatz root patterns for the attractive case are discussed in detail. The relationship between the various phases of the magnetic phase diagrams and the external magnetic fields is given for the attractive case. We also give a quantitative description of the ground-state energies for both strongly repulsive and attractive Yang Mempengaruhi general higher derivative Yang-Mills actions of the type (F 2 +2F 4 ) which are globally supersymmetric up to order 2 in six and ten dimensional spacetimes are given. The F 4 -terms turn out to occur in the combination 2 (tr F 4 - 1/4(tr F 2 ) 2 ), where the trace is over the Lorentz indices. This result agrees with the low energy limit of the open superstring in ten dimensions, where is the string tension. Surprisingly, the transformation rules of the Yang-Mills multiplet receive order 2 corrections even in the off-shell formulation. For the case of Abelian Yang-Mills group, the action is expressed in Born-Infeld form with a metric generically given by (1+ 2 F 2 +...).

The purpose of the present study is to investigate the anti-tumor effect and the underling mechanism of TBMS1 on glioma cancer cells.Methods: The MTT assay was performed to evaluate the effect of TBMS1 on glioma cell proliferation. The fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry analysis were performed to evaluate the effect of TBMS1 on glioma cell apoptosis. The Western blot analysis was used to evaluate the protein change.Results: TBMS1 inhibited glioma cancer cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry analysis that TBMS1 induced glioma cell apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. Western blotting showed that TBMS1 induced apoptosis by increasing the expression of Bax and downregulating the level of Bcl-2. Furthermore, we found that TBMS1 induced apoptosis by increasing the concentration of reactive oxygen species through the release of Cytochrome C and activation of Caspase-3.Conclusion: These findings indicate that TBMS1 may be developed as a possible therapeutic agent for the management of of renormalizable theories with coupled massless fields (in particular, the Yang--Mills theory) are shown to cancel for transition probabilities corresponding to finite-energy-resolution detectors, just as in quantum electrodynamics.

This study, Yunnan Minority Eye Study (YMES), was initially designed to determine the prevalence and impact of eye diseases, including hypertension and diabetes mellitus. As a part of YMES, the prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension and the associated risk factors among the Yi ethnic population in rural China are reported. A population-based survey was conducted in 2012 with adult participants over 50 from rural communities in Shilin Yi Autonomous County, Yunnan Province, located in southwest China. A random cluster sampling method was used to select a representative sample. The participants' blood pressure, height, weight, and waist circumference were measured. Hypertension was defined as mean systolic blood pressure 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure 90 mmHg, and/or current use of antihypertensive medications. A total of 2208 adults were assessed. The prevalence of hypertension was 38.5%, and the age- and gender-adjusted prevalence was 37.0%. The proportion of patients who were aware of their hypertension among those diagnosed with hypertension was 24.8%. Of those aware of having hypertension, 23.6% took antihypertensive drugs. Among all hypertensive patients, only 7.2% had controlled their hypertension (population of the Yi ethnic group in China. The ratio of awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension were considerately low. Hypertension education and screening programs in rural China are recommended to improve the health status of this population.

Conservated, quantities are found through the Noether's identity. This formalism is used for masive Yang-Mills fields and two equations, similar to the Kemmer's equation, are obtained, although of different formates, both containing quadratic terms. In consequence two Lagrangians are defined, formally distint, for the Yang-Mills fields. The Schroedinger-like Hamiltonian is calculated for the first wave equations.

This approach may lay a foundation for the further investigation of the curative mechanisms of calming the liver and suppressing Yang treatment. A total of 48 hyperthyroidism patients with syndrome of hyperactivity of liver-Yang were randomly divided into treatment group and control group. The treatment group was treated by method for calming the liver and suppressing Yang in accordance with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and the control group with thiamazole tablets for three periods of treatment The therapeutic effects, the score of TCM symptom, electrocardiogram (P wave), thyroid hormones and ultrasound were observed in both groups before and after the treatment. The side effects in the treatment course were observed in both groups. The level of differential protein expression was analyzed by two-dimensional electrphoresis and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionizaton time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The treatment group has the effect on stepping down the heart rate, cutting down the P wave amplitude changes, regulating the level of thyroid hormones and decreasing the volume of thyromegaly.

We investigate numerically the evolution of the universe and the Yang-Mills fields during the radiation and dust eras of a universe that is almost isotropic. The Yang-Mills field undergoes small amplitude chaotic oscillations, as do the three expansion scale factors which are also displayed by the expansion scale factors of the universe. The results of the numerical simulations are interpreted analytically and compared with past studies of the cosmological evolution of magnetic fields in radiation and dust universes. We find that, whereas magnetic universes are strongly constrained by the microwave background anisotropy, Yang-Mills universes are principally constrained by primordial nucleosynthesis but the bound is comparatively weak with YM rad [Introduction to the Yang-Baxter Equation with Open of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70) Florin Nichita 2012-04-01 Full Text Available The Yang-Baxter equation first appeared in theoretical physics, in a paper by the Nobel laureate C.

With these techniques one can compute the reduced partition functions of topological super-Yang-Mills theory with 4, 8 or 16 supercharges. More generally, the superlocalization formula can be applied to any topological field theory in any number of dimensions [Instability of higher dimensional xO(3) invariant solutions for a pure semi-simple Yang-Mills, as as Yang-Mills coupled to gravity in 6-dimensional space-time compactified over M 4 xS 2 .

The model was induced by 3,3-iminodipropionitrile (IDPN treatment; then mice were divided into 4 groups (n=22, each; control and IDPN groups were gavaged with saline and the remaining 2 groups were gavaged with tiapride and JPZDD. We recorded the stereotypic behaviors of TS mice and measured the content of GABA in striatum by HPLC and GABAAR expression by immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR. Our results showed that JPZDD inhibited the abnormal behaviors of TS model mice and decreased GABA levels and GABAAR protein and mRNA expression in the striatum of TS model mice. In brief, the mechanism by which JPZDD alleviates TS symptoms may be associated with GABAAR expression downregulation in striatum which may the Yang's type (super) equations previously derived (hep-th/9811108) by M.

These Yang's type field equations are shown to be precisely such that they automatically provide a solution of these conditions. This B\u00e4cklund transformation is similar to the one proposed by A.

They have attracted much attention from mathematicians and physicists since their discovery. In this work, we analyze black holes associated with the gauge Lorentz group. In particular, we study solutions which identify the gauge connection with the spin connection. This ansatz allows one to find exact solutions to the complete system of equations. By using this procedure, we show the equivalence between the Yang-Mills-Lorentz model in curved space-time and a particular set of extended gravitational theories. (orig.)

Taubes and I recently proposed a continuum regularization technique for quantum field theory. This regularization may be implemented by applying a regulator to either the (d + 1)-dimensional Parisi-Wu Langevin equation or, equivalently, to the d-dimensional second order Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations. This technique is non-perturbative, respects all gauge and Lorentz symmetries, and is consistent with a ghost-free gauge fixing (Zwanziger's). This thesis is a detailed study of this regulator, and of regularized Yang-Mills theory, using both perturbative and non-perturbative techniques. The perturbative analysis comes first. The mechanism of stochastic quantization is reviewed, and a perturbative expansion based on second-order SD equations is developed. A diagrammatic method (SD diagrams) for evaluating terms of this expansion is developed. We apply the continuum regulator to a scalar field theory. Using SD diagrams, we show that all Green functions can be rendered finite to all orders in perturbation theory. Even non-renormalizable theories can be regularized. The continuum regulator is then applied to Yang-Mills theory, in conjunction with Zwanziger's gauge fixing. A perturbative expansion of the regulator is incorporated into the diagrammatic method. It is hoped that the techniques discussed in this thesis will contribute to the construction of a renormalized Yang-Mills theory is 3 and 4 dimensions yang digunakan Xin; Worm, Verner; Peihong, Xie 2017-01-01 Purpose The paper debunks Peter P.

A satisfactory method of detecting MEL in onsite or in-home testing is in urgent need of development. This work aimed to explore a rapid, convenient, and cost-effective method of identifying MEL in milk products or other food by colloidal selenium-based lateral flow immunoassay. Colloidal selenium was synthesized by L-ascorbic acid to reduce seleninic acid at room temperature. After conjugation with a monoclonal antibody anti-MEL, a test strip was successfully prepared. The detection limit of the test strip reached 150 \u00b5g/kg, 1,000 \u00b5g/kg, and 800 \u00b5g/kg in liquid milk, milk powder, and animal feed, respectively. No cross-reactions with homologues cyanuric acid, cyanurodiamide, or ammelide were found. Moreover, the MEL test strip can remain stable after storage for 1 year at room temperature. Our results demonstrate that the colloidal selenium MEL test strip can detect MEL in adulterated milk products or animal feed conveniently, rapidly, and sensitively. In contrast with a colloidal gold MEL test strip, the colloidal selenium MEL test strip was easy to prepare and more cost-efficient. Keywords: melamine, selenium nanoparticles, test strip, Indonesia Two problems are studied in the paper: (i) the relation between Lagrangian and Feynman rules if the Lagrangian contains derivative couplings and/or vector meson fields and (ii) the behaviour of certain two closed loop diagrams in the perturbation theory of Yang-Mills fields.

The Lagrangian requires the selection of a codimension-2 Cauchy-Riemann submanifold which is naturally picked out by the choice of space-time reality structure and we focus on the choice of Euclidean signature. The action is shown to give rise to a space-time action that is equivalent to the standard one, but has just cubic vertices.

Having graduated from Faculty of Political Sciences, brahim S\u00fcreyya entered upon his career in duty position. He lived out nearly best part of his life with risky adventures. During his biennial officialism process, his relationship with the Party of Union and Progress caused him to stay in Sinop prison in repressive days of the period of II. Abd\u00fclhamit. In subsequent years after his three year imprisonment, Party of Union and Progress came into power; therefore he continued his mission with administrative duties. While brahim S\u00fcreyya was a provincial district governor in one of Rumelian lands, Turco- Italian War broke out; therefore he resigned from his administrative duty without any hesitation and crusaded as a volunteer. In this war, he entered into Mustafa Kemal's service and their friendship which would last for long years began. When brahim S\u00fcreyya was governor of Gallipoli during First World War years, their paths with Mustafa Kemal crossed again. brahim S\u00fcreyya experienced trashing of war actually and he was one of the people who commenced struggle in Anatolia by taking chances with his intimate friend Mustafa Kemal during catasrtophic days in which enemies were trying to split the country. brahim S\u00fcreyya who took sides with Mustafa Kemal even after War of Independence and who was one of the individuals having established a state from wrecks of the war, served in the government throughout his life lasting till 1950s. Bu makalede By using the deduced differential cross-section data for PHIp elastic scattering at 175 GeV/c in the Chou-Yang model, the PHI form factor has been computed and parametrized. Then in conjunction with the proton form factor this form factor is used in the pristine Chou-Yang model to obtain differential cross-section data at Fermilab energies. The theoretical results agree with the experimental measurements, endorsing the conjecture that the hadronic form factor of neutral particle is proportional to its magnetic form factor.

The purpose of this study was to examine the test-retest validity of SPQ with a large number of participants. SPQ test was conducted two times with three months interval in 247 Korean university students. The structural validity of first SPQ data was examined with Factor analysis and Cronbach's alpha, and the correlation between first and second measure of SPQ was attested with Pearson's correlation. Yang, Uncertain and Yin temperament groups were determined with SPQ total scores, and agreement of temperament group clustering between first and second measures were analyzed with Cohen's Kappa. Three subscales of SPQ explained 55.25% of total variances, and internal consistency of SPQ total score was 0.772. The correlation coefficient between first and second measures of SPQ were 0.851 and 0.888 in male and female, respectively, and the agreement of first and second Yin-Yang temperament group clustering as Cohen's Kappa was 0.536 for male and 0.637 for female. The repeatability of SPQ measuring Yin-Yang temperament at three months of interval was found to be satisfactory.

The disturbances in the Yin-Yang dynamical balance may result in stress, inflammation, and various disorders including insomnia, Alzheimer's disease, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, skin disorders, and cancer. At the molecular and cellular levels, the imbalances in the cytokine pathways, mitochondria networks, redox systems, and various signaling pathways may contribute to systemic inflammation. In the nervous system, Yin and Yang may represent the dynamical associations between the progressive and regressive processes in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. In response to the damages to the heart, the Yin-Yang dynamical balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine networks is crucial.

As expected, we find that Wilson-loop correlation functions depend on the N-ality of a representation R to the leading order. However, the next-to-leading order correction is not universal and is given by the group characters, in the representation R , of the permutation group. We also study W-bosons in super Yang-Mills. We show that they are deconfined on the string world sheet, and therefore, they can change neither the string N-ality nor its tension. This phenomenon mirrors the fact that soft gluons do not screen probe charges with nonzero N-ality in pure Yang-Mills.

Abstract in the higher dimensional Einstein-Yang-Mills equations for a null dust with Yang-Mills gauge charge are obtained by employing Wu-Yang ansatz, namely, HD-EYM Vaidya solution. It is interesting to note that gravitational contribution of Yang-Mills (YM) gauge charge for this ansatz is indeed opposite (attractive rather than repulsive) that of Maxwell charge. It turns out that the gravitational collapse of null dust with YM gauge charge admits strong curvature shell focusing naked singularities violating cosmic censorship. However, there is significant shrinkage of the initial data space for a naked singularity of the HD-Vaidya collapse due to presence of YM gauge charge. The effect of YM gauge charge on structure and location of the apparent and event horizons is also discussed.

System (INIS) ](http://inis.iaea.org/search/) Mason, L.J.; Newman, E.T. 1989-01-01 It is our purpose here to show an unusual relationship between the Einstein equations and the Yang-Mills equations. We give a correspondence between solutions of the self-dual Einstein vacuum equations and the self-dual Yang-Mills equations with a special choice of gauge group. The extension of the argument to the full Yang-Mills equations yields Einstein's unified equations. We try to incorporate the full Einstein vacuum equations, but the approach is incomplete. We first consider Yang-Mills theory for an arbitrary Lie-algebra with the condition that the connection 1-form and curvature are constant on Minkowski space. This leads to a set of algebraic equations on the connection components. We then specialize the Lie-algebra to be the (infinite dimensional) Lie algebra of a group of diffeomorphisms of some manifold. The algebraic equations then become differential equations for four vector fields on the manifold on which the diffeomorphisms act. In the self-dual case, if we choose the connection components from the Lie-algebra of the volume preserving 4-dimensional diffeomorphism group, the resulting equations are the same as those obtained by Ashtekar, Jacobsen and Smolin, in their remarkable simplification of the self-dual Einstein vacuum equations. (An alternative derivation of the same equations begins with the self-dual Yang-Mills connection now depending only on the time, then choosing the Lie-algebra as that of the volume preserving 3-dimensional diffeomorphisms). When the reduced full Yang-Mills equations are used in the same context, we get Einstein's equations for his unified theory based on absolute parallelism. To incorporate the full Einstein vacuum equations we use as the Lie group the semi-direct product of the diffeomorphism group of a 4-dimensional manifold with the group of frame rotations of an SO(1, 3) bundle over the 4-manifold. This last approach, however, yields equations more general than the vacuum equations.

Next, the task of finding and studying Euclidean gauge field configurations of finite action as solutions to the equation of motion is addressed. It is found that configurations which contribute the most in the semi-classical approximation are those which minimize the action. The question of a lower bound for the Euclidean action is considered. Properties of topological charge and the behavior of topological charge under gauge transformation are discussed. Then instanton solutions to the field equations are produced. Finally, the physical interpretation of the instanton is considered. It is found that the instanton, the Euclidean gauge field configuration which minimizes the action, induces tunneling among the infinitely degenerate vacua of the Yang-Mills theory by lifting the degeneracy and creating new distinct inequivalent (invariant under topologically nontrivial gauge transformations) vacua labelled by a superselection index theta. The angle theta is shown not to be a gauge artifact. In conclusion, the tunneling Hamiltonian and effective Lagrangian for the Yang-Mills theory are discussed [Yang Monopoles and Emergent Three-Dimensional Topological Defects in Interacting Bosons](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PhRvL.120w5302Y) Yan, Yangqian; Zhou, Qi 2018-06-01 The Yang monopole as a zero-dimensional topological defect has been well established in multiple fields in physics. However, it remains an intriguing question to understand the interaction effects on Yang monopoles. Here, we show that the collective motion of many interacting bosons gives rise to exotic topological defects that are distinct from Yang monopoles seen by a single particle. Whereas interactions may distribute Yang monopoles in the parameter space or glue them to a single giant one of multiple charges, three-dimensional topological defects also arise from continuous manifolds of degenerate many-body eigenstates. Their projections in lower dimensions lead to knotted nodal lines and nodal rings. Our results suggest that ultracold bosonic atoms can be used to create emergent topological defects and directly measure topological invariants that are not easy to access in solids.

The method fits most naturally into the framework of multi-loop integrand reduction and in a nutshell amounts to consistently retaining the colour structures of the unitarity cuts from which the integrand is gradually constructed. This technique has already been used in the recent calculation of the two-loop five-gluon amplitude in pure Yang-Mills theory with all positive helicities, (DOI: 10.1007/JHEP10(2015)064). In this note, we give a careful exposition of the method and discuss its connection to loop-level Kleiss-Kuijf relations. We also explore its implications for cancellation of nontrivial symmetry factors at two loops. As an example of its generality, we show how it applies to the three-loop case a days, the consumption of fast food has become an eating pattern for Indonesian. One of the most popular fast food is meatball, but today, we often found that the producents add a non food addition ingredient in the meatball that we call formalin. The use of formalin actually has been prohibited used in food based on the Peraturan Menteri Kesehatan No.1168 tahun 1999, but in fact, there are food producent that produce food with formalin. One of the food is meat ball. The objective of this research is to identifying whether there are formalin in meatballs that sold in padang. 42 samples that identified taken from mobile vendor, meatball restaurant and franchise restaurant in several locations with the greatest numbers of [Non-integrability of time-dependent spherically is studied using the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam method.

Abstract in Bor, G. 1991-01-01 The purpose of the thesis is to prove the existence of a new family of non self-dual finite-energy solutions to the Yang-Mills equations on Euclidean four-space, with SU(2) as a gauge group. The approach is that of equivalent geometry: attention is restricted to a special class of fields, those that satisfy a certain kind of rotational symmetry which it is proved that (1) a solution to the Yang-Mills equations exists for among them, and (2) no solution to the self-duality equations exists among them. The first assertion is proved by an application of the direct method of the calculus of variations (existence and regularity of minimizers), and the second assertion by showing that the self-duality equations, linearized at a symmetric self-dual solution, cannot possess the required symmetry [ANALISIS FAKTOR-FAKTOR YANG 0.749.\u00c2 The objective of this study is to test empirically the factors that influence the independence of public accountant appearance both partially and simultaneously.

A generalization of the Abelian Hodge star duality is found which, though not yet known to give dual symmetry, reproduces analogues to many dual properties of the Abelian theory. For example, there is a dual potential, but it is a two-indexed tensor T of the Freedman-Townsend-type. Though not itself functioning as such, T gives rise to a dual parallel transport A for the phase of the wave function of the color magnetic charge, this last being a monopole of the Yang-Mills field but a source of the dual field. The standard color (electric) charge itself is found to be a monpole of A . At the same time, the gauge symmetry is found doubled from say SU(N) to SU(N)xSU(N). A novel feature is that all equations of motion, including the standard Yang-Mills and Wong equations, are here derived from a ''universal'' principle, namely, the Wu-Yang criterion for monpoles, where interactions arise purely as a consequence of the topological definition of the monopole charge. The technique used is the loop space formulation of Polyakov [Ultraviolet divergences in higher K.S. 1984-01-01 We determine the loop orders for the onset of allowed ultra-violet divergences in higher dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. Cancellations are controlled by the non-renormalization theorems for the linearly realizable supersymmetries and by the requirement that counterterms display the full non-linear supersymmetries when the classical equations of motion are imposed. The first allowed divergences in the maximal super Yang-Mills theories occur at four loops in five dimensions, three loops in six dimensions and two loops in seven dimensions. (orig.)

We employ three-dimensional N=2 superspace language to identify the Higgs branch of this theory. We find that the vacuum conditions determining the Higgs branch are exactly the bow equations yielding Yang-Mills instantons on a multi-Taub-NUT space. Under electric-magnetic duality, the super Yang-Mills theory describing the bulk is mapped to itself, while the fundamental- and bifundamental-carrying impurity walls are interchanged.

It is shown, in terms of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio mechanism, that the gauge symmetry breaking can be realized dynamically in the maximally generalized Yang-Mills model.

Methods: Twenty aged AD rats (Sparague-Dawley rats,male) were randomly divided into FZS treated group (n = 10) and control group (n = 10). Another 10 healthy adult rats were as blank controls. Morris water maze record system was used for cognitive function assessment. Before and after FZS treatment 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and 11 C-2- (PIB) PET imaging was undertaken. After post-treatment imaging procedures the brain tissues of all animals were taken for histochemical study, such as staining with HE, congo red, amyloid immunofluorescence, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) SPSS 13.0 software for the data analysis. Results: The cognitive dysfunction of aging AD rats was improved after FZS treatment. The escape latency in FZS treated group was significantly shorter than that of control group ((32.5 \u00b110.8) s vs (102.6\u00b18.8) s, t =15.7987, P=0. 0001). Diffuse neuronal loss and A deposition were detected in the hippocampus and cortex in the aged AD rats. The imaging data showed that brain glucose metabolism was amended in FZS treated group while the abatement of amyloid deposition was not significant. Immunofluorescence results indicated that the neuronal proliferation was more remarkable in FZS treated group. Conclusions: It may be feasible to use PET imaging as a method to evaluate the therapeutic effect in AD rats. FZS may ameliorate memory dysfunction of aged AD rats. Its mechanism may be partly contributed to the enhancement of the neuronal proliferation and survival.

In the framework of the superfield approach we present with some details two versions of the composite N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions with U(n) and U(m) x U(n) local invariance. We argue that especially the superfield sigma models can be used for the description of pre-QCD supersymmetric dynamics. solutions of Yang-Mills equations are given which show that the source does not uniquely determine the field. However, these particular solutions suggest a natural way of uniquely specifying solutions in terms of a physical realization of a symmetry group. (orig.)

This paper described the efforts to avoid the capture of turtles on the tuna longline fishery and its handling recommendation. It has been written based on the research results and observer programs of activities that have been implemented since 2005. It's also including a literature review rules and regulations regarding the management of sea turtles. The record results during 2005 - 2014 conducted by an independent scientific board on tuna longline in the Indian Ocean with 72 times number of setting and 89,441number of hooks. There are 105 turtles caught, which are leatherback, olive ridley turtles, hawksbill, loggerhead sea turtles as well as the unknown green turtle where the current status of turtles in the Indian Ocean is in a state of vulnerable, endangered, critically even endangered. The olive ridley turtle, loggerhead and leatherback turtles are in a vulnerable status. While, the green turtles are in a state endangered and even hawksbill in a state extremely endangered. Policy measures for handling of turtles in tuna longline fishery needs to be taken in order to be implemented include the socialization of the use of intensified circle hooks and if necessary the government issued regulations regarding the use of circle hooks, the implementation of the placement of fishing monitoring (observer aboard the tuna longline in order to assist the skippers monitoring the catch of turtles and turtle handling training for the skippers and crew in order to hold the caught turtles can be handled directly on the boat to reduce the mortality turtles which can be released back into the sea alive.

However, the difference is a central issue in the news, coverage of environmental journalism focused on text production from the reality of environment such as the environmental damage caused of human error (pollution, flooding, landslides, and deforestation, local wisdom, conservation, waste, nature resource. According to categorization from Flournoy, environmental news consist of about environmental degradation such as deforestation, pollution industrial waste and the greenhouse effect through newspapers and television. But most environmentalists are not satisfied with the environmental news in newspapers and on television. They cite three mistakes that often appear in the news environment, such as: lack of information relevant to the background news, headlines are often misleading and lack of desire to think of risk coverage.

[[Plasma metabonomics of Guifu Dihuang Wan in the treatment of deficiency].](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27881338) Xiao, Ya; Jing, Yuan; Chen, Jie-Yu; Luo, assess the effect of Guifu Dihuang Wan (GFDHW) in the treatment of yang deficiency and explore the underlying molecular mechanism. Sixty-two participants without diseases were randomized into control group (n=31) and experimental group (n=31) and were given lifestyle intervention additional GFDHW treatment for a month. NMR technology was used for metabonomics analysis. Intervention with GFDHW resulted in significantly decreased conversion scores of yang deficiency in the experimental group compared with the control group (P<0.005). The concentrations of lactate, valine, proline, arginine and 3-hydroxybutyrate were increased in the plasma of yang-deficient subjects after lifestyle intervention. GFDHW treatment with lifestyle intervention significantly increased the concentrations of lactate, valine, proline, arginine and 3-hydroxybutyrate and alpha glucose, isoleucine, betaine and propylene glycol. GFDHW treatment improves yang deficiency possibly by increasing the concentrations of alanine, glutamine, alpha glucose, isoleucine, betaine and propylene glycol and promoting energy metabolism of structure in the scattering amplitudes of the generic Jordan family of N=2 Maxwell-Einstein and Yang-Mills/Einstein supergravity theories in four and five dimensions. The Maxwell-Einstein supergravity amplitudes are obtained through the color/kinematics duality as a product of two gauge-theory factors; one originating from pure N=2 super-Yang-Mills theory and the other from the dimensional reduction of a bosonic higher-dimensional pure Yang-Mills theory. We identify a specific symplectic frame in four dimensions for which the on-shell fields and amplitudes from the double-copy construction can be identified with the ones obtained from the supergravity Lagrangian and Feynman-rule computations. The Yang-Mills/Einstein supergravity theories are obtained by gauging a compact subgroup of the isometry group of their Maxwell-Einstein counterparts. For the generic Jordan family this process is identified with the introduction of cubic scalar couplings on the bosonic gauge-theory side, which PA THOGENICITY ASSA VIBRIO YUSMINAH H ALA 2002-01-01 Full Text Available Rifampicin-resistant marker w as empl oyed as a repor ter t o detect the ad here nce and colonization of V. harve yi in s hrimp larvae.

Shen deficiency Zheng is one of the main types of osteoporosis while Shen-Yin and -Yang deficiencies represent two basic principles/types of Shen deficiency. Currently, Tonifying Shen strategy, in particular, the Tonifying Shen-Yin and -Yang principles, has been demonstrated to exert osteoprotective effects. However, the mechanisms by which Tonifying Shen strategy and/or Tonifying Shen-Yin and -Yang principles function in treating osteoporosis are still not clearly understood. Here we first briefly explore current understanding of Tonifying Shen strategy, such as Tonifying Shen prescriptions, herbs, and effective components, in treating osteoporosis. Furthermore, the mechanism of Tonifying Shen-Yang principle in treating osteoporosis is reviewed from the clinic experience, animal, and mechanistic investigation. Moreover, the mechanisms by which Tonifying Shen-Yin principle in treating osteoporosis are established. Finally, we compare the similarity and difference between Tonifying Shen-Yang and -Yin principles in treating osteoporosis. Our findings indicate that both principles exert bone-protective effects in treating osteoporosis by simultaneously stimulating the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs into osteoblast and the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs into osteoclast. However, Tonifying Shen-Yin principle is in favor of increasing bone mineral density (BMD while Tonifying Shen-Yang principle is in favor of osteoporosis-related syndromes. Our findings indicate that Tonifying Shen-Yin and -Yang principles not only share some similarity but also obtain some difference in treating osteoporosis.

To optimize public service for the community, by 2013 the number of districts has been in expand into 32 districts. Research purposes is to figure out how the implementation of the policy widened the territory based the public services, particully in the education sector. This type of research is empiric juridic or in other words sociological study of law with statutory approach, sociological approach, conceptual approach and a case approach. Research data collected were analyzed with descriptive analytical method. The results showed that in general the expansion policy districts in South Central Timor has been on target but in terms of public services, especially in the education sector do not maximized because there is less or limited staff, poor quality of science held by educators as well as the lack of infrastructure educational support such as libraries, laboratories and classrooms. Key words: policy, redistricting, public service, integrable systems and integrable spin systems in 2+1 dimensions can be obtained from the (2+1)- dimensional Gauss-Mainardi-Codazzi and Gauss-Weingarten equations, respectively. We also show that the (2+1)-dimensional Gauss-Mainardi-Codazzi equation which describes the deformation (motion) of surfaces is the exact reduction of the Yang-Mills-Higgs-Bogomolny and self-dual Yang-Mills equations. On the basis of this observation, we suggest that the (2+1)-dimensional Gauss-Mainardi-Codazzi equation is a candidate to be integrable, and the associated linear problem (Lax representation) with the spectral parameter is presented.

Limited scientific evidence supports the positive effects of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM for treating dysmenorrhea. Thus, an observation period of 3 months could verify the ancient indication that TCM treatments effectively alleviate menstrual cramps in women with primary dysmenorrhea or endometriosis. Methods. A prospective, nonrandomized study (primary dysmenorrhea and endometriosis groups was conducted in women with dysmenorrhea for more than three consecutive menstrual cycles. All patients received TCM prescriptions based on bian zheng lun zhi theory 14 days before menstruation for a period of 12 weeks. Pain intensity was evaluated using a 10-cm visual analogue scale and two validated questionnaires (the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire and the World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire. Results. Of the initial 70 intent-to-treat participants, the women with dysmenorrhea reported significant alleviation of cramps during menstruation after the 12-week TCM treatment. Mixed model analysis revealed that TCM prescriptions were more effective in alleviating fatigue, hot flashes, dizziness, painful breasts, excitement, and irritability in the primary dysmenorrhea group (N=36 than in the endometriosis group (N=34. Conclusion. TCM prescriptions based on syndrome differentiation theory might be a potentially viable choice for treating painful menstruation and premenstrual symptoms after ruling out endometriosis.

BBR solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs were prepared to achieve improved bioavailability and prolonged effect. Developed SLNs showed homogeneous spherical shapes, small size (76.8 nm, zeta (7.87 mV, encapsulation efficiency (58%, and drug loading (4.2%. The power of X-ray diffraction combined with 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was employed to analyze chemical functional groups and the microstructure of BBR-SLNs, and indicated that the drug was wrapped in a lipid carrier. Single dose (50 mg/kg oral pharmacokinetic studies in rats showed significant improvement (P<0.05 in the peak plasma concentration, area under the curve, and variance of mean residence time of BBR-SLNs when compared to BBR alone (P<0.05, suggesting improved bioavailability. Furthermore, oral administration of both BBR and BBR-SLNs significantly suppressed body weight gain, fasting blood glucose levels, and homeostasis assessment of insulin resistance, and ameliorated impaired glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance in db/db diabetic mice. BBR-SLNs at high dose (100 mg/kg showed more potent effects when compared to an equivalent dose of BBR. Morphologic analysis demonstrated that BBR-SLNs potentially promoted islet function and protected the islet from regeneration. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that by entrapping BBR into SLNs the absorption of BBR and its anti-diabetic action were effectively enhanced. Keywords: 1994-01-01 A classical solution to the Yang-Mills theory is given a semiclassical interpretation. The boundary value problem on a complex time contour which arises from the semiclassical approximation to multiparticle scattering amplitudes is reviewed and applied to the case of Yang-Mills theory. The solution describes a classically forbidden transition between states with a large average number of particles in the limit g0. It dominates a transition probability with a semiclassical suppression factor equal to twice the action of the well-known BPST instanton. Hence, it is relevant to the problem of high-energy tunnelling. It describes transitions of unit topological charge for an appropriate time contour. Therefore, it may have a direct interpretation in terms of fermion-number violating processes in electroweak theory. The solution describes a transition between an initial state with parametrically fewer particles than the final state. Thus, it may be relevant to the study of semiclassical initial-state corrections in the limit of a small number of initial particles. The implications of these results for multiparticle production in electroweak theory are pengendalian kebisingan.

We extend our recent results presented in Lue et al (2002 Preprint hep-th/0212323), by obtaining the complete N = 4 Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons supergravity in D = 3, up to quartic fermion terms, by S 3 group manifold reduction of the six-dimensional theory. The SU(2) gauge fields have Yang-Mills kinetic terms as well as topological Chern-Simons mass terms. There is in addition a triplet of matter vectors. After diagonalization, these fields describe two triplets of topologically-massive vector fields of opposite helicities. The model also contains six scalars, described by a GL(3, R)/SO(3) sigma model. It provides the first example of a three-dimensional gauged supergravity that can be obtained by a consistent reduction of string theory or M-theory and that admits AdS 3 as a vacuum solution. There are unusual features in the reduction from six-dimensional supergravity, owing to the self-duality condition on the 3-form field. The structure of the full equations of motion in N = (1, 0) supergravity in D = 6 is also elucidated, and the role of the self-dual field strength as be computed in an effective Lagrangian description. In the infinite top-mass limit, an amplitude with a Higgs boson and n gluons is computed by the form factor of the operator TrF^{2}. Up to two loops and for three gluons, its maximally transcendental part is captured entirely by the form factor of the protected stress tensor multiplet operator T_{2} in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The next order correction involves the calculation of the form factor of the higher-dimensional, trilinear operator TrF^{3}. We present explicit results at two loops for three gluons, including the subleading transcendental terms derived from a particular descendant of the Konishi operator that contains TrF^{3}. These are expressed in terms of a few universal building blocks already identified in earlier calculations. We show that the maximally transcendental part of this quantity, computed in nonsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, is identical to the form factor of another protected operator, T_{3}, in the maximally supersymmetric theory. Our results suggest that the maximally transcendental part of Higgs amplitudes in QCD theory. M. 1980-09-01 We investigate of solutions of the classical SU(2) Yang-Mills equations.

Besides presenting an alluring performance, reog is also full of tradition and customs inherited from old generation such as erotic dance, liquor party, and homosexual relationship. Those traditions are identically associated to reog as a form of free, spontaneous and rules free entertainment for common people, therefore, the customary tradition often cause controversy to emerge among people because of their contradiction toward present customs of ethics and politeness. On the other hand, the tradition contain lofty cultural principles which reflect the true identity of Ponorogo people. Unless the principles are properly preserved, the statement which says that reog is the true identity and distinctive feature of Ponorogo will fade away, and thus reog will be easily taken and claimed by other societies. Documentary movie as audio visual media is able to plainly eplain how reog dancers truly live. By using interview method and daily life document documentary, the controversy in the traditions could be dug transparently. Various opinions toward the erotic dance, liquor party, and homosexual relationship become a strength to trace the history of reog in Ponorogo. Hence, Indonesian people will not be hesitant that reog is an original culture owned by the Indonesians themselves since the time of their ancestors. However, reog is still an entertainment for common people, pleasure is the main purpose of it. Strong limitation toward the expression of art will eventually extinguish the people's enthusiasm in the art itself.

This study was aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory activity of YGJ and to explore its potential anti-inflammatory mechanisms by serum metabonomics approach. An xylene-induced mouse right-ear-edema model was used as an inflammatory response in vivo model. Ear edema, prostaglandin E2 (PGE (TNF-) were detected. Then, serum metabolic profiling was analyzed and pathway analysis performed on the biomarkers reversed after YGJ administration and further integration of metabolic networks. The results showed that YGJ alleviated ear edema and decreased serum PGE 2 and TNF- levels. Fourteen biomarkers were screened, and the levels were all reversed to different degrees after YGJ administration. These biomarkers were mainly related to linoleic acid metabolism, taurine and metabolism, glyoxylate glycine, serine threonine and cycle (TCA cycle). In metabolic networks, glycine and pyruvate were node molecules. This indicated that YGJ could significantly inhibit inflammatory response triggered by acute local stimulation and exerted anti-inflammatory activity mainly by regulating node molecules.

All rights Yang-Mills theory on a lattice, the supersymmetric Ward identities are valuable for finding the critical value of the hopping parameter and for examining the size of supersymmetry breaking by the lattice discretisation. In this article we present an improved method for the numerical analysis of supersymmetric Ward identities, which takes into account the correlations between the various observables involved. We present the first complete analysis of supersymmetric Ward identities in N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU(3). The results indicate that lattice artefacts scale to zero as O(a^2) towards the continuum limit in agreement with theoretical expectations.

The review is done in 10 published studies (8 are 2002\u20142010 publications and 2 are 1993\u20141994 publications indexed in Pubmed with the above objective. Low utilization of antenatal care/ANC services is found to be associated with low compliance as it prevents the women to receive recommended number of the iron tablets as well as decrease the opportunity of women to have encouragement from health staff to take the tablets. Supply of tablets becomes the issue since not all women receiving 30 tablets/ANC visits as recommended. Studies on influence of side-effects of taking the tablets to compliance show inconclusive findings. Some studies found the effect is very minimal, and can be managed appropriately especially among more educated women and among women with adequate counseling. Studies also indicated that support from family is important to reduce possibility of pregnant women forgot to take the tablets, the other major factor of the low compliance. Quality of counseling, e.g. clarity of the messages, is associated with compliance. In conclusion, improving support from ANC provider (such as sufficient tablet supply, clear message on the tablets benefits and support from family may contribute to better compliance of women towards maternal iron supplementation.Keywords: compliance, iron array load implosion on Yang accelerator](https://inis.iaea.orgsearchsinglerecord.aspx?recordsFor=SingleRecord&RN=45093377) [International Nuclear Information System Ganghua 2012-01-01 Based on the ZORK model describing the Saturn facility, a zero dimensional load model of the wire array Z-pinch on Yang accelerator is designed using Pspice to simulate the implosion process.

The exchange rate system choice is based on some economic advantages that will be obtained from it, considering some economic disadvantages that might be occurred. The valuation toward the advantages and disadvantages of the exchange rate system implementation exactly depends on the national economy it self, because such economy will give some responses in different ways. In a small-opened economy, the effect that occurred in its national economy by the implementation of the floating exchange rate system will be different with the one which is received by a developed country. The exposition about the phenomenon that is happened in the small-opened economy country will become more clearly explainable by Mundell - Fleming - model which is specially developed for those purposes-, and also by some basic theories related with the topic. By using the perfectly capital mobility asumption, Mundell - Fleming model is able to explain the effect of the economic policies implementation, specially fiscal policy and monetary policy, in a small economy country that has already applied the free floating exchange rate system will be different with other countries. Fiscal policy that has been implemented in the country will not significantly alter its national income, but it will cause an alteration in its exchange rate. However, monetary policy implemented in the same countries, will cause changes in its national income as a result of its exchange rate alteration.

In this research, hedging is the moderating variable between independent variable and dependent variable. The independent variables included profit, firm size, leverage, growth, dividend and liquidity while the dependent variable included firm value. The method used was the ordinary least Square. The samples were taken from 2 telecommunication companies, and the data observed included the quarterly financial data from 2006 to 2015. The findings showed that derivative transactions used as hedge by the companies included cross currency swap, forward and option. Furthermore, the use of hedging foreign exchange was not seen to affect the firm value for the telecommunication company. This is because the 5 moderating variables did not significantly affect the firm value and only 1 moderating variable had a significantly negative effect on the firm value.

In contrast to the unmodified theory, large N volume independence is valid in the deformed theory down to arbitrarily small volumes. The double trace deformation prevents the spontaneous breaking of center symmetry which would otherwise disrupt large N volume independence in small volumes. For small values of N, if the theory is formulated on R 3 x S 1 with a sufficiently small compactification size L, then an analytic treatment of the non-perturbative dynamics of the deformed theory is possible. In this regime, we show that the deformed Yang-Mills theory has a mass gap and exhibits linear confinement. Increasing the circumference L or number of colors N decreases the separation of scales on which the analytic treatment relies. However, there are no order parameters which distinguish the small and large radius regimes. Consequently, for small N the deformed theory provides a novel example of a locally four-dimensional pure gauge theory in which one has analytic control over confinement, while for large N it provides a simple fully reduced model for Yang-Mills theory.

As is known quantum non-dynamical R-matrices of Baxter-Belavin type satisfy this equation. Together with unitarity condition and skew-symmetry it provides the quantum Yang-Baxter equation and a set of identities useful for different applications in integrable systems. The dynamical R-matrices satisfy the Gervais-Neveu-Felder (or dynamical Yang-Baxter) equation. Relation between the dynamical and non-dynamical cases is described by the IRF (interaction-round-a-face)-Vertex transformation. An alternative approach to quantum (semi-)dynamical R-matrices and related quantum algebras was suggested by Arutyunov, Chekhov, and Frolov (ACF) in their study of the quantum Ruijsenaars-Schneider model. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we prove that the ACF elliptic R-matrix satisfies the associative Yang-Baxter equation with shifted spectral parameters. Second, we directly prove a simple relation of the IRF-Vertex type between the Baxter-Belavin and the ACF elliptic R-matrices predicted previously by Avan and Rollet. It provides the higher order R-matrix identities and an explanation of the obtained equations through those for non-dynamical R-matrices. As a by-product we also get an interpretation of the intertwining transformation as matrix extension of scalar theta function likewise R-matrix is interpreted as matrix extension of the Kronecker function.

This strain contains the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene fused to the regulatory region of the medaka vasa gene, and germ cell-specific expression of GFP can be visualized in living (transparent) individuals. From 0 days post-hatch (0 dph) onwards, juveniles were exposed to graded concentrations of EE 2 (25.2-1710 ng/L) for 35 days. The gonads of live specimens were monitored by measuring their size and calculating their GFP-fluorescence area. GFP-fluorescent area in control females was about 10 times that in control males at 10 days posthatch (dph) whereas the gonadal size of 10 dph males that had been exposed to 158 ng/L of EE 2 significantly increased up to twice the size of control males, indicating that abnormal sexual differentiation towards female might occur in these individuals. Histological examination and identification of the sex-linked marker SL1 indicated that male to female sex reversal occurred at EE 2 exposure 45.1 ng/L at 35 dph. These results suggest that observation of proliferative activity of germ cells in the olvas-GFP/STII-YI strain could be applied to facilitated screening fish model to detect adverse effects on sexual differentiation as early as 10 dph juveniles.

In the Yang-Mills-Higgs theory, our solution shows that when the parameter 0, the monopole is carried by the gauge field and there is a string singularity in the gauge field. When the parameter 0, the monopole is transferred from the gauge field to the Higgs field and the string singularity disappeared.

It is known, that the pure Yang-Mills equations cannot have nontrivial regular solutions which vanish rapidly at space infinity (socalled finite energy solutions). So, if regular solutions exist, they must have non-trivial asymptotic properties. However, if the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions is non-trivial, then the fact must be explicitly taken into account in constructing the proper action (and energy) for the theory. The elucidation of the appropriate surface correction to the Yang-Mills action (and hence the energy-momentum tensor density) is one of the main motivations behind the present study. In this paper the author restricts to the asymptotic behaviour of the static solutions. It is shown that this asymptotic behaviour is such that surface corrections (at space-infinity) are needed in order to obtain a well-defined (classical) theory. This is of relevance in formulating a yang disampling.

Abstract Information System ](http://inis.iaea.org/search/) Bizon, The coupling of a dilaton to the SU(2)-Yang-Mills field leads to interesting non-perturbative static spherically symmetric solutions which are studied by mixed analytical and numerical methods. In the abelian sector of the theory there are finite-energy magnetic and electric monopole solutions which saturate the Bogomol'nyi bound. In the nonabelian sector there exist a countable family of globally regular solutions which are purely magnetic but have zero Yang-Mills magnetic charge. Their discrete spectrum of energies is bounded from above by the energy of the abelian magnetic monopole with unit magnetic charge. The stability analysis demonstrates that the solutions are saddle points of the energy functional with increasing number of unstable modes. The existence and instability of these solutions are 'explained' by the Morse-theory argument recently proposed by Sudarsky and Wald.

[Yang-Monti Principle in Bridging Long Ureteral Defects: Cases Report and A Systemic Review.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28670676) Bao, Jun Sheng; He, Qiqi; 2017-07-02 Ureteric substitution using the Yang-Monti principle was reported as a modification of simple ileal ureter replacement. During April 2013 to June in 2015, 2 patients underwent ileal ureteral substitution using a reconfigured ileal segment of Yang Monti principle in our clinical center. Some slight modifications were made and then follow-up were carried out up to 12 months. For these 2 cases, no significant intra/post-operative complications occurred. In 1 year follow up, serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of both patients decreased to normal.Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renogram and pyelogram showed a stable split renal function. To better understand the Yang-Monti principle and potential risks and complications, we conduct an systemic review by searching PubMed, Google Scholar and the Cochrane Library database from January 1996 through June 2016. 10 out of 644 publications were identified, which included 269 patients from cohort studies. The most usual indications for Yang-monti therapy were iatrogenic stricture and retroperitoneal fibrosis. Infection and ileus were indicated as themain short time postoperative complications while the fistula and re- strictures happened in long-term. In general,we believe Yang-Monti Principle is a safer and efficient technique for clinical partial and complete ureteral defects if patients and potential risks could be well prepared.

Oriflame is a cosmetic product that is affordable, easy to obtain and long-lasting nature. With the increasing number of cosmetic products on the market, it will provide flexibility for consumers to choose a brand in accordance with consumers wishes. Therefore, companies need to analyze consumer behavior for each cosmetic product in order to determine their purchasing patterns for many brands of cosmetic products in the market. This will encourage companies to compete for potential customers through a variety of appropriate strategies, such as changing the packaging color, aroma, promotions and prices. Further, for the manufacturer distributes its products to the consumer market so that the product is acceptable according to what the customer wants. The purpose of this study is to determine the factors affecting customers decision to buy Oriflame cosmetics. The approach used in this study is a quantitative research using multiple linear regression analysis. The number of samples taken is 100 with incidental sampling technique and using a Likert scale questionnaire method to obtain the data. The unit of analysis is all the user of Oriflame cosmetics. The results showed that product and place do not significantly influence the consumer's decision to buy Oriflame cosmetics. While the price and promotion variables influence the consumer's decision to buy Oriflame cosmetics significantly. Thus, the most important variables for the consumer's decision to buy Oriflame cosmetics are price and promotion.

No choice of H can be shown to lead to an analytic formulation of the theory. by introducing an analysis on dual planes the theory is reduced (including the reality constraint) to one involving N=2 symmetry. This approach has to be extended to include truly harmonic derivatives. For the typical case of SU(4)/SU(2)xU(1) prepotentials are introduced which solve the constraints. It has not been possible, however, to construct an action which leads to the equation of motion for the original N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (at the linearised 9 x 9 Matrix Representation Birman-Wenzl-Murakami Algebra and Berry Phase in Yang-Baxter Gangcheng a 9 x 9 S-matrix and E-matrix.

Based on the Chinese philosophy, Yin is the decreasing, negative, historical, or feminine principle in nature, while Yang is the increasing, positive, contemporary, or masculine principle in nature. Yin and Yang are two fundamental opposites in Chinese philosophy. The Henon map is an invertible map; so the Henon maps with increasing and decreasing argument can be called the Yang and Yin Henon maps, respectively. Chaos synchronization of Yin and Yang T-S fuzzy Henon maps is achieved by PDC controllers. The design of PDC controllers is based on the linear invertible matrix theory. The T-S fuzzy model of Yin and Yang Henon maps and the design of PDC controllers are novel, and the simulation results show that the approach is effective.

The approach is that of 'equivariant geometry': Attention is restricted to a special class of fields, those that satisfy a certain kind of rotational symmetry, for which it is proved that (1) a solution to the Yang-Mills equations exists among them; and (2) no solution to the self-duality equations exists among them. The first assertion is proved by an application of the direct method of the calculus of variations (existence and regularity of minimizers), and the second assertion by studying the symmetry properties of the linearized-self-duality equations.

The aim here is to present the ideas that the author reconstructed, based on the dialectics of harmonization, regarding harmony and conflict embodied in traditional Chinese thought, and to describe how a formal psychological theory/model on interpersonal harmony and conflict was developed based on the Yin-Yang perspective. The paper also details how essential theories on interpersonal harmony and conflict were constructed under this formal model by conducting a qualitative study involving in-depth interviews with 30 adults. Psychological research in Western society has, intriguingly, long been focused more on interpersonal conflict than on interpersonal harmony. By contrast, the author's work started from the viewpoint of a materialist conception of history and dialectics of harmonization in order to reinterpret traditional Chinese thought. Next, a \"dynamic model of interpersonal harmony and conflict\" was developed, as a formal psychological theory, based on the real-virtual notions in the Yin-Yang perspective. Under this model, interpersonal harmony and conflict can be classified into genuine versus superficial harmony and authentic versus virtual focus conflict, and implicit/hidden conflict is regarded as superficial harmony. Subsequently, the author conducted a series of quantitative studies on interpersonal harmony and conflict within parent-child, supervisor-subordinate, and friend-friend relationships in order to verify the construct validity and the predictive validity of the dynamic model of interpersonal harmony and conflict. The claim presented herein is that Chinese traditional thought and the psychological theory/model based on the Yin-Yang perspective can be combined. Accordingly, by combining qualitative and quantitative empirical research, the relative substantial theory can be developed and the concepts can be validated.

CF can be subdivided into different patterns. However, there are no diagnostic methods for CF. This study aimed to clinically validate a pattern identification method by identifying correlations between CF and responses to the qi blood yin yang deficiency questionnaire (QBYY-Q). Participants were recruited between May and June 2014 through the Kyung Hee University Korean Medicine hospital website and via posters and comprised 129 CF patients diagnosed with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (1994) criteria. Participants who had organic diseases that explained the CF were excluded. A total of 159 participants were asked to complete the QBYY-Q, the fatigue severity scale, and the Chalder fatigue scale. The latter two questionnaires were used to assess convergent validity with the QBYY-Q. Among the 129 CF participants, 70 and 59 had chronic fatigue syndrome and idiopathic chronic fatigue, respectively. Two Korean medical doctors independently assessed participants' qi, blood, yin, and yang deficiency patterns using QBYY deficiency pattern identification guidelines. Based on the results of a preliminary study of the QBYY-Q, we selected 32 reliable items for symptoms corresponding to each deficiency pattern. The items were used to estimate internal consistency and construct validity. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed for scores on each deficiency pattern. The data were means and standard deviations or numbers of participants and proportions for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. A statistical significance level of P yin, and yang deficiency were 45.1, 58.0, 52.2, and 63.4 %, respectively. Each QBYY-Q deficiency score was positively associated with each corresponding deficiency pattern. Qi deficiency was used as a reference category.

Besides methods based on a discretization of space-time (lattice gauge theory), also analytic methods are feasible, either in the Lagrangian or in the Hamiltonian formulation of the theory. This thesis focuses on the Hamiltonian approach to Yang-Mills theories in Coulomb gauge. The thesis is presented in cumulative form. After an introduction into the general formulation of Yang-Mills theories, the Hamilton operator in Coulomb gauge is derived. Chap. 1 deals with the heat-kernel expansion of the Faddeev-Popov determinant. In Chapters 2 and 3, the high-energy behaviour of the theory is investigated. To this purpose, perturbative methods are applied, and the results are compared with the ones stemming from functional methods in Coulomb and Landau gauge. Chap. 4 is devoted to the variational approach. Variational ansatzes going beyond the Gaussian form for the vacuum wave functional are considered and treated using Dyson-Schwinger techniques. Equations for the higher-order variational kernels are derived and their effects are estimated. Chap. 5 presents an application of the previously obtained propagators, namely the evaluation of the topological susceptibility, which is related to the mass of the meson. Finally, a short overview of the perturbative treatment of dynamical fermion fields is presented.

The Maxwell-Einstein supergravity amplitudes are obtained through the color/kinematics duality as a product of two gauge-theory factors; one originating from pure N=2 super-Yang-Mills theory and the other from the dimensional reduction of a bosonic higher-dimensional pure Yang-Mills theory. We identify a specific symplectic frame in four dimensions for which the on-shell fields and amplitudes from the double-copy construction can be identified with the ones obtained from the supergravity Lagrangian and Feynman-rule computations. The Yang-Mills/Einstein supergravity theories are obtained by gauging a compact subgroup of the isometry group of their Maxwell-Einstein counterparts. For the generic Jordan family this process is identified with the introduction of cubic scalar couplings on the bosonic gauge-theory side, which through the double copy are responsible for the non-abelian vector interactions in the supergravity theory. As a demonstration of the power of this structure, we present explicit computations at tree-level and one loop. The double-copy construction allows us to obtain compact expressions for the supergravity superamplitudes, which are naturally organized as polynomials in the gauge coupling constant.

With this motivation, we perform in this model explicit calculations of S-matrix elements between quark states, at tree level, one loop, and two loops, and discuss issues of renormalisability and unitarity. In particular, it is shown that the S-matrix element for quark scattering is renormalisable at one-loop order and is only logarithmically non-renormalisable at two loops. The discrepancies in the ultraviolet regime between the one-loop predictions of this model and those of massless QCD are discussed in detail. In addition, some of the similarities and differences between the massive Yang-Mills model and theories with a Higgs mechanism are analysed at the level of the S-matrix.

(Contribution to G\\\\\"ursey Memorial Conference and Symmetries) ](http://inis.iaea.org/search/) Schleifenbaum, Wolfgang 2008-01-01 The subject of this thesis is the theory of strong interactions of quarks and gluons, with particular emphasis on nonperturbative aspects of the gluon sector. Continuum methods are used to investigate in particular the confinement phenomenon. Confinement which states that the elementary quarks and gluons cannot be detected as free particles requires an understanding of large-scale correlations. In perturbation theory, only short-range correlations can be reliably described. A nonperturbative approach is given by the set of integral Dyson Schwinger equations involving all Green functions of the theory. A solution for the gluon propagator is obtained in the infrared and ultraviolet asymptotic limits. In chapter 1, redundant degrees of freedom of the Yang Mills gauge theory are removed by fixing the Weyl and Coulomb gauge prior to quantization. The constrained quantization in the Dirac bracket formalism is then performed explicitly to produce the quantized Yang Mills Hamiltonian. The asymptotic infrared limits of Coulomb gauge correlation functions are studied analytically in chapter 2 in the framework of the Gribov Zwanziger confinement scenario. The Coulomb potential between heavy quarks as part of the Yang Mills Hamiltonian is calculated in this limit. A connection between the infrared limits of Coulomb and Landau gauge is established. The Hamiltonian derived paves the way in chapter 3 for finding the Coulomb gauge vacuum wave functional by means of the variational principle. Numerical solutions for the propagators in this vacuum state are discussed and seen to reproduce the anticipated infrared limit. The discussion is extended to the vertex functions. The effect of the approximations on the results is examined. Chapter 4 is mainly devoted to the ultraviolet behavior of the propagators. The discussion is issued in both Coulomb and Landau gauge. A nonperturbative running coupling is defined and calculated.

The present study was to investigate the potential protective effect of QiShenYiQi Pills (QSYQ, a compound Chinese medicine, against cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity in mice. Pretreatment with QSYQ significantly attenuated the cisplatin induced increase in plasma urea and creatinine, along with the histological damage, such as tubular necrosis, protein cast, and desquamation of epithelial cells, improved the renal microcirculation disturbance as indicated by renal blood flow, microvascular flow velocity, and the number of adherent leukocytes. Additionally, QSYQ prevented mitochondrial dysfunction by preventing the cisplatin induced downregulation of mitochondrial complex activity and the expression of NDUFA10, ATP5D, and Meanwhile, cleaved-caspase3 pretreatment. summary, the pretreatment with QSYQ remarkably ameliorated the cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity in mice, possibly via the regulation of mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and apoptosis.

Abstract __________________________________________________________________________________________ The research analyzed a dynamic model of Totally Asymmetric Exclusion Process (TASEP, especially in two dimensions (2D and also the boundary and rules dynamic conditions used in this modeling. TASEP has been applied in various fields, one of them is the modeling of vehicle traffic. Two-dimensional system that will be studied is the discrete system of two-dimensional lattice system. The system is modified into the form of unidirectional T-junction . Furthermore, the vehicles that pass the junction are modeled as particles that jump from one lattice to another lattice. The value of the density and current density of particles in the system is determined numerically. The continuity equation to describe the dynamics of particles in TASEP is solved by using Euler's method. The profiles of [Connection between Einstein equations, nonlinear sigma models, (INIS) ](http://inis.iaea.org/search/) Sanchez, N.; Whiting, B. 1986-01-01 The authors analyze the connection between nonlinear sigma models self-dual Yang-Mills theory, and general relativity (self-dual and non-self-dual, with and without killing vectors), both at the level of the equations and at the level of the different type of solutions (solitons and calorons) of these theories. They give a manifestly gauge invariant formulation of the self-dual gravitational field analogous to that given by Yang for the self-dual Yang-Mills field. This formulation connects in a direct and explicit way the self-dual Yang-Mills and the general relativity equations. They give the ''R gauge'' parametrization of the self-dual gravitational field (which corresponds to modified Yang's-type and Ernst equations) and analyze the correspondence between their different types of solutions. No assumption about the existence of symmetries in the space-time is needed. For the general case (non-self-dual), they show that the Einstein equations contain an O nonlinear sigma model. This connection with the sigma model holds irrespective of the presence of symmetries in the space-time. They found a new class of solutions of Einstein equations depending on holomorphic and antiholomorphic functions and we relate some subclasses of these solutions to solutions of simpler nonlinear field equations that are well known in other branches of physics, like sigma models, SineGordon, and Liouville equations. They include gravitational plane wave solutions. They analyze the response of different accelerated quantum detector models, compare them to the case when the detectors are linterial in an ordinary Planckian gas at a given temperature, and discuss the anisotropy of the detected response and the Yang-Mills Gauge Field](http://www.ptep-online.com/index_files/2008/PP-12-06.PDF) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70) Suhendro I. 2008-01-01 Full Text Available In this work, we attempt at constructing a comprehensive four-dimensional unified field theory of gravity, electromagnetism, and the non-Abelian Yang-Mills gauge field in which the gravitational, electromagnetic, and material spin fields are unified as intrinsic geometric objects of the space-time manifold S4 via the connection, with the general- ized non-Abelian Yang-Mills gauge field appearing in particular as a sub-field of the geometrized electromagnetic interaction.
