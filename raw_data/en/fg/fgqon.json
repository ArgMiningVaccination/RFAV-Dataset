The Chaplain Residency is bringing Anna Langholz, an emerging faith leader to our region. Anna will serve halftime on the Carroll University campus and halftime at with Crossroads Presbyterian Church. This partnership is made possible through the generosity of Carroll donors and the support of the Presbytery of Milwaukee. Rev. Anna Langholz serves as the chaplain resident at Carroll University. Anna studied Psychology at Hope College in Holland, Michigan before getting an M.Div from Princeton Theological Seminary and being ordained as a Minister of Word and Sacrament with the Reformed Church in America. Some of her passions in college ministry include walking with students through seasons of deep vocational discernment and identity formation. When she isn't at Carroll, Anna is also serving Crossroads Presbyterian Church in Mequon. She loves learning from students about the latest tik tok trends and dreaming about which national park to visit next! A Vision of Partnership for the Gospel Partnered in Leadership. The heart of the Chaplain Residency Partnership is the initiative to bring a recent seminary graduate to the Presbytery of Milwaukee who will engage in creative, committed pastoral leadership in two vital ministry settings: a local congregation and Carroll University. The resident will be employed half-time by the congregation and half-time by Carroll. They will receive supervision and mentorship from season clergy members of the Presbytery and opportunities for continuing education through Carroll. They will nurture opportunities for collaboration and innovation in both ministry settings, serving alongside each community with energy, intelligence, imagination, and love. Carroll University: A Legacy of Partnership with the Presbyterian Church As the first four-year institution of higher education in the State of Wisconsin, Carroll University roots our mission in our Presbyterian and liberal arts heritage. Since 1850 Carroll has been affiliated with the Presbyterian Church, a relationship reaffirmed in our 2010 Covenant with the Synod of Lakes and Prairies. The University has had a long history of serving and being served by the church, and Carroll's mission and core values reflect the educational excellence, purposeful living, and Reformed spirit expressed throughout Presbyterian culture. Carroll University's Strategic Plan, Pioneer Driven, charts an ambitious and dynamic course forward, one characterized by innovation and entrepreneurship and fueled by the dedication and drive of today's Pioneers. As part of Pioneer Driven, the Chaplain Residency Partnership will celebrate our Presbyterian heritage and enhance our core mission: to provide a superior education, rooted in its Presbyterian and liberal arts heritage, and draws upon its Christian tradition to prepare all students for vocational success, lifelong learning and service in a diverse and global society.
