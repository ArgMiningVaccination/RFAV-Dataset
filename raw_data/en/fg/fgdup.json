Unconscious patterns like bullying, judgment, and anger become conscious as our awareness grows. As the saying goes, \"hurt people hurt people.\" When awareness grows, and we become conscious of our emotions, we are more able to transcend behaviors that cause us (or others) to be hurt. Another word for awareness is presence. Stormy clouds, aka \"heavy emotions,\" come and go, and becoming more aware or present will help the storms pass without allowing children to label themselves as the manifested emotion (e.g. \"I am an angry person\"). As kids are learning how to function in this world, the best gift we can give them is the space to be, especially when they are feeling anger, grief, or rejection. When we can be completely present with them, it helps children see that there isn't anything wrong with having an emotion. When we don't react personally to their storm, they will learn that they can remain aware of the emotion on a feeling level. Asking them questions like, \"Where is the feeling?\" and \"What does it feel like?\" will help prevent the child's mind to judge the emotion or turn into anxious thinking. It's the emotion that feels scariest to the child and to us. Our awareness can help us see that there is nothing to be afraid of and nothing wrong with us for experiencing these feelings. The feelings are not ultimately us; they are clouds that are simply passing through. As kids learn to be present with their stormy clouds, they are given the space to allow self-compassion to shine through. Realizing that they are okay during and after a major emotional storm. The next time a stormy cloud shows up for your child, help them cultivate their awareness by following the steps below: How to release a stormy cloud: Close your eyes. Breathe in and breathe out. Bring your attention to your body. Where is the stormy cloud? In your belly? Throat? Head? Legs? Place a pillow or stuffed animal on the spot where you feel the heavy cloud. What does the stormy cloud feel like? Mad? Sad? Hurt? Focus your awareness on the pillow or stuffed animal and keep breathing. Keep going until the stormy cloud has floated away! After the stormy cloud has passed: What did the stormy cloud feel like? What happened when it went away? Do you think it might come back? Draw a picture of the stormy cloud.Nishi Singhal is the director of the Lively Community Foundation, working to improve the mental and emotional well-being of communities. She enjoys writing the Heart & Mind books to spread the message of mindfulness to kids. She can be found at joyparade.co. The Crazy Wisdom Weekly, April 14, 20238 Sound Bites with Artist Evan Haywood By Cashmere Morley Evan Haywood is a musician and visual artist from Ann Arbor, Michigan. His first two albums as a singer/songwriter, Ramshackles and Perfumed Gardens, were released in 2016 and 2018, respectively. His third solo album, Elderberry Wine , was released on all digital streaming platforms on March 31. Evan is the founder of the independent record label Black Ram Sound and is involved in numerous collaborative projects. He runs a studio in Ann Arbor called the Black Ram Treehouse, where he records and produces music for himself and many other artists. 1. What does music mean to you? Music means so much to me! It is a language, a way of life, and a method of exploring subconscious layers of reality to express cultural knowledge and reflect upon our personal experiences. Most of all, I feel that music is a dimension of communication where people from diverse backgrounds can come together and learn to better understand each other. Music transcends all barriers and allows us to speak from the heart. 2. How did you become an artist? I've always been obsessed with music -- first I sang in the Boychoir of Ann Arbor and did some opera, then I was in a couple of punk bands in my early teens, before spending 15 years performing with the hip-hop collective Tree City. I started writing songs on the guitar when I was about 14 -- and I've been at it for 20 years now! Working at Encore Records for over a decade was also a great education for me on the range and depth of music history. That experience turned me on to a lot of the records that have greatly inspired me as a songwriter. 3. What are some other artists or bands who have influenced your sound? Os Mutantes, The Stooges, NaS, Madlib, Can, Lee \"Scratch\" Perry, Kevin Ayers, MF DOOM, Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, Amy Winehouse, J Dilla, Mobb Deep, Alice Coltrane, Caetano Veloso, Gal Costa, Kraftwerk, De La Soul, White Stripes, Kool Keith, Bobby Womack, Jim Ford, Kendrick Lamar, Funkadelic, The Misfits, Wu-Tang Click to connect with Evan Haywood. \"I think my favorite part of being a musician is when my mind clicks into a space where I am no longer creating from a place of self- consciousness.\"The Crazy Wisdom Weekly, April 14, 20239 Now playing \" Elderberry Wine \" by Evan Haywood.Clan, Skip Spence, and Son House are a few influences that come to mind. I'm into storytellers who can weave rich details into their words and sounds. I want to be transported into another world when I listen to music. 4. What artist(s) do you have on repeat right now? The Ramones! 5. What's the most rewarding part about being a musical artist? I think my favorite part of being a musician is when my mind clicks into a space where I am no longer creating from a place of self-consciousness. I become an empty vessel for the universal consciousness, and the words and ideas begin flowing through me, rather than from me. This is a state of pure joy and bliss, especially when other musicians are involved in the conversation taking place. Sometimes, it feels so good that we all just start laughing! It is a beautiful experience to relinquish control, and it's from this place of emptiness that I have created most of my best works. 6. What is something about your music that someone may not know? I don't think most people know that I play many of the instruments on my records. On the new one, Elderberry Wine -- you can hear me on vocals, guitar, bass, drums, percussion, piano, and synth. 7. If you could take only three records to a deserted island, what would they be? Congos -- Heart of the Congos Sly and the Family Stone -- There's A Riot Goin' On Pharoah Sanders -- Karma 8. Where are you performing next? Right now, I'm focusing on releasing music I've already completed and building my label, Black Ram Sound. I've been on a hiatus from performing for a few years now, but I'll be back around when the time is right. 9. Where are some of your go-to places to catch a show around Ypsi/Ann Arbor that other people may not know about? I really enjoy watching DJ's and producers spin at Lo-Fi in Ann Arbor, and Ziggy's in Ypsi is a great place to see all kinds of music. Blue LLama has a wonderful atmosphere to catch some live jazz, and the food is excellent. The Blind Pig will always hold a special place in my heart. My favorite venue in Ann Arbor used to be Arbor Vitae, but it was shut down a few years ago by a greedy real estate company. I'm really thankful for the spots that are still around, because I've seen so many venues come and go over the years.The Crazy Wisdom Weekly, April 14, 202310 Writers Wanted Fun ways to be visible and connected in the community.

What are some of the challenges that come with lowering one's ecological footprint? The Strawbale Studio is zoned \"agricultural outbuilding\" and is not used as a \"dwelling\". I try to lower my eco- footprint in other ways, in the current house I live in on the land, (the house is oriented toward the sun and has in-radiant heating. I also do experiments on the land; bio-char, wood to soil amendment, sheet mulching with cardboard, leaves and local horse manure, mushroom growing on inoculated logs and woodchips, compost furnace experiment... which worked part way.... harvesting down trees and splitting for use in the wood stove, rocket stove and earth oven, saving eggshells for a future \"lime plaster\" experiment. Lots of exploring of local materials to useful forms.... raw wool to felted material, fibers to cording, sticks to lashed projects and \"wattle & duab\", local wood for utensil and spoon carving, local soil to earth plasters and sculptures, drying and tincturing local plants, tapping the maple trees for syrup, and more. 2. What is one of the most personally rewarding outcomes you've experienced coordinating this program? I love the interaction with others who are excited about these natural things! \"Co-creation\"! Also the creativity that comes out from our combined visions, and the experimenting an exploration possible with these natural materials. 3. What would you tell someone who may be hesitant to try your program? Well for one thing, it's fun! You will connect with nature, unleash your creativity, and meet other folks in this safe, nurturing setting. 4. What are some ways people can start to lower their own ecological footprint in their own homes/lives? I\"m particularly interested in reducing waste, especially plastic, and value buying in bulk, and supporting effective recyling programs regionaly. \"Circular Economy\" is a concept for keeping technological materials in a closed-loop cycle of re-use. I am very The Crazy Wisdom Weekly, April 14, 202313Deanne Bednar entered the world of natural building by participating in a \"Start-to-Finish\" course with the Cob Cottage Company in 1996 after retiring from teaching art & sustainability at the middle school level. Returning to Michigan, Bednar became a collaborator in the Strawbale Studio Project. She now educates (and learns) as much as she can about natural building and sustainable living through workshops, internships, presentations, exhibits and outreach. Bednar had the privilege of illustrating the Hand-Sculpted House Book, The Natural Plaster Book , and The Cobber's Companion , and being a start-to-finish collaborator on the Kensington Kids Cottage, located within the Kensington Metropark, at the Farm Center. Especially life-changing were Bednar's adventures during 1979 & 1980 when she recieved a Masters Degree in Social Ecology from Goddard College in Vermont. motivated to see how I can contribute to effective reduction in material use, and recylcing that works. What places are doing this? How can I be a part of that? Where can I bring my containers and buy in bulk? I take bags to the grocery instead of getting new bags... there are many details I could share around this! Composting for instance, and more. 5. Tell me a little more about the outreach and volunteer programs you participate in. At Strawbale Studio there are two types of month-long programs: the Woofing/Worktrade with a Sustainable Skills Program and an internship where folks pay to learn, hands-on about natural building and related skills. Folks receive room and board in both programs. Details are at strawbalestudio.org. There are also a variety of four hour to one week offerings in a variety of skills: strawbale construction, earth oven, wood carving, foraging, earth sculpting, mushroom inoculation and more. Several times a year I go offsite to do projects. Typically, a presentation/ hands-on experience at Detroit Bioneers, The local Earth Day Festival, The Jewish Food Fest, The Great Lakes Herb Faire and the Great Lakes Foragers Gathers, to name a few. Occasionally, there are offsite projects such as an Earth Oven Build Workshop in Detroit in 2023, Natural Wall system at the Wellfield Botanical Gardens, Thatching at Kinstone, helping at a Strawbale installation in the Ann Arbor area, and others over the years.
