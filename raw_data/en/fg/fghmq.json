Page 4 of 200 Course Objectives The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture Certified Poultry Technician Course is designed to provide trained technicians for collection of samples from poultry fo r regulatory testing purposes. This testing may be required for various reasons, i ncluding testing to meet poultry health program requirements, interstate movement, or for show birds to gain entry into exhibitions. The importance of proper sample collectio n, handling, and submission of these samples cannot be stressed enough. In additi on, technicians will be trained to recognize symptoms of diseases in poultry, reporting protocols for suspected disease, and proper biosecurity practices to reduce the risk o f spreading disease. Certified Poultry Technicians (CPTs) are vital to the protect ion of avian health through identifying and reporting birds suspected to be infected with dangerous transmissible diseases and through proper sample collection and submission . The safety of technicians is paramount and can be promoted through learning pro per sampling techniques and biosecurity practices. At the completion of this course, the individual should have the knowledge and skills to: Recognize signs of avian disease . Report suspected dangerous transmissible diseases to the Department. Be familiar with precautions necessary to reduce the spread of disease. Develop and follow proper biosecurity and cleaning and disinfection protocols. Be familiar with proper personal p rotective equipment and personal safety. Be familiar with the Department's avian health programs, including testing requirements. Be familiar with the Department's requirements for testing for exhibition. Be competent with blood and swab sample collection, handling, and submission. If applicable, be competent performing and interpreting the Pullorum Rapid Whole Blood Agglutination Plate Test. Understand proper bird identification and record -keeping requirements (official leg bands). If sampling birds for en try into a MD, NY/NJ and PA TESTED LBM be competent in filling out PICs and understand the rules for entry into the LBMS. The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture may monitor any certified poultry technician's performance, including sample collection, h andling, and submission; and record -keeping.

Signs suggestive of AI or other DTDs may include the following: Increased mortality; Decreased egg production; Swollen eyelids/sinuses/combs or wattles; or bluish discoloration of wattles and combs; Respiratory snicking; and Generally depressed birds. Commonly, the producer will notice mortality increases if the flock is infected with HPAI , and in the case of layers, decreased egg production, which usually follows the increased mortality by several days. These are genera l guidelines only.

Samples can be tested at any PADLS laboratory. Call the laboratory in advance to let them know when the samples will arrive if you are submitting a large number of samples or have specific testing requirements . Samples can be hand carried to the laboratory (preferred method) or shipped by overnight mail or courier. Samples should be delivered to the laboratory between Monda y morning and Thursday noon. Samples should not be delivered on a day before a holiday or o n weekends. If shipping samples, send early in the week, preferably before Wednesday morning. Do not drop samples off at a PDA regional office for shipment unless yo u have made special arrangements with the regional staff. BIRDS TESTED FOR PULLORUM MUST B E LEG BANDED WITH AN OFFICIAL PDA BAND. OFFICIAL LEG BANDS ARE AVAILABLE FROM YOUR PDA REGIONAL OFFICE. EACH BLOOD SAMPLE TUBE MUST BE LABELED WITH THE BAND NUMBER O F THE BIRD FROM WHICH THE SAMPLE WAS COLLECTED OR A CORRESPONDING NUMBER SO THAT THE SAMPLE CAN BE TRACED BACK TO THAT BIRD. O RECORDS OF LEG BAND DISPOSITION MUST BE MAINTAINED FOR A MINIMUM OF TWO YEARS AND MUST BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE DEPARTMENT UPON REQUEST. O IF TESTING FLOCKS ON SITE USING THE RAPID PULLORUM TEST, ALL SUSPECTS (REACTORS) MUST BE BANDED AND EITHER BLOOD FROM THE REACTOR IS SENT TO THE LAB FOR FURTHER TESTING, OR THE BIRD IS SENT TO THE LAB FOR CULTURE. O ALL BIRDS TESTED FOR SHOW MUS T BE LEG BANDED WITH AN OFFICIAL PDA BAND, EVEN IF TESTED USING THE RAPID PULLORU M TEST. O ALL BIRDS ENTERING A SHOW MUST BE LEG BANDED WITH AN OFFICIAL PDA BAND (ENFORCED AFTER JUNE 1, 2017).

Do not take tubes or boxes onto more than one premises. Pennsylvania Certified Poultry Technicians are not authorized to collect official samples from poultry located outside of Pennsylvania without a reciprocal state agreement in p lace. Certified Poultry Technicians collecting samples for MD, NY/NJ and PA TESTED live bird market s must first take additional training and be added to the Department's list of CPTs approved to sample for the live bird market system. Page 25 of 200 Guidelines for Samples Samp le Collection - Blood Refer to the Ohio State University Extension Guidelines for additional information concerning Collection of Poultry Blood Samples. Please note that only the clear serum, obtained after the blood sample has clotted and has been separated at the lab oratory, is used for testing. The CPT must submit enough blood from each bird to provide enough serum for all testing. Large tubes: Large (5 ml) tubes should be used when more than one test will be performed on the samples so a greater quantity of blood c an be collected. Place the necessary number of empty tubes in the cardboard tube box and tilt the box approximately 30 degrees. Brace the b ox in this position while you collect samples to facilitate clot formation in the samples. If using large, open -top tubes for hand delivery to the laboratory, place a large piece of tape over the tops of the tubes in the box. Do not use open -top tubes with tape over the top for shipping - the labs can provide caps for the large tubes if requested for shipping. (If it is a hot day, keep samples cool on frozen cold packs immediately after collection). Collect 2.5 milliliters (cc) of blood per bird and place i t in a large (5 -ml) tube. Place the sample in the tube using only gentle, steady pressure on the syringe to avoid dam aging the blood cells. Complete the submission form and place it on top of the samples. If samples are to be tested for pullorum, label tub es to correspond to the offical band number of each bird sampled. Include the band number on the submission form. Place the box lid on tightly. Label the box (not the lid) with the owner name , and premise ID or flock address . Place the box into a plastic bag. Seal the bag. Disinfect the outside of the plastic bag. Keep the samples cool on frozen cold packs in a cooler du ring transport - do not use ice. Do not allow the blood samples to freeze. Plastic snap -cap tubes: If only one test will be performed on the samples, smaller plastic snap cap tubes are acceptable. If using plastic snap cap tubes, coll ect 2.0 cc of blood p er bird and place it in a tube. Fill the tube, but leave a small air space at the top so the lid does not pop open during transport. Place the sample in the tube using only gentle, steady pressure on the syringe to avoid damaging the b lood cells. Plastic s nap cap tubes with samples should be placed into a labeled whirlpak bag for submission to the laboratory. If you have sampled more than one bird type, place only one bird type per bag, and write the bird type on the corresponding bag ( chickens in one bag, turkeys or game birds in another). Seal the bag. Label the whirlpak bag with the owner name, and premise ID or flock address. Complete the submission form and place it in the bag pocket. Disinfect the outside of the whirlpak bag. Page 26 of 200 Guidelines for Samples Keep the samples cool on frozen cold packs in a cooler during transport - do not use ice. Do not allow the blood samples to freeze. The USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory does not recommend avian influenza AGID testing of blood from waterfowl - collect cloacal swabs from waterfowl for AI testing. Sample Submission - Hand Carried Blood Samples (Preferred Method) After collection: If you are using large tubes pla ce tape over the top of the tubes if you have not already done so. Place the completed submission form on top of the samples. Place the box lid on tightly. Label the box (not the lid) with the owner name, and premise ID or flock address. Place the box into a plastic bag. Seal the bag. Disinfect the outside of the plastic bag. If you are using p lastic snap cap tube s, the tubes with samples should be closed tightly and placed into a labeled whirlpak bag for submission to the laboratory. Seal the bag. Label the whirlpak bag with the owner name, and premise ID or flock address, as well as bird type if submitting sample s from more than one bird type. Complete the submission form and place it in the bag pocket. Disinfect the outside of the whirlpak bag. Keep the samples cool (see next bulleted item). Submit samples as soon as possible (preferably within 24 -48 hours). Keep the samples cool on frozen cold packs in a cooler during transport - do not use ice. Do not allow the blood samples to freeze. Deliver samples to the reception area of the laboratory. Samples must be delivered to the laboratory between Monday morning and Thursday noon. Samples should no t be delivered on a day before a holiday or on weekends. Page 27 of 200 Guidelines for Samples Sample Submission - Overnight Mail or Courier Delivery of Blood Samples After collection: If you are using large tubes, d o not use open -top tubes with tape over the top for shipping - the labs can provide caps for the large tubes if requested for shipping. Place the completed submission form on top of the samples. Place the box lid on tightly. Label the box (not the lid) with the owner name, and premise ID or flock address. Place the box into a plastic bag. Seal the bag. Disinfect the outside of the plastic bag. If you are using p lastic snap cap tubes , the tubes with samples should be closed tig htly and placed into a labeled whirlpak bag for submission to the laborato ry. Seal the bag. Label the whirlpak bag with the owner name , and premise ID or flock address , as well as bird type if submitting samples from more than one bird type. Complete the submission form and place it in the bag pocket. Disinfect the outside of th e whirlpak bag. Submit samples as soon as possible (preferably within 24 - 48 hours). Keep the samples cool on frozen cold packs in an approved, sealed Styrofoam container (placed inside of a sealed cardboard box) during transport - do not use ice. Do not allow the samples to freeze. Remember that samples can freeze in cold weather if held too long in a delivery truck. If shi pping samples, send early in the week, preferably before Wednesday morning. DO NOT use Priority Mail. Page 28 of 200 Guidelines for Samples Sample Collection - Swabs for AI testing Tracheal/oropharyngeal swabs (gallinaceous birds such as chickens, turkeys, and game birds): Swab testing may be used instead of blood testing to test gallinaceous birds for avian influenza. Swabs may not be used for pullorum testing of any ty pe of bird. Keep Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth tubes refrigerated at all times. Use tubes conta ining 5.5 mls BHI. Collect tracheal/oropharyngeal swabs for virus detection testing from bird s representative of the entire flock. Insert the dry swab and rub the mucosa vigorously. Use one swab for each bird. Avoid contaminating the swab through allowing contact with other surfaces. Place material from up to 11 swabs (from up to 11 different birds of one type) into one tube (gallinaceous birds only). Do not co mbine swab material from different bird types in a tube. Do not leave swabs in the tubes - insert each swab into the tube, swirl the tip in the BHI, press the tip against the inner surface of the tube to remove excess material into the tube, and then discar d the swab in a biosecure manner. Secure tube tops. Place tubes into a labeled whirlpak bag. If you have sampled more than one bird type, place only one bird type per bag, and write the bird type on the corresponding bag (chickens in one bag, turkeys or g ame birds in another). Seal the bag. Label the bag wi th owner name, and premise ID or flock address. Complete the submission form and place it in the bag pocket. Disinfect the outside of the whirlpak bag. Keep the samples cool on frozen cold packs in a coo ler during transport - do not use ice. If you cannot get the samples to the lab within 48 hours of collection, freeze the swab samples and keep frozen until delivered to the lab. It is recommended that you submit samples as soon as possible after collectio n (preferably within 24 -48 hours) to ensure sample integrity. If shipping samples, send early in the week, preferably before Wednesday morning. Please note: Viral transport medium (VTM) may replace BHI at the discretion of the PADLS laboratories. VTM shoul d be an orange color when fresh. It becomes a violet color as it becomes unsuitable for use. Do not use VTM that has changed color or that has passed its expiration date. VTM should be kept refrigerated at all times, so keep the tubes on frozen cold packs as you collect samples. Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) br oth may be provided instead of VTM for swab submissions. BHI should be clear. Do not use BHI that is cloudy or that has passed its expiration date. BHI should be kept refrigerated at all times, so keep t he tubes on frozen cold packs as you collect samples.

Swabs may not be used for pullorum testing of any type of bird. Keep Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth tubes refrigerated at all times. Collect cloacal swabs for virus detection testing from birds representative of the entire flock. Insert the dry swab and rub the mucosa vigorously. Use one swab for each bird. Avoid contam inating the swab by all owing it to contact other surfaces. Place swabs into tubes containing enough BHI to moisten and cover the end of the swabs. 5.5 ml BHI tubes may be used. Place up to 5 swabs (from up to 5 different birds of one type ) into one tube. Do not mix duck and goos e swabs in a tube. Break off the ends of the swab handles so the swabs fit into the tubes (only the tip with the sample is needed for testing). Secure tube tops. Place tubes into a labeled whirlpak bag. If you have sampled more than one bird type (such as ducks and geese), place only one bird type per bag, and write the bird type on the corresponding bag. Seal the bag. Label the bag with owner name, and premise ID or flock address. Complete the submission form and place it in the bag pocket. Disinfect the outside of the whirlpak bag. Keep the samples cool on frozen cold packs in a cooler during transport - do not use ice.

If you have sampled mor e than one bird type (such as ducks and geese), place only one bird type per bag, and write the bird type on the corresponding b ag (ducks in one bag, geese in another). Seal the bag. Complete the submission form and place it in the bag pocket. Disinfect th e outside of the whirlpak bag. Keep the samples cool on frozen cold packs in an approved, sealed Styrofoam container (placed inside of a sealed cardboard box) during transport - do not use ice. If you cannot get the samples to the lab within 48 hours of co llection, freeze the swab samples and keep frozen until delivered t o the lab. It is recommended that you submit samples as soon as possible after collection to ensure sample integrity. If shipping samples, send early in the week, preferably before Wednesda y morning. DO NOT use Priority Mail. Page 31 of 200 Guidelines for Samples GUIDELINES FOR SUBMISSION OF BIRDS TO THE LABORATORY Diagnosis of disease can be difficult if the history of the flock is unknown or the specimens for testing are not submitted properly. The following guidelines we re designed to assist in the submission o f birds to the laboratory: 1. Submission Form: It is vital that the general PADLS submission form be filled out accurately and completely, and that the information is printed clearly. Current contact information must be listed. If the form is not filled out properly, the proper testing may not be done, and/or the submitter may not receive the results. 2. History: Any health problems in the flock should be included on the submission form. A detailed description of any hea lth problems in the flock, including chan ges in production, symptoms of illness, and mortality, should be included with the submission. In addition, field necropsy findings, recent feed changes, vaccinations, treatments, litter changes, etc. should be incl uded to assist with the diagnosis. 3. Numbe r of Birds in the Submission: As a general guideline, the following numbers may be used: a. Growing and adult chickens and turkeys: 4 to 8 birds b. Baby chicks and poults: 8 to 10 birds 4. Which Birds to Submit: It is impo rtant to choose birds for submission which will be most likely to provide the proper diagnosis of the problem in the flock. Please contact the diagnostician at the receiving lab to discuss the problem for further guidance on bird selection. The following g uidelines apply: a. If the f lock has increased mortality, always include several fresh dead birds representative of the mortality of the day. b. If there are specific symptoms noted (respiratory signs such as snicking, foamy eyes, labored breathing; diarrhea or other changes s; neurologic signs; leg problems; generally to thrive; poor growth; weight loss; etc.), include live birds that are showing the specific symptom(s) of interest. c. Include bir ds in different stages of illness if available. Page 32 of 200 Blood Collection Page 33 of 200 Blood Collection VME -23-05\u2014page 2 Examples of sick birds that have ruffled feathers and appear \"depressed.\" Example of a hematoma. How Much Blood Can One Collect? The amount of blood that can be safely collected from a clinically healthy bird is 1% of its body weight, in grams. For examp le, the maximum amount of blood to take from a 500 g bird is 5 mL (5 cc) of blood. In addition, one should collect less blood from birds that are sick. PA CPT: If you can't collect the amount of blood required for testing, consider swabbing for AI testing . Where Are the Blood Collection Sites? The large vein under the wing (brachial vein) Place the bird on a table, setting it on its side. Lift up the wing with one hand and part the feathers along the wing. Water can be used to help keep the feathers separ ated. Place the needle at a slight angle, bevel up, against the vein on the underside of the wing. (The bevel is the side of the needle with the angle and the hole.) Insert the needle into the vein and slowly withdraw blood. Page 34 of 200 Blood Collection Separation of wing feathers , exposing the brachial vein (left). Vein puncture and the withdrawal of blood (right). Remove the needle and apply pressure to the vein for a few seconds. This will help to minimize the development of large hematomas, which can be common with poultry. Fi ll the appropriate vial 1/3 to 1/2 of its full volume. Allow the vacuum in the vial to empty the syringe, rather than pushing on the plunger, as this will prevent hemolysis (rupture of red blood cells). This volume is needed to ensure enough blood is colle cted to obtain an adequate sample. The vein on the side of the outstretched neck (jugular vein) Place the bird on a table, setting it on its side. Stretch out the neck with one hand and part the feathers along the neck. The right jugular vein is usually larger. Place the needle at a slight angle, bevel up, against the vein. Puncture the vein and slowly withdraw blood. Remove the needle and apply pressure to the vein for a few seconds. Fill the appropriate vial 1/3 to 1/2 of its full volume. Exposed jugul ar vein (left) and withdrawal of blood (right). Page 35 of 200 Blood Collection VME -23-05\u2014page 3 The vein on the inner leg, above the hock (medial metatarsal vein) Place the bird on a table, setting it on its side. Stretch out the leg with one hand and part the feathers along the hock joint. Place the needle at a slight angle, bevel up, against the vein. Puncture the vein and slowly withdraw blood. Remove the syringe and apply pressure to the vein for a few seconds. Fill the appropriate vial 1/3 to 1/2 of its full volume. Withdrawal o f blood from the medial metatarsal vein. What Should Be Done After the Blood Is Collected? For Pennsylvania CPTs, refer to the PA Guidelines for collection, handling, and submission of samples.

These standards apply to egg- and meat -type chickens, waterfowl, exhibition poultry, and game birds. Information con cerning the pen arrangement and number of birds per pen should be obtained from the owner so that the required number of samples per pen and per flock can be deter mined. A means of identifying each sample by pen of origin should be provided. The vehicle tr ansporting the personnel taking the samples should be left as far as practical from the poultry pens. Sanitary precautions, including personal cleanliness, should be observed during the sampling procedure. The hands should be carefully washed with a saniti zing soap prior to the sampling. Outer clothing, including gloves, should be changed between visits to different premises so that clean clothing is worn upon enter ing each premises. A minimum size of three inches by three inches should be used for the ster ile gauze pads. The used and clean apparel should be kept separate. Boots or footwear should be cleaned and disinfected between visits to different premises. Disp osable caps should be provided and discarded after use on each premises. After collection, th e samples should be protected from drying, light, and excessive temperatures and delivered to the laboratory within one day. If delivery is delayed, samples should be refrigerated. (1) Poultry House Environmental Samples. Fecal material, litter, dust, or floo r litter surface or nest box drag swab samples to be submitted for bacteriological examination shall be collected in accordance with the procedures described below : (i) Fecal material, litter or dust . With a clean gloved hand or sterile collection device, col lect fecal material, litter, or dust from several locations representing all areas of the pen or house into a sterile bag or container. A suggested number of sampl es is five samples from pens or houses with less than 500 birds; ten samples from pens or hou ses of 500 to 2,500 birds; and 15 samples from pens or houses with more than 2,500 birds. (ii) Drag swabs (DS). DS, which consist of gauze pads or commercially availab le sponges, enable the sampling of large areas of the pen or house. (A) Preparation. DS may be purchased commercially or be user prepared. One suggested method of making the DS assemblies is as follows: A sterile gauze pad is folded in half and a two -foot long (60cm) piece of twine is securely attached to the folded pad using a paper clip, staple, o r similar device. A second sterile gauze pad is similarly fastened to a five -foot (150 cm) long piece of twine. The shorter piece of twine is then tied to the longer piece producing a DS sample set of two swabs arranged in a Y -shaped configuration. Alterna tively, two separate DS samplers may be prepared. The twine is wrapped around the swabs, and the swabs moistened with double - strength skim milk (DSSM) (evaporated mi lk). The moistened swabs are placed in an instrument package. The sterilized swabs containe d in the instrument package may be frozen (to prevent drying) until use. Page 38 of 200 Environmental Swabbing for Salmonella (B) Procedure. At the farm the thawed DS assemblies are unraveled and the ends of t he twine he ld in gloved hands. The swabs are dragged across the environmental surfaces of the house for 15 minutes or the length of the house (down and back). One set of swabs (two individual pads) is dragged across the center of the house floor and anothe r set of sw abs (two individual pads) is dragged across the inside perimeter of the house floor. The four pads are individually placed in labeled, sterile bags. If necessary to prevent drying out, additional DSSM may be added to the bags. The bags should be protected from excessive heat and submitted as soon as possible to the authorized laboratory for testing. If the samples cannot be submitted to the laboratory the same day, they should be stored 2\u00b0 - 4 \u00b0C or placed in a cooler with frozen cold packs for no more than five days before culturing. (iii) Shoe cover swabs. Absorbable fabric shoe covers involve the exposure of the bottom surface of shoe covers to the surface of floor litter and slat areas. Wearing clean gloves, place the shoe covers over footwear that is only wor n inside the poultry house. This can be footwea r dedicated to the facility or disposable overshoes. Each pair of shoe covers should be worn while walking at a normal pace over a distance of 1,000 feet (305 meters). For flocks with fewer than 500 breeders, at least one pair of shoe covers should be worn to sample the floor of the bird area. For flocks with 500 or more breeders, at least two pairs of shoe covers should be worn to sample the floor of the bird area. After sampling, place each shoe cover in a st erile container with 30 ml of double strength s kim milk, unless pre - moistened swabs are used. Seal the sterile containers and promptly refrigerate them at 2\u00b0 to 4 \u00b0C or place in a cooler with frozen cold packs. Do not freeze. Samples should be stored at re frigerator temperatures of 2\u00b0 to 4 \u00b0C no more t han five days before culturing. (iv) Nest box or egg belt swabs as alternative sampling source . (A) Two sterile pre -moistened (ex. DSSM) gauze pads or sponges are swabbed along the inside of approximately 10 percent o f the nest boxes. Each swab or sponge is placed into a separate sterile bag and submitted to the authorized laboratory. (B) Two sterile pre -moistened (ex. DSSM) gauze pads or sponges are used to swab the egg belts. At least 30 feet of belt material is swabbed with each swab. Each swab is placed into a separate sterile bag and submitted to the authorized laboratory. (2) Cloacal Swabs. Cloacal swabs for bacteriological examination shall be taken from each bird in the flock or from a minimum of 500 birds in accordan ce with the procedure described this sect ion. A sterile cotton -tipped applicator or swab is inserted into the cloaca and rectum of the bird in such a manner to ensure the collection of fecal material. The applicator may be broken off into a sterile tube. T he cloacal swabs may be combined in multi ples of five or in combinations specified by the authorized laboratory. Note - if collecting cloacal swabs for salmonella testing, do not use tubes with BHI broth as is required for AI testing. Page 39 of 200 Environmental Swabbing for Salmonella (3) Hatchery Samples . Hatchery -related sampl es, such as chick box papers, meconium, and fluff, may be examined for the presence of Salmonella to indicate the transfer of Salmonella from parent to offspring. (i) Chick box papers (swabs). Chick box paper samples may be collected by an authorized agent according to paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section (see below) or may be submitted directly to an authorized laboratory for testing according to paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B) of this section (see below). It is important to remove the paper from the chick box before the box is placed in the brooding house. (A) Instructions for sampling chick box papers. One chick box paper is collected for every 10 boxes of chicks placed in a house. With sanitized and gloved hands lay out the papers on a clean, disi nfected surface. Saturate a sterile gauze pad or sponge with DSSM and swab the surface of five chick box papers. The pad should be rubbed over approximately 75 percent of each paper with sufficient pressure to remove any dried meconium. Addition of more DS SM may facilitate sampling. The process is repeated with a second swab and the other five chick box papers. Both swabs may be added to a single sterile, labeled plastic bag and submitted to the authorized laboratory. Promptly refrigerate the Whirl -Pak bags containing the samples and transport them, on frozen cold packs or otherwise refrigerated, to a laboratory to be cultured within five days of collection. (ii) Chick box papers. The Plan participant may send chick box papers directly to a laboratory, where sam ples may be collected as described in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section (see above). To send chick box papers directly to a laboratory: (A) Collect one chick box paper for each 10 boxes of chicks placed in a house and place the chick papers immediately i nto large plastic bags and label and seal the bags. (B) Place the plastic bags containing the chick box papers in a clean box and transport them within 48 hours to a laboratory. The plastic bags do not require refrigeration. (iii) Chick meconi um. After collection, the container of meconium is mixed to obtain a uniform consistency. In the laboratory a 25 -gram sample will be removed for bacteriological examination. (iv) Fluff. Fluff samples may be collected from the floor of the hatchery or from the tray following hatchi ng. The fluff sample may be collected by either swabbing the floor or tray with a pre -moistened gauze pad or sponge or by placing fluff material directly into a sterile bag.

PEQAP drag swab kit from Penn State Animal Diagnostic Laboratory o r New Bolton Center; kit contains: a) Whirl -Pak bags (18 -ounce size) b) Sterile gauze pads Manure Swabb ing: 1. Prior to swabbing, label the sample bags with flock name and collection date. 2. Suit up with protective clothing and disinfect boots and swabbing equipment before entering the house in accordance with standard biosecurity practices. 3. Bring all materials to the bottom floor of the house. Use the bottom utility area if the house has one. Bring a bucket filled with a disinfecting solution. 4. Spread out the large garbage bag and arrange the sampling materials on top of the bag. Label the bags. 5. Place on a pair o f disposable exam gloves. 6. Open the alcohol swab and wipe the top of the can of DSSM and the can opener. Wipe excess alcohol from the can and can op ener with a clean paper towel before opening the can to minimize contamination of the milk with alcohol. 7. Disinfect the scissors with the disinfecting solution in your bucket. Wipe excess disinfectant off the scissors with a clean paper towel. 8. Use disinfected scissors to cut open the autoclave pack of swabs near the top of the pack. 9. Shake the can of DSSM and moist en the swabs in the pack by pouring a small amount of DSSM into the pack and massaging the outside of the pack. Lay the pack on the garbag e bag. Be sure to clean and sanitize gloved hands after touching non -sterile items and before taking samples with ste rile swabs. Wipe excess disinfectant from gloved hands with a clean paper towel. Page 41 of 200 Environmental Swabbing for Salmonella 10. Tear the top off Whirl -Pak bags. 11. Tie two swabs to the strings per NPIP protocol. 12. Sample the manure per NPIP protocol. 13. Place the 2 swabs into separate Whirl -Pak bags witho ut touching the swabs (one swab per bag). Cut attaching strings with the scissors and disinfect the scissors in between each sample; wipe excess disinfectant from the scissors with a clean paper towel or pull the strings off per NPIP guidelines. Note - Adding too much DSSM can affect test results. 14. After the manure is dragged, place the Whirl -Pak bags (with samples) into the gallon - size bag, seal tightly, and place in the cooler with the frozen cold packs. 15. Put all discarded material into the garbage bag a nd dispose of properly. 16. Place the cooler outside the house; clean and disinfect it; then load it into your vehicle. 17. Follow standard biosecurity procedures when leaving. 18. Transport samples to a processing facility within 24 hours, if possible. In rare cases, when samples cannot be shipped to the laboratory within 48 hours, freeze the samples for future shipment at the earliest time. Delayed processing may alter test results and may result in additional testing requirements. Egg Belts and Nest boxes: Hand -swab the egg belts and nest boxes per NPIP protocol and handle as per manure swabbing guidelines.

This bacterial infect ion endures in the ovaries o f the laying female. The disease is transmitted from mother to chick through the incubated egg. If the egg hatches, the chick is already infected when it leaves the shell. Through the droppings other chicks become quickly infect ed, until the disease spread s through the brood. The one and only effective control measure for Pullorum disease is the elimination of infected breeders. This involves blood testing, so that Pullorum \"carriers\" may be detected and removed from the breeding flocks. Description: The s erum plate agglutination (SPA) test is used to detect specific antibodies that will bind to an antigen and cause visible \"clumping\" or agglutination. The antigen is prepared from cultures of Salmonella pullorum and a dye is adde d to improve visibility of the reactions. A prescribed amount of antigen is placed on a solid support, such as a glass plate or mirror, keeping each drop of antigen separate. An equal amount of test serum is placed next to the antigen and these are then mi xed together. After a short incubation, the mixture is examined for evidence of agglutination, which appears as discrete clumps of the stained particles with a clearer background. If no antibodies are detected, the mixture will remain opaque. This is a scr eening test o nly and additional testing must be performed on all reactors. Who can perform this test in PA ? Performance of this test is recommended only for CPTs performing a large amount of breeder flock testing since the antigen has an expiration date and the test is subjective . CPTs must demonstrate proficiency before being approved to perform the test (certified after 5/1/18). Equipment necessary for testing: Required Test Components: Pullorum Plate Antigen; positive and negative control sera; test samples (never frozen); a glass plate or mirror marked in squares of ~1 -1.5in (~25 -40mm); bleeding needle, blood loop (standardized), method of disinfecting, rinsing, and drying l oop and needle, and a device to hold birds individually while waiting for th e test results. Official leg bands , available from your PDA regional office. For NPIP birds: NPIP form 9 -2 (available from PDA (717-783-6897)). For birds not on NPIP, an equivalent PDA rapid plate test form is available for exhibition bird testing (availab le from PDA at 717 -783- 6897). Page 47 of 200 PT Rapid Plate Test Test Procedure: 1. The antigen must be used according to the directions of the antigen manufacturer . Allow all components (solid plate, antigen, control sera, and test sera) to warm to room temperature before use. Ensure the antigen has not passed the expiration date. 2. Shake the antigen well for 15 to 20 seconds. 3. It is advisable to test known posi tive and negative control sera before testing bird samples . Use separate pipettes for administering all controls and sa mples. 4. To conduct the testing of samples: a. A drop of antigen is placed on the testing plate. b. A loopful of blood is taken up fr om the wing vein after the vein has been lanced . When submerged in the blood and then carefully withdrawn, the loop bec omes properly filled. On looking down edgewise at the filled loop, one observes that the blood appears to bulge. c. The loopful of blood is stirred into the drop of antigen, and the mixture spread to a diameter of about 1 inch. d. The test plate is rocke d from side to side a few times to mix the antigen and blood thoroughly, and to facilitate agglutination. Be sure to keep each mixture within a single square. 5. Incubate at room temperature for 2 minutes. 6. The plate may be rotated by hand during in cubation. Gently rotate the plate for a few seconds. Let stand. After 1 minute, the plate may be rotated again and al lowed to stand. 7. The reaction is read at the end of the 2 -minute incubation period. A positive reaction shows formation of discrete clu mps of stained material, normally starting at the edge of the mixture. Negative reactions show little to no change in the opaque serum - antigen mixture . 8. The loop is rinsed in clean water and dried by touching it to a piece of clean blotting paper to av oid contamination of the next sample. 9. Send a completed NPIP 9 -2 form or PDA equivalent form (for non -NPIP flocks) to PDA to record flock testing in compliance with NPIP and PDA requirements. Reading the test: Positive reactions are indicated by a clum ping of the antigen in well - developed, blue -colored clusters surrounded by clear spaces, within 2 minutes. The greater the agglutination ability of the blood, the more rapid the clumping and the larger the clumps. A lesser reaction shows small, but clearl y visible clumps surrounded by spaces only parti ally clear. Reactions which occur after 2 minutes should not be considered positive. Negative reactions show little to no change in the opaque serum antigen mixture. Biological reactions may vary between cle ar-cut positive and negative. Precautions: Avoid exposing hands, eyes or clothing to the antigen. It is recommended that the test be conducted out of direct sunlight, where there is a minimum amount of dust. For product or technical information, please call Charles River Customer Service at 1 -860- 889-1389. FOR VETERINARY USE ONLY - CONTAINS FORMALDEHYDE AS A PRESERVATIVE. Page 48 of 200 PT Rapid Plate Test Packaging: Antigen is packaged in a glass vial with a separate dropper tip. The dropper is calibrated to deliver 0.04ml of antigen p er drop (one test). The antigen should be stored in the dark at 2 to 7\u00b0C (35 -45\u00b0F). DO NOT FREEZE. Follow all label directions for sto rage and handling. Things to avoid: Deteriorated antigen may give false readings. Before testing, check a drop of anti gen, without blood, on the plate to check for spontaneous agglutination. Do not use antigen which is past the expiration date. Excessive evaporation, high temperatures, or incorrectly interpreting late powder or marginal flocculation may also lead to fals e readings. Delay in reading tests causes errors; tests should not be read after 2 minutes. Testers should use care, not speed, for the number of birds tested is less important than maximum accuracy. Cleaning the testing surface: Clean plate with clear, warm or cool water. Hot water may coagulate blood, making it difficult to remove. Soaps, disinfectants, or cleaning compounds may leave a residue which may affect subsequent tests. Grease on plate may prevent blood antigen mixture from spreading properly, and grease may be removed with soap, after which plate must be thoroughly rinsed. After cleaning, polish plate with clean cloth, leaving no blood or lint on the surface. References: 1. NPIP Program Standard A (2019) 2.

Page 52 of 200 Biosecurity SECTION VI: BIOSECURITY Page 53 of 200 Biosecurity Biosecurity Guidelines for Collecting Samples Certain poultry diseases can be easily spread between flocks by people, clothes, vehicles, and equipment. The following are guidelines designed to reduce the risk of spreading disease between flocks. Overview: It is recommended that you visit only one prem ises per day. If you must visit more than one premises in a day, for each visit wear clean outerwear, including boots, and wash your vehicle between premises , especially if you drove through poultry or manure areas . NEVER visit a commercial poultry flock t he same day you have been in contact with another flock unless these commercial flocks are under the same management and th e management allows it. Before entering a poultry house or yard: Park as far away from the poultry house/yard as possible. Avoid par king on an area where litter has been spread. Put on clean cloth coveralls or new disposable coveralls. Put on rubber boots which have been cleaned and disinfected or disposable booties. Put on a disposable hair cap or hat which can be cleaned and disinfec ted. Put on disposable gloves (optional) or sanitize hands. Face shields, eyewear, disposable face masks, or respirators are optional. Take only essential equipment and supplies with you. Equipment must always be carefully cleaned and disinfected prior to use on a premises. Before leaving a poultry premises: Do not enter your vehicle until you have removed your dirty outerwear. Remove and bag all items worn on the premises before leaving the premises. Dispose of any disposable items in a plastic garbage ba g, and seal the bag. Place any non -disposable clothing, such as cloth coveralls and raincoats, etc, worn on t he premises in a clean garbage bag and wash the clothing in warm or hot water before wearing it again. Clean and disinfect rubber boots before remo val from the premises. Do not wear dirty boots in your vehicle. If you have parked near the poultry or manure areas, or there is known disease in the flock, scrub vehicle tires with a brush to remove organic material and spray the tires with disinfectant b efore leaving the premises, and wash your vehicle before enterin g another operation. Disinfect the outside of sample bags and other non -disposable equipment and supplies. Keep samples, dirty clothing, and used equipment in an area separate from clean items in your vehicle to avoid contamination. Wash or sanitize hands, including under fingernails. Biosecurity Guidelines for Collecting Samples Page 54 of 200 Biosecurity Plan Template Biosecurity Programs and Plans for Poultry Farms In the aftermath of the HPAI outbreak in 2014/2015, investigator s with USDA reported that although wild birds may have introducted AI initially, infection was spread from flock to flock predominately by people and equipment. USDA now requires that poultry farms affected by AI must have a biosecurity plan in place, and be following that plan, to be eligible for the maximum amount of indemnity and compensation. Commercial flocks meeting the minimum size requirement enrolled in the National Poultry Improvement Plan (NPIP) should have an effective biosecurity program and pl an in place. All NPIP participants in PA, regardless of flock size, must address biosecurity to have a successful NPIP inspection. An effective plan will be required for issuance of a permit for any flock to move product if a flock is located in a quaranti ned area. The National Poultry Improvement Plan (Program Standard E) outlines the major elements for an acceptable biosecurity plan (see below): 1. Biosecurity Coordinator: The Biosecurity is responsible for the development, implementation, maint enance and ongoing effectiveness of the biosecurity program. Depending on the type and size of poultry operation, the Biosecurity Coordinator's responsibility could be at the farm, production site, production complex, or company level. The Biosecurity Coor dinator should be knowledgeable in the principles of biosecurity. The Biosecurity Coordinator, along with the personnel and caretakers on the farms and production sites are responsible for the implementation of the biosecurity program. The Biosecurity Coor dinator should review the biosecurity program at least once during each calendar year and make revisions as necessary. The Biosecurity Coordinator should be identified and recorded on the plan . This means a name, signature, date and time that the coordinat or on the farm was made responsible for the farm plan. 2. Training: The biosecurity program should include training materials that cover both farm site - specific procedures as well as premises -wide and/or company - wide procedures as appropriate. All poultry o wners and caretakers that regularly enter the perimeter buffer area (PBA) must complete this training. The training should be done at least once per calendar year and documented in a training log. New poultry caretakers should be trained at hire. Training logs should be retained for 3 years (or as per 9CFR (NPIP Provisions)). 3. Lines of Separation on buildings w ith required sanitation (LOS): The Line of Separation (LOS) is a functional line separating the poultry house(s) and the poultry inside from exposure to potential disease sources. Generally, it is defined by the walls of the poultry building with practical deviations to account for entry points, structural aspects, or outside access areas. The site -specific biosecurity plan should describe or illustrat e the boundaries of the LOS and clearly outline the procedures to be followed when caretakers, visitors, or suppliers cross it. A LOS at the entrances can be marked by having a line at the doors where certain sanitation steps would Page 55 of 200 Biosecurity Plan Template be required -this could i nclude something as simple as putting on personal protective equipment (PPE) or washing and disinfecting boots before entering. Dedicated footwear for poultry areas is recommended. For po ultry enclosed in outdoor pens, similar principles for the LOS can b e applied for defining and controlling the LOS for each pen. In this circumstance, the walls of the outdoor pens would provide a template for defining the LOS to be used when entering or e xiting the pens. For poultry with non -enclosed outdoor access, the LOS is still recommended. In an emergency disease state where the transmissible disease risk is heightened, it may be required to enclose all poultry and enforce a LOS. 4. Perimeter Buffer Area (PBA): The perimeter buffer area is a functional zone surroundin g the poultry houses or poultry raising area that separates them from areas unrelated to poultry production on that site and/or adjoining properties. It is comprised of the poultry houses and poultry raising areas as well as nearby structures and high traf fic areas involved in the daily function of the poultry farm. This would usually include but not be limited to such things as feed bins, manure sheds, composting areas, egg rooms, generators, pump rooms, etc. The site - specific biosecurity plan should descr ibe or illustrate the boundaries of the PBA and clearly outline the procedures that caretakers, visitors, or suppliers must follow when entering and leaving the PBA. This would be setback distances from poultry buildings to help reduce fomite transmission by people or equipment. The PBA may also be called hot/cold zones. 5. Personnel: The biosecurity program and/or the site -specific biosecurity plan should include provisions specifica lly addressing procedures and biosecurity PPE for site - dedicated personnel. The plan should likewise address the procedures and biosecurity PPE for non -farm personnel. The plan should also specify procedures which all personnel having had recent contact w ith other poultry or avian species should follow before re -entering the PBA. 6. Wild Birds, Rodents, Insects, and other animals : Poultry operations should have control measures to prevent contact with and protect poultry from wild birds, their feces and thei r feathers as appropriate to the production system. These procedures should be reviewed further during periods of heightened risks of disease transmission. Control programs for rodents and insects should be in place and documented. Pets and livestock shoul d not be allowed in the poultry areas. 7. Equipment and Vehicles: The biosecur ity plan should include provisions for procedures for cleaning, disinfection, or restriction of sharing of equipment where applicable. Vehicle access and traffic patterns should be defined in the site -specific biosecurity plan. Page 56 of 200 Biosecurity Plan Template 8. Mortality Disposal: Mortal ity should be collected daily, stored and disposed of in a manner that does not attract wild birds, rodents, insects, and other animals and minimizes the potential for cross -contamination from other facilities or between premises. It is recommended that de ad bird disposal be on -site, if possible. Mortality disposal should be descr ibed in the site -specific biosecurity plan. 9. Manure and Litter Management: Manure and spent litter should be removed, stored and disposed of in a manner to prevent exposure of susc eptible poultry to disease agents. On -site litter and manure storage should limit attraction of wild birds, rodents, insects, and other animals. 10. Replacement Poultry: Replacement poultry should be sourced from health -monitored flocks which are in complianc e with NPIP guidelines. They should be transported in equipment and vehicles that are regularly cleaned, disinfected and inspected. Biosecurity protocols should be in place for equipment and personnel involved in the transport of replacement poultry. 11. Wate r Supplies: It is recommended that drinking water or water used for evaporative cooling be sourced from a contained supply such as a well or municipal system. If drinking water comes from a surface water source, water treatment must be used to reduce the l evel of disease agents. If surfaces have been cleaned or flushed wit h surface water, subsequent disinfection should be employed to prevent disease transmission. If water treatment is not possible, a risk analysis should be performed to determine actions ne eded to mitigate risks. 12. Feed and Replacement Litter: Feed, feed ingredients, bedding, and litter should be delivered, stored and maintained in a manner that limits exposure to and contamination by wild birds, rodents, insects, and other animals. Feed spil ls within the PBA (outside of the LOS) should be cleaned up and d isposed of in a timely fashion. 13. Reporting of Elevated Morbidity and Mortality Elevation in morbidity and/or mortality above expected levels, as defined by the biosecurity plan, should be rep orted as required in the site -specific biosecurity plan and appro priate actions should be taken to rule out reportable disease agents (dangerous transmissible diseases). If you need assistance when creating your plan, please contact your regional PDA vete rinarian.

This program involves participation and cooperation by the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture and Pennsylvania's poultry flock producers. Program Overview: A. Flock Owner Responsibilities: 1. Collection and submission of diagnostic samples: a. Samples shall be collected by a certified poultry technician or an accredited veterinarian. b. Samples shall be collected from 30 birds representative of the flock (birds of testing age tested from all pens and houses on the premises) and tested at a Pennsylvania Animal Diagnostic Laboratory System (PADLS) laboratory every 21 -30 days. c. Samples shall be colle cted, transported to the laboratory, and tested at the flock owne r's expense. 2. Reporting of possible disease: Flock owners shall immediately report any evidence or suspicion of avian influenza to the Department, and shall submit any samples requested for t esting. 3. Records: Flock owners shall maintain records pertaining to the flock to include sources of birds, dates of additions to the flock, dates and results of testing, and other records that may be necessary to monitor compliance with this program, shall save these records for two years, and shall make thes e records available for review by the Department. 4. Compliance with regulations: a. Marketing and transport: Page 62 of 200 AI Monitored Flock Program Flock owners shall market and transport live poultry in accordance with program requirements and utilize only marketing agents and transportation agents who are licensed or otherwise approved by the Department in accordance with the Domestic Animal Act (Act 100). b. Import/movement regulations: Flock owners shall comply with all Department poultry health regulations regarding import and movement of poultry as stated in Title 7 of the PA Code. 5. Biosecurity: Flock owners shall adopt and implement the minimum biosecurity measures included in the appendix of this document for their flocks, and shall allow p eriodic inspection by the Department to evaluate flock and premises biosecurity. B. Department Responsibilities: 1. Monitoring: The Department will: a. Monitor testing and maintain records necessary to administer the pr ogram; and b. Monitor compliance with program s tandards through flock inspection as needed; and c. Provide certification that a flock has met program standards and is a Pennsylvania AI Monitored Flock. 2. Information: The Department will, in cooperation with Penn State University and the University of Penns ylvania, provide technical information and advice to flock owners, veterinarians, and certified poultry technicians regarding the prevention and control of avian influenza. C. Program Requirements: 1. To be cert ified as a Pennsylvania AI Monitored Flock, a flo ck must meet the following requirements: a. The flock is in compliance with the requirements set forth elsewhere in this document. b. To qualify as a flock the group must have been together without any additions f rom untested or unmonitored flocks for a minimum of 21 days prior to testing and no additional birds may be added between the testing date and the date that they leave the farm. c. The flock is tested for avian influenza as follows: Page 63 of 200 AI Monitored Flock Program i. Samples from 30 birds, three weeks of age and older from all pens and hous es on the premises shall be collected between 21 and 30 days after the previous collection. Please note that you must count 21 -30 days from the date of the last sample collection -do not use calendar dates. For example, a flock sampled on August 24 will be out of compliance if sampled again on September 24 since this is actually more than 30 days. ii. Flocks must be tested every month -not just the month that they are moving. iii. Waterfowl should be swabbed (cloacal swabs) and tested using virus detection testing. PCR testing is available for domestic ducks and geese fed a commercial diet. AGID testing of serum from waterfowl will not be accepted for program purposes. Other birds, such as chickens, may have blood samples submitted for testing. Tracheal or oropharyngea l swabs will be accepted for other birds, but the testing fees for tracheal swabs are higher than for blood testing - more information is available from the PADLS labora tories. Check with PADLS for current fee schedules. d. The first test must be conducted wit hin 30 days of placement except for the following: i. For serology, sample collection from silkies and other small breeds of chickens may be delayed until the birds are 6 -8 weeks of age; ii. For serology, sample collection from guineas, chukars, and quail may be delayed until the birds are 5 -6 weeks of age. iii. Eggs from gallinaceous poultry may be substituted for blood samples for testing by AGID only at the discretion of the receiving State. 2. The 30 birds selected for testing shall be selected randomly and shall be representative of the flock (birds of testing age tested from all pens and houses on the premises). 3. The sample collector is expected to conduct a flock inspection at the time of sample collection to assess the general health of the flock. 4. The samples shall be submitted to a PADLS laboratory for testing. 5. The flock owner shall notify the Department if 30 eligible birds are not available for testing within every 30 days. 6. A flock must be negative for AI on testing for 3 consecutive months before it is considered to be a monitored flock in good standing. When new birds are added to the premises, birds coming from a source which is of equal or higher status (for example, another monitored flock) assume the monitored flock status of the previous flock and must be te sted once as a monitored flock prior to moving into the LBMS. Chicks coming directly from an NPIP AI Clean hatchery must be tested once as a monitored f lock before moving into the LBMS. If the added birds are from other sources, the flock must be tested fo r 3 months consecutively (with negative results) to be a monitored flock in Page 64 of 200 AI Monitored Flock Program good standing. 7. If a monthly test is missed or is done outside of the 21 -30 day window on a flock, or birds of lower status are added to the flock: a. The flock must be tested negative within 10 days of movement and moved as a \"tested flock\"; AND b. The flock loses its monitored flock status and must start over with three months of negative testing 21 -30 days apart, AND c. The previous monitored flock number will be made inactive and may not be used on submission forms or other paperwork until it has bee n re-activated after three months of negative testing. 8. Program flocks may be subject to inspections by animal health officials to ensure that the flocks are in compliance with program standards regarding sanitation, testing, and separation from non - program poultry. 9. Any monitored flock with a non -negative test for AI (confirmed at NVSL) must start over with three negative qualifying tests (new - 2017). (Regarding serum testing: If NVSL reports a n on-negative AGID, but negative HI, the flock is considered to b e negative and does not have to restart). D. Termination: 1. Flock owners may terminate participation in this program at any time. 2. The Department may remove a flock from the program on the basis of non-compliance with program requirements. 3. The terminating party will notify the other party of the termination as soon as possible. 4. The Department may terminate the AI Monitored Flock Program at any time, without advance notice to the participating flock owners. If the Department terminates this program, it will provide notice to the participating flock owners as soon as possible. 5. Failure to provide notice of termination described in this paragraph shall not affect termination. E. It should be further unders tood that: 1. The accredited veterinarian or certified poultry technician who collects samples may negotiate fees with the flock owner for professional services required by this program. 2. No liability shall accrue to the Department for damages, losses, or inj uries incidental to or arising by virtue of participation in this program. 3. Certification as an AI Monitored Flock does not constitute a warranty regarding the presence or absence of AI. Page 65 of 200 AI Monitored Flock Program APPENDIX Biosecurity Guidelines for Participating Flocks Disease age nts such as bacteria and viruses are easily introduced onto a farm by people, vehicles, farm equipment, and animals, including the poultry coming into the operation. Organic material, including manure, feathers, and dust, are the primary means by which the disease agents can be carried. Listed below are practical measures which can be taken to reduce the risk of bringing disease agents onto a farm. These are minimal biosecurity recommendations and should be used only as guidelines for development of comple te biosec urity practices on an individual farm. Avoid visiting farms with poor biosecurity practices. When visiting other farms or auctions with poultry, wear disposable outerwear and dispose of it, or change your clothes and clean your boots before ret urning to your own property. Limit visitors and reduce vehicular traffic on your property, and keep any visitors away from the poultry. Keep your poultry house locked. Allow only essential personnel into your poultry house. Provide clean or disposable co veralls, head covers, and plastic boots or boots that can be cleaned and disinfected for personnel who must enter the house. Personnel should change outerwear between poultry houses. Disinfecting foot baths may be useful and should be placed at outside entries to the poultry house and egg room. Change the disinfectant in the foot baths daily. Foot baths do not replace clean, designated footwear for wearing in poultry areas. Do not share equipment or vehicles with other farms. If you must, insist that ve hicles and equipment entering your premises be cleaned and disinfected. (Personnel and equipment that have been in direct or indirect contact with the live bird markets pose a great risk). Trucks from the Live Bird Market should not be going directly to any farm to load birds. It is recommended that birds are taken to a central location for loading onto trucks for the Live Bird Market. Vehicles transporting birds should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected before r eturning to the farm. Special attention s hould be paid to the coops. If you must allow trucks from the LBM onto your premises, do not allow personnel or coops Page 66 of 200 AI Monitored Flock Program from the live bird markets to enter your poultry house(s) unless those per sonnel are wearing proper clothing and coops have been cleaned and disinfected. Insist that supplies brought to your premises (egg flats, carts, etc.) be new (if disposable) or be washed and disinfected (plastic flats, carts, shelves, or dividers). Follo w the \"all -in/all-out\" philosophy of flock management. Protect open range or backyard poultry flocks from contact with wild birds and water that may have been contaminated by wild birds. Dispose of dead birds safely (incineration, burial, composting, rendering). Never pile dead birds outside of a building or spread in fields. If multiple loadouts are required on your farm, try to have all birds off the farm within 3 -4 days. Create and follow a biosecurity plan for each flock (refer to the National Poultry Improvement Plan Program Standard E). Report any increased illness or mortality to your company or to the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture at (717) 772-2852.

[49 Pa.B. 3630] [Saturday, July 13, 2019] A. Avian influenza is an infectious disease of poultry. B. Avian influenza is designated a ''dangerous transmissible disease'' of animals under the provisions of the Domestic Animal Law (3 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2301 \u20142389), at 3 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2321(a)(6). C. The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture (PDA) has broad authority under the Domestic Animal Law to regulate the keeping and handling of domestic animals in order to exclude, contain or eliminate dangerous transmissible diseases. D. Avian influenza has cause d significant loss in the pas t to the Pennsylvania poultry industry. E. Avian influenza is of particular concern to the entire Pennsylvania poultry industry and may severely limit the market for Pennsylvania product. F. Avian influenza subtypes H5 and H7 are o f particular concern due to t heir potential for developing into a virulent (highly pathogenic) form of disease. G. Avian influenza exists, or is suspected to exist, outside this Commonwealth. H. All poultry and hatching eggs of poultry entering PA must come fr om a flock meeting the testing requirements outlined in this order and the testing requirements for Pullorum -typhoid and other Dangerous Transmissible Diseases as required under PDA's regulat ions at Title 7 of the Pennsylvania Code (accessible through the following web site address: www.pacode.com) and under the Domestic Animal Law 2301 \u20142389), at 3 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2321(d)) including all applicable Orders of Quarantine (accessible throu gh the following website address: www.agriculture.pa.gov ). A flock shall consist of birds which have been together without untested additions for 21 days. I. The Domestic Animal Law allows (at 3 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2329 (c)) for the establishment of an Interstate/International Quarant ine under the circumstances described above. J. Any person accepting poultry or hatching eggs in violation of the testing and records provisions of this Order is in violation of this Order. K. Pursuant to that authority, PDA issued its initial Interstate/Inter national Quarantine Order addressing avian influenza on January 24, 2006. In the course of implementing and administering this initial Order, PDA determined the need to refine the conditions of quarantine; and issued a February 7, Page 71 of 200 2008, March 16, 2009, July 1, 2012, and a revised January 5, 2013 Interstate/International Quarantine Order to supplant and rescind its initial Order. L. PDA has again determined the need to refine the conditions of quarantine. Specifically, PDA seeks to further clarify the requirem ents for testing and documentation applicable to importation of poultry and hatching eggs of poultry into Pennsylvania. Order . PDA enters an Interstate/International Quarantine Order, incorporating the foregoing recitals. This order is entered under auth ority of the Domestic Animal Law (at 3 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2329) and \u00a7 1702 of the Administrative 1929 (71 P.S. \u00a7 442), and est ablishes the following quarantine restrictions with respect to the shipment of live poultry and other avian species into the Comm onwealth of Pennsylvania: 1. For purposes of this Order, the term ''poultry'' includes all domesticated fowl, including chickens, turkeys, ostriches, emus, rheas, cassowaries, pheasants, partridge, quail, grouse, and guineas, but not doves and pigeons), or as otherwise defined under subpart A of the current version of the National Poultry Improvement Plan (NPIP) and Auxiliary Provisions, and shall be 3 weeks of age or older. 2. Poultry and hatching eggs of po ultry shall only be allowed into the Commonwealth under one of the following circumstances: a. The poultry and hatching eggs of poultry originate from a flock that participates in the current version of the National Poultry Improvement Plan and Auxiliary Provisions ''U.S. Avian Influenza Clean'' or ''U.S. H5/H7 Avian Influenza Clean'' program and the shipment is ac companied by a USDA form 9 -3 form (Report of Sales of Hatching Eggs, Chicks, or Poults) or equivalent form. If poultry or hatching eggs are shipped in containers through the United States Postal Service (USPS), Federal Express, United Parcel Service (UPS), or by any other courier, the 9 -3 (or equivalent) form must be affixed to the outside of the container and must be clearly visible and legible; or b. The poultry and hatching eggs of poultry originate from a flock in which a minimum of thirty (30) birds, three (3) weeks of age or older, were tested negative for avian influenza by a National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) laboratory. For gallinaceous birds such as chickens, turkeys, ostriches, emus, rheas, cassowaries, and game birds, serology is permitted OR virus isolation or real-time reverse -transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RRT -PCR) testing of or tracheal swab performed. RRT -PCR testing of cloacal swab samples is accepted for testing of domestic waterfowl species such as ducks and geese, as specified by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory. For non - domesticated waterfowl, virus isolation testing of cloacal swab samples shall be performed. The date of sample collection must be within the thirty (30) days prior to the date of entry into Pennsylvania. If there are fewer than thirty (30) birds in the flock, all birds of age must be tested as describe d above for that bird type. Samples must be collected by a USDA Category II Accredited Veterinarian, a Certified Poultry Technician, or a State or Federal official or their designees. No untested poultry shall have been added to the flock after sample collection and before entry into Pennsylvania. c. All poultry and hatching eggs of poultry being imported into Pennsylvania which are not being moved on a NPIP 9 -3 (or equivalent) form must be accompanied by an Owner Endorsed Avian Interstate/International Healt h Statement, or a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (CVI) issued by a USDA Category II Accredited Veterinarian. The testing laboratory name, test accession number(s), and a statement indicating negative test results must be included on the statement or CVI. If poultry or hatching Page 72 of 200 eggs are shipped in containers through the United States Postal Service (USPS), Federal Express, United Parcel Service (UPS), or by any other courier, a copy of the Owner Endorsed Avian Interstate/International Health Statement or CVI must be affixed to the outside of the container and must be clearly visible and legible. A copy of the Owner Endorsed Avian Interstate/International Health Statement or CVI and the laboratory test report including negative test results must also be sent to PDA within the seven (7) days after the date of shipment. d. If a flock is serologically positive, poultry and hatching eggs from that flock may be imported only if the flock is determined to be free of virus by virtue of a negative virus detection t est. This test must be performed by an approved NAHLN laboratory. A minimum of one hundred and fifty (150) birds from the flock must be tested. If there are fewer than 150 birds in the flock, all birds of age must be tested by the approved test described f or that bird type. For gallinaceous bi rds such as chickens, turkeys, ostriches, emus, rheas, cassowaries, and game birds, virus isolation or RRT - PCR testing of oropharyngeal or tracheal specimens shall be performed. RRT -PCR testing of cloacal swab samples is accepted for testing of domestic w aterfowl species, such as ducks and geese, as specified by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory. For non -domesticated waterfowl, virus isolation testing of cloacal swabs shall be performed. The date of sample co llection must be within the thirty (30 ) days prior to the date of entry into Pennsylvania. Samples must be collected by a USDA Category II Accredited Veterinarian, a Certified Poultry Technician, or a State or Federal official or their designees. No untest ed poultry shall have been added to th e flock after sample collection and before entry into Pennsylvania. 3. Poultry three (3) weeks of age and older and hatching eggs of poultry, imported into the Commonwealth, shall meet all other import requirements requi red under PDA's regulations at Title 7 of the Pennsylvania Code (accessible through the following web site address: www.pacode.com) and under the Domestic Animal Law 2301 \u20142389, at 3 applicable Orders of Quaran tine (accessible through the following website address: www.agriculture.pa.gov). 4. turkeys, ostriches, emus, rheas, cassowaries, game birds, other gallinaceous birds, domestic waterfowl and other water birds (swimming or wading birds) three (3) weeks of age and older which are destined to be pet birds (non- agricultural purposes) or destined to be part of a zoological or menagerie collection and their hatching eggs, and non-domesticated birds destined for domestication, confinement, or intended for release shall only be allowed into the Commonwealth under one of the following circumstances: a. The birds and hatching eggs originate from a flock in which a minimum of thirty (30) birds (or the entire flock if it consists of fewer than 30 birds), three (3) weeks of age or older, were tested negative for avian influenza by virus detection testing. Alternatively, these birds may be tested individually for import (no flock of origin test requirement). Samples must be collected by a USDA Category II Accredi ted Veterinari an, a Certified Poultry Technician, or a State or Federal official or their designees. The test shall be performed by an approved NAHLN laboratory. b. RRT -PCR testing or virus isolation testing for avian influenza is accepted for testing of chickens, turkeys, ostriches, emus, rheas, cassowaries, game birds, other gallinaceous birds, and domestic waterfowl species such as ducks and geese as specified by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory. For non -domesticated water birds (swimming or wading birds), virus isolation testing of cloacal swabs shall be performed. The date of sample collection must be within the thirty (30) days prior to the date of entry into Pennsylvania. Hatching eggs may originate from individually tested birds or from a flock tested as required by this Order. Page 73 of 200 c. These birds and hatching eggs must be accompanied by an Owner Endorsed Avian Interstate/International Health Statement, or a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (CVI) issued by a USDA Category II Accredited Vet erinarian.

A. Avian influenza, Chlamydiosis (psittacosis), Chronic respiratory disease of poultry caused by Mycoplasma synoviae or Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Duck viral enteritis, Newcastle Disease, and Salmonella gallinarum are designated ''dangerou s transmissible diseases'' of animals under the provisions of the Domesti c Animal Law (3 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2301 \u20142389), at 3 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2321(d). B. The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture (Department), under the edicts established by section 2327 of the Domest ic Animal Law (3 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2327) (related to disease surveillance and detection) has the authority and duty to carry out disease surveillance and detection and more specifically to regularly monitor the domestic animal population of this Commonwealth to determine the prevalence and incidence of transmissible diseases or conta mination by hazardous substances. C. The Department, under the provisions set forth at section 2329 of the Domestic Animal Law (3 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2329) (related to quarantine) has the autho rity to establish three different types of quarantine orders \u2014Interstate a nd International, General and Special. The Department may establish a Quarantine Order, ''Whenever a dangerous transmissible disease...exists anywhere within or outside of this Com monwealth, or whenever it is deemed advisable to test or treat any domest ic animal upon the reasonable suspicion that it has contracted or been exposed to a dangerous transmissible disease...or whenever the testing or treatment of a domestic animal indi cates that the domestic animal has been exposed to a dangerous transmissi ble disease...so as to render future accurate testing for recent exposure of that domestic animal to that dangerous transmissible disease...impractical or impossible, the depart ment shall have the power to establish and enforce quarantines of any suc h infected, exposed, contaminated, suspected or susceptible domestic animal.''

The Department may establish and enforce a general quarantine order within the Commonwealth for any reason set forth paragraph C above, ''...to preve nt a dangerous transmissible disease...from being carried into, within, from or out of the area or locality that is subject to the quarantine...'' E. Section 2321(relat ed to dangerous transmissible diseases) of the Domestic Animal Law sets forth, at su bsection (a), dangerous transmissible diseases (3 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2321(a)). Section 2321(d) (related to designation of additional dangerous transmissible diseases through tempo rary order) allows the Department to designate additional transmissible diseases det ermined to, ''...present a danger to public health, to domestic animal health, to the safety or quality of the food supply or to the economic well-being of the domestic animal industries...'' as dangerous transmissible diseases through the issuance o f a temporary order (3 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2321(d)). Page 75 of 200 F. The dangerous transmissible diseases listed at section 2321(a) of the Domestic Animal Law and those designated by the Departme nt through a temporary order are known to exist within or outside of this Commonweal th and have been determined to pose a danger to public health, domestic animal health, the safety or quality of the food supply or to the economic well -being of the domesti c animal industries. G. The Act of April 6, 1956, P.L. (1955) 1429, at section 1, (Pul lorum Act) provides that ''The Secretary of Agriculture, when he determines that there is a need for trained technicians to aid in drawing blood from poultry to be used in pullorum testing programs, may license as many trained technicians as he deems neces sary to aid the programs.'' H. The Department developed and has administered such licensing and training programs. I. As dangerous transmissible diseases other than pullorum have been identified, and additional regulatory poultry health programs have been impl emented by the Department, other states and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), it has become necessary for the Department to train poultry techn icians with regard to sampling and testing techniques necessary to detect and surveil for those additional diseases. J. Avian influenza and other dangerous transmissible diseases of poultry are of concern to the entire Pennsylvania poultry industry and may s everely limit the market for Pennsylvania poultry products or cause production losses or death in poultry flocks within and outside of the Commonwealth if not detected and controlled. K. Avian influenza, in particular, has caused significant loss in the past to the Pennsylvania poultry industry and to the poultry industry in other states and as a whol e. L. Regulatory poultry health programs exist through the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture and through the USDA National Poultry Improvement Plan (NPIP) to provide disease surveillance, promote healthy poultry and a healthy food supply, and to support interstate and international commerce. M. Regulatory surveillance for movement of poultry not participating in official poultry health programs may be required fo r intrastate, interstate, and international commerce, and for entry into exhibitions or markets . N. The following Order establishes testing and training requirements necessary for Certification and Licensing of Poultry Technicians. O. Only persons certified and licensed in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Order may draw blood, collect sw ab and egg samples, and conduct approved on -site testing of poultry for dangerous transmissible diseases of poultry for regulatory testing purposes. Order. PDA enters a General Quarantine Order, incorporating the foregoing recitals. This Order is entered under authority of the Domestic Animal Law (at 3 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2329) and \u00a7 1702 of the Administrative Code (71 P.S. \u00a7 442), and establishes the followi ng quarantine restrictions and standards with respect to training and testing of persons to become licensed as Certified Poultry Technicians and provides standards for the collection of samples for testing and rapid testing for regulatory purposes other th an the detection of pullorum disease in poultry. Page 76 of 200 1. General . For purposes of this Order, the term ''p oultry'' includes all domesticated fowl, including chickens, turkeys, ostriches, emus, rheas, cassowaries, waterfowl, and game birds, except doves and pigeon s, which are bred for the primary purpose of producing eggs or meat, or as otherwise defined under subpart A of the current version of the National Poultry Improvement Plan (NPIP) and Auxiliary Provisions. 2. Purpose . This Order allows for qualified persons to become licensed as Certified Poultry Technicians to carry out certain sampling and testing proce dures, in addition to testing and sampling for pullorum disease under the Pullorum Act, and thereby further fulfill the Department's duty to surveil for dangerous transmissible diseases in accordance with the Domestic Animal Law. This Order allows for a mo re proactive and preventative approach to current and future dangerous transmissible diseases and hazardous substances through surveillance, monitori ng, and testing by the poultry industry. Such an approach furthers the legislative mandate of section 2327 of the Domestic Animal Law1 (related to disease surveillance and detection) and provides greater protection to the poultry population and industry in this Commonwealth. This Order delineates education and testing criteria that will allow for and require th e certification and licensure of private sector individuals to carry out domestic poultry sampling and rapid testing and thereby enhance monitoring, detection, and containment of dangerous transmissible diseases of poultry and contamination by hazardous substances. 3.

Page 85 of 200 NOTICES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE General Quarantine Order; Poultry Exhibition Requirements [49 Pa.B. 3093] [Saturday, June Recitals . A. Avian influenza and Pullorum -typhoid are infectious diseases of poultry. B. Avian influenza and pullorum -typhoid are designated ''dangerous transmissible diseases'' of animals under the provisions of the Domestic Animal L aw (3 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2301 \u20142389), at 3 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2321(d). C. Avian influenza can be transmitted between poultry and by contaminated people, vehicles, equipment, and other fomites, as well as by aerosol. D. Avian influenza has caused significant loss in the past to the Pennsylvania poultry industry. E. Avian influenza is of particular concern to the entire Pennsylvania poultry industry and may severely limit the market for Pennsylvania product. F. Avian influenza subtypes H5 and H7 are of particular concern due to th eir potential for developing into a virulent (highly pathogenic) form of the disease. G. Avian influenza is periodically identified in poultry flocks in Pennsylvania and surrounding states. H. Salmonella Pullorum -typhoid is a bacterial disease which can produc e significant mort ality in young gallinaceous (chicken, turkey and game) birds. Birds that survive infection will be lifetime carriers and may be the source of infection of other poultry. I. Transmission of pullorum -typhoid is primarily vertically through th e egg but may also be through direct or indirect contact with infected birds, and may be carried by fomites. J. Pennsylvania is designated as a pullorum -typhoid free state by the National Poultry Improvement Plan. K. Avian influenza and Pullorum -typhoid can be transmitted b etween poultry. L. The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture (Department) requires official identification of poultry entering an exhibition to promote animal disease traceability in the event of a report of a dangerous transmissible disease ( 47 Pa.B. 1857) .

This Order shall not be construed as limiting the Department's authority to establish additional requirements for poultry for exhibition or to limit any aut hority the Department possesses under the Domestic Animal Law or any other Act or Law administered by the Depar tment. 12. This Order is effective upon publication in the Pennsylvania Bulletin . RUSSELL C. REDDING, Secretary [Pa.B. Doc. No. 19 -895. Filed for public inspection June 14, 2019, 9:00 a.m.] Page 90 of 200 NOTICES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE General Quarantine Order; Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Live Bird Market Poultry Testing Requirements Recitals . A. Avian influenza (AI) is a designated ''dangerous transmissibl e disease'' of animals under the provisions in the Domestic Animal Law (3 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2301 \u20142389), at 3 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2321(a)(6) and is defined as an infectious disease of poultry caused by Type A influenza virus. B. Certain Influenza A viruses, including but not limited to H5 and H7 subtypes, are known to be zoonotic and are considered by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to be of public health concern. C. Avian influenza subtypes H5 and H7 are of particular concern due to their potential for developing int o a virulent (highly pathogenic) form of the disease. D. Influenza A subtype H2 is also of particular concern as it is known to be circulating in the Live Bird Marketing system (LBMS) in the Northeastern United States and appears to be adapting to infect gallinaceous species such as chickens, turkeys, and game birds as well as waterfowl. E. Other subtypes of Influenza A are of growing concern because of recent outbreaks in poultry in other countries as well as for their zoonotic potential. F. Avian influenza can be transmitted between poultry and by contaminated people, vehicles, equipment, and other fomites, as well as by aerosol. G. Avian influenza has caused significant loss in the past to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania poultry industry. H. Avian influenza is of concern to the entire Commonwealth of Pennsylvania poultry industry and may severel y limit the market for Pennsylvania product. I. The Live Bird Marketing system in the Northeastern United States consists of a complex system of production flocks, Dealers/ Haulers, auctions and Live Bird Markets. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania producers provi de a large portion of the poultry which enters Live Bird Markets in the Northeastern states. J. Poultry entering Live Bird Markets located in Northeastern states outside of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania with an active Live Bird Marketing system are requir ed to move as a Tested Flock or as an AI Monitored Flock in an effort to prevent poultry infected with Influenza A, particularly H5, H7, and H2 subtypes, from entering the markets and circulating throughout the Live Bird Marketing system. K. The Commonwe alth of Pennsylvania Initial State Response and Containment Plan (ISRCP) protocols outline response to all Influenza A identified in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and in cludes immediate quarantine of any premises on which Influenza A has been identified , including Live Bird Markets and epidemiologically linked flocks. L. Per the ISRCP, if Influenza A is identified in poultry samples collected at a Commonwealth of Pennsylv ania Live Bird Market, the market is placed under quarantine, and depending upon whi ch virus Page 91 of 200 subtype was identified, may be granted 72 hours to sell down poultry which are in the market at the time the quarantine was placed. No live poultry may leave the market. Following sell down, the market shall be clean ed and disinfect ed and pass a post-cleaning and disinfection inspection by officials. Environmental samples may be collected and tested at the discretion of the Department. If necessary, officials may r equire the cleaning and disinfection procedure to be repeated. M. Live Bird Market c losure due to quarantine may result in loss of income at all levels of the Live Bird Marketing system and may negatively affect the availability of product for consumers. N. A requirement that allows only AI test -negative poultry to enter Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Live Bird Markets may reduce the risk of the introduction of AI into commercial poultry from the LBMS, enhance AI surveillance across the Commonwealth of Pennsyl vania , and reduce the number of markets placed under quarantine and the negative eff ects of quarantine on the LBMS. O. The Department, under the edicts established by section 2327 of the Domestic Animal Law (3Pa.C.S.A. \u00a72327) has the authority and duty to ca rry out disease surveillance and detection and more specifically to regularly monito r the domestic animal population of this Commonwealth to determine the prevalence and incidence of transmissible diseases or contamination by hazardous substances. P. The Dep artment, under the provisions set forth at section 2329 of the Domestic Animal Law (3Pa.C.S.A. \u00a72329) (related to quarantine) has the authority to establish three different types of quarantine orders \u2014 Interstate and International, General, and Specia l. The Department may establish a Quarantine Order, ''Whenever a dangerous transmissible disease...exists anywhere within or outside of this Commonwealth, or whenever it is deemed advisable to test or treat any domestic animal upon the reasonable suspici on that it has contracted or been exposed to a dangerous transmissible disease...or whenever the testing or treatment of a domestic animal indicates that the domestic animal has been exposed to a dangerous transmissible disease...so as to render future accura te testing for recent exposure of that domestic animal to that dangerous transmissible disease...impractical or impossible, the department shall have the power to establish and enforce quarantines of any such infected, exposed, contaminated, suspe cted or susceptible domestic animal. In addition, to the afordescribed domestic animals, a quarantine may apply to any goods, products, facilities, containers, vehicles or materials that may carry dangerous transmissible disease...and may be applied on or in or aga inst any premises, area or locality as defined in this chapter.'' (3Pa.C.S.A. \u00a72329(a)). Order. With the foregoing recitals incorporated into this Order by reference, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture under authority of the Domestic Animal Law, at 3Pa.C.S.A. \u00a72329(d) and \u00a71702 of the Administrative Code of 1929 (71 P.S. \u00a7442), hereby establishes a General Order of Quarantine (Quarantine Order) related to the dangerous transmissible disease Avian Influenza and with respect to health requirements f or poultry entering a Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Live Bird Market.

In domestic poultry, AI viruses are typically of low pathogenicity (LP), causing subclinical infections, respiratory diseas e, or drops in egg production. However, a few AI viruses cause severe sy stemic infections with high mortality. This highly pathogenic (HP) form of the disease has historically been called fowl plague. In most wild birds, AI viral infections are subclinical except for the recent H5N1 HP AI viruses of Eurasian lineage. Etiology : AI viruses are type A orthomyxoviruses characterized by antigenically homologous nucleoprotein and matrix internal proteins, which are identified by serology in agar gel immunodiffus ion (AGID) tests. AI viruses are further divided into hemagglutinin ( H1-16) respectively. Most AI viruses (H1 -16 subtypes) are of low pathogenicity , but some of the H5 and H7 AI viruses are highly pathogenic for chicken s, turkeys, and related gallinaceous domestic poultry. Epidemiology and Transmission: LP AI viruses are distributed worldwide and are recovered frequently from clinically normal shore birds and migrating waterfowl. Occasionally, LP viruses are recovered fr om imported pet birds and ratites. The viruses may be present in village or backyard flocks and other birds sold through live -poultry markets, but most commercially raised poultry in d eveloped countries are free of AI viruses. The HP viruses arise from mut ation of some H5 and H7 LP viruses and cause devastating epidemics. Stamping -out programs are used to quickly eliminate the HP viruses in developed countries, but some developing count ries may use vaccines to control HP viruses. The incubation period is hi ghly variable and ranges from a few days in individual birds to 2 wk in the flock. Transmission between individual birds is by ingestion or inhalation. Naturally and experimentally, ca ts and dogs have been infected with one strain of H5N1 Eurasian HP AI virus. Experimental infections occurred after respiratory exposure, ingestion of infected chickens, or contact exposure, but cats were more susceptible than dogs. Potentially, domestic pets could serve as a transmission vector between farms, but the ability of other AI viruses, including other H5N1 strains, to infect pets is unknown. Other mammals that have been experimentally infected include pigs, ferrets, rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, mi ce, mink, and nonhuman primates. Transmission between farms is the resul t of breaches in biosecurity practices, principally by movement of infected poultry or contaminated feces and respiratory secretions on fomites such as equipment or clothing. Airborne dissemination between farms may be important over limited distances. Lim ited spread by wild birds of the Eurasian H5N1 HP AI virus has been suggested but is not typical of other HP AI viruses. Other HP AI and all LP AI have minimal potential to infect dogs and cats. Clinical Findings and Lesions: Clinical signs, severity of disease, and mortality rates vary depending on AI virus strain and host species. Page 120 of 200 Low Pathogenicity Avian Influenza Viruses: LP AI viruses typically produce respiratory signs such as s neezing, coughing, ocular and nasal discharge, and swollen infraorbital sinuses in poultry. Sinusitis is common in domestic ducks, quail, and turkeys. Lesions in the respiratory tract typically include congestion and inflammation of the trachea an d lungs. In layers and breeders, there may be decreased egg production or fertility, ova rupture (evident as yolk in the abdominal cavity) or involution, or mucosal edema and inflammatory exudates in the lumen of the oviduct. A few layer and breeder chicke ns may ha ve acute renal failure and visceral urate deposition (visceral gout). The morbidity and mortality is usually low unless accompanied by secondary bacterial or viral infections or aggravated by environmental stressors. Sporadic infections by any sub type of L P AI viruses can occur, but H9N2 LP AI is common in poultry in Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa. High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza Viruses: Even in the absence of secondary pathogens, HP AI viruses cause severe, systemic disease with high mortalit y in chickens, turkeys, and other gallinaceous poultry; mortality can be as high as 100% in a few days. In peracute cases, clinical signs or gross lesions may be lacking before death. However, in acute cases, lesions may include cyanosis and edema of the h ead, comb, wattle, and snood (turkey); edema and red discoloration subcutaneous petechial visceral and blood -tinged oral and nasal discharges. In severely affected birds, greenish diarrhea is common. Birds that survive the peracute infection may develop CNS involvement evident as torticollis, opisthotonos, incoordination, paralysis, and drooping wings. The location and severity of microscopic lesions are hig hly varia ble and may consist of edema, hemorrhage, and necrosis in parenchymal cells of multiple visceral organs, skin, and CNS. Diagnosis: LP and HP AI viruses can be readily isolated from oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs, and HP AI viruses from many inte rnal orga ns. AI viruses grow well in the allantoic sac of 9 - to 11 - day- old embryonating chicken eggs, and they agglutinate RBCs. The hemagglutination is not inhibited by Newcastle disease or other paramyxoviral antiserum. AI viruses are identified by demo nstrating the presence of 1) influenza A matrix or nucleoprotein antigens using AGID or other suitable immunoassays, or 2) viral RNA using an influenza A -specific reverse transcriptase -PCR test. LP AI must be differentiated from other respiratory diseases or causes of decreased egg production, including 1) acute to subacute viral diseases such as infectious bronchitis, infectious laryngotracheitis, low virulent Newcastle disease, and infections by other paramyxoviruses; 2) bacterial diseases such as mycopla smosis, i nfectious coryza, ornithobacteriosis, turkey coryza, and the respiratory form of fowl cholera; and 3) fungal diseases such as aspergillosis. HP AI must be differentiated from other causes of high mortality such as virulent Newcastle disease, perac ute septi cemic fowl cholera, heat exhaustion, and severe water deprivation. Page 121 of 200 Prevention and Treatment: Vaccines can prevent clinical signs and death. Furthermore, viral replication and shedding from the respiratory and GI tracts may be reduced in vaccinated birds. Specific protection is achieved through autogenous virus vaccines or from vaccines prepared fr om AI virus of the same hemagglutinin subtype. Antibodies to the homologous viral neuraminidase antigens may provide partial protection. Currently, only inactiva ted whole AI virus, recombinant herpesvirus -turkey -AI-H5 (rHVT -AI-H5) vaccines are licensed in the USA. The use of any licensed AI vaccine requires approval of the State Veterinarian. In addition, use of H5 and H7 AI vaccine s in the USA requires USDA approval. Treating LP - affected flocks with broad -spectrum antibioti cs to control secondary pathogens and increasing house temperatures may reduce morbidity and mortality. Treatment with antiviral compounds is not approved or rec ommended. Suspected outbreaks should be reported to appropriate regulatory authorities. Zoonot ic Risk: AI viruses exhibit host adaptation to birds. Human infections have occurred, usually as isolated, rare, individual cases. Most human cases have originat ed from infection with Eurasian H5N1 HP AI virus and, most recently, Chinese H7N9 LP AI virus. The total accumulated human cases of H5N1 HP AI virus in Asia and Africa from 2003 -2013 is 648, of which 384 were fatal. The primary risk factor for human infect ion has been direct contact with live or dead infected poultry, but a few cases have resulted f rom consumption of uncooked poultry products, defeathering of infected wild swans, or close contact with human cases. Respiratory infection has been the most fre quent presentation of human H5N1 cases. For H7N9 LP AI, total accumulated human cases in China for 2013 is 137, of which 45 were fatal. Most cases had exposure risk to live -poultry markets. Conjunctivitis was the most frequent symptom in human cases of H7N 7 HP AI virus infection in the Netherlands during 2003, with 89 confirmed cases and 1 fatality. Other HP AI viruses and all LP AI viruses have produced very rare or no human infections. Source; The Merck Manual (Dr. David Swayne) Note: Currently, the O IE (World Health Organization) Terrestrial Animal Health Code (Terrestrial Code) defines \"avian influenza\" as an infection of poultry caused by any influenza A virus with high pathogenicity (HPAI ), and by H5 and H7 subtypes with low pathogenicity (H5/H7 LPA I). In previous versions of the Terrestrial Code and Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals (Terrestrial Manual), HPAI and H5/H7 LPAI viruses were termed \"notifiable avian influenza\" viruses, but because of inconsistences with usag e of the term \"notifiable\" with other diseases in the Terrestrial Code, t he terms \"notifiable avian have been removed from the Terrestrial Code a nd the Terrestrial Manual. To avoid confusion with the scientific use of \"avian influenza\", which began in 1955, in this Terrestrial Manual the terms HPAI , H5/H7 LPAI and influenza A will be used. The latter indicates any influenza virus from birds that is H1-H16.Page 122 of 200 Page 123 of 200 Page 124 of 200 6/17/2019 Avian Coryza The most prominent clinical sign may be facial edema (swelling of the face) and conjunctivitis with nasal and ocular discharge. Wattles may also be inflamed, and the infraorbital sinuses may be distended with exuda te. Sneezing and c oughing are frequently present which contributes to spreading the organism. Feed intake is decreased and layers in active production will show a sharp decrease in egg production (from 10 to 40% reduction). The morbidity (proportion of aff ected birds) is hi gh and is not uncommon to observe most of the birds showing disease symptoms. However, death loss is usually low unless the disease is complicated with other agents, such as Mycoplasma gallisepticum or E. coli. Occurrence: The disease ca n occur in birds o f any age but is more common in mature birds especially when they are stressed. It is not uncommon for layers to become infected shortly after relocation into new cages or around peak production. The incubation period is short, about 24 -48 h after experime ntal inoculation. Under field conditions incubation may take an additional 24 h. The uncomplicated disease usually runs its course in about 2 weeks. Transmission: Birds that have recovered from the disease can harbor the bacteria for a long time (or perma nently) in the absence of any clinical sign (asymptomatic carriers). For this reason, the disease can be difficult (or impossible) to eliminate in those facilities lacking an all -in all-out practice. Traditionally, layers are kept in mult iage complexes and infectious coryza can be a challenge when bringing young pullets that have never been exposed to the organism in the past. Exposure of na\u00efve birds to birds that have been infected previously is perhaps the most common mechanism for disea se transmission in regions where infectious coryza is prevalent. The organism can spread via inhalation from aerosols or be ingested from contaminated feed or water. Equipment moved from one house into another may also transport infective bacteria. Diagno sis: Isolation of the organism. This can be done plating the samples on blood agar plates cross streaked with a Staphylococcus culture following overnight culture at 37C in anaerobiosis. Hemagglutination Inhibition and PCR are 125 of 200 Differen tial Diagnosis: Coryza should be differentiated from other diseases like swollen head syndrome, fowlpox, and ornithobacterosis. Treatment: A. paragallinarum is susceptible to several antibiotics which can be given in feed or water. Tetracyclines are commonly used for treatment. Control: If the disease is not endemic in a given area for infectious coryza, depopulation may be used to decrease the likelihood of passing the disease to future flocks. If this is not an option, avoid bringing replacement birds into the same premises while sick or recovered birds are present. After the affected flock is removed, clean and disinfect the premises and wait at least 3 weeks before repopulating. If the disease becomes wide -spread in a region, there are commercial bacterins (a type of vaccine made with inactivated bacteria) available. This vaccine must match the serotype of A. paragallinarum isolated from previ ous local outbreaks. 2 doses of the vaccine should be given well before the onset of lay and several weeks before mo ving the birds into a high -risk location.

It is a worldwide problem that presents primarily as an acute respiratory disease, but depression, nervous manifestations, or diarrhea may be the predominant clinical form. Severity depends on the virulence of the infecting virus and host susceptibility . Occurrence of the disease is reportable and may result in trade restrictions. Previousl y known as velogenic viscerotropic Newcastle disease, ND is one of the most infectious diseases of poultry in the world. The mortality in unvaccinated birds can reach 100 percent, and birds may die without any clinical signs of disease. Though recommended and widely used, vaccination does not fully protect against NDV and may obscure the disease, resulting in further spread. Identifying Affected Birds NDV affects the respiratory, digestive, and nervous systems. The incubation period ranges from 2 to 15 days. An infected bird may exhibit some or all of the following signs: Sneezing, gasping, nasal discharge, coughing; Greenish, watery diarrhea; Depression, muscular trem ors, droopy wings, opisthotonus, circling, and complete paralysis; Partial to complete drop in egg production and thin -shelled eggs; Swelling of tissues around the eyes and in the neck; Sudden death; and Increased flock mortality. Transmission NDV is spre ad primarily through direct contact with droppings and nasal, ocular, or oral secretions of infected birds. The virus is present in high concentrations in body fluids and discharges and spreads rapidly through birds in confinement. The virus can be carried from one premises to another on contaminated shoes and clothing of service crews and visitors and their contaminated vehicles. The virus can survive for several weeks in a warm and humid environment on feathers and in manure and o ther materials and can s urvive indefinitely in frozen material. It is rapidly destroyed by dehydration and ultraviolet rays. Smuggled psittacines, especially Amazon parrots from Latin America, pose great risks for introducing the virus into the United Stat es. These parrots are as ymptomatic carriers and can carry the virus for up to 400 days. Biosecurity Measures on the Farm Veterinarians should work with poultry producers to strengthen biosecurity practices. Established and enforced biosecurity protocols w ill help prevent introdu ction of NDV and other infectious agents. Recommend biosecurity Establishing an \"all -in, all -out\" flock -management policy; Protecting against exposure to wild birds or water or ground contaminated by wild birds; Closing bird areas to none ssential personnel or vehicles; Providing employees with clean clothing and disinfection facilities and directions for their use; Thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting equipment and vehicles (including tires and undercarriag e) when entering or leaving the farm; Banning the borrowing or lending of equipment or vehicles; Banning visiting other poultry farms, exhibitions, fairs, and sales or swap meets (if Page 127 of 200 visits must occur, direct workers to change footwear and clothing on thei r return); and Banning bringing b irds in slaughter channels back to the farm. Vaccination Vaccines are available for chickens, turkeys, and pigeons and are used to induce an antibody response, so vaccinated bids must be exposed to a larger dose of NDV to be infected. Fowlpox or turkey herpesvirus -vectored NDV vaccines are commercially available for chickens and have the advantage of being able to be administered in ovo at the hatchery. These vaccines must be reconstituted as directed by the manufacturer and, because they take 3-4 weeks to produce a protective level of immunity, biosecurity is even more important. Zoonotic Risk: All NDV strains can produce a transitory conjunctivitis in people, but the condition has been limited primarily to laboratory workers and vaccination teams expos ed to large quantities of virus. Before poultry vaccination was widely practiced, conjunctivitis from NDV infection occurred in crews eviscerating poultry in processing plants. The disease has not been reported in people who rear poultry or cons ume poultry products. Source; The Merck Manual and USDA Page 128 of 200 Mycoplasma synoviae (MS) Facts Mycoplasma synoviae i s generally a subclinical upper respiratory bacterial infection of chickens and turkeys. The microorganism is transmitted b y direct contact although egg transmission (breeder flocks) and carrier birds (multi -age flocks) can contribute to infection. Systemic infection can result in inflammation of synovial membranes, resulting in exudates in the joints (arthritis), tendons shea ths and sternal bursae of infecte d birds (see photo). Affected birds are usually immature and are lame or recumbent with swollen hocks, footpads or sternal bursae. Infected layer flocks can have decreased egg production. Mycoplasma synoviae was first recognized as an acute to chronic inf ection of chickens and turkeys that produced an exudative tendinitis and synovitis (infectious synovitis); it now occurs most commonly as a subclinical infection of the upper respiratory tract, especially in multi-age layer flocks. M synoviae infection is also a complication of airsacculitis in association with Newcastle disease or infectious bronchitis. It is distributed worldwide and is seen primarily in chickens and turkeys, but ducks, geese, guinea fowl, pa rrots, pheasants, and quail may also be suscept ible. M synoviae isolates vary widely in virulence. Epidemiology and Transmission M synoviae is egg transmitted (transovarian), but the infection rate in breeder hens is low, and some hatches of progeny may be free of infection. Horizontal transmission i s similar to that of M gallisepticum, primarily via the respiratory tract, with direct and indirect routes. The incidence of M synoviae infection in commercial poultry in the USA has decreased because of the National Poultry Improvement Plan control progr ams implemented for chicken and turkey breeders. However, M synoviae infections of multiple -age layer flocks are common and may contribute to decreased egg production. Clinical Signs and Lesions Although slight rales may be present in birds with M synovia e respiratory infection, usually no signs are noticed. Birds under s tress or with concurrent infections are more likely to be clinically affected. The first signs of infectious synovitis include pale -bluish head parts and lameness in many birds with a tend ency to sit. The more severely affected birds are depressed and foun d resting around feeders and waterers. Hocks and footpads are swollen, and sternal bursitis (breast blisters) may be seen. Morbidity is usually low to moderate with mortality of 1% -10%. Ef fects on egg production are usually not apparent, but instances of transient egg production drops have occurred in layer flocks. Respiratory lesions may be absent, or consist of mild mucoid tracheitis or sinusitis with airsacculitis when birds are stresse d from poor air quality or challenged with Newcastle disease or infe ctious bronchitis. Early in infectious synovitis, a creamy to viscous yellow -gray exudate is present in most synovial structures but most commonly seen in swollen hock and Page 129 of 200 wing joints. In chronic cases, this exudate may become inspissated; livers are enlarged and sometimes green, spleens are enlarged, kidneys are enlarged and pale, and birds may be weak and thin with breast blisters from sternal recumbency. Diagnosis Skeletal abnormalitie s and trauma must be eliminated as the c ause of lameness. Differential diagnoses include viral tenosynovitis as well as staphylococcal and other bacterial joint infections. A presumptive diagnosis based on clinical signs and gross lesions should be confir med by laboratory tests. Serum plate agg lutination or ELISA are used to detect M synoviae antibodies, but cross -reactions with M gallisepticum and other nonspecific reactions may occur. These reactors are confirmed as seropositive by hemagglutination -inhib ition or by culture, isolation, and iden tification of the organism. PCR may be used to rapidly detect M synoviae DNA from pre - or postmortem specimens. In turkeys, the agglutination test for M synoviae may not be reliable, especially in birds with predomin antly respiratory infection. Treatment, Control, and Prevention The National Poultry Improvement Plan coordinates control and serology -based surveillance programs for M synoviae similar to those for M gallisepticum. These programs have resulted in eradica tion of the infection in most primary br eeder flocks of chickens and turkeys in the USA. Chicks and poults should be obtained from M synoviae -free breeders and raised with biosecurity to prevent introduction. Antibiotics in the feed may be beneficial in pr evention of synovitis but are expensive and not very effective in established cases. When M synoviae involvement in airsacculitis is an anticipated problem, preventive antibiotic therapy during the time of respiratory reaction to Newcastle disease and infe ctious bronchitis vaccines may be helpfu l. A live temperature -sensitive vaccine (MS -H) is commercially available and permitted in some areas. Source; the Merck Manual Photo source -Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory Page 130 of 200 Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG ) Facts Mycoplasma gallisepticum is the polymicrobial \"chronic respiratory disease\" of chickens; in turkeys, it frequently results in swollen infraorbital sinues and is called \"infectious sinusitis.\" These diseases affect chickens and turkeys worldwide, causing the most significant economic losses in large commercial operations, and are commonly seen in noncommercial flocks. Infection also occurs in pheasants, chukar partridges, peafowl, pigeons, quail, ducks, geese, and psittacine bir ds. Songb irds are generally resistant, although M gallisepticum causes conjunctivitis in wild house finches (and some similar species) in North America. M gallisepticum is the most pathogenic avian mycoplasma; however, considerable strain variability is m anifest i n a range of host susceptibility, virulence, clinical presentation, and immunologic response. Epidemiology and Transmission M gallisepticum is transmitted vertically within some eggs (transovarian) from infected breeders to progeny, and horizonta lly via i nfectious aerosols and through contamination of feed, water, and the environment, and by human activity on fomites (shoes, equipment, etc). Infection may be latent in some birds for days to months, but when birds are stressed horizontal transmissi on may oc cur rapidly via aerosols and the respiratory route, after which infection and clinical disease spread through the flock. Flock -to-flock transmission occurs readily by direct or indirect contact from the movement of birds, people, or fomites from infected t o susceptible flocks. Some potential reservoirs of M gallisepticum in the USA are noncommercial (backyard) flocks, multiple -age layer flocks, and some free -ranging songbird species. Good management and biosecurity practices are necessary to ensure that M gallisepticum infections are not introduced to commercial poultry from these and other sources. In many outbreaks, the source of infection is unknown. Cold weather, poor air quality or crowding, concurrent infections, and some live virus vaccinatio ns may fa cilitate infection, disease, and transmission. Epithelium of the conjunctiva, nasal passages, sinuses, and trachea are most susceptible to initial colonization and infection; however, in severe, acute disease, infection may also involve the bronc hi, air sacs, and occasionally lungs. Once infected, bird s may remain carriers for life. There is a marked interaction (polymicrobial disease) between respiratory viruses, Escherichia coli, and M gallisepticum in the pathogenesis and severity of chronic respiratory disease. Clinical Findings and Lesions In chic kens, infection may be inapparent or result in varying degrees of respiratory distress, with slight to marked rales, difficulty breathing, coughing, and/or sneezing. Morbidity is high and mortality l ow in uncomplicated cases. Nasal discharge and conjunctiv itis with frothiness about the eyes may be present. The disease is generally more severe in turkeys than in chickens, and swelling of the infraorbital sinuses is common. Feed efficiency and weight gains are reduced. Commercial broiler chickens and market t urkeys may suffer high Page 131 of 200 condemnations at processing due to airsacculitis. In laying flocks, birds may fail to reach peak egg production, and the overall production rate is lower than normal. Uncompl icated M gallisepticum infections in chickens result in relatively mild catarrhal sinusitis, tracheitis, and airsacculitis. E coli infections are often concurrent and result in severe air sac thickening and turbidity, with exudative accumulations, adhesive pericarditis, and fib rinous perihepatitis. develop sinusitis contains focal areas of lymphoid hypoplasia and germinal center formations. Diagnosis History, clinical signs, and typical gross lesions may be suggestive of M gallisepticum. Serology by agglutination and ELISA methods are commonly used for surveillance. Hemagglutination -inhibition is used as a confirmatory test, because nonspecific false agglutination reactions may occur, especially after injection of inactivated oil -emulsion vaccines or infection with M synoviae. M ga llisepticum should be confirmed by isolation made in mycoplasma medium containing 10% -15% serum. Colonies on agar med ium are used for speci es identification by immunofluorescence with species -specific antibodies. PCR can also be used for detection of M gallisepticum DNA using swabs taken directly from infected sites (choana, sinuses, trachea, air sacs) or after growth in culture. Mycoplasma isolates must be identified by species, because birds may also be infected with nonpathogenic mycoplasmas. E coli infection, Newcastle disease, avian influenza, and other respiratory diseases (eg, infectious bronchitis in chickens) sh ould be considered in the differential diagnosis and can act as inciting or contributing pathogens. Treatment, Control, and Prevention Most strains of M gallisepticum are sensitive to a number of broad -spectrum antibiotics, including tylosin, tetracycline s, and others but not to penicillins or those that act on the cell wall. Tylosin or tetracyclines have been commonly used to reduce egg transmission or as prophylactic treatment to prevent respiratory disease in broilers and turkeys. Antibiotics may allevi ate the clinical signs and lesions but do not eliminate infection. Regulations on the use of antibiotics in food animals are rapidly evolving and should be consulted before use. Prevention is based largely on obtaining chicks or poults from M gallisepticu m-free breeder flocks. Eradication of M gallisepticum from chicken and turkey commercial breeding stock is well advanced in the USA because of control programs coordinated by the National Poultry Improvement Plan. The most effective control program is to e stablish M galliseptic um-free breeder flocks, managed and maintained under good biosecurity to prevent introductions, and monitored regularly with serology to continually confirm infection -free status. In valuable breeding stock, treatment of eggs with ant ibiotics or heat has b een used to eliminate egg Page 132 of 200 transmission to progeny. Medication is not a good long -term control method but has been of value in treating individual infected flocks. Laying chickens free of M gallisepticum are desirable, but infection in commercial multiple - age egg farms where depopulation is not feasible is a problem. Inactivated, oil -emulsion bacterins are available and help prevent egg production losses but not infection. Three live vaccines (F -strain, ts-11, and 6/85) have been lic ensed in the USA for use during the growing phase to provide some protection during lay and may be used in some areas with permission of the state veterinarian. F -strain is of low virulence in chickens but is fully virulent fo r turkeys. Vaccinated chickens remain carriers of F -strain, and immunity lasts through the laying season. Vaccine strains ts -11 and 6/85 are less virulent, offer the advantage of improved safety for nontarget birds, and are widely used in commercial layers . A commercial recombinant fow lpox-M gallisepticum vaccine has been marketed. Source; The Merck Manual Page 133 of 200 Salmonella pullorum - 'Bacillary White Diarrhea' Facts Etiology and Transmission: Infections with Salmonella Pullorum usually ca use very high mortality (potentially approaching 100%) in young chickens and turkeys within the first 2 -3 wk of age. In adult chickens, mortality may be high but frequently there are no clinical signs. Pullorum disease was once common but has been eradicat ed from most commercial chicken stock in the USA, al though it may be seen in other avian species (eg, guinea fowl, quail, pheasants, sparrows, parrots, canaries, and bullfinches) and in small backyard or hobby flocks. Infection in mammals is rare, although experimental or natural infections have been report ed (chimpanzees, rabbits, guinea pigs, chinchillas, pigs, kittens, foxes, dogs, swine, mink, cows, and wild rats). Transmission can be vertical (transovarian) but also occurs via direct or indirect contac t with infected birds (respiratory or fecal) or cont aminated feed, water, or litter. Infection transmitted via egg or hatchery contamination usually results in death during the first few days of life up to 2-3 wk of age. Transmission between farms is due t o poor biosecurity. Clinical Findings and Lesions: The disease may be seen in all age groups, but birds <4 wk old are most commonly affected. Birds may die in the hatchery shortly after hatching. Affected birds huddle near a heat source, are anorectic, ap pear weak, and have whitish fecal pasting around the vent (diarrhea). Survivors are small in size and frequently become asymptomatic carriers with localized infection of the ovary. Some of the eggs laid by such hens hatch and produce infected progeny. There may be no lesions due to an acute septicemia and d eath. Lesions in young birds usually include unabsorbed yolk sacs and classic gray nodules in the liver, spleen, lungs, heart, gizzard, and intestine. Firm, cheesy material in the ceca (cecal cores) a nd raised plaques in the mucosa of the lower intestine a re sometimes seen. Occasionally, synovitis is prominent. Adult carriers usually have no gross lesions but may have nodular pericarditis; fibrinous caseous contents. In mature chickens , chronic infections produce lesions indistinguishable from those of fowl typhoid. Diagnosis: Lesions may be highly suggestive, but diagnosis should be confirmed by isolation, identification, and ser otyping of S pullorum. Infections in mature birds can be identified by serologic tests, followed by necropsy evaluation complemented by microbiologic culture and typing for confirmation. Official testing recommendations for flocks in the USA are outlined i n the National Poultry Improvement Plan. Treatment and Control: Treatment of infected flocks to alleviate the perpetuation of the carrier state is not recommended. Control is based on routine serologic testing of breeding stock to assure freedom from infection. In addition, management and biosecurity measures should be taken to reduce the introduction of S pullorum from feed, water, wild birds, rodents, insects, or people. Birds should be purchased from sources free of S pullorum. Source; the Merck Man ual Page 134 of 200 Typhoid ( Salmonella gallinarum ) is Salmonella gallinarum. The incidence of fowl typhoid is low in the USA, Canada, and some European countries but is much higher in other countrie s. Although S gallinarum can be egg -transmitted and produces lesions in chicks and poults similar to those produced by S pullorum, there is a much greater tendency to spread among growing or mature flocks through direct contact with infected birds. Mortali ty in young birds is similar to that seen in S pullorum infection but may be highe r in older birds. Clinical Findings and Lesions: The disease may be acute or chronic. Clinical signs and lesions in young birds are similar to those seen with S pullorum inf ection. Older birds may be pale, dehydrated, and have diarrhea. Lesions in older b irds may include a swollen, friable and often bile -stained liver, with or without enlarged spleen and kidneys; anemia; and enteritis. Diagnosis: Diagnosis should be confirmed by isolation, identification, and serotyping of S gallinarum (National Poultry Improvement Plan testing procedure). Treatment and Control: Treatment and control are as for pullorum disease. There are no federally licensed vac cines in the USA. The standard serologic tests for pullorum disease are equally effective in de tecting fowl typhoid. Source; The Merck Manual Page 135 of 200 Duck Viral Enteritis (DVE) Duck viral enteritis (DVE) is an acute, highly contagious dise ase of ducks, geese, and swans of all ages, characterized by sudden death, high mortality (particularly among older d ucks), and hemorrhages and necrosis in internal organs. It has been reported in domestic and wild waterfowl in Europe, Asia, North America, and Africa, resulting in limited to serious economic losses on domestic duck farms and sporadic, limited to massive die-offs in wild waterfowl. In the USA, considerable losses due to DVE have been reported in the concentrated duck - producing areas located in Long Island, New York. Members of the family Anatidae (ducks, geese, and swans) are the natural hosts for the vi rus. There are differences in susceptibility to the virus, with Muscovy ducks being the most susceptible. However, naturally occurring infe ctions have been reported in a variety of domestic ducks such as Pekin, Khaki Campbell, Indian runners, and mixed bre eds. The age at infection ranges from 7 days to maturity. The infection has not been reported in other avian species, mammals, or people an d does not pose a zoonotic risk. Etiology and Pathogenesis: Anatid 1 ) is a member of the family Herpesviridae. The virus induces vascular damage, especially in smaller blood vessels. This results in the deve lopment of generalized hemorrhages and progressive degenerative changes of parenchymatous organs. An immunosuppressiv e state induced by DVE may also explain the presence of secondary infections frequently seen in natural outbreaks of DVE in ducklings. Epidemiology and Transmission: The v irus is mainly transmitted by direct contact from infected to susceptible ducks or by indirect contact with a contaminated environment. Water seems to be a natural route of viral transmission. Outbreaks are frequent in duck flocks with access to bodies of water cohabited with free -living waterfowl. A carrier condition is suspected in wild birds. Recovered birds become latently infected carriers and may shed the virus periodically. DVE virus may undergo latency like other herpesviruses, and the trigeminal ga nglion seems to be a latency site for the virus. Recovered birds may carry the virus in its latent form, and viral reactiva tion may be the cause of outbreaks in susceptible wild and domestic ducks. Clinical Findings: The incubation period is 3 -7 days. Sud den high and persistent mortality is often the first sign of the disease. Mortality varies and can be 5% -100%, depending on virulence of the infecting viral strain. Adult ducks usually die in higher proportions than young ones, increasing the economic sign ificance of the disease. Sick birds are unable to stand and show indication of weakness and depression. Photophobia, inappe tence, extreme thirst, droopiness, ataxia, nasal discharge, soiled vents, and watery or bloody diarrhea may be seen. Adult ducks may die in good flesh. In contrast, ducklings frequently show dehydration and weight loss, as well as blue beaks and blood -stained vents. In laying flocks, egg production may drop sharply. Source; The Merck Manual Page 136 of 200 Avian Chlamydiosis (psittacosis) Avian chlamy diosis can be an inapparent subclinical infection or acute, subacute, or chronic disease of wild and domestic birds characterized by respiratory, digestive, or systemic infection. Infections occur worldwide and have been identified in at least 460 avian sp ecies, particularly caged birds (primarily psittacines), colonial nesting birds (eg, egrets, herons), ratites, raptors, and poultry. Among poultry, turkeys, ducks, and pigeons are most often affected. The disease is a significant cause of econo mic loss and human exposure in many parts of the world. Etiology: Chlamydia bacterium. Transmission is by the fecal -oral route or by inhalation. Respiratory discharge or feces from infected birds contain elementary bodies that are resistant to drying and can remain infective for several months when protected by organic debris (eg, litter and feces). Airborne particles and dust spread the organism. The incubation period is typically 3 -10 days but ma y be up to several months in older birds or after low exposure. Host and microbial factors, route and intensity of exposure, and treatment determine clinical course. The prevalence of infection varies considerably between species and by geogra phic locatio n. Infection is endemic in commercial turkey flocks; no clinical signs or mild respiratory signs and low mortality are the common presentations. Outbreaks are rare. Although chickens are relatively resistant to clinical disease, asymptomatic in fection is f requent. Clinical Findings and Lesions: Severity of clinical signs and lesions depends on the virulence of the organism, infectious dose, stress factors, and susceptibility of the bird species; asymptomatic infections are common. Nasal and ocular discharg e, conjunctivitis, sinusitis, green to yellow -green droppings, fever, inactivity, ruffled feathers, weakness, inappetence, and weight loss can be seen in clinically affected birds. Diagnosis: The combination of a serologic and an antigen de tection test, e specially PCR, or culture, is a practical diagnostic scheme to confirm chlamydiosis. In live birds, the preferred sample for bacterial culture or PCR is a single conjunctival, choanal, or cloacal swab. Multiple samples collected throughout 3 -5 days are rec ommended for detection of intermittent shedding by asymptomatic birds. Antibodies may or may not be detectable depending on the test used and on the level and stage of infection. Interpretation of titers from single serum samples is difficu lt. A 4 -fold increase in titers between paired acute and convalescent samples is diagnostic, and high titers in a majority of samples from several birds in a population are sufficient for a presumptive diagnosis. Prevention and Treatment: Human and avian chlamydiosis is a reportable disease; state and local governmental regulations should be followed wherever applicable. No effective vaccine for use in birds is Page 137 of 200 available. Treatment prevents mortality and shedding but cannot be relied on to eliminate latent infection; sh edding may recur. Tetracyclines (chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, doxycycline) are the antibiotics of choice. Appropriate biosecurity practices are necessary to control the introduction and spread of chlamydiae in a n avian population. Minimal standards include quarantine and examination of all new birds, prevention of exposure to wild birds, traffic control to minimize cross - contamination, isolation and treatment of affected and contact birds, thorough cleaning and disinfection of premises and equipmen t (preferably with small units managed on an all -in/all- out basis), provision of uncontaminated feed, maintenance of records on all bird movements, and continual monitoring for presence of chlamydial infection. The or ganism is susceptible to heat (it may be destroyed in <5 min at 56\u00b0C) and most disinfectants (eg, 1:1,000 quaternary ammonium chloride, 1:100 bleach solution, 70% alcohol, etc) but is resistant to acid and alkali. It may persist for months in organic matte r such as litter and nest material, b ut thorough cleaning before disinfection is necessary. Zoonotic Risk: Avian chlamydiosis is a zoonotic disease that can affect people after exposure to aerosolized organisms shed from the digestive or respiratory tract s of infected live or dead birds or b y direct contact with infected birds or tissues. Human disease most often results from exposure to pet psittacines and can occur even if there is only brief contact with a single infected bird. Other persons in close co ntact with birds such as pigeon fanci ers, veterinarians, farmers, wildlife rehabilitators, zoo keepers, and employees in slaughtering and processing plants or hatcheries are also at risk. Recent studies showed that zoonotic transmission of C psittaci in poultry industry workers is likely unde restimated. Precautions should be taken when examining live or dead infected birds to avoid exposure (eg, dust mask and plastic face shield or goggles, gloves, detergent disinfectant to wet feathers, and fan-exhausted examining hood). Some individuals, esp ecially pregnant women and those with impaired immunity, are more susceptible than others. The illness in people is usually respiratory and varies from flu -like symptoms to systemic disease with pneumonia and possibly endocarditis and encephalitis. Source; The Merck Manual Page 138 of 200 Infectious Laryngotracheitis Virus (ILT) Facts What is ILT? Infectious Laryngotracheitis virus is a herpes virus that causes respiratory disease in chicke ns, turkeys, pheasants, and some other species of birds. Can ILT survive in the en vironment? ILT cannot survive for a long period of time in the environment, since the virus is susceptible to heat and sunlight. It is also killed by most disinfectants. How long are birds contagious? Once a bird is infected with ILT, it becomes a life -long carrier of ILT and can shed the virus during times of stress, infecting other birds. A bird is most contagious while it is showing clinical signs of disease. How is ILT transmitted? The main source of transmission is the infected bird, which infects ot her birds. The proximity to other poultry that are infected with either the vaccine or field strain of ILT can cause disease in susceptible birds nearby. Especially at risk are farms located near major highways that have live poultry truck traffic or house s down -wind of egg -type pullet houses that use ILT vaccine on a routine basis. In addition, farms that practice multiple harvests in which crews take out only a part of the flock at a time greatly increase the risk of introducing ILT due to contamination from trucks, coops, and the crew's clothing, since ILT can also be spread by contaminated clothing, boots, equipment, and other mechanical carriers. What clinical signs are present in ILT -infected birds? Birds infected with ILT initially show signs similar to other poultry respiratory diseases. These signs include: Discharge from the eyes; Nasal discharge; Sneezing; Decreased growth and a failure to thrive; and Decreased egg production. As the disease progresses, the birds may show worsening signs, includi ng: Bloody discharge from the mouth and nose; Difficulty breathing and gasping for air; and Coughing, which may include coughing up bloody mucus. Morbidity can range from 50% to 100%. Will infected birds die? The course of the disease varies with the sev erity of the lesions caused by the virus, but most birds recover in 10 -14 days. Mild forms of the disease result in very low mortality (less than 2%). Severe forms of the disease result in variable mortality (5 -70%), with an average mortality of 10 -20%. Page 139 of 200 Is treatment available? There is no treatment effective against ILT, but antibiotics may be used to control secondary infections in severe cases. Some relief from signs is obtained by keeping the birds quiet, and lowering the dust level. Maintaining a clean water system may avoid transmission between flock members. How is ILT diagnosed? Since the clinical signs of ILT can also be seen with other diseases, including AI, it is important to get a rapid diagnosis. Sick or dead birds should be submitted to a dia gnostic laboratory for testing. What is seen on post -mortem examination? Usually infected birds have severe laryngotra cheitis, often with blood in the lumen, and caseous plugs may be present. Microscopically, there are often intranuclear inclusions in the tracheal epithelium. Can ILT be transmitted to people? No. Is it safe to eat meat and eggs from birds with ILT? Yes. ILT does not affect human health, and cooking will destroy any virus that is present. Is a vaccine available? Yes, 3 vaccine types are available; 1) chick embryo origin (CEO), 2) tissue culture origin (TCO), and 3) a pox -vectored recombinant vaccine. 1. Chicken embryo origin (CEO) vaccines can be administered through an eye drop or mass vaccination, such as spray or water. While these CEO v accines result in a better immunity, CEO vaccines have the capability of reverting to virulence and causing full-blown ILT signs. It can cause severe clinical signs and disease. Also, chickens treated with CEO vaccine can become carriers of the virus, putt ing unvaccinated flocks at risk. 2. Tissue culture origin (TCO) vaccines have a relatively low level of infec tiousness and are administered by an eye drop. A disadvantage of TCO vaccines is that the level of immunity is limited; the advantage of this is that it causes a less severe reaction. The TCO vaccine is only given by eyedrop and does not spread significant ly or revert to virulence and is therefore a very safe vaccine to use for show birds. 3. Recombinant ILT vaccines have been developed. The pox -vectored recombinant vaccine is given by the wing -web route to birds that are at least 8 weeks of age, as are all pox vaccines. If a bird has had previous exposure to pox prior to being given the pox -vectored recombinant, immunity to ILT will be minimal. If pox ex posure is not a problem, this vaccine would also be very safe for use in show birds. Please note that vaccination of show birds in PA is not required by PDA for show entry, and if used, it must be used properly. Page 140 of 200 Vaccination in the face of the outbreak in egg-type layers is used quite often to reduce the severity and longevity of the disease. In this case, double dosing of vaccine is done by administering one dose of chick embryo origin (CEO) vaccine per bird via water early in the morning followed by the second dose once the first dose has been consumed. The appropriate amount of vac cine is placed in about 10 gallons of drinking water per 1000 birds (about 8 gallons of stock solution metered at one ounce per gallon drinking water for 100,000 birds). This i s done following a short water starvation period. Dye is added to the vaccine so lution so that when starting to add the vaccine to the water lines the lines can be opened at the end of the line and closed when water containing dye is viewed. How can I prev ent ILT from infecting my flock? Egg -type birds - Apply one dose of CEO vaccine at 6 to 8 weeks by eyedrop followed with a booster vaccination of one dose of CEO vaccine at 12 to 15 weeks (by eyedrop preferably but can also be applied by water or coarse sp ray). Use good biosecurity measures to reduce exposure, especially durin g movement of birds out of pullet houses and into or out of layer houses. Broilers - Broiler vaccination is not routinely done as it increases the problems associated with upper respi ratory diseases. Exhibition Poultry - Isolate all show birds from the rest of your flock for 30 days after returning from the show, and care for those birds last every day. Do not share equipment between the birds during this time. ILT should be prevente d by using good biosecurity: Keep out possibly contaminated fomite s (mechanical carriers): Wild birds in the house or nesting in the air inlets; People - feed truck drivers, catch crews, coops, repairpersons, pest management persons, gas haulers, veterina rians, servicepersons, etc. Persons can be allowed entry if the pro per procedures of clean hands, headgear, clothing, and footwear are followed; Equipment - litter hauling, tractors, pest management equipment, etc. Equipment can be allowed into the house i f proper precautions of cleaning and disinfection are done; and Practice all -in all-out marketing if possible. If multiple harvests will be done, be sure that the equipment and catch persons' clothing are decontaminated prior to use. For the next flock pla ced following a break or flocks at high risk of infection: *Comp lete cleaning and disinfection of the house is recommended. * If built up litter is to be used, close up the house and heat the house to 100 + degrees F for three days prior to placement, in a n effort to kill the ILT herpesvirus, and discuss vaccination op tions with a veterinarian.

Carver, DVM, PhD, ACPV; PDA Page 141 of 200 Salmonella enteritidis (SE) Facts Egg-associated salmonellosis is considered to be an import ant public health problem in the United States and several European countries. A bacterium, Salmonella enteritidis, can be inside perfectly normal -appearing eggs, and if the eggs are eaten raw or un dercooked, the bacterium can cause illness. During the 198 0s, illness related to contaminated eggs occurred most frequently in the northeastern United States. Since then, SE risk -reduction programs for table egg layer flocks and breeder flocks which produc e them have been developed in many states and at the feder al level. Consumers should be aware of the disease and learn how to minimize the chances of becoming ill. A person infected with the Salmonella enteritidis bacterium may have a fever, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea beginning 12 to 72 hours after consuming a contaminated food or beverage. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most persons recover without antibiotic treatment. However, the diarrhea can be severe, and the person may be ill enough to require hospitalization. The elderly, infants, and thos e with impaired immune systems may have a more severe illness. How eggs become contaminated Most types of Salmonella live in the intestinal tracts of animals and birds and are transmitted to humans by contaminated foods of animal origin. Salmonella enter itidis may infect the ovaries of healthy appearing hens and may contaminate the eggs before the shells are formed. Due to intermittent shedding by the hen, an infected hen can lay many normal eggs while only occasionally laying an egg contaminated with th e Salmonella bacterium. Reducing the risk of Salmonella enteritidis infection Keep eggs refrigerated. Discard cracked or dirty eggs. Wash hands and cooking utensils with soap a nd water after contact with raw eggs. Eat eggs promptly after cooking. Cook tho roughly. Do not keep eggs warm for more than 2 hours. Refrigerate unused or leftover egg - containing foods. Avoid eating raw eggs (as in homemade ice cream or eggnog) unless using pasteurized eggs. Avoid restaurant dishes made with raw or undercooked, unpa steurized eggs. Restaurants should use pasteurized eggs in any recipe that calls for pooling of raw eggs. Poultry producers can take steps to reduce the risk of salmonella in their flocks, to include purchasing stock from NPIP SE -clean breeding stock, mai ntaining a sanitary flock environment, and environmental testing.

To qualify as a flock the group must have been together without any untested (avian influenza (AI)) additi ons or exposure to untested (AI) poult ry for a minimum of 21 days prior to testing for AI. The flock must have been together for at least 21 days before they can be tested for AI. Additionally, the qualifying flock may not be exposed to untested (AI) poult ry and no untested (AI) poultry may be added between the sample collection date and the date that the poultry leave the farm, unless those additions are from a flock which has been tested to equal or exceed the testing for AI done on the qualifying flock. The poultry must move directly to the market regardless of whether they were born and raised on the premises or they are an assembled flock. They cannot move to another premises before going to the market (exception -poultry may move to distributor for a fe w hours if necessary before being ship ped by the distributor to a live bird market). \"Monitored Flock\" means an established flock that meets the following criteria (Refer to the current version of the PA AI Monitored Flock Program Standards): A sample size of at least 30 birds (three weeks of age and older) randomly selected and representative of the flock is tested every month (every 21 to 30 days) for AI in accordance with the PA AI Monitored Flock Program standards. If the flock contains less than 30 birds, all birds three weeks of age and older within the flock must be tested monthly (Samples from 30 birds, three weeks of age and older from all pens and houses on the premises shall be collected between 21 and 30 days after the previous collection). Flocks must be tested every month -not just the month that they are moving . Waterfowl should be swabbed (cloacal swabs) and tested using virus detection testing. It is preferred that other birds, such as chickens, have blood samples submitted for testing. (Tracheal/OP swabs will be accepted for oth er birds, but the testing fees for swabs are higher than for blood testing.). The first test needs to be conducted within 30 days of placement except for the following: o Blood collection of s ilkies and other small breeds of chickens may be delayed until the birds are six to eight weeks of age; o Blood collection of guineas, chukars, and quail may be delayed until the birds are five to six weeks of age. Page 191 of 200 o Eggs may be substituted for quail and chukars after they start laying with permission of the receiving state . If multiple floors or houses, test a random sample of each house (to include birds from each floor) for a total of 30 samples per premises; The birds tested have tested negative for avian influenza for three consecutive months; No birds of lesser AI test status have been added to the flock; (When birds of lesser status are added to the flock, the flock loses its monitored status. After waiting 21 consecutive days, a flock that has lost its monitored status may re - qualify for monitored status if 30 birds have tested negative for AI monthly for three consecutive months); The flock must receive a poultry inspection certifica te indicating negative avian influenza status and flock health status prior to movement. If monitored flock testing is done outside of t he 21 -30 day window, or the flock has a non -negative test (confirmed at NVSL), that flock will be considered inactive on the monitored flock program, will have to requalify with three negative monthly tests to qualify, and must move as a 10 -day tested floc k into the NY and NJ live bird markets. Please note that you must count 21 -30 days from the date of the last sample collection -do not use calendar dates. For example, a flock sampled on August 24 will be out of compliance if sampled again on September 24 s ince this is actually more than 30 days. A CPT may collect samples from his or her own flock or a flock owned by a relative. \"Tested Flock\" means an established flock (must have been together as a flock for at least 21 days) in which 30 birds have tested negative for avian influenza within the 10 days prior to the date of movement . The flock may not be exposed to untested (AI) poultry and no additional poultry may be added between the sample collection date and the date that the poultry leave the farm, unl ess those additions are from a flock which has been tested to equal or exceed the testing for AI done on the qu alifying flock. The flock must receive a poultry inspection certificate indicating negative avian influenza status and flock health status prior to movement. If tested birds are added to the qualifying flock after the flock was tested for AI, the PIC is on ly valid for 10 days from the date of the most recent negative AI test of any of the poultry. A CPT may collect samples from his or her own flock or a flock owned by a relative . Page 192 of 200 MD, NY/NJ and PA Teste d Live Bird Market Requirements : Poultry less than 7 days of age are exempt from the following requirements; however, birds must have originated and moved directly from a flock that meets the requirem ents. Poultry that qualify for movement shall be kept apart from other pou ltry of infected, exposed, or unknown AI status. Approved tests for AI include AGID testing of blood samples, and PCR or virus isolation testing of swab samples. Serology (AGID) te sting of waterfowl is not accepted for entry into the NY LBMS (for tested or monitored flocks). Instead, waterfowl must have cloacal swab samples tested using virus detection testing for the NY LBMS. Poultry dealers/haulers must be licensed in Pennsylvani a if they are picking up birds in Pennsylvania or buying/selling birds in Pennsylvania. o For movement into the NY LBMS: Dealer s/haulers must hold a valid Domestic Animal Health Permit in New York o For movement into the NJ LBMS: Dealers/haulers must be regist ered as a Poultry Distributor within the NJ LBMS. Sanitation: All persons entering any premises containing live poultry with any poultry truck, feed delivery and/or other service vehicle shall take every sanitary precaution possible to prevent the introdu ction or spread of AI into or within the State. These precautions shall include the disinfecting of all footwear before entering and after leaving any premises containing live poultry and the washing and disinfecting of the cabs, tires and bodies of all ve hicles between each entry of a premises containing live poultry. In addition, all markets, auctions, sales outlet s and distribution facilities containing live poultry shall be maintained in a clean and sanitary manner and all coops, crates, flats, containe rs or other equipment used to hold or handle live poultry in such establishments shall be cleaned and disinfected between uses. Cleaning and disinfection of poultry crates, vehicles, and other equipment used for holding and transporting poultry must be documented properly in a logbook. New Jersey log books will be accepted in New York. New York log books are acceptab le only in New York. It is recommended that dealers delivering to the New York and New Jersey LBMS utilize the NJ logbook to document equipment cleaning and disinfection. If dealers are delivering only to the NY LBMS, the NY logbook may be used. Premise I D numbers: Federal premise ID numbers, if available, should be included on the laboratory submission form for all samples submitted for testing . The premise ID corresponds to the location of the birds when they were sampled. For NJ LBMS - Registration: Poultry distributors and production/supply flocks conducting business within the NJ LBMS must register with the NJ Dept. of Agriculture pursuant to N.J.A.C. 2:9 -2.2 (registration requirements). Production/supplier flocks that conduct business within the NJ LBMS, but are located in another state, are exempt from registering with the New Jersey Department of Agriculture (NJDA) if: Page 193 of 200 *Their premises has been assigned a National Premises Identification Number through the feder al National Animal Identification System (or other approved federal premise identification system); and *The premises identification number has been registered with the state in which the premises is located; and *Proof of registration is provided to an authorized agent of the New Jersey Department of Agriculture (by completing a NJ LBMS \"Registration Exemption Form\"). For NJ LBMS -Production flocks: All flocks must comply with the r equirements set forth in N.J.A.C. 2:9-5.1-5.2. For NJ LBM S-Distributors: All distributors conducting business within the NJ LBMS must comply with the requirements set forth in N.J.A.C. 2:9 -4.1-4.3, and must have a biosecurity plan on file with the NJ Dept of Ag. Contact Dr. Chrislyn Wood of USDA for assistance w ith a biosecurity plan. For NY LBMS -Crate washing: Transporters and distributors delivering birds to the NY LBMS will possess and utilize a working mechanical crate washer which cleans and disinfec ts crates between uses . For NY LBMS -Per regulation 45.6 -8: Flocks with NVSL -confirmed non -negative tests must have 150 birds swabbed or remove the flock and C&D the premises before entry; and if monitored must restart the program. For MD, NY/NJ and P A Tested LBM s: A poultry distributor must obt ain either a completed poultry inspection certificate (PIC) or a certificate of veterinary inspection (CVI) from the production/supplier flock for all poultry intended for movement into the LBM. The PIC or CVI shall be accompanied by a copy of the finaliz ed laboratory report indicating the poultry tested negative for avian influenza. The flock poultry invoice, the PIC or CVI, and the laboratory report shall remain in the possession of the poultry distributor, a nd a new poultry invoice produced by the poul try distributor shall accompany all poultry moved into the LBM . It is not required to provide a PIC to the market owner (just the invoice).
