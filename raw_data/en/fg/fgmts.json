Vincent ent of Justi ce, Washin gton, D.C., for respondent. DECISION HASTINGS, Special Master . This is an action in which the petitioners, Michae l and There sa Cedillo, seek an award under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Prog ram (see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa- 10 et seq.) on account2 of sever al conditions, including autism and chronic gastrointestinal symptoms, which afflict their On October 30, 2008, petitioners filed a notice waiving their 14-day \"waiting period\"1 pursuant \u00a7 300aa- 12(d)( 4)(B). According ly, this document will be made available to the public immediately , as petitioners ha ve re quested. The applicable statutory provisions defining the Prog ram are found at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa- 102 et seq. (2000). Hereinaf ter, for ease of citation, all \"\u00a7\" references will be to 42 U.S.C. (2000). I will also sometimes ref er to the a ct of Cong ress that c reated \"Va ccine Act.\"daug hter, Michelle Cedillo. I conclude that the petitioners have not demonstrated that they are entitled to an award on Michelle's behalf. I will set forth the reasons for that conclu sion in detail below. Howe ver, a t this poi nt I will briefly summarize the rea sons for my conclusion.3 The petitioners in this case have advanc ed a causa tion theory that has sever al parts, including contentions (1) that thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines can cause immune dysfunction, (2) that the MMR vaccine ca n cause autism, and (3) tha t the MMR vaccine can c ause c hronic g astrointestinal dysfunction. Howeve r, as to each of those issues, I conclude d that the evidenc e was overw helmingly contra ry to the petitioners' contentions. The expert witnesses prese nted by the responde nt were far better qualified, far more experience d, and far more persua sive than the petitioners' experts, conce rning most of the key points. The numerous medical studies conce rning these issues, performed by medical scientists worldwide, have come down strong ly against the petitioners' contentions. Considering all of the evidenc e, I found that the petitioners have failed to demonstrate that thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines can contribute to causing immune dysfunction, or that the MMR vaccine ca n contribute to ca using e ither autism or g astrointestinal dysfunction. I further conclude that while Michelle Cedillo has tragically suffe red from autism and other sever e conditio ns, the petitioners have also failed to demonstrate that her vaccinations played any role at all in causing those problems. I THE APP LICABLE STATUT ORY SCHEME AND CASE LAW Under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Prog ram (hereinaf ter the \"Prog ram\" ), compensa tion awards are made to individuals who have suffe red injuries after receiving vaccines. In general, to gain an award, a petitioner must make a number of factual demonstrations, including showing s that an individual received a vaccination cover ed by the statute; received it in the United States; suffe red a serious, long- lasting injury ; and has received no previous award or settlement on account of the injury . Finally --and the key question in most cases under the Prog ram-- the petitioner must also establish a causal link betwee n the vaccination and the injury. In some cases, the petitioner m ay simply demonstrate t he occurrence of what has been called a \"Table I njury .\" That is, it may be shown that the vaccine recipient suffe red an injury of the type enumer ated in the \"Vaccine Injury Table\" corresponding to the vaccination in question, within an applicable time period following the vaccination also specifie d in the Table. If so, the Table Injury is presumed to4 have be en ca used by the vaccination, and the petit ioner is automatically entitled to compensation, unless it is affirmatively shown that the injury was cause d by some factor other than the nce of the reader, I have attache d to this Decision, as an Appendix, a Table3 of Contents of the dec ision. As will be detailed be low, no Table I njury is alleg ed in this case.4 2In other cases, howeve r, the vaccine recipient may have suffe red an injury not of the type cover ed in the Vaccine Injury Table. In such instances, an alterna tive means exists to de monstrate entitlement to a Prog ram award. That is, the petitioner may gain an award by showing that the recipient's injury was \"caused-in-f act\" by of course , the presumptions available under the Vaccine Injury Table are inopera tive. The burden is on the petitioner to introduce evidenc e demonstrating that the vaccination actua lly cause d the injury in question. Althen v. Secre tary of S, 940 F.2d 1518, 1525 ( Fed. Cir. 1991). The showing of \"causation-in-fa ct\" must satisfy the \"prepondera nce of the evidenc e\" standard, the same standard ordinarily used in tort litigation. \u00a7 300aa- 13(a) (1)(A); 418 F.3d at 1278. Under that standard, the petitioner must show that it is \"more probable than not\" that the vaccination was the cause of the injury . Althen , 418 F.3d at 1279. The petitioner need not show that the vaccination was the sole cause or even the predominant cause of the injury or condition, but must demonstrate that the vaccination was at least a \"substantial factor\" in causing the condition, and was a \"but cause . Cir. 1999). Thus, the petitioner must supply \"proof of a logical sequenc e of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury ;\" the logic al sequenc e must be supported by \"reputable medical or scientific ex planation, i.e., evidenc e in the form of scie ntific studies or ex pert medical testimony .\" Althen , 418 F.3d at 1278; , F.2d 1144, 1148 ( Fed. Cir. 1992). The Althen court also provided additional discussion of the \"causation-in-fa ct\" standard, as follows: Concisely stated, Althen's burden is to show by preponde rant evidenc e that the vaccination broug ht about her injury by providing : (1) a medical theory causa lly connec ting the vaccination and the injury ; (2) a logic al sequenc e of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury ; and (3) a showing of a proxi mate temporal relationship betwee n vaccination and injury . If Althen satisfies this burden, she is \"entitled to recover unless the [gover nment] shows, also by a preponde rance of evidenc e, that the injury was in fact cause d by factors unrela ted to the vac cine.\" Althe n, 418 F.3d at 1278 (citations omitted). The Althen court noted that a petitioner need not necessarily supply evidenc e from medical literature supporting the petitioner's causation contention, so long as the pe titioner supplies the medical opinion of an expert. Id. at 1279-80. The court also indicated that, in finding causa tion, a Prog ram factfinder may rely upon \"circumstantial evidenc e,\" which the court found to be consistent with the \"sy stem created by Congr ess, i n which close calls regarding causa tion are r esolved in fa vor of injure d claimants.\" Id. at 1280. Since Althen , the Federal Circuit has addre ssed the causation-in-fa ct standard in sever al additional ruling s, which have affirmed the applicability of the Althen test, and afforded further instruction for resolving causa tion-in-fac t issues. In Capizzano , 440 F.3d 1317, (Fed. Cir. 2006), the court cautioned Prog ram factfinders against narrowly construing the second element of the Althen test, confirming that circumstantial evidenc e and medi cal opinion, sometimes in the form of notations of treating physicians in the vaccinee' s medical records, may in a particula r case be sufficie nt to satisfy that second element of the Althen test. Both Pafford of HHS , 485 F.3d 1146, 1150 (Fed. Cir. 2007), discussed the issue of which party bears the burden of ruling out potential non-vac cine cause s. Most recently rned an issue of what evidenc e the specia l master may consider in de ciding the initial question of whethe r the pe titioner has met her causa tion burden. Another important aspec t of the causa tion-in-fac t case law under the Prog ram conce rns the factors that a speci al master should consider in evalua ting the reliabilit y of expert testimony and other scientific evidenc e relating to causa tion issues. In Daubert v. Merre ll Dow Pharmace uticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993), th e Supreme Court listed certain factors that federal trial courts shoul d utiliz e in evalua ting proposed expert testimony conce rning scientific issues. In , 195 F.3d 1302, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 1999), the Federal Circuit ruled that it is appropr iate for specia l masters to utiliz e Daubert's factors as a framework for evalua ting the reliability of causa tion- in-fact theories prese nted in Prog ram cases. One of the factors listed in Daubert is whether the scientific theory \"has been subjected to peer revie w and publication.\" 509 U.S. a t 593. The Court noted that while publication does not \"necessar ily\" correlate with reliability , since in some instances new theories will not yet have been published, never theless \"submission to the scrut iny of the scientific community is a component of 'good scienc e,'\" so that the \"fact of publicatio n (or lack there of) in a peer revie wed journal thus will be a relevant, though not dispositive, considera tion in assessing the scientific va lidity \" of a theory . Id. at 593-94. A second important factor listed in Daubert is the issue of \"general acceptanc e.\" The Court stated that a \"reliability assessment does not require , althoug h it does permit, expli cit identification of a relevant scientific community and an express deter mination of a particula r degree of acceptanc e within that community . * * * Widespread acceptanc e can be an important factor in ruling particula r evidenc e admissible, and a known technique which has been able to attrac t only minimal support within the community * * * may proper ly be viewed wit h skepticism.\" 509 U.S. at 594 (citations and interna l quotation marks omitted). II FACTS A. Undispu ted fac ts The following facts are ta ken fr om Michelle's medic al records, a nd are not disput e. 41. Michelle's early pe riod Michelle Cedillo was born on August 30, 1994. (Ex. 1, p. 1.) The pregnancy leading to her5 birth, and her birth, appea r to have been uncomplicated. (Ex. 23, pp. 47-52.) The records of her visits to the pediatric ian during her first 16 months of life indicate that Michelle's health appea red relatively normal during that period. (Ex. 8, pp. 2-6; Ex. 28, p. 265.) Those records show a few6 mild illnesses, but mostly normal examinations. (Id.) Michelle received the typical infant vaccinations during that period. Her initial hepatitis B vaccination was administered in the hospital shortly after her birth. (Ex. 23, pp. 45, 63.) On September 27, 1994, she received a second hepatitis B vaccination. (Ex. 18, p. 1.) On three occasions--Octobe r 31, 1994, December 27, 1994, and Marc h 8, 1995--she received three differ ent vaccinations, namely 18, p. 1; Ex. 8, pp. 4, 5.) On the last of those three dates, Marc h 8, 1995, she also received another hepatitis B vaccination. (Ex. 18, p. 1.) On Septembe r 6, 1995, Michelle r eceived hicken- pox\") va ccina tion. ( Id.) Both parties have filed numerous documents in this case. Petitioners have filed, on various5 occasions, exhibi ts numbere d 1 throug h 133. I will refer to those exhibits as Ex. 1, Ex. 2, etc. Respondent has filed exhibi ts, on various occasions, desig nated as Ex. A throug h Ex. AAA. I will refer to those exhibi ts as Ex. A, Ex. B, etc. In addition, in conjunction with the evidentiar y hearing held in June of 2007, both parties also filed other exhibits, separ ately numbere d, as \"Petitioners' Trial Ex hibits\" and \"Respondent's Trial Exhibits.\" I will refer to those as P. Trial Ex. 1, R. Trial Ex. 1, etc. In addition, \"Tr.\" references will be to the pages of the correc ted transcr ipt of the evidentiar y hearing held on June 11 throug h June 26, 2007. In this regard, I note that because of the importance of this case to many pending autism claims, the parties agreed to a transcr ipt correction proce ss. The original transcr ipt was filed with this court, in multipl e volumes, on June 12 throug h 27, 2007. The parties then listened to the digital audio recording of the hearing, and agreed upon an extensive set of corrections to the original transcr ipt. After that revie w proce ss was complete, the responde nt filed with this court, on Februar y 5, 2008, a compac t disc containing the parties' agreed corrections. The court repor ter was instructed to make those chang es, and then a \"Revised and Correc ted\" transcr ipt, containing the parties' corrections, was filed, again in multipl e volumes, on April 23 throug h June 11, 2008. According ly, \"Tr.\" citations are to the pages of the \"Revised and Correc ted\" transcript. (Note that the parties' briefs contain references to the original , uncorr ected transcript pages.) I also note that when documents were filed electronically in this case, electronically - generated page numbers appea r in the upper- right hand corne r of those documents. Howeve r, such electronically -generated page numbers often do not c orrespond exactly to the page numbers of the exhibi ts as originally numbere d by parties. In this opinion, I will ordinarily refer to the pages of the expert repor ts and other e xhibits as originall y numbe red, usually at the bottom of the pag es. Refer ences to Ex . 8 will be to the hand-w ritten pag e number s at the bottom of the pa ges.6 5A number of those vaccinations-- i.e., the DTP, hepatitis Hib vaccinations--conta ined a mer cury-base d prese rvative know n as \"thimerosa l,\" which will be discusse d at leng th below. Michelle experience d relatively few illnesses as an infant. A pediatric ian noted that she had an episode of vomiting and loose stools on Marc h 3, 1995, when she was seven months old, with the diagnosis of \"proba ble viral syndrome.\" (Ex. 28, p. 265.) On June 2, 1995, it was noted that Michelle was \"extremely constipated on 2% milk.\" (Ex. 8, p. 3.) The pediatric records also indicate that from age six months throug h 16 months, Michelle's height, weig ht, and head circumfere nce were substantially above nor (Ex. 8, pp. 7-8; Tr. 1335-37, ining to Michelle's initial 16 months of life contain relatively little information conce rning her development, other than the frequent notation of \"norma l\" in various physical examination categories. The pediatric ian notes indicate that at two months of age Michelle was able to fix her eyes on a movement and follow the movement (\"fixes + follows\"), and that she startled appropr iately to loud noises. (Ex. 8, p. 5.) They also record that on September 6, 1995, at one year of age, Michelle had \"seve ral words,\" was able to \"pull to stand,\" was \"not cruis ing or walking ,\" and that she \"crawls on knees.\" (Ex. 8, p. 2.) Her \"neur ologic al\" examination at that visit was de scribed a s \"normal.\" (Id.) 2. The MMR vaccination an d followin g pediatric visits On December 20, 1995, Michelle visited her pediatric ian, wher e she appea red well. (Ex. 8, p. 2.) At that visit, she rec eived a 1.) Michelle's ne xt visit to the pediatrician was on Januar y 6, 1996. (Ex. 8, p. 1.) The re cord of that visit indicates that Michelle had suffe red a number of symptoms since her previous visit on December 20, 1995. The record indicates that \"1 week after\" Michelle's MMR vaccination on December 20, she had \"fever and rash;\" the fever got \"better ,\" but later \"spiked up\" again. (Id.) The record further indicates that Michelle's second episode of fever \"starte d [with] cough yesterda [Januar y 5] gaggi ng to of vomiting.\" (Id.) By the following morning (\"toda y\" in the exam note), Michelle's tempera ture, taken at home, was 105.7 degrees. the pediatric ian's office , Michelle's tempera ture was recorded as 100.3 degrees, she was crying, and she had a \"purule nt postnasal drip.\" (Id.) The pediatric ian's diagnosis was \"sinusitis vs. flu,\" and Michelle was treated with antibiotics. ( Id.) Michelle next visited her pediatric ian on Marc h 15, 1996, wher e she went for her schedule d \"well check\" at 18 months of age. (Ex. 8, p. 1.) No major problems with Michelle's health are noted in the record of that visit; among the not ations are that Michelle \"seems t o hear well\" and \"stools well.\" (Id.) The physician did note, howeve r, that Michelle was \"talking less since ill in Jan.\" (Id.) 63. Diagnosis of au tism in 1997 After the visit of Marc h 15, 1996 , Michelle was not taken to see any physician again for about one year. The next record of her contac t with a physician is a record that indicates that on Marc h 7, 1997, her mother filled out a \"patient information sheet\" for a pediatric ian, Dr. Emilia Matos. (Ex. 17, p. 2.) There are no notes of a pediatric ian exam on that date, but notes of a visit to Dr. Matos on April 24, 1997, indicate \"deve lopmental delay suspected,\" and that Michelle was being referred to a specia list for further evalua tion. (Ex. 17, p. 5.) On May 2, 1997, Michelle saw Dr. Masland, a neurolog ist, who took a history . (Ex. 19, p. 1.) Dr. Masland recorded that at age 16 months Michelle had develope d \"a fever of 105+, that lasted for four days. This occur red two weeks after immuniz ation.\" (Id.) He added that \"[s]ince then she lost her ability to verba lize and has continued with repetitive movement.\" (Id.) He also stated that \"[i]t would appea r that there was some neurolog ical harm done at the time of the fevers. Whether this was a post-immuniz ation phenomenon or a sepa rate occur rence, would be ve ry difficult to say .\" (Id.) Beginning with those medical visi ts in early 1997, it quickly became clear that Michelle's development was quite abnorma l. On July 21, 1997, she was examined by a developmental psycholog ist, Dr. Karlsson Roth, who conclude d that Michelle suffe red from \"seve re Autism\" as well as \"prof ound Mental Retarda tion,\" and that her overa ll future potential \"is going to be extremely limit ed.\" (Ex. 7, p. 7.) Michelle was diagn osed with the particula r disorder, within the autism spectrum, known as \"autistic disorder.\" (Ex. 31, p. 12.) Michelle's evalua tions over the subsequent7 years confirme d these diagnoses, and confirme d also the tragic sever ity of Michelle's condition. For example, Dr. Ira Lott, a pediatric neurologist, wrote on Marc h 1, 1999, that Michelle had \"autism of a se vere degree,\" and tha t she \"doe s not have much in the w ay of communica tive speec h.\" (Ex. 28, p. 218.) 4. Other m edical diffic ulties In addition to her autism and sever e mental retardation, Michelle has also experience d a number of other medical problems over the years. One very signific ant problem has been her gastrointestinal symptoms. Michelle has experience d chronic problems, lasting for years, with both constipation and diarrhe a. For example, a notation of Michell e's treating gastroente rolog ist, Dr. Ramon Montes, on May descr rly years of Michelle's constipation and diarrhe a symptoms. (Ex. 44, p. 58.) The note indicates that Michelle's chronic diarrhea began about one year prior to that visit of May 2000-- i.e., about May of 1999. (Id.) That note of Dr. Montes does not say when the chronic constipation began, but indicates that the constipation was associate d with milk consumption (id.), and another record made on June 2, 1995, states that Michelle was \"[e]x tremely constipated on 2% milk\" (Ex. 8, p. 3), possibly indicating that the chronic constipation beg an about that time. Respondent does not contest that diag nosis.7 7Michelle has also experience d other gastrointestinal problems over the years, in addition to her constipation and diarrhe a. For example, on May 22, 2000, Dr. Montes noted that Michelle had symptoms \"suggestive of possible gastroesopha geal reflux disease\" (Ex. 28, p. 246), and on June 12, 2000, that physician diagnosed \"erosive esophag itis\" (Ex. 28, p. 185). Other medical records include further repor ts of gastroesopha geal 9, 29.) As a result of Michelle's gastrointestinal problems, a number of diagnostic proce dures, such \"endosc opies,\" were performed. During one such proce dure, on Januar y 1, 2002, a biopsy (tissue sample) was taken from her intestine. A \"Mea sles Virus Detec tion\" test on that biopsy was performed by the Unig enetics Ltd. Labora tory in Dublin, Ireland. The repor t of that test, issued on Marc h 15, 2002, stated that \"mea sles virus was detec ted\" in the tissue. (Ex. 28, p. 179.) (Note that the validity of that test result is in dispute, and that I have conclude d that the test was not reliable -- see pp. 41- 78 below.) In addition to her a utism, mental retardation, and gastrointestinal symptoms, Michelle has also suffe red from other medical conditions. Michelle has at times suffe red from symptoms of arthritis (Ex. 34, p. 4), uveitis (Ex. 33, p. 20), and pancr eatitis (Ex. 47, p. 61). She has suffe red from sever e feeding problems, requiring the use of a feeding tube. (Ex. 28, pp. 475-76.) In more recent years she has experience d a sever e seizure disorder, and suffe red a fracture d leg due to a fall cause d by a seizure. (Ex. 27, pp. 261-62.) In short, Michelle has continually suffe red from a tragic series of medica l misfortunes. B. Other factual representation s Michelle's mother, Theresa Cedillo, has on sever al occasions provided written statements conce rning Michelle's medical and developmenta l history , either for the purpose of providing details for Michelle's physicians, or for litigation purposes. (See, e.g., Exs. 18, 22, and 54.) Mrs. Cedillo also testified during the evidentiar y hearing in this case. (Tr. 222-406, 2874-84.) For the most part, Mrs. Cedillo's representa tions, in both her written statements and in her hearing testimony , have been consistent with the information contained in the medical records. In a few instances, howeve r, Mrs. Cedill o's representa tions have varie d from the medical Those are to petitioners' causa two issues--(1) the onset of Michelle's initial symptoms of autism, and (2) the history of gastrointestinal symptoms. I will discuss those issues separ ately below. 8III BACK GROUND: THE CONTROVERSY CONCERNING VACCIN AND AU TISM, TH E \"OMNIBUS AUTIS M PROCEEDING,\" A ND THE PROCEDURAL HISTORY OF THIS CASE This case conce rning Michelle Cedillo is one of more than 5,000 cases filed under the Prog ram in which it has been alleg ed that a child's disorder known as \"autism,\" or a simil ar disorder, was cause d by one or more vaccinations. A brief history of the controve rsy regarding vaccines and autism, along with a history of the de velopment of the 5,000 c ases in this court, will follow. A. Au tism described The terms \"autism\" and \"autism spectrum disorder\" (\"ASD\") have been used to de scribe a set of developmental disorders chara cterized by impairments in social i ntera ction, non-ver bal communication, and stereoty pical restric ted or repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. (Ex. JJ, pp. 32-33.) Those terms are essentially synony \"pervasive8 developmenta l disorder\" (\"PDD\" ), commonly used in medical diagnoses. (Id.) The PDD category is further subdivided into five subcate gories: autistic disorder, childhood disintegr ative Syndrome, otherwise at 32; E x. HH 23-25.) In this De cision, I will disorder\" intercha ngeably , to refer to the entire group of disorders within the broad PDD category. (The specific term \"autistic disorder,\" on the other hand, will be used to refer to the first specific subcategory of PDD listed above. (Ex. JJ. at 33, fn. 3.)) Autism is a condition that is usually recognized during a child's first few years of life, sometimes during the first year, but sometimes not until later years. (Ex. JJ, p. 33.) Autism can widely vary in sever ity. For many , such as Michelle Cedillo, the condition can be extremely sever e and deva stating, r ender ing the autistic individual completely unable to ca re for himself or he rself.

Institut e of Medicine, IMMUNIZATION SAFETY REVIEW: MEASLES-MUMPS-RUBELLA9 VACCINE AND AUTISM (National Acade my Press 2001). (Ex. HH.) 9B. Increase in diagn oses, and inception of controversies about pot ential vaccine causation Autism was first descr ibed i n a medical journal by Dr. L eo Ka nner in 1943. (Ex. HH, p.10 22; Tr. 1054.) I n rec ent y ears, the rate of diagnosis of autism has incre ased dr amatica lly. (Ex. J J, p. 35.) It is unclea r, howeve r, whether the actual incidence of autism-- that is, the rate at which new cases occur during a given period of time--has truly chang ed during that time period. Some experts have suggested that the incidence of the condition is, in fact, substantially on the incre ase, perha ps due to environmenta l factors. Other experts argue that the incre ase in diagnosis does not represent a real incre ase in the incidence of the condition, resulting instead from a broade ning of the diagnostic criter ia for autism, improved recognition of autism, and other factors. (Ex. JJ, p. 35; Ex. P, pp. 24- 31.) In any event, there is no doubt that at this time autism is a very common condition, in this country and throughout t he world. For example, one survey of recent studi es in the Unit ed States found that the current preva lence rate of autism in this country --that is, the proportion of the population that suffe rs from autism at a particula r time--is about 1 out of 152 children. That figure11 is roug hly consistent with the results of seve ral other recent studies. Because of the recent incre ase in diagnoses of autism and the incre ased public awareness of the condition, some have asked whether environmenta l factors may have cause d an increase in autism. Relevant here are two differ ent theories that have become prominent during the last ten years, in which it is theorized that childhood vaccinations may be causing or contributing to autism. First, one controve rsy arose in 1998 when British physician Dr. Andre w Wakefield and colleag ues published an article raising the possibili ty that the measles- mumps-rubella (\"MMR\") vaccine might be causing autism. (Ex. JJ, p. 40.) Second, beginning in 1999, a theory emer ged that a merc ury-12 based prese rvative used in a number of childhood vaccinations, known as \"thimerosal,\" might be causing autism. (Ex . JJ, p. 37.) The emer gence of those two controver sies led to a large number of claims filed under the Prog ram, e ach a lleging tha t an individual's a utism, or a simil ar disorder, w as ca used by the MMR vaccine, by thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines, or by both. To date, more than 5,000 such cases have been f iled with this court, and most of them rema in pending .

Inception of the Om nibu s Aut ism Procee ding To deal with this large group of cases involving a common factual issue-- i.e., whether these types of vaccinations c an cause autism--the Offic e of Special Masters (OSM) conducte d a number of informal meeting s in 2002, including both attorney s who represent many of the autism petitioners, and counsel for the Secre tary of Health and Human Service s, who is the responde nt in each of these cases. At those meeting s, the petitioners' representa tives proposed a specia l proce dure by which the OSM could most efficiently proce ss the autism claims. They proposed that the OSM utiliz e a two- step proce dure: fir st, conduct an inquiry into the general c ausation iss ue involved in these ca ses-- i.e., whether the vaccinations in question can cause autism and/or simil ar disorders, and if so in what circumstances- - and then, second, apply the evidence obtained in that general inquiry to the individual cases. They proposed that a team of petitioners' lawy ers be selec ted to represent the interests of the autism petitioners during the course of the general causa tion inquiry . They proposed that the proce eding begin with a lengthy period of discovery conce rning the general causa tion issue, followed by a desig nation of experts for each side, an evidentiar y hearing, and finally a ruling on the general causa tion issue by a specia l master. Then, the evidenc e conce rning the general causa tion issue, obtained a result of the g eneral proc eeding , would be applied to the individual ca ses. As a result of the meeting s discussed abov e, the OSM adopted a proce dure generally followi ng the format proposed by the petitioners' counsel. On July 3, 2002, the Chief Special Master, acting on behalf of the OSM , issued a document entitled the Autism Gene ral Order # 1. 13 That order set up a proce eding known as the Omnibus A utism Proce eding (hereinaf ter sometimes the \"OAP\") . In the OAP, a group of counsel selec ted from attorney s representing petitioners in the autism cases, know n as the Petitioners' Steer ing Committee (\" PSC\"), w as cha rged with obtaining and prese nting evidenc e conce rning the general issue of whether those vaccines can cause autism, and, if so, in what circumstances. The evidenc e obtained in tha t general inquiry was to be a pplied to the individual cases. Autism Gene ral Order #1, 2002 WL 31696785, at *3, 2002 U.S. Claims LEXIS 365, at *8. The Autism Gene ral Order #1 assig ned the initial responsibility for presiding over the Omnibus Autism Procee ding to the undersig ned. I n addition, I was assigne d responsibility for all of the individual Prog ram petiti ons in which it was alleg ed that an individual suff ered autism or a The Autism Gene ral Order #1 is published at 2002 WL 31696785, 2002 U.S. Claims13 LEXIS 365 (Fed.

I also note that the documents filed in the Omnibus Autism Procee ding are contained in a specia l file kept by the Clerk of this court, known as the \"Autism Master File.\" An electronic version of that File is maintained on this court's website. This electronic version contains a \"docke t sheet\" listing all of the items in the File, and also contains the complete text of most of the items in the File, with the exception of a few documents that are withheld from the website due to copy right considera tions or due to \u00a7 300aa- 12(d)( 4)(A) .

The indi vidual petitioners i n the vast majority of those cases requested that, in general, no proce eding s with respec t to their individual petitions be conducte d until af ter the conclusion of the OAP conce rning the general causa tion issue. The plan has been that once the OAP conce rning14 the general causa tion issue has conclude d, the Offic e of Special Masters would then deal specific ally with the individual cases. In a document filed into the Autism Master File on January 11, 2007, the Chief Special Master ma de proc edura l altera tions to t he Omnibus Autism Proceeding . He a dded two additional Special Masters, Denise Vowell and Patricia Campbell-Smith, to preside over the OAP along with myself. Since that time, we three specia l masters have jointly resolved procedural issues in the OAP, such as discovery motions. The individual Prog ram pe titions , on the other hand, have been divided among the three specia l masters. (Unde r the statutory scheme , a \"decision\" in an individual Prog ram c ase is to be issued by a single specia l master. \u00a7 300aa -12(d) (3)(A).) At the inception of the OAP in 2002, the pl an was that the P SC would engage in an init ial period of discovery , then proce ed to \"general PSC, howeve al delay s of the \"general causa tion\" hearing, in order to pursue additional discovery , and to wait for the results of certain studies. During the years 2002 throug h 2006, the petitioners made very extensive discovery reque sts. Ultimately , pursuant to those discovery requests, about 218,000 pages of documents, from files of a number of governme nt agencie s, were supplied to the PSC. In a document filed into the Autism Master File on July 18, 2006, the PSC proposed that a \"genera l causa tion\" hearing be conducte d in June of 2007. Subsequently , in an oral prese ntatio n during an OAP status confe rence held on December 20, 2006, and in a written proposal filed on Januar y 9, 2007, the P SC altere d that reque st in two major respe cts. First, the PSC proposed that their \"general causa tion\" evidenc e be divided into three separate theories : (1) that the combination of the MMR vaccine and thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines can cause autism; (2) that thimerosal- containing vaccines alone can cause autism; and (3) that the MMR vaccine alone can cause autism. Second, the PSC proposed that the PSC utiliz e a \"test case,\" to be tried in June of 2007, in order to prese nt the PSC's first general causa tion theory . The PSC proposed that the instant case, of Michelle Cedillo, be that first test case . Individual pe titioners ha ve alway s had the option to \"opt out\" of the OAP at any time. In14 other words, any petitioner who did not want to await the outcome of the OAP could opt to prese nt his own evidenc e conc erning causa tion to a specia l master, and a prompt ruling conce rning his own causa tion claim. A few petitioners have voluntarily dismiss ed their claims. A few others, acknow ledging that they do not have evidence demonstratin g causation, have asked that a special master file a \"ruling on the record,\" resulting in ruling s deny ing the claims. To date, howeve r, none of the petitioners in the OAP have soug ht to prese nt their own substantive causation evide nce, aside from the pe titioners in the six \"test ca ses\" de scribed be low at p. 15 fn.16. 122. Plan adopted for hearing t he petitioners' causation theories In response to the PSC's proposal, after discussion at a number of telephonic confe rences with counsel from both the PSC and responde nt, the three specia l masters developed a plan for hearing the PSC 's theorie s and evidence. The three special masters ag reed that the PSC could, as the PSC desired, divide its \"general causa tion\" evidenc e into theories, and prese nt the evidenc e conce rning the first theory by utiliz ing this Cedillo case as a \"test case\" in June of 2007. (See Autism Update issued Januar y 19, 2007.) Howeve r, the PSC was also instructed to choose two additional \"test cases\" falling within the same \"general causa tion\" e conce rning the first theory , along with all evidence specific to the particula r case of Michelle Ce dillo, in J une of 2007. Then, over the next seve ral months, the PSC would prese nt its case-spec ific evidenc e conce rning the two additional test cases. Each of the three specia l masters would then re solve one of the three test case s. (Id.) There after, under the plan that the three specia l masters adopted, a simil ar \"test case approa ch\" would be applied to each of the other two \"general causa tion\" theories of the PSC. That is, the PSC would desig nate three test cases as to each theory , and the three cases as to each theory would be decide d separ ately by the three specia l masters. (Ther efore, it was envisioned that a total of nine decisions in individual cases, three decisions as to each theory , would eventua lly be issued. But see fn. 16 below.) 3. Execution of Om nibu s Aut ism Procee ding plan to date Since adopting the general plan descr ibed above for hearing the petitioners' causa tion theories, the three specia l masters have put that plan into practice over the following months. This Cedillo case has bee n a major pa rt of that plan. Pursuant to that general plan, the parties filed, into the record of this Cedillo case, a vast amount of evidenc e, conce rning not only the specific s of Michelle Cedillo's case, but also the petitioners' first \"general causa ne and thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines can combine to cause autism. The two parties filed, in this Cedillo case alone, a total of 23 expert repor ts conce rning Michelle's case and/or the \"general causation\" issue. They have filed copies of 658 medical journal articles or medical text excerpts. During a three -week evidentiar y hearing held in June of 2007, the parties prese nted testimony from 17 witnesses, 16 of them experts. Much of the evidenc e filed into the record of this Cedillo case, of course , is relevant beyond this specific case. The P SC's intent was to present, in the contex t of this case, all of its evidenc e supporting the PSC's first general causation theory , i.e., that the MMR vaccine and thimerosal- containing vacc ines ca n combine to ca use autism; the responde nt's intent was to prese nt all of the responde nt's evidenc e in opposition to that theory . According ly, during the evidentiar y hearing in this Cedillo case, Special Masters Vowell and Campbell-Smith sat on the bench with me. Their role was not to de cide this pa rticular Cedillo case, but to he ar the general causation evidenc e provided 13by the expert witnesses, so that each of those two spec ial masters c ould apply that evidenc e to the individual test cases assig ned to them. After the evidentiar y hearing in this Cedillo case, evidentiar y hearings were then held in the other two test cases. Specifica lly, in one of those cases, Hazlehurst v. Secretary of HHS, No. 03- 654V, a hearing was held befor e Specia l Master Campbell-Smith on October 15-18, 2007, in Charlotte, North Car olina. In the other c ase, Snyder v . Secre tary of HHS , No. 01-162V, a hear ing was held on November 5-9, 2007, in Orlando, Florida , befor e Special Master Vowell. Both Special Master Vowell and I attended the Hazlehurst hearing as observe rs, to hear any expert evidenc e relevant to the \"general causa tion\" issue. Simi larly, both Special Master Campbell-Smith and I attended the Snyder hear ing a s observe rs, for the same purpose .15 Since t he conclusions of the evidentiar y hear ings in those three test cases, the parties have filed extensive post-hear ing br iefs in all three case s. It is also important to emphasize that because the three cases were tried as \"test cases,\" each involving both regarding \"general tion\" in the three cases have necessarily \"spilled over\" into one another . For example, much of the documentar y evidenc e and much of the hearing testimony in this Cedillo case, as discussed above, relates to \"general causa tion.\" Thus, copies of that \"general causa tion\" evidenc e from this Cedillo case have been introduced into the case files of the Hazlehurst and Snyder cases (at the reque st of the petitioners in those cases). Further, it developed that in the course of the Hazlehurst and Snyder cases, an additional amount of \"general causa tion\" evidenc e was also It is important to understand the roles of the three specia l masters who have jointly presided15 over the Omnibus Autism Procee ding over the past two years. The three of us have worke d together closely on procedural matters in the OAP, such as developing a general schedule for the petitioners' three theories of causa tion, acting upon the PSC's motions for general discovery relating to the OAP, etc. For example, we have joi ntly issued a ruling on a discove ry motion (see Ruling f iled into the Autism Master File on May 25, 2007), and jointly issued a number of proce dural order s conce rning the time for f iling docume nts into t he OAP. Howeve r, when it comes to deciding cases, it is clear under the statute that a ruling in an individual case is to be made by a single special master , based on the record of that individual case. \u00a7 300aa- 12(d)(3)(A). According ly, it should be understood that in deciding the three \"test cases\" under the PSC's first theory of l master has independe ntly analy zed the evidenc e of that master' s own case and is ruling independe ntly. While the \"general causa tion\" evidenc e is common to the three cases, each of us has analy zed that common evidenc e independe ntly of the other two; eac h has re ached his or her ow n conclusion. We did agree that we would issue our ruling s conce rning the \"entitlement\" issues in the three cases on the same day. That will enable any courts hearing any appea ls from our decisions to have the benef it of reading the analy ses of three different specia l masters concer ning the general causa tion evidenc e. The analyses of each of the three ruling s, howeve r, were underta ken separately and independe ntly. 14introduced into the records of those cases. The Cedillos have reque sted that I consider that \"general causa tion\" evidenc e from Hazlehurst and Snyder in resolving this Cedillo case. Thoug h responde nt argued to the contra ry (see \"Respondent' s Objection\" filed on October 12, 2007), I have grante d this reque st of the Cedillos, and, there fore, I have evalua ted that \"general causa tion\" evidenc e from Hazlehurst Snyder in resolving this case.16 4. Note conce rning usage of an \"om nibu s procee ding\" The Omnibus Autism Procee ding is not the first time tha t a specia l master of this court has utiliz ed an \"omnibus proce eding \" in order to proce ss a large group of Program cases. On several previous occasions, when faced with multiple cases involving a common issue of \"general causa tion,\" specia l masters of this court have worke d with petitioners' counsel and responde nt's counsel to devise specia l proce dures to more efficiently proce ss the cases. Those situations have been de scribed a s \"omnibus proce eding s.\" It is important to understand that the use of an \"omnibus proce eding \" does not chang e the fact that each individual petition is decide d individually, on its own merits . The Vaccine Act contains no provision for \"class action\" suits, or for any type of adjudication of more than one petition at a time. In each prior \"omnibus proce eding ,\" each individ ual case involved in the proce eding ultimately ended with its own \"decision,\" voluntary dismiss al, or other case- specific dispositi on of the case. An \"omnibus proce eding ,\" rathe r, is simply a device to organize the presentati on of evide nce, in cases with common \"general causa tion\" issues, in order to avoid duplication of effort. For example, if 100 individual petitioners each rely on Dr. Jones for his theory that Vaccine A cause s Disease B, Dr. Jones might need to repeat the same \"general causa tion\" Extensive steps have also been taken toward resolving the PSC's second general theory of16 causa tion in the OAP, i.e., the theory that thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines can, by themselves, directly cause autism by affecting the brain. Severa l weeks of evidentiary hearings were held during May and July of 2008, in which petitioners' counsel prese nted both their general specific causation evidenc e conce rning three test cases, the cases of King v. Secre tary of HHS , No. 03-584V, Mead tary of HHS , No. 03-1202V. The parties to those three cases are currently engaged in an extensive post-hear ing briefing proce ss, which will conclude in the late spring of 2009. There after, three separ ate decisions in those three cases will be issued by the three specia l masters. Concerning the third general theory of causa tion originally proposed by the PSC, howeve r, it appear s that the PSC will not be pre senting a third theory . It now appea rs that the evide nce tha t might have been prese nted as a third theory has already been prese nted as part of the PSC's first theory , in this Cedillo case as well as the Hazlehurst and Snyder cases. See the \"Notice \" filed by the PSC into the Autism Master F ile on August 7, 2008. Thus, the current plan for the OAP calls for a total of only six \"test ca ses,\" thre e for the PSC 's first theory , and thre e for the sec ond theory . To follow the course of the Omnibus A utism Proce eding , interested persons may regularly consult this court's website. See fn. 13 above . 15testimony at 100 differ ent hearings. But by using an \"omnibus proce eding ,\" opposing counsel and a specia l master may agree that it makes more sense to have Dr. Jones prese nt that \"general causa tion\" testimony once , and then have the transcr ipt of that testimony available to be introduced into the records of the other 99 cases. Moreove r, in practice, it may happen that after Dr. Jones prese nts his testimony in the first ca se and tha t case is decided, the parties in many of the other 99 cases may then settle those ca ses, without the nece ssity for a trial in eac h case . For example, I myself presided over an \"omnibu s proceeding \" conce rning rubella vaccine can cause chronic arthropa thy. I met with counsel representing petitioners whose cases involved that \"general causa tion\" issue, general causa filed and medical literature , and then prese nted oral testimony from the experts at an evidentiar y hearing. Based upon that evidenc e, I filed a published opinion concluding that the rubella vaccine can cause chronic arthropa thy under certain circumstances, if a case meets certain criter ia. In re Ahern , No. 90-1435V, 1993 WL 179430 (Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. Jan. 11, 1993). Based on that opinion, most of the pending or later- filed cases involving that general causa tion issue then resolved without the nee d for a n individual, case-spec ific trial. For example, in 70 such cases the pa rties re ached a settlement affording compensa tion to the petitioner, based upon the simil arity of those petitioners' situations to the criter ia outlined in the Ahern opinion. In 52 other cases, the petitioner either voluntarily dismiss ed the petition or abandone d prosec ution, a ppare ntly in light of the fact that the petitioner's case did not fit within the stated criter ia. In only 31 cases was I require d to make a formal ruling concerning whether the petitioner was entitled to an award, and even those cases involved either no trial or a limit ed trial, because the \"general causa tion\" evidenc e from the omnibus proce eding was available for application to those individual cases. (Ten of those 31 cases were resolved in favor of a petitioner, e.g., Long v. Secre tary of HHS 1995 WL 470286 (Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. July 24, 1995), while in 21 such cases the claim was denied, e.g., Awad v. Secre tary of HHS , No. 92-79V, 1995 WL 366013 (F ed. Cl. Spec. Ms tr. 5, Thus, the rubella/a rthropathy \"omnibus proce eding \" succe ssful proce dural device . Each individual case was ultimately resolved on its own merits , but they were resolved far more efficiently than if we had nee ded a f ull-blown trial, with multi ple expert witnesses, in ea ch ca se.17 Other prese nted of an evidentiar y hearing conce rning one individual case, and the specia l master decide s the test case. After that decision, the other cases involving the same general causa tion issue may then settle based on the outcome of the test case, and/or the In fact, during the above- descr ibed 2002 meeting s which resulted in the Omnibus Autism17 Procee ding, it was the petitioners' the rubella/a rthropathy \"omnibus proce eding \" be use d as a mode l for org anizing the a utism cases. 16general causa tion evidenc e develope d in the test case may be \"imported\" into the records of the other cases, fac ilitating the dec isions in t hose ca ses.18 In summary , the important point to note, conce rning the OAP and other \"omnibus proce eding s\" that have been used in the Prog ram, is that, even when an \"omni bus proceeding \" is utiliz ed, each individual case will still ultimately be resolved individually , according to the facts and circumstances of that individual c ase. The \"omnibus proce eding \" is simply a procedural tool that is employ ed to add e fficie ncy to the proce ss of prese nting e vidence and eva luating t evidence . 5. Additi onal procedural h istory of this C edillo case Petitioners filed their Prog ram petition in this Cedillo case on December 9, 1998. The case was originally assig ned to Special Master Elizabeth Wright, but, due to Special Master Wright's retire ment from the Offic e of Special Masters, the case was reassigne d to Special Master John Edwar ds on April 12, 1999. During the first two years after the fili ng of the petiti on, petitioners' counsel were primarily engaged in the tasks of (1) assembling and filing the voluminous medical records pertai ning to Michelle's illness, and (2) searching for one or more expert witnesses who could opine that Michelle's illness was vaccine-c aused. On October 31, 2000, the petitioners filed the expert repor t of Dr. Cindy Schneider , and on May 8, 2001, they filed the expert repor t of Dr. Marc el Kinsbourne, both repor ts contending that Michelle suffe red a \"Table Injury.\" Respondent then filed an opposing expert repor t, of Dr. Max Wiznitzer, on July 11, 2001. (None of those three expert repor ts were assig ned exhibit num bers.) On Januar y 14, 2002, howeve r, the petitioners filed a notice that they were chang ing their theory of the case from a \"Table Injury\" claim, as set forth in their two prior expert repor ts, to a \"causation-in-fa ct\" claim. Also, at that time discussions were being initiated that led to the creation of the Omnibus Autism Procee ding. Thus, after the OAP was created by the Chief Special Master' s Autism Gene ral Order #1 on July 3, 2002, this case, along with sever al hundred other cases, was transfe rred to my docket for proce ssing under the OAP. (Orde r of August 30, 2002.) On September 16, 2002, the petitioners filed in this case a \"Not ice to Defer Procee dings eding s in this case be deferred indefinitely , pending the outcome of the OAP. According ly, at the Cedillos' reque st, during the following four years I did not conduct case- specific proce eding s in this case. Note that the outcome of a \"test case\" is not formally \"binding \" on any other case. 18 Petitioners in subsequent cases are free to submit additional \"general causa tion\" evidenc e that was not prese nted in the test case. (That is certainly true with respe ct to these autism test cases.) Thus, a \"test case\" will be mos t useful in fostering the settlement or other resolution of additional cases if the parties do a compre hensive job of prese nting rning the causa tion issue in question. (It appears to me that the parties to this Cedillo case have, in g eneral, done suc h a compr ehensive job.) 17Then, as explained above, at the end of 2006 the PSC, along with the petitioners' own counsel, proposed that Michelle's case become the first \"test case\" in the OAP. (See p. 12-13 above; see also the Orde r filed in this case on Februar y 1, 2007.) There after, petitioners filed a number of expert repor ts on Februar y 20, 2007, and respondent filed a number of e xpert re ports on April 24, 2007. (A few additional expert repor ts were filed by both parties there after.) A three -week evidentiar y hearing, as previously noted, was held in June of 2007, and both parties there after filed a number of leng thy post-hear ing br iefs. Fur ther, petitioners causa tion\" evidenc e from the Hazlehurst and Snyder cases in resolving this Cedillo case. Thoug h responde nt argued to the contra ry (see \"Respondent' s Objection\" filed on October 12, 2007), I grante d that reque st of the Cedillos, and, thus, certain \"general causa tion\" evidenc e from Hazlehurst and Snyder has been formally introduced into the record of this ca se, via my Orde rs of F ebrua ry 4, 2009.20 6. The scope of the record Finally , I note that much time has passed since the conclusion of the evidentiar y hearing in this case in June of 2007. Howeve r, two major f actor s should be rec ognized. First, the completion of the three -week evidentiary hearing in this Cedillo case in June of 2007 did not mark the end of the prese ntations by the parties relevant to this case. Additional \"general causa tion\" expert testimony , much of it relevant to this Cedillo case, was prese nted during the evidentiar y hearings in the Hazlehurst and Snyder cases in the fall of 2007, with the Snyder hearing not concluding until November 9, 2007. Then, the parties' proce ss of briefing this Cedillo case extended into May of 2008. Finally , even at that point the petitioners in this case were still keeping alive their option to submit additional \"general causa tion\" evidenc e that they hoped to obtain from a British litigation file. It was not until July of 2008 that the Petitioners' Steering Those post-hea ring briefs w ill be cited as follows:19 Petitioners' Post-Hear ing B rief, f iled Supplemental ing B a s P2. Petitioners' Reply to ring Brief, 11, 2008-- -------cited a s P3. Petitioners' Supplemental Post-Hear ing Re ply Brief (Hazlehurst / Snyder Evidence ) filed Ma y 9, 2008--- ------------------------------------------------cited as P4. Respondent's Respondent's Supplemental Post-Hea ring Brief Reg / Snyder Evidence , filed April 4, 2008-- ---------------------------------------------------------cited as R2. Compact discs containing the \"general causa tion\" evidenc e from the Snyder and Hazlehurst20 cases were originally filed into the record of this case on August 1 and August 7, 2008, respe ctively . Howeve r, there were errors on those discs. According ly, all of the \"general causa tion\" evidenc e from Hazlehurst and Snyder was refiled , into the rec ord of this ca se, on F ebrua ry 4, 2009. 18Commi ttee in the OAP conclude d that they would not attempt to obtain further evidenc e from that British litigation. (See discussion at p. 83 below.) Thus, it was only at that time that I could, as I did on J uly 30, 2008, file an O rder decla ring that the evidentiar y record in this case w as closed. Second, it should be recognized that the evidentiar y record, based upon which I have decide d this case, is massive. This record dwar fs, by far, any evidentiar y record in any prior Prog ram case. A few statistics may give a flavor of the amount of material involved. The record contains about 7,700 pages of Michelle Cedillo's medical records alone. The parties filed a total of 23 expert repor ts in this Cedillo case alone, and a total of 50 expert repor ts including the Hazlehurst and Snyder cases. During the evidentiary hearings, 16 expert witnesses testified in Cedillo , four in Hazlehurst , and eight in Snyder totaled 2,917 pages in Cedillo , 1,049 Snyder , and 570 pages in Hazlehurst . The parties filed six post-hear ing briefs in this Cedillo case alone, totaling 462 pag es. In addition, the amount of medical literature filed into the records of the three cases was staggering . In the Cedillo case alone, the parties filed a total of 658 medical journal article s, medical textbook excerpts, or other items of medical literature . Many more such documents were filed into the Hazlehurst and Snyder cases, so that a total of 939 differ ent items of medical literature were filed into the three case files (even after excluding from the count those documents that were filed in more than one case). Some of those items were extremely lengthy. (E.g., Ex. JJ, 163 pages; Ex. L, Att. 1, 617 pages; Ex. BB, Att. 94, 306 pages.) I have not attempted to calculate the total number of pages of those 939 documents, but clearly the total runs well into the tens of thousands of pages. And most of those docume nts are densely packe d with dif ficult, technica l information, so that study ing e ven a medica l journal article that is only a few pag es long can r equire a leng thy time period. Further, the complexit y of the materia l involved here is daunting as well. The medical records, ex pert testim ony, and medical literature involve many differ ent subspecia lties of biology and medicine, including neurolog y, virolog y, y, genetics, a nd epidemiolog y. In sum, the massive nature of the evidentiar y record, along with the complexit y and varie ty of the scienti fic issues involved, necessitated the lengthy time period spent in prepa ring this Decision. IV ISSUES TO BE DECIDED As noted above , the petit ioners in this case do not c ontend that Michelle suf fered a \" Table Injury .\" Their contention, instead, is one of \"causation-in-fa ct,\" also known as \"actual causa tion.\" 21 Petitioners alleg ed a Table Injury , but on Januar y 14, 2002, they filed a notice that21 (continued...) 19The petitione rs and their expert witnesses contend that Michelle's chronic gastrointestinal symptoms and her autism were cause d by a combination of the thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines that she received during her early months of life and the MMR vaccination that she received on December 20, 1995. Petitioners' overa ll causa tion theory in this case can be summarized as follows: (1) The thimerosal-22 containing vaccines that Michelle received during her first 16 months of life weakened her immune system. (2) That weakening of the immune system allowed the measles virus contained in the MMR vaccine to persist within Michelle's body . (3) The persisting vaccine-stra in measles virus damag ed Michelle's dig estive system, causing her gastrointestinal difficulties. (4) The persisting vacc ine- strain measles virus also damag ed Michelle's brain, causing her autism, mental retardation, and seizures. The responde nt's expert witnesses, on the other hand, disag reed strenuously with most parts of petitioners' overa ll theory . Respondent's experts do not dispute that the fever and rash that Michelle experience d about one week after the MMR vaccination was a reaction to that vaccination. But those experts do not believe that any of Michelle's chronic symptoms--including23 her autism, which they believe to have been evident even prior to the MMR vaccination in question-- were vac cine- cause d. According ly, in the following sections of this De cision, I will discuss the differe nt parts of petitioners' theory . In section V, I will explain that petitioners failed to demonstrate either that24 (...continued)21 they were chang ing their theory of the case from a Table Injury claim to a \"causation-in-fa ct\" claim. In science, the words \"theor y\" and \"hypothesis\" may have differ ent meaning s. A22 \"hypothesis\" is an idea or supposition that is proposed to explain an event or phenomenon. (Tr. 1731A; Dorland's Illustrated Medic al Dictionary 899 (30th ed. 2003) (hereinaf ter Dorland's ).) The term \"theory ,\" on the ot her hand, can be us ed in scienc e to descr ibe a doctrine or set of principles that has been developed , based on observations , to explain a set of data. (Dorland's at 1893.) Thus, the term \"theor y\" may imply a doctrine that has been developed and supported by evide nce, in contra st to a \"hy pothesis\" that is merely an untested idea. In this strict scientifi c nomenclature , then, the petitioners in in ordinary everyday use of the English language, the word \"theor y\" is often used to descr ibe what a scient ist would call a \"hypothesis.\" Moreove r, the parties to this case have usually referred to the petitioners' \"theor y\" or \"theories\" conce rning causa tion. According Decision, I will also refer to petitioners' \"theor y\" or \" theories\" conce rning causa tion. The fact that those acute symptoms were likely cause d by her MMR va ccina tion doe s not23 mean that Michelle is entitled to a Vaccine Act award on account of those symptoms, because those particula r symptoms di d not last for more tha n six months. See \u00a7 300aa- 11(c) (1)(D)(i) . As to each of to have been vaccine-c aused, it24 (continued...) 20thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines can harm infant immune systems in general, or that Michelle's own thimerosal-c ontaining vaccinations did harm her own immune system. In section VI, I will explain why I have found that the testing for the prese nce of the measles virus in both Michelle and in other autistic children, on which the petitioners rely with respe ct to all of their causa tion claims, was unreliable . In section VII, I will explain that petitioners failed to demonstrate either that the MMR vaccine can contribute to the causa tion of autism in general, or that Michelle's own MMR vaccination did contribute to her own autism. I n section VI II, I will ex plain that petitioners fa iled to demonstrate either that the MMR vaccine can contrib ute to the causa tion of gastrointestinal dysfunction in general, or that Michell e's own MMR vaccination did contribute to her own gastrointestinal problems. I n section I X, I will ex plain that the evidenc e conc erning the ca usation of regressive autism combined with gastrointestinal dysfunction in some individuals does not offer persua sive evidenc e that either or both conditions can be vaccine-c aused. In section X, I will explain that petitioners have not demonstrated that Michelle's MMR vaccina tion contributed to the causa tion of either her mental retardation or her seizure disorder. In section XI, I will discuss an argument conce rning Michelle's treating physicians. In section XII, I will discuss an argument of petitioners conce rning whether Michelle's case is simil ar to certain Prog ram cases. In section XIII, I will explain how my previously -stated analy sis of petitioners' contentions fits within the context of the legal test set forth in Althen v. Secre tary of HHS , 418 F.3d 1274 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Finally , in section XIV I will set forth some conc luding c omments. It may be noted that I could have elected not to disc uss and re solve, in this Decision, all of the issues raised by petitioners in this case. For example, I find the first part of the petitioners' theory of this case--i.e., their contention that thimerosal-c ontainin g vaccines damag ed Michelle's immune system, there by making it possible for the vaccine-stra in measles virus to persist within Michelle's body --to be essen tially unnecessary to the rest of their causation arg ument. That i s, if petitioners were able to persuade me that the vaccine-stra in measles virus did likely persist in Michelle's body and cause damag e to either (or both) her brain or gut, I would compensa te such damag e. It would not matter why the measles vaccine-stra in virus was able to persist; whether that persistenc e was the result of thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines or for some other reason would be irrele vant. Theref ore, resolution of that part of petitioners' theory is not strictly necessary for resolution of this case . Howeve r, as e xplained above , this case desig nated by the Petitioners' Steering Commi ttee (PSC) Autism Procee ding as a \"test case.\" The PSC desires that the specia l masters test and evalua te its causa tion theories, in order to provide guidance for the other pending autism cases. The refore, I will evaluate tha t contention of the pe titioners. As another example, I note that petitioners' expert witness who testified that Michell e's autism was cause d by her MMR vaccinatio n, Dr. Marc el Kinsbourne, explained that he was (...continued)24 is the petitioners' burden to demonstrate that it is \"more probable than not\" that the vaccination was a substan tial factor in causing that condition. See \u00a7 300aa- 13(a) (1)(A). Under that standard, the existence of a fact must be shown to be \"more probable than not.\" In re Winship , Harlan, J ring). 21assuming the accuracy of the hotly -disputed labora tory test that purported to find vaccine-stra in measles virus in Michelle's intestinal tissue. Since I have found that test result to be unreliable (see pp. 77-78 below), the foundation for Dr. Kinsbourne' s opinion has disappea red, and, there fore, there is no necessity that I evalua te the soundness of Dr. Kinsbourne' s opinion in other respe cts. Neve rtheless, I have chosen to include an evalua tion of Dr. Kinsbourne' s analy sis, f or the purpose of providing guidance for the othe r pending autism cases. In other words, I have attempted in this Decision to provide a full analy sis of all of the petitioners' major causa tion theories raised in this case, whether necessary for resolution of this case or not, in order to provide g uidance for the r emaining autism cases. V PETIT IONERS HAVE NOT DEMONSTRATED EIT HER THAT THIMEROS AL-CONTAINING VACCIN ES CAN HARM INF ANT IMMU NE SYST EMS IN GENERAL, OR THAT SUCH VACCIN ES DID HARM M ICHELL E'S IMMUNE SYSTEM The first part of petitioners' overa ll causa tion theory is their contention that thimerosal- containing vaccines damag ed Michelle's immune system, thereby making it possible for the vaccine- strain measle s virus to persist within Michelle's body .25 First, as noted above, I observe that I find this portion of petitioners' theory to be essentially unnece ssary to the rest of their causa tion argument. That is, if petitioners were able to persua de me that the vaccine-stra in measles virus did likely persist in Michelle's body and cause damag e to either (or both) her brain or gut, I would compensa te such damag e. It would not matter why the vaccine- strain m easle s virus was able to persi st. There fore, resolution of this part of petitioners' theory is not strictly neces sary for resolution of this case. Howeve r, as explained above, this case was desig nated as a \"test case,\" to provide guidance for the other pending autism cases. There fore, I will evalua te this contention of the petitioners, and explain why I find that the evidenc e in the record does not support either the proposition that thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines can damag e immune systems in general , or the proposition that such vac cines did damag e Miche lle's own immune sy stem. A. The evidence does not suppor t the general proposit ion th at thi merosal-containin g vacc ines can dam age infants' im mune system s. Petitioners have relied upon the opinions of certain expert witnesses, along with references to a number of items of medical literature , for their general theory that the thimerosal contained in The measles virus exists natura lly in its ordinary , \"wild,\" full-streng th form. The MMR25 vacci nation, on the other hand, utiliz es an intentionally weake ned (\"attenuated\" ) version of the measles virus. (Ex. JJ, p. 40; Ex. V, p. 3; Tr. 2774.) I will refer to that version of the measles virus, contained in the MMR vac cination, as vaccine-stra vaccines can damag e an infant's immune system. Respondent offers the testimony of expert witnesses, and references to medical literature , in response . After a thoroug h revie w, I find that the evidenc e offere d by responde nt is substantiall y more persuasive conce rning this issue. I find that the evidenc e falls far short of demonstrating that it is \"more probable than not\" that thimerosal- containing 1. Thim erosal in vaccines Thimerosal is a compound consisting of merc ury and other components (49.6% merc ury by weig ht) that has been used in va ccine s, and in othe r biolog ical and pha rmac eutical pr oducts, the 1930s. (Ex. JJ , p. 36; Ex . 55, Tab A, p. 1.) It is used, in ve ry small a mounts, a s a prese rvative in multi-dose vials of vaccine, in order to bacte rial contamination. (Ex. JJ, pp. 36-37.) Thimerosal has been used in more than 30 vaccines licensed in the United States. During the 1990s, it was used in a number of vaccines given to infants in the United States, including the diptheria/tetanus/pertussis (\"DTP\"), hemophilus influenza (\"Hib\"), and hepatitis B 37.)26 Michelle Cedillo received thimerosal-containing vaccinations on a number of occasions. She received hepatitis B vaccinations on three occasions--in the hospital shortly after birth; on September 27, 1994; a nd on Marc h 8, 1995. (Ex. 23, pp. 45, 63; Ex. 18, p. 1.) She re ceive d both DTP vaccinations and Hib vaccinations on four occasions: October 31, 1994; D ecember 27, 1994; Marc h 8, 1995; and Marc h 15, 1996. (Ex. 18, p. 1; Ex . 8, pp. 1, 4, 5.) 2. General analysis of testim ony of Dr. Aposhian and Dr. Brent Concerning this issue, the petitioners rely primarily on the opinion of Dr. H. Vaske n Aposhian, Ph.D., who is a profe cellular biology , pharma cology, and toxicolog y at the University of Ariz ona. (Ex. 56, p. 1.) Dr. Apos hian submitted a lengthy expert repor t detailing many examples of how merc ury, in its various forms, can be very toxic (poisonous) to humans. (Ex. 55.) At the hear ing, he testified that he could see a \"possible path\" by which the merc ury in thimerosal-conta ining vaccines could cause \"immune disreg ulation and immune suppression in humans.\" (Tr. 109-110.) He also testified that the merc ury that Michelle Cedillo received in her thime rosal-containing vaccines \"could be a substantial contributing factor to the onset of [her] imm une disfunction.\" ( Tr. 114.) Dr. Aposhian raised a number of points in support of his conclusion that thimerosal- containing vaccines can damag e infants' immune systems. He relied on the evidenc e outlined in his expert repor t, demonstrating that merc ury in various forms can be toxic to humans. (Ex. 55; Tr. 67- 88.) He pointed out that the amount of mercury received by infants from thimerosal-c ontaining Between 1999 and 2002, thimerosal was phased out of most of the vaccines commonly26 given to infants in the United States. (Ex. JJ, pp. 37-39.) Howeve r, thimerosal rema ins in influenza vaccines, which a re commonly given to infants. (Ex. J J, p. 38, Table 1.) 23vaccines exceeds a \"reference-dose\" standard develope d by the Environmental Protec tion Age ncy for a type of merc ury known as methy lmercur y. (Tr. 112-113.) He descr ibed the theory that autism might be caused in some children because they suffe r from a \"mer cury efflux disorder\" --i.e., an inability to excrete merc ury as efficiently as most children do, so that a resulting build-up of merc ury in the body might damag e the f unction of the body 's cells, including ce lls of the immune system. (Tr. 70, 97-106, 197-98.) Dr. Aposhian also suggested that autistic children may be autistic because they are genetica lly \"hypersusc eptible\" to mer cury, leaving them vulnera ble to immune system damag e whe n exposed to thi merosal. ( Tr. 92, 115, 129-31.) Respondent counter ed Dr. Aposhian chief ly with the expert repor t and hearing testimony of Dr. Jeffrey Brent, M.D., Ph.D., who is a physician and Clini cal Professor of Pediatrics and Interna l Medicine at the University of Colorado. (Ex. M, p. 1; Tr. 2296, 2302-03.) Although Dr. Aposhian has excellent credentials and experience in the area of \"toxi colog y\"--that is, the study of the adver se effects of chemica l substances on living systems (Tr. 2310)-- Dr. Brent has even more impressive qualifica tions to opine in this area. Dr. Brent, unlike Dr. Aposhian, is a medical doctor. Further,27 Dr. Brent is a medical toxicologist , which means that he has specific and extensive medical training conce rning the effects of poisons on the human system. (Tr. 2311.) He is one of about 250 board- certified medical toxicolog ists in the United States (Tr. 2311-12), and he has experience in treating children w ith actual mer cury toxicity. (Tr. 2306- 2308.)28 Dr. Brent testified persua sively that the available evidenc e does not justify a conclusion that the thimerosal contained in childhood vaccines can damag e infants' immune systems. Dr. Brent did not dispute that merc ury in some of its forms, at certain dosag es, can be toxic, or even fatal, to humans. But he stressed that Dr. Aposhian was inappropria tely relying on instances of merc ury toxicity involving merc ury in forms quite differ ent from the ethylmercur y found in thimerosal, and on instances involving exposure to vastly greater amounts of merc ury than the small amounts used as pre serva tives in vacc ines. As to the forms of mercu ry, Dr. Brent explained that the many differ ent types of merc ury have toxologic al proper ties quite differ ent from one another , so that it is inappropria te to generalize, as Dr. Aposhian does, from one form of merc ury to another . (Ex. L, pp. 9-15; Tr. 2342A-43.) Dr. Brent quoted a medical toxicity text which noted that \"no other metals better illust rate the diversity of ef fect cause d by differ ent che mical spec ies than does mer cury.\" (Tr . 2342-43.) Prog ram decisions have often noted that one factor to be considered , in evaluating27 conflicting expert testimony , is the experience and cr edentials of the respe ctive experts. See, e.g., Hopkins v. Secre tary of HHS , 84 Fed. Cl. 11 , (F ed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. Oct. 29, 2008) . Those instances of merc ury toxicity involved merc ury in forms other than thimerosal, and28 did not involve autism. (Tr. 2306-08.) 24In this regard, Dr. Brent pointed out one specific problem with Dr. Aposhian's theory , in which Dr. Aposhian relied on a \"refer ence dose\" standard that was develope d with regard to a specie s of mercury known as \"methy lmercur y.\" Dr. Bre nt expl ained that a s soon as thimerosal in a vaccine enters the body , it breaks down into its component par ts, and the merc ury released f rom the thimerosal compound is the specie s of merc ury known as \"ethy lmercur y.\" (Tr. 2314.) Dr. Brent pointed out that ethylmercur y has toxologic al proper ties that are very differ ent from methy lmercur y, so that it was quite inappropria te for Dr. Aposhian, in devising his theory that thimerosal can damag e the immune system, to rely on the \"reference dose\" standard for a different type of merc ury, methy lmercur y. (Ex. L , pp. 10-14; Tr. Brent also testified that Aposhian's causa tion theory erroneously ignor ed the \"dose- response \" principle, a foundation of medical toxicolog y. Dr. Brent explained that almost any substance can be toxic if administered in high enoug h quantities, while substances that are toxic at high doses can be harmless or even benef icial at low doses. (Ex. L, p. 6; Tr. 2335-46.) He noted that even water can be fatally toxic to huma ns at extreme leve ls. (Tr. 2336.) D r. Brent a cknowledg ed that merc ury in large amou nts, far above the amounts involved in thimerosal in vaccines, can be toxic to humans. (Tr. 2421.) He testified, howeve r, that the historical examples of merc ury toxicity upon which Dr. Aposhian relies involved vastly greater amounts of merc ury, compar ed to the amount of ethylmercur y contained in the thimerosal in vaccines. For example, Dr. Brent pointed to three studies cited by Dr. Aposhian in which the subjects had their merc ury blood levels measure d at approximately 1,000 microg rams per liter, 150,000 microg rams per liter, and 500,000 microg rams per liter, respe ctively . This c ontrasted sharply to the mean merc ury blood level of 1.6 microg rams per liter found in one group of two-month-olds after receiving thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines. (Tr. 2341-42; R. Tr. Ex. 17, p. 24; Pet. Ex . 55, Tabs P, L L, MM.) Dr. Brent also criticized the relianc e of Dr. Aposhian, in forming his theory that thimerosal can cause human i mmune system dysfunction, on in vitro studies. Dr. Bre nt explained that while in vivo studies are studies that are done on living humans or other animals, in vitro studies are studies in which a cell or other entity is removed from a living be ing a nd studied in a \"pe tri dish\" or other labora tory setting. (Ex. L, pp. 6-7; Tr. 2320-21.) He explained that what happens to a cell in a laboratory when exposed to a chemica l might be completely differ ent from the effect that such chemica l might have on a simil ar cell if that cell was part of a living being . (Ex. L, pp. 7-9; Tr. 2320-23.) Dr. Brent noted that in vitro studies are useful for generating hypothese s about toxicity, but that any hypotheses generated by in vitro experiments must be considere d as purely specula tive until in vivo testing can be done. (Ex. L, pp. 7-9; Tr. 2320-24.) In this regard, Dr. Brent noted that Dr. Aposhian, in forming his theory that thimerosal causes immunosuppression, had relied 25particula rly on certain studies by Goth and Agrawal. Dr. Brent opined that those two studies, both29 30 in vitro studies, did not offer signific ant support for the proposition that thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines could ca use human immunosuppression. (Ex. L , pp. 8-9; Tr. 2324-34.) Dr. Brent noted many problems with the Goth study. Not only was the study an in vitro study , but it invol ved mouse c ells, not human cells. Dr. B rent e xplained that the results of animal studies cannot be extrapolated to huma ns, but a re useful mainly to generate hypothese s for human testing. ( Tr. 2325, 2333-34.) Further, the mouse cells were ex posed t o thimerosal i tself, wherea s human cells in the body would be exposed not to thimerosal , but ethylmercur y soon after enter ing the body . (Ex. L, p. 8; Tr. 2325-26.) In addition, Dr. Brent testified, the amount of thimerosal to which the mouse cells were exposed was greatly higher than the amounts of ethylmercur y to which human cells would be exposed in an infant vaccinated with thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines. (Tr. 2326-30.) He also pointed out other problems with the Goth study . (Tr. 2330- 31; Ex . L, p. 8.) Dr. B rent pointed out similar problems with the Ag rawal study . (Ex. L , pp. 8-9; Tr. 2331- 33.) The A grawal study , again, was a n in vitro study . The Ag rawal study did involve human, not animal cells, but the cells, as in the Goth study , were exposed to thimerosal , not ethylme rcury . (Tr. 2331; Ex. L, p. 8.) In addition, as with the Goth study , in the Agrawal study the cells were exposed to thimerosal i n amounts far greater than would be comparable to the ex posure of human ce lls to ethylmercur y after receipt of thimerosa l-containing vacc ines. hype rsusceptibili ty\" Petitioners have suggested that there may exist a group of humans who, unlike most humans, are genetica lly \"hypersusc eptible\" to merc ury, leaving them vulnera ble to immune system damag e when exposed to ethylmercur y. Dr. Aposhian's testimony seeme d to asser t this theory . (Tr. 92, 115, 129-131.) After revie w, howeve r, I find that petitioners have failed to demonstrate that this theory has any validity . First, neither Dr. Aposhian nor any other of petitioners' experts pointed to any scientific research that even suggests that such \"hypersusc eptibility \" exists. Rather, petitioners' experts31 Samuel Goth et Q.) Anshu Agrawal et al., Thimerosal Induce s TH2 Responses via Cytokine30 Secre tion Human De ndritic Cells , 81 J . LEUKOCYTE BIOLOGY 474 (2007). ( Ex. 55, Tab A.) Of course , as a matter of law, there is no requireme nt that a petitioner support his medical31 theory , or any individual part there of, with medical literature . Capizzano v. Secre tary 418 F.3d 1274, 1279-80 (Fed. Ci r. (continued...) 26seem to be merely speculating in suggesting that such a \"hypersusc eptibil ity\" phenomenon might explain why only a small proportion of the children who are exposed to thimerosal end up suffe ring from autism. For example, Dr. Aposhian, instead of pointing to any evidenc e of human \"hypersusc eptibility \" to thimeros al or ethylmerc ury, attempted to rely upon an analog y to a condition known as acrodynia or \"Pink Disease .\" Acrodynia was cause d, in the early part of the 20 centur y,th by infants' exposure to a differ ent form of merc ury, merc uric chloride, in teething powder s. Noting that the condition seeme d to develop in only some of the children exposed to the merc uric chloride, Dr. Aposhian suggested that might be because the suffe ring children were \"hypersusc eptible\" to merc ury. (See Ex. 55, pp. 8-9; Tr. 92; P. Tr. Ex. 1 at 16-17. ) Dr. Brent, howeve r, testified that acrodynia was more likely to have been a dose-re lated condition than an example of genetic hypersusc eptibility . That is, he explained tha t measure ments of urine merc ury levels in vic tims of acrodynia showed that those who suffe red the disease had been exposed to particularly high levels of merc uric chloride; this indicates that acrodynia was suffe red by children that were exposed to more merc ury, rathe r than by children who happene d to be more susceptible to merc ury. (Ex. L, pp. 22-23; Tr. 2365-68, 2483.) Dr. Brent also testified that there exists no suppo rt in the medical literature for the petitioners' \"hypersusc eptibility \" theory , despite intensive study of the autistic population. (Tr. 2363-64, 2460-61.) Further, he explained that in instances in the past in which researchers have deter mined that some persons are more genetica lly susceptible than others to certain substances, the specific ge ne involved was \"easily identified\" by genetic r esearchers; in contrast, no such spe cific gene ha s been ide ntified for the ed hy persusc eptibility (...continued)31 In appropr iate circumstances, medical opinion plus circumstantial evidenc e can be enoug h, without medical literature support, to demonstrate causa tion- fact. Howeve r, in considering a medical theory , support for that theory from medical litera ture in pee r-reviewe d journals may be a positive fa ctor, while a lack of such support for such theory in me dical literature may, in some circumstances, be considere d as a f actor raising doubt about the validity of the theor y. (See the case s cited at pp. 122-23, be low.) In this case, as to this \"genetic hypersusc eptibility \" theory of petitioners, the main reason that I have rejected it is that Dr. Aposhian's reasoning conce rning the theory was unpersua sive, while Dr. Brent's reasoning was convincing . The absenc e of medical literature support for the theory is simply an additional point casting doubt upon the theory . This pa ttern will pr ove to be rning a number of petitioners' causa tion theor discussed be low. Wit h respe ct to eac h of those theor ies, the main reason to reject the theory is that the testimony of the responde nt's witnesses was substantially more persua sive. Where appropr iate, I may also note that the petiti oners' expert failed to point to any literature supporting the theory . Such a lack of support, howeve r, is, in every instance, only one factor in the rejection of the theory . I do not mean to suggest, conce rning any point, that there is a requireme nt of literature support, or that a la ck of litera ture support by itself condemns a theory . 27Respondent also offered another expert conce rning the a purported genetic hypersusc eptibility to thimer osal. Dr. Edwin Cook, M.D., is a psychiatrist (a utism i s considere d a psychiatric condition) who, in a medical career that began in 1981, has specia lized in the treatment of autistic children and in genetic research related to autism. (Tr. 1466-80.) Dr. Cook, like Dr. Bre nt, testified t hat he was aware of no evidenc e to support the theory that some persons may be genetica lly hypersusc eptible to thimerosal. ulation.\" (Tr . 1505.) In sum, the only support that Dr. Aposh ian was able to provide for petitioners' \"genetic hypersusc eptibility \" theory was his analog y to acrodynia, but Dr. Brent pointed to data indicating that acrodynia was not likely an example of hypersusc eptibility . Thus, conce rning this issue, I conclude that the testimony of Drs. B rent a nd Cook was per suasive, and tha t the testimony of Dr. A poshian was not. I conclude that the petitioners' \"genetic hypersusc eptibility \" theory has not been shown32 to have a ny validity . 4. \"Mercury e fflux disorder\" theory Dr. Aposhian testified that autism in some individuals, perha ps including Michelle Cedillo,33 may be cause d by a \"mer cury efflux disorder,\" meaning that the child is unable to excrete merc ury as efficiently as most children do, and a resulting build-up of merc ury in the body damag es the function of the body 's cells, including cells in the immune system. Dr. Aposhian stated that the problem i n the \"mer cury efflux disorder\" is that the children \"ca n't get rid of mercury in the cell. They can take merc ury into the cell, but they can't get rid of it. That's true for the brain, it's true for about all the tissues in the body ,\" including the immune system. (Tr. 102A.) Thus, under Dr. Aposhian's theory , the merc ury rema ins in the cells, causing cell dysfunction. (Tr. 94A-106A, 197A-202.) Dr. Brent, howeve r, testified effectively that petitioners' \"mercury efflux disorder\" theory is highly dubious. (Tr. 2351-63.) He noted that such a disorder is not recognized by the medical I also note that a committee of the Institut e of Medicine analy zed the available evidenc e32 conce rning the theory that such a genetic hypersusc eptibility to merc ury might exist. (Ex. JJ, pp. 138-39.) (For a full descr iption of the Institut e of Medicine and the repor ts issued by that body that are relevant to this case, see p. 124 below.) The committee conclude d that it could find \"no corroborating data\" to support such theory . (Ex. J J, p. 139.) It is not clear whether Dr. Aposhian's theories overla pping theories. He may have been suggesting that those who are \"genetica lly hypersusc eptible\" are the same as those who have a \"mer cury efflux disorder.\" Howeve r, whether those two theories are separ ate or not, I was not persua ded that either theory has any validity at all. 28community . (Tr. 2361-62.) He also pointed to sever e problems with the studies on which34 Dr. Aposhian principally relied for his \"mer the Holmes and Bradstree t35 2003 studies.36 In the Holmes study (Ex. 55, Ta b X), the investiga tors measure d the merc ury levels in the hair of autistic children and non-autistic \"contr ol\" children, and found lower levels in the autistics, which led them to suggest that autistics may have a problem in excreting merc ury. Dr. Brent, howeve r, testified t hat the re sults and conclusions of the Holmes study failed to make sense for a number of reasons. (Ex. L, pp. 19-21; Tr. 2351-54.) Among those reasons was the fact that the merc ury hair levels found in the autistic individuals tested by Holmes actua lly were square ly within the normal range of what other testing indicated would be the normal level of merc ury in hair in U.S. children. (Ex. L, pp. 19-20; Tr. 2351-53.) Dr. Brent explained that the Holmes investiga tors' conclusion, that the autistics had abnormally low levels of merc ury in their hair, was cause d by the fact that the non-autistic children used as \"contr ols\" in the study , for some unexplained reason, had hair merc ury levels about 15 times the normal rate found in a previous huge study of Americ an children' s hair. (Ex. L , p. 20; T r. 2350-51.) Dr. B rent found tha t this unex plained devia tion from the prior a ccepted merc ury hair leve l data made the Holmes study extremely suspect. Dr. Brent explained further that when two other groups of researchers performed studies simil ar to the Holmes study , both found no signifi cant difference s in the merc ury hair levels betwee n the autistics and controls studied. (Ex. L, p. 20; Tr. 2462-66.) I find that at least one of those studies, the Kern study , supports Dr. Brent's testimony in that regard. He also discounted another37 study which Dr. Aposhian had descr ibed as supporting the Holmes study . Dr. Brent stated that this Of course , petitioners are not require d to demonstrate that any of their medical theories are34 recognized or accepted by the medical community . Capizzano , 440 F.3d at 1325. A new theory can be shown to be probable , via expert testimony and circumstantial evidenc e, even though not recognized generally. Id. However, whether a theory has found acceptanc e in the medical community can be one factor, to be weig hed along with other factors, in deter mining whether a theory is reliable or probable.

In that Bradstree t study , urinary merc ury excretion was measure d in groups of autistic children and non-autistic \"contr ol\" children, after the subjects underw ent a proce ss known as \"chelation.\" The authors repor ted highe r merc ury conce ntrations in the urine of the autistics, concluding there from that autistic children have a decreased ability to excrete merc ury. Dr. Brent, howeve r, explained that the study suffe red from so many methodologic al and conce ptual errors that it essentially provided no useful information whateve r. (Ex. L, pp. 21-22; Tr. 2356-61.) As one example, he noted that urinary excretion following chelation has been shown to be an inaccurate measure of merc ury body burden. (Ex. L , p. 22.) He also noted that the way in which the controls were selec ted for the study was problematic. (Ex. L, p. 22; Tr. 2358.) Additionally , Dr. Brent testified that the study authors made a major mistake in failing to measure the urinary merc ury levels in individual subjects prior to chela tion (Tr. 2359-60), and even Dr. Aposhian himself acknow ledged that he would have done the study differ ently in that regard (Tr. 166). Dr. Brent descr ibed problems with the statistical me thodology that the study authors used. (Ex. L, p. 22; T r. 2358.) He also stated the Bradstree t 2003 study was published in a \"fringe\" medical journal. (Tr.39 2360.) Finally, Dr. Brent noted that another research group performed a study simil ar to Bradstree t's, but without the methodologic al flaws, and published it in a \"legitimate\" medical journal. (Id.) That study , in contra st to Bradstre et's, found no difference betwee n autistics and40 controls ter chelation. (Tr . 2360-61.) Lin-Wen Hu et al., Neutron Activation Analysis of Hair Samples for the Identification of38 Autism , 89 TRANSACTIONS AM. NUCLEAR SOCIETY 681 (2003). (Ex. L, Att. 28.) Dr. Aposhian referred to this study as the \" MIT study .\" (Tr . 98.) Dr. Brent referred to the journal that published the Bradstree t 2003 article as a \"fringe\"39 journal because that journal is not \"indexed\" by the National Library of Medicine. (Tr. 2360.) An \"indexed\" medical journal is one that is included in databa ses assembled for medical-scientific literature search engines. (Ex. BB, p. 6.) A journal may not be indexed because it is new, or because it is thought to be \"insuffic iently rigorous\" to be reliable . (Id.) Respondent's expert Dr. Ward stated that non-indexed journals are \"generally ignor ed by scientists as source s of reliable scientific information.\" (Id.) He also noted that the journal in which the Bradstree t 2003 article was published, althoug h in opera tion for more tha n 50 y ears, is not an indexed journal. ( Id.) Sarah Soden et al., 24-Hour Provoke d Urine Excretion Test for Heav y Metals in Children40 with Autism and Typically Developing Controls , A Pilot Study , 45 CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 476 (2007). ( Ex. OO.) 30Dr. Aposhian also relied (Tr.101- 03) on . In that study , the researchers41 purported to find that merc ury levels i n teeth of autist ic children were gre ater than i n non-autisti c controls. That finding , they asser ted, indicated that autist ic children have difficulty excreting merc ury. Dr. Brent, howeve r, opined that Dr. Aposhian's relianc e on the Adams study was misplaced. Dr. Bre nt testified that the st udy was small, that there were problems with the study's statistical methodology , and that evalua tion of merc ury levels in teeth was a questionable technique, since tee th are not a norma l excretory organ for merc ury. (Tr. 2467- 69.) I find that Dr. Brent's testimony on this point was persua sive, and that the testimony of Dr. Aposhian was not. I conclude that the Holmes, Bradstree t 2003, and Adams studies are of42 doubtful reliability , and that the contra ry studies cited by Dr. Brent provide better evidenc e. I43 conclude that the petitioners have failed to show that their \"mer cury efflux disorder\" theory has any validity .44 5. Petitioners' other general citation s to m edical literature In their briefs, petitioners have stressed that they have pointed to much medical literature indicating in general that merc ury, in some forms and dosages , can be toxic to humans. (P1, pp. 207- 211.) I have examined all of the items of medical literature cited by petitioners, and those items do contain some evidenc e indicating that merc ury in some forms and dosag es can be toxic. Howeve r, a thoroug h examination of the record makes it clear that there is no evidenc e, beyond Dr. Aposhian's own asser tion, that ethylme rcury, in the very small amounts contained in thimerosal-containing vaccines, can damag e infant immune systems, or otherwise contribute to autism in any way. For example, none of the medical article s, cited by petitioners at the pages of their brief set forth above, conclude or even suggest that thimerosal or ethylmercur y, in the amounts conta ined in infant James Adams & Jane Romdalvik, Merc ury, Lead and Zinc in Baby Teeth of Children with41 Autism Versus Controls , 70 J. TOXICOLOGY & ENVTL. HEALTH 1046 (2007). ( Ex. 82.) It is noteworthy that when the Holmes investiga tors found alleg edly low levels of merc ury42 in hair, they found that to be supportive of the \"mer cury efflux disorder\" theory , but when the Bradstree t and Adams groups found alleg edly high levels of merc ury in urine and teeth, they also found that to be supportive of the same the ory. I also note that a committee of the Institut e of Medicine specific ally revie wed the Holmes43 and B radstre et 2003 studies, and pointed out problems with both studies. (Ex. J J, pp. 132-34.) An expert prese nted by Hazlehurst case, Dr. Jean-Ronel Corbier, also44 stated the opinion that autism in some individuals may be related to an impaire d ability to excrete merc ury. (Hazlehurst Tr. 379A-82A.) Dr. Corbier, howeve r, did not offer any substantial explanation for this opinion. He merely pointed briefly to the same three studies cited by Dr. Aposhian-- the Bradstree t 2003, Holmes, and Adams studies. I have considere d this testimony of Dr. Corbier, but I do not find it persua sive, and I find that the contra ry testimony of Dr. Brent was substantially more pe rsuasive. 31vaccines, can damage immune systems or cause other harm. According ly, I conclude that those general citati ons of petitioners to medical literature do not offer any substantial support to their theory that thimerosal-c ontaining va ccine s can da mage the infa nt immune sy stem.45 6. Testim ony of Dr. Bye rs and Dr. Ki nsbou rne Two additional experts also gave brief testimony on behalf of petitioners conce rning this general issue. Dr. Vera Byers, M.D., Ph.D., an immunologist, offered testimony that seeme d to generally support Dr. Aposhian' s theory that the thimerosal in thimer osal-conta ining vaccines can cause immune system e. (Ex. 57, pp. 4-5; Tr. 872, 893-913, 931-32, 935.) The testimony of Dr. Byers, howeve r, was quite vague. She repeatedly emphasized that conce rning this issue of the possible e ffects of merc ury on the immune system, it wa s her intent to \"defer\" to Dr. Aposhian, or that she wa s \"relying\" on Dr. Aposhian ( Tr. 894-896, 930, 935, 946, 983, 984-85), indicating that she was mere ly adopting Dr. Aposhian's conclusion on this issue, not developing her own opinion. Beyond relying on Dr. Aposhian, she did not offer any analy sis conce rning how she reached her opinion on this point, except to indicate that she was relying on the Goth and Agrawal studies, which I have f ound to be of dubious value f or reasons discussed a bove. (Tr . 900-903.) The main point of Dr. B yers' testimony seeme d to be her conclusion that Miche lle Cedillo had a malfunc tioning immune sy stem, thereby allowing the vaccine-stra in me asles virus to pe rsist in her system. To be sure, Dr. Byers generally indicated the conclusion that this malfunction of Michelle's own immune system was at least in part the result of her thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines. (Dr. Byers indicated that Michelle's immune dysfunction was also in part the result of the vaccine- strain measles virus itself.) But in this regard, Dr. Byers again was not relying entirely on her own analy sis. Rather, her reasoning seeme d to be as follows: ( 1) Dr. Aposhian has demonstrated that46 thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines in general can damag e infant immune systems. (2) Miche lle Cedillo suffe rs from a damag ed immune system. (3) Given the preceding two points, it is reasonable to infer that Michelle's own immune system damag e was, at least in part, the result of her thimerosal- containing vaccines. Howeve r, other than her brief discussion of the Goth and Agrawal article s (Tr. 900-903), Dr. Byers did not provide any support for he r appar ent conclusion that thimerosal- containing vaccines can damag e immune systems, saying only that she was relying on Dr. Aposhian for that point. Further, responde nt's expert Dr. Christine McCusker, a pediatric immunologist, noted that45 recent large studies failed to identify any pattern of abnorma l immune function in autistic children. (Ex. Z, p. 2; Tr. 2207.) At a number of place s in their briefs and their prese ntations during the evidentiar y hearing,46 petitioners' counsel and experts stated their arguments somewhat vaguely. According ly, when summarizing such arguments, I will sometimes state that the petitioners \"seem to\" or B yers' , conce this general issue of whether thimerosal- containing vacc ines ca n damag e the immune sy stem, was not per suasive. Dr . Byers' testimony in this regard was far outweighe d by the testimony of Dr. Brent and responde nt's other witnesses, discussed above . Additionally , petitioners pointed to the opinion of another of their experts, Dr. Marc el Kinsbourne, asser ting that he listed \"mer cury\" as a \"possible cause of immune dysregulation.\" (P2, p. 16.) A close reading of the section of the tra nscript cited by petitioners, howeve r, indicates that Dr. Kinsbourne was careful to offer no opinion of his own conce rning this topic. He stated only that merc ury was \"one of the possibili ties\" as a cause for the alleg ed immune dysregulation of Colten Snyder (Snyder Tr. 486, line 25), and he also noted that even in going that far, he was not stating his own opinion, but was \"relying on another expert's independe nt opinion on that\" (Snyder Tr. 485, lines 14-15). Dr. Kinsbourne also made it quite clear, during his testimony in this Cedillo case, that he does not have an opinion of his own as to whether thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines can cause immune dy sfunction. (Tr . 1125, 1173-74.) According ly, I find that the testimony of Dr. Kinsbourne, like that of Dr. B yers, of fered no support to the petitioners' asser tion thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines can immune systems.47 7. Sum mary conce rning general theory of thim erosal-caused imm une dysfunction For all the reasons set forth above, I conclude that the evidenc e offered by the responde nt conc erning this general issue is substantially more persua sive than the evidenc e offered by petitioners. I conclude that while Dr. Aposhian does have impressive credenti als as a Ph.D. toxicolog ist, Dr. Brent, a medical doctor and a medical toxicolog ist, has superior credentials conce rning this issue. I found the testimony of Drs. Brent and Cook to be substant ially more persua sive, in general, than that of Dr. Aposhian. Whil e all the experts agree that merc ury, in some48 I also note that another of petitioners' experts, Dr. Ronald Kenne dy, at one point stated47 generally that \"mer cury,\" in some unspecifie d form and dosag e, can cause \"immune dysfunction.\" (Tr. 709.) Dr. Kenne dy explained that he had read in textbooks that heavy metals (such as merc ury) can in general have a subst antial i mmunosuppressive effec t, althoug h he did not consider himself to be an expert in that area. (Tr. 776-783.) Howeve r, Dr. Kenne dy never opined that thimerosal or ethylme rcury , in the amounts contained in thimeros al-containing vaccines, can damag e infant immune sy stems. (Tr. 776-783.) (To be sure, one theme of Dr. Kenne dy's testimony was that the measles vaccine can cause immune system suppression (e.g., Tr. 720-21), but he did not testify that thimerosal-containing vaccines can c ause suc h suppression.) Another of responde nt's expe rts, Ward, a medical doctor specia lizing in48 infec tious diseases, also noted in his written report that he saw no substantial evidenc e to support the theory that thimerosal can damag e the immune system. (Ex. BB, pp. 9-10.) Like Dr. Brent, Dr. Ward stated that no conclusions can be draw n from the in vitro studies. (Ex. BB, p. 9.) These (continued...) 33forms and dosag es, ca n be tox ic, I find that Dr. Bre nt was quit e persuasive in explaining why , for the reasons set forth above, there is no good reason to conclude that merc ury in its ethylme rcury form, in the small amounts contained in infant vaccines, can damag e infant immune systems. I find Dr. Brent to be convincing in his testimony that Dr. Aposhian erred in his relianc e upon in vitro studies, espec ially the Goth and Agrawal studies. I disorder\" have not been shown to have validity . And I find that the medical literature cited by petitioners lends no substantial support to their theory conce rning this issue. In short, I find that the evidenc e falls far short of demo nstrating that it is \"more probable than not\" that thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines can damag e infants' immune system. B. Petition ers have not demon strated that thim erosal-containin g vacc ines harm ed Michelle's own im mune system . In the prior sever al pages of this Decision, I have explained why I conclude that the petitioners have failed to demonstrate that thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines in general can damag e infants' immune systems. In this section, I conclude that the petitioners have also failed to demonstrate that it is \"more probable than not\" that thimerosal-c ontaining lle's own immune sy stem. Petitioners' argument with regard to Michelle can be summarized as follows: (1) Thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines in ge neral can damag e infant immune sy stems. (2) Michelle suffe rs from a damag ed immune system. (3) Given the preceding two points, it is reasonable to infer that Michelle's own immune system damag e was the result of her thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines. I must reject petit ioners' overall ar gument, howeve r, because I reject both of the first two parts of petitioners' thre e-part arg ument. 1. I have ge neral causation theory conce rning im mune dam age is with out m erit. As to part (1) of petitioners' three -step theory (see previous paragraph) , I have already explained in detail, at pp. 22-34 of this Decision, why I have found no merit in the petitioners' theory that thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines in general can damag e infant immune systems. There fore, since I have rejec ted that general c ausation theory , it follows inescapa bly that petitioners have failed to demonstrate tha t thimerosal-conta ining va ccine s damag ed Miche lle's own immune sy stem. (...continued)48 opinions of Dr. Ward off er additional support for my conclusion her e. 342. Petitioners h ave f ailed to dem onstrat e that Michelle has a s ubstan tially abnorm al im mune system . I also reject part (2) of petitioners' three -step argument, since I find that petitioners have failed to demons trate that it is \"more probable than not\" that Michelle has a damag ed immune system. a. Petitioners' evidence --Dr. Bye rs Concerning this issue of Mi chelle' s own i mmune system, the peti tioners rely primarily on the testimony of Dr. Byers, a medical doctor specia lizing in immunology . She testified that Michelle has a malfunctioning (\"dysregulated\" was the term she used most often) immune system. (Tr. 872, 929A.) Dr. Byers seeme d to base this conclusion primarily upon a set of tests of Michelle's immune system performed by an immunologist, Dr. Gupta, in 1997 when Michelle was three years old. (Tr. 879A.) Dr. By ers stated that this testing showed t hat M ichelle' s immune function was abnorm al, pointing out sever al specific tests on which Michelle's results deviated from normal test results. One abnorma lity, she testified, was that Michelle has \"Th1/Th2 skewing ,\" meaning an imbalance of too few \"Th1\" cells and too many \"Th2\" cells. (Ex. 57, pp. 3-4; Tr. 879A.) Another problem, according to Dr. Byers, was that Michelle had an unusually low \"CD8 count,\" which meant that she had an abnorma l ratio betwee n two types of immune sy stem cells known as CD4 and CD8. (Ex. 57, p. 4; Tr. 880A, 884A.) Third, Dr. Byers said, Michelle ha d an ele vated \" CD20\" test, which mea nt that she had abnorma lly eleva ted amounts of the immunoglobulin subclasses I gG2 and I gG4. (Ex. 57, p. 3; Tr. 880A-81A .) Dr. Byers also mentioned sever al other factors that contributed to her view that Michelle has an abnorma l immune system. She stated that one such factor was Michelle's \"aberrant reaction to the MMR vaccine,\" meaning Michelle's high fever that began about one week post-vacc ination. (Tr. 874A, 929A, 936.) Another factor, according to Dr. Byers, was that Michelle has suffe red from \"chronic i conditions,\" 879A, A factor that she listed was Michelle's alleg ed \"inability to clear the measles virus va ccine strain from he r body a who specia lizes in pediatr ic immunology. (Tr. 2202-03.) She opined that Michelle has a normal immune system. (Ex. Z, pp. 4, 6; Tr. 2244A-45.) Dr. McCusker evalua ted in detail the immunological testing of Michelle done by Dr. Gupta in 1997. (Ex. Z, pp. 2-5; Tr. 2217A-25A, 2240, 2257A-58.) She conclude d that that testin g demonstrated that Michelle has an \"entire ly normal immune response .\" (Tr . 2225A. )50 Dr. McCusker explained what she found to be the primary error in Dr. Byers' evalua tion of the 1997 testing by Dr. Gupta . Dr. McCusker noted that Dr. B yers ha d compar ed the r esults from sever al of the tests on Michelle to a set of \"norma l\" values for such tests. The normal values utiliz ed by Dr. Byers, howeve r, were for adults , not children. According to Dr. McCusker, this inappropria te usage of normal values for adults, rather than age-adjusted values, explain the supposedly \"abnor mal\" results for Michelle cited by Dr. Byers. Dr. McCusker stated that when she herse lf instead compar ed Michelle's results to an age-adjusted set of normal values, Michelle's results fell within the normal rang es. (Ex. Z, pp. 2- 4; Tr. 2217A-2225A .) Dr. McCusker testified further that if Michelle had had a damag ed immune system, she would have suffe red from an abnorma l number of infec tions, yet, in fact, that did not happen to Michelle. (T r. 2240-41A.) c. Analysis concerning M ichelle's own im mune system After full considera tion, I have found the testimony of Dr. McCusker conce rning this issue to be subst antially more persuasive than that of Dr. B yers. There are a number of reasons for this conclusion. Two other experts for responde nt also briefly addre ssed the issue of whether Michelle has49 a defective immune system. Dr. Ward, the infec tious disease expert, examined Michelle's records and found \"no evidenc e of clinically relevant immune suppression in Michelle's case.\" (Ex. BB, p. 8.) Simi larly, Dr. Diane Griff in, a medica l doctor with extensive experience study ing the measles virus and related issues, also stated that she found no evidenc e of immune suppression in Michelle's records. (Tr. 2792A-93.) Howeve r, neither of those experts testified extensively conce rning this issue, nor is either an immunologist. According ly, while their opinions do provide additional support for the conclusion that I have reached, those opinions were seconda ry in importance to Dr. McCusker 's opinion. According to the transcr ipt, Dr. McCusker stated that Michelle has an \"entire ly immune50 response .\" (Tr . 2225A, l ine 10.) Howeve r, the audio recording of the hearing , which is ava ilable on this court's website, demonstrates that Dr. McCusker said the word \"norma l\" betwee n the words \"entire ly\" and \" immune.\" That is consistent with the re st of her e xpert re port and testimony . 36Initially , Dr. Byers' opinion that Michelle had a defective immune system was based in part on two assumptions of fact which I have rejected as incorre ct. First, Dr. Byers assumed Michelle's51 \"inability to clear the measles virus vaccine strain from her body.\" (Tr. 879A.) In other words, Dr. Byers assumed the validity of the much-disputed labora tory testing that conclude d that Michelle had the prese nce of measles vaccine in her intestinal tissue years after her MMR vaccination. However , I have conclude d that such testing was not reliable . (See pp. 41-78 below.) Second, Dr. Byers based her opinion on the assumption that Michelle has suffe red from \"chronic inflammatory conditions,\" 888A, 929A, emphasis added.) Howeve r, I have conclude d that petitioners have failed to demonstrate that Michelle suffe rs from a chronic inflammatory bowel condition (though she certainly has had non- inflammatory chronic gastrointestinal problems). (See pp. 148- 161 below.)52 Next, Dr. By ers relied upon Michelle's high fever after the MMR vaccination as evidence that her immune system was defective. (Tr. 874A, 929A, 936.) Howeve r, Dr. McCusker responde d that high fever does occur occasionally after MMR vaccination, without any long-term ramifica tions. the measles virus, Dr. Diane Griff in, testified that about five to fiftee n percent of MMR recipients get a fever of 103\u00b0 or more. (Tr. 2779A.) Thus, it appea rs that M ichell e's fever was not so uncommon as to constitute substantial evidenc e of da mage to her immune sy stem. Dr. McCusker also testified that, according to the 1997 testing, Michelle's immune sy stem did appropr iately make antibo dies to the components of the vaccines that she received, including diphtheria, tetanus, rubella, polio, and pneumococ cus. (Tr. 2217A-18A.) In Dr. McCusker' s view, that indicates a proper ly functioning immune system. Petitioners did not attempt to refute this point. In addition, Dr. McCusker testified, as noted above, that if Michelle had a damag ed immune system, she would have suffe red from a greater-tha n-normal amount of infec tions, while in fact her number of infec tions does not appea r to have been abnorma l. (Tr. 2240-41A.) Even Dr. Byers admitted that Michelle did not have a history of especially frequent or unusual infec tions. (Tr. 874A.) The next point is the most important one with respe ct to this issue of whether Michelle's immune system was damage d. Dr. By ers and McCusker, as noted above, differ ed on the issue of which set of \"norma l\" values to utiliz e when evalua ting the 1997 testing of Michelle's immune system by Dr. Gupta. Dr. Byers utiliz ed a set of normal values develope d by the same labora tory that An expert opinion may be rejected if based on an incor rect assumption. E.g., Perreira v.51 Secre Fe d. Cl. 29, 33-34 (1992). The distinction betwee n inflammatory and non-inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders is52 very important in this regard, since an inflammatory disorder would likely indicate involvement of the immune system, while non-inflammatory conditions such as diarrhe a and constipation, from which Miche lle chronic ally suffe red, w ould not necessa rily involve the immune sy stem. 37did the actua l testing on Michelle, but that set was develope d via testing of adults . Dr. McCusker, in contra st, found it more appropr iate to utiliz e a published set of age-adjusted normal values develope d in testing of c hildren. . 884A-87; Ex. Z, pp. 2-4; Tr . 2210A-13.) Concerning this issue, Dr. Byers did make a noteworthy point when she explained that there are varia tions in labora tory techniques, so that the best range of normal values to use may be the one develope d by the same laboratory doing the testing. (Tr. 885A.) But Dr. McCusker responde d that while there are varia tions betwee n labora tories, it is even more important to use age-appropriate values when evalua ting immune testing results of children , because children do differ signific antly from adults in immune testing results. (Tr. 2210A-13, 2250A, 2266-67.) She noted, for example, that if you evalua ted newbor n children' s immune systems using adult ranges, all such children would appea r to have abnorma l immune systems. (Tr. 2267.) She explained that U.S. and Canadian pediatric immunologists routinely use a published set of normal values for children, which have not chang ed appreciably since 1992. (Tr. 2212A-13.) I found that Dr. McCusker was far more persua sive on this point. She demonstrated that, in evalua ting the immune systems of children, it is much more appropr iate to utiliz e age-appropriate normal values, even if develope d by other labora tories, than to use adult values develope d in the same labora tory wher e the testing was done.53 Dr. McCusker also made another important point. She stated that even using the adult values utiliz ed by Dr. Byers, Michelle's results on the sever al specific tests cited by Dr. Byers deviated from the normal range only by slight amounts . (Tr. 2268.) There fore, she said, as an immunologist evalua ting Michelle's test results, even compar ing Michelle's results to the adult values , she would still deem Michelle's immune system to be normal . Further, it is important that Michelle's own treating immunologist, Dr. Gupta himself, after doing the 1997 testing in question, descr ibed Michelle as having \"almost normal immune functions.\" (Ex. 3, p. 16.) Dr. McCusker testified that Dr. Gupta would not have made that general statement had he believed that Michelle's immune system substantially deviated f rom normal. (Tr. 2250A .)54 Thus, for all the reasons set forth above, I find that the petitioners have failed to demonstrate that it is likely that Michelle's immune system was substantia lly abnormal. I acknow ledge that Dr. Gupta's comment that Michelle's immune functions were \"almost normal\" indicates that he perceived the possibility of some slight abnorma lity in Michelle's sy stem. But the word \" almost\" also indicates that Dr. Gupta consid ered her immune system to at least be close to normal. His Respondent's expert Dr. Ward, a medical doctor with experience in vaccine immunology53 (Tr. 1799), also testified that normal values for immunology testing chang e appre ciably as children age. (Tr . 1799-1800A.) In addition, Dr. McCusker prese nted additional testimony related to the issue of the \"Th254 skewing \" that Dr. Byers purportedly found in Dr. Gupta's testing of Michelle's immune system. Dr. McCusker stated that if Michelle actua lly had \"Th2 skewing ,\" she would have had abnorm al levels of the immunog lobulin subclass I gE, which she did not. (Tr . 2240.) 38overa ll repor t certainly does not indicate that he found anything substantial ly abnorma l in Michelle's immune sy stem. Further, Dr. McCusker was simply far more persua sive than Dr. Byers conce rning this issue, for the re asons that I have outlined a bove. I n addition, I note that Dr. Mc Cusker's experience and backg round are also superior conc erning this iss ue. B oth Dr. McCusker and Dr. Byers have sol id credentials in immunology . Howeve r, Dr. McCusker has the of spe cializing in pediatric immunology , which is not true of Dr. Byers. In addition, Dr. McCusker has extensive experience in recent years in the clinical practice of treating pediatric immunology patients (Tr. 2204-06), wher eas Dr. Byers does not seem to have had any clinical experience, with children or adults, since ar ound the y ear 2000 (Tr. 869A ). d. Dr. Kennedy Petitioners in their briefs also relied on certain statements by Dr. Ronald Kenne dy conce rning Michelle's immune system. (P1, pp. 89, 95.) Dr. Kenne dy is not a medical doctor, but has a Ph.D. in microbiolog y, and has a gre at deal of ex perie nce in study ing viruses and i n the development of vaccines. (Tr. 684-85; Ex. 110, pp. 1-2.) His expert repor t for the most part did not deal specific ally with Michelle's own case, or with immunology in general. Howeve r, Dr. Kenne dy did include three unexplained sentenc es which mentioned Michelle's immune system. In the first sentenc e, he stated that the \"most plausible scientific reason\" for the persistenc e of measles virus in Michelle's body is that \"ther e is a selec tive immune dysfunction with her immune system.\" (Ex. 110, p. 8.) He added55 a simil ar sentenc e as his penultimate sentenc e at the end of his repor t. (Ex. 110, p. 9.) Then, in his final sentenc e, he stated that the \"skew ing of the T cell responses,\" an appar ent reference to Dr. Gupta's testing, \"indicate d that Michelle Cedillo exhibi ted immune dysfunction.\" (Ex. 110, p. 9.) During his hearing testimony , Dr. Kenne dy again briefly mentioned Michelle's immune system. (Tr. 741-43A.) He pointed to a result of one of Dr. Gupta's tests that he believed indicated an \"elevated\" response by her immune system (Tr. 741-42), which he interpreted as evidenc e of \"some sort of immune dy sfunction\" ( Tr. 742). I have considere d these statements by Dr. Kenne dy, but they certainly do not alter my analy sis stated above. In the quoted sentenc e from page 8 of his expert repor t, and in the penultimate sentenc e on page 9, Dr. Kennedy seems to be indicating , as Dr. Byers did, that the fact that the measles virus has persisted in Miche lle's body is an indication of immune dysfunction in Michelle. Howeve r, I have found, for reasons to be detailed below, that the testing that purported to find persisting measles virus in Michelle's body was unreliable . (See pp. 41-78 below.) There fore, this pont of Dr. Ke nnedy is of no value, since it is based on an incor rect assumption. Dr. Kenne dy's initial expert repor t was filed as Ex. 110; later, the same document was filed55 again, with a sig nature , as Ex. 112. I will cite to that report a s Ex. 110. 39Finally , I note that Dr. Kenne dy's observa tions in his final sentenc e of his expert repor t, and in his hearing testimony , appar ently were based on his interpre tation of Dr. Gupta's testing as showing certain of Michelle's results as outside the normal range. But this analy sis seems to ha ve resulted from the same error made by Dr. Byers as discussed above- -i.e., comparing Michelle's testing results to adult values rathe r than age-adjusted values. There fore, I must reject Dr. Kenne dy's analy sis in thi s reg ard for the same reason that I have r ejected Dr. B yers' simil ar testimony . According ly, having dy's brief statements conce rning Michelle's immune sy stem, I conclude that they add nothing of persua sive value to pe titioners' argument that Michelle ha s a def ective immune sy stem. C. Su mmary conce rning immune system allegations For all the reasons set forth above, I conclude that the petitioners have failed to demonstrate either that thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines can harm infant immune systems in general , or that thimerosal-c ontaining va ccine lle's own immune sy stem.56 Petitioners also mentioned, in one of their briefs, the fact that Dr. Kenne dy argued that the56 measles vaccine (rather than the thimerosal-c ontaining cause i mmune suppression. (P1, pp. 93-94.) It is true that Dr. Kenne dy, and Dr. Byers as well, did testify that the measles vaccine can have a suppressive effect on the human immune system for a period of time after vaccination. (Tr. 710, 720-21A, 764-69, 1012A.) Howeve r, the petitioners neve r attempted to tie this point into the rest of their causa tion arguments. How this point might fit within their overa ll causation theory is a mystery . And, in any event, I have considere d the question of wheth er the petitioners have demonstrated that Michell e's MMR vaccination of December 20, 1995, had any signific ant immunosuppressive ef fect on her, a nd I find that they did not. In this regard, one of responde nt's experts, Dr. Griff in, did acknow ledge that infec tion by virus in its wild, full-strength non-vac cine form, (Tr. 2767-69, 2799-2800A.) Howeve r, Dr. Griff in also testified that with the vaccine-strain form of the measles virus, there is no immunosuppression that is \"clinica lly important.\" (Tr. 2779A- 81, 2799.) According to Dr. Griff in, the vaccine-stra in vir us does cause minor temporar y chang es in the immune system response that could be measure d via testing, such as chang es in the lymphocy tes that are circulating. (Tr. 2780-81.) But those changes do not suppress the immune system enoug h to cause incre ased susceptibility to disease. (Tr. 2779A-81, 2807, 2809.) Dr. Griff in noted that a number of studies have looked for evidenc e of incre ased susceptibility to infec tion after MMR vaccination, but have found none. (Tr. 2780-81A.) She repeated that point later, stating that there is no evidenc e that vaccines \"make people more susceptible to opportunistic organisms\" (Tr. 2807, lines 11-17), and that scientists have not recognized any evidenc e that the meas les vaccine affects the va ccine e's \"ability to ht off infe of responde nt's experts, Zweiman, who has outstanding credentials conce rning immunology , testified in the Snyder case in agreement with Dr. Griff in that there is no clinically relev ant immunosuppression cause d by the measles vaccine. (Snyder Tr. 590A- (continued...) 40VI THE UNIGENETICS T EST ING THAT PUR PORTED TO FIND EVIDENCE OF P ERSIS TING M EASLE S VIRUS IN THE INTES TINAL TISS UE OF M ICHELL E AND OTHERS WAS NOT REL IABLE As noted above, the petitioners contend in this case that the MMR va ccine can, in general, contri bute to the causa tion of both autism and chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction, and did contribute to the causa tion of Michelle Cedillo's own autism and chronic gastrointestinal symptoms. There is one key factual alleg ation that underlies all of those causa tion That is, all of the petitioners' causa tion theories depend upon the validity of certain testing that purported to find evidenc e of pe rsisting mea sles virus in the biologica l materials of Miche lle and a numbe r of other autistic children. Specifically , the petitioners' pr imary expert conce rning the ca usation of autism , Dr. Marc el Kinsbourne, made it clear that his opinion in any individual case would depend upon the existence of a reliable labora tory finding of persisting vaccine-stra in measles virus in the body of the individual in question. (Tr. 1180A, 1183A, 1196A.) of chronic gastrointesti nal dysfunction, Dr. Arthur Krigsman, also specified that his opinion in any individual case would depend upon the existence of such a reliable labora tory finding of per sisting vac cine- strain measle s virus in the individual. (Tr. 531-33A, 538A .) There fore, a key issue in this case conce rns the reliabilit y and validity of the labora tory testing that purported to find evidenc e of persisting measles virus in the intestinal tissue of Michelle and other a utisti c childre n. Both pa rties to this case ha ve off ered extensive e vidence conce caref ul considera tion, I conclude that the evidence indicates strong ly that the testing in question was not reliable . (...continued)56 91A.) Dr. Ward also testified to the same effect (Tr. 1881-82A, 1890-91), as did one of responde nt's experts in the Snyder case , Dr. B ertus Rima ( Snyder Tr. 831A) . As will be explained below, Dr. Griff in has extraordinary credentials as an expert conce rning the measles virus. (See pp. 108-09 below.) I found her testimony , as supported by the testimony of Dr. Zweiman, Dr. Ward, and Dr. Rima, to be persua sive on this point. According ly, conce rning this issue of whether the vaccine-strain measles virus has a clinically signific ant immunosuppressive effect, I credit their opinions over those of Dr . Kenne dy and Dr . Byers. Moreove r, as explained above, I have conclude d that there has been no showi ng that Michelle has a substanti ally abnormal immune system, so that even if the MMR vaccination had some temporary effect on Michelle's immune system, there has been no demonstration that the vaccination had any substantial long- lasting e ffect. Indeed, the petitioners acknow ledged in their briefs that the validity of the Unig enetics57 testing of Michelle's ow n biopsy is a \" sine qua non in her que st for entitlement.\" ( P3 at 14.) 41A. The cted by the Unigenetics laborator y On Januar y 31, 2002, a biopsy (i.e., a small piece of living tissue) was taken from Michelle's ileum, a part of her small intestine, for diagnostic purposes. (Ex. 44, pp. 13-14.) A \"Mea sles Virus Detec tion\" was performed by the Unig enetics Ltd. labora tory opera ted by Dr. John J. O'Leary and colleag ues, in Dublin, Ireland. (Ex. 28, p. 179.) The report of that test, issued on Marc h 15, 2002, stated that \"me asles virus wa s detec ted\" in the tissue. ( Id.) Michelle was not the only person whose tissue was tested for the possible detec tion of measles virus by a labora tory opera ted by Dr. O'Leary in Dublin. Dr. O'Leary's labora tory also performed testing that was re ported in an a rticle published by Uhlmann and c olleag ues in 2002. 58 (I will refer to that article hereinafter as the \"Uhlmann article ,\" and the study that the article descr ibed as the \"Uhlmann study .\") That article was co-authored by 11 individuals, including Dr. Andr ew Wakef ield, the B ritish phy sician who was the primary author of the a bove-me ntioned 1998 article that initiated the controve rsy conce rning whether the MMR vaccine can cause autism. (Ex. 63, Tab U, pp. 84, 89.) Many of the other authors, including Uhlmann, were listed as affiliated with Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, or the Coombe Women's Hospital in Dublin. (Id.) Two of the Dublin authors, in addition to Uhlmann, wer e Dr. O'L eary and Dr . Orla Sheils. ( Id.) The record of this case indicates that Dr. O'Leary and Dr. Shiels, in addition to being two of the authors of the Uhlmann article , have worked together at Dr. O'Leary's labora tory in Dublin, affiliated with Trinity College and the Coombe Women's Hospital. They were two of the principal members of the research team that carried out the Uhlmann study in Dublin. (Ex. 110, p. 7; Tr. 810- 12, 817, 845, 851A, 1938A; Snyder Tr. 853A-54A.) Uhlmann was a post-doctora l student who worke d for them at the Dublin labora tory. (Tr. 1938A.) Unig enetics Ltd. was established O' Leary and collea gues as a for-profit company to do testing for measles virus, appar ently for the purpose of providing testing of claimants in ce rtain British litiga tion in which it was alleg the MMR va ccine can c ause a utism. (That litigation will be descr ibed below, at p. 49 fn. 69.) 13; Snyder Tr. 928A-29.) enetics did testing for mea sles virus on59 samples from other individuals, such as Michelle Cedillo. (Ex. 28, p. 179.) It is not clear from the record whether the testing described in the Uhlmann study was performed under the Unig enetics Ltd. name. Howeve r, it is clear, and undisputed, that it was the Dubl in labora tory group heade d by Drs. O'Leary and Shiels that performed both the above- mentioned test on Michelle's tissue and the testing descr ibed in the Uhlmann article . The V. Uhlmann et al., Potential Viral Pathogenic Mechanism for New Variant Inflammatory58 Bowel Disease , 55 M OLECULAR PATHOLOGY 84 (2002). ( Ex. 63, Tab U.) Petitioners' expert Dr. Kenne dy explained that it is common for scientific investiga tors at59 universities to be permitted to set up their own for-profit biotech companies in addition to their university duties. (Tr. 812- 13.) 42methodology was the same. (See, e.g., Ex. 110, p. 7; Tr. 810-12, 817, 845, 851A, 1938A; Snyder Tr. 331A- 32A.) In the record of this case, the parties and witnesses have referred to the labora tory group that performed both the Uhlmann study , as well as the testing on Michelle Cedillo and simil ar commerc ial enetics.\" In this Decision, for ease of reference, I will usually refer to the \"Unig enetics labora tory,\" or simply \"Unig enetics;\" it should be clear, howeve r, that in such instances I am referring to all of the measles virus detec tion testing done by this Dubl in labora tory group, whether it was performed under the \"Unig enetics Ltd.\" name or not.60 The Uhlmann article of intestinal tissue (spec ifically , ileal lymphoid tissue) from two groups of children. (Ex. 63, Tab U, p. 84.) The testing was done by a methodology known as PCR (poly mera se chain reaction), the same form of testing done on Michelle Cedillo's tissue. The first group of 91 children each had both a \"deve lopmental disorder\" and also intestinal dysfunction; the second group consisted of 70 developmenta lly normal children who had suffe red various types of intestinal problems. (Id.) The tissue samples were tested for the prese nce of measles virus RNA, by sever al differ ent PCR techniques. The authors repor ted that they found measles RNA in61 the samples of the large majority of the developmenta lly disabled children, but in only a few of the developmenta lly normal childre n. (Id.) The Uhlmann authors conclude d that their results raised an important question, namely , \"does MV [measle s virus] play an aetiolog in intesti nal inflammation in developmenta l disorder? \" (Id. at 89.) The Unig enetics labora tory, as noted above, has performed testing for measles virus on other tissue specimens besides those tested in the Uhlmann study . That labora tory performed the above- descr ibed test on Michelle Cedillo. In addition, it appea rs that biopsy tissue from other autistic children, whose families had conce rns about a possible c ausal link be tween the MMR vaccine and Dr. Kenne dy indicated that Dr. O'Leary's academic, not-for- profit, Trinity College60 labora tory, and the Unigenetics labora tory, were \"two differ ent labs,\" even though opera ted by overla pping individuals. (Snyder Tr. 412A-13A.) It certainly appea rs that there were \"two labora tories\" at least in the sense that Unig enetics opera ted separ ately , for business purposes, from the other lab work done by Dr. O'Leary and colleag ues at the Dublin hospital. The record does not make it clear whether the Unig enetics work was done in a different physical space than the other Dublin lab work. But that is not important, since it is clear that when experts descr ibed visiti ng ibing the physical space wher e the O'Leary group performed the measles virus testing done in the Uhlmann study and on samples from individuals such as Miche lle Cedillo. RNA is short for \"ribonuc leic acid,\" which is part of the genetic materia l of a cell. 61 Dorland's at 1638. 43autism, has been sent to Unig enetics for testing to detec t measles virus. For example, in one of the other Vaccine Act \"test cases\" descr ibed above, the Snyder case, biologic from Colten Snyder was sent to Unig enetics, which found such materia l to be positive for the prese nce of measles virus. ( Snyder Ex. The \"Unig enetics L td.\" l abora tory any is no longe r in business, appar ently dissolved in 2005. (Tr. 856; Snyder Ex. X, p. 4; Snyder Tr. 400A.) Howeve r, the Dublin laboratory of Drs. O' Leary and Sheils does continue to oper ate and publish work. (Ex. 110, p. 7.) B. Addit ional s tudies The publication of the Uhlmann article raised conce rns. Obviously , the repor ted finding that the large majority of the developmenta lly disabled children in the study had measles virus RNA in their intestinal tissue, while the vast majority of the developmenta lly normal children did not, gave rise to conce rn that the measles virus might be causing developmenta l disorders, including autism. And because the MMR vaccine contains a weakened but live version of the measles virus, the Uhlmann article contributed to the controve rsy conce rning whether the MMR vaccine might be causing autism, the theory first raised in the above- mentioned 1998 Wakefield article . Criticisms62 of the Wakefield article and its g eneral causation theory will be discussed below (pp. 143-44) , but at this point I note that the publication of the Uhlmann article cause d some experts to question the conclusion of the Uhlmann authors that measles virus RNA had actua lly been found in the tested children. According ly, other researchers undertook studies to see if they could replica te the results of the Uhlmann study . Those resear chers performed testing proc edure s simil to these descr ibed in the Uhlmann ar ticle, looking f or the pre sence of the mea sles virus in the children. An article descr ibing one such study was published by Afzal and colleag ues in 2006. The63 Afzal authors tested certain blood c ells, known as \"PMBCs,\" of 15 children suffe ring from autism spectrum disorders (ASD), all of whom had received the MMR vaccine, for measles virus. The researchers utiliz ed a number of testing methodologie s, but found none of the samples positive for measles virus by any test. (Ex. T, Att. 2.) An article descr ibing another important study was also published in 2006, by D'Souza and colleag ues. The D'Souza researchers tested the blood cells (PMBCs) of 88 children, 54 diagnosed64 Four of the authors of the 1998 Wakefield article , including Dr. Wakefield, were also62 authors of the Uhlmann ar ticle. M. Afzal et al., Absence of Detec table Measles Virus Genome Sequenc e In Blood of63 Autistic Children Who Have Had Their MMR Vacc ination During the Routine Childhood Immunization Schedule of UK, 78 J. MED. VIROLOGY 623 (2006). ( Ex. T, Att. 2.) Yasmin D' Souz a, Eric Fombonne, Brian J. Ward, No Evidenc e of Persisting Measle s Virus64 (continued...) 44with A SD a nd 34 developmenta lly normal, for measles virus. (Ex. T, Att. 6, p. 1664.) At least 51 of the 54 ASD children, and at least 31 of the 34 developmenta lly normal children, had received MMR vaccine. (Id. at 1669.) The authors' ultimate conclusion was that none of the studied children, in either the ASD group or the developmenta lly normal group, in fact had persisting measles virus infe ction. That re sult was reached after a series of procedure s, the history of which sheds important light on the r esults of the Uhlmann study . In PCR testing, the scientist's goal is to look at a sample of biologic materia l and see if it contains a certain \"target,\" such as measles virus RNA. To do so, the scientist use s \"primer s\" that are desig ned to \"amplify \" the target. The PCR scientist attempts to develop a set of primers that will pinpoint the target material, and only the target material , for \"amplifica tion\" in the PCR test. The D'Souza team, there fore, utiliz ed the same set of primers that the Uhlmann team had develope d and used i n the Uhlm ann st udy, in order to test the performanc e of those primers. When the D'Souz a team performed its testing utiliz ing the Uhlmann primers, the testing initially yielded \"positive\" finding s of measles virus for almost all of the tested samples, including samples from both the ASD children and the developmenta lly normal children. (Id. at 1670.) Howeve r, the D'Souza group there after subjected those appar ently positive samples to additional testing techniques in order to deter mine whether the PCR testing using the Uhlmann primers was truly identify ing measles virus and only measles virus. The first technique involved a nalysis of \"melting curve s,\" and the second involved analy sis of the size of \"amplicons,\" a technique also known as \"gel electrophoresis.\" The application of those two techniques revealed that all but nine of the samples that had initially tested positive by the PCR test using the Uhlmann primers were, in fact, not measles virus. (Id. at 1670-71; Ex. BB, p. 12; proce dure known as \"s equencing ,\" which, it is undisputed, is the \"gold st andar d\" for deter mining whether the materia l being examined actua lly is measles virus RNA, rathe r than some other substance. The D'Souza group was able to succe ssfully complete the sequenc ing proce dure in seven of the nine samples, and all seven turned out not to contain measles virus RNA. The sequencing , rathe r, demonstrated that the m aterial, which in the P CR testing had appea red to be measles virus materia l, was in fact not measles virus materia l, but human genetic materia l. (Ex. T, Att. 6, p. 1671; Tr. 1853A, 1856A.) The D'Souza authors, thus, conclude d that their results demonstrated that the data published in the Uhlmann article \"is unlikely to be true.\" (Id. at 1671.) The D'Souza group detailed what they found to be \"seve ral plausible explanations\" for the Uhlmann authors' erroneous conclusion that they had found measles virus in the tissue samples. (Id. at 1672; Tr. at 1853A-55.) Their prim ary explanation was that the \"primer s\" used in the Uhlmann study were not as \"spec ific\" as they neede d to be to positively identify measles virus materia l and only measles virus materia l. Instead, the (...continued)64 in Peripheral Blood Mononucle ar Cells From Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder , 118 PEDIATRICS 1664 (2006). ( Ex. T, Att. 6.) 45D'Souza authors demonstrated that the Uhlmann primers were nonspecific enoug h that they mistakenly identified human genetic materia l as measles virus materia l. (Id. at 1672; Tr. 1853A- 1858A.) C. Petition ers' e vidence As noted above, petitioners' two primary experts conce rning their causa tion claims, Drs. Kinsbourne and Krigsman, validity of the above- descr ibed Unig enetics testing of Michelle Cedillo and other children. Howeve r, while those two experts relied upon the validity of the Unig enetics testing, neither purported to be an expert conce rning the specific , highly contested issue of whether , in fact, the Unig enetics testing results should be considere d reliable . Concerning that issue of the reliabilit y of the Unig enetics testing, rathe r, the petitioners have relied chief ly upon two expert witnesses, Dr. K aren Hepne r and D r. Ronald Kenne dy.65 1. Dr. Hepner Petitioners' first witness, Dr. Karen Hepne r, has a Ph.D. in molecular biology , and more than ten years' experience in utiliz ing PCR technolog y. (Ex. 64; Tr. 583A-84A, 636-37.) In her expert repor t and hearing testimony , Dr. Hepne r indicated the opinion that the Unig enetics test results were reliable . (Tr. 639.) Discussing the Uhlmann article , she opined that the positive and negative controls used by the Uhlmann author s were appropr iate, that the ope rating proce dure employ ed in the testing was appropr iate to minimi ze the possibili and that the \"assay s\" utiliz ed we re appropriate ly selec ted and implemented. ( Ex. 63, pp. 1-3; Tr. 610A- 28.) Dr. Hepne r also discussed two of the studies often cited by critics of the Unig enetics testing, the Afzal 2006 and D'Souza 2006 studies, which are descr ibed above at pp. 44-46. Dr. Hepne r stated t hat the failure of those studies to find evidenc e of persisting measles virus in the bodi es of autistic children is not a good reason to doubt the reliability of the Unig enetics te sting. She stated that the failure of the Afzal and D'Souza studies to replica te the finding s of the Uhlmann study was probably due to two factors. First, in those Afzal and D'So uza studies, the authors tested certain blood cells of the children, not intestinal tissue as did the authors of the Uhlmann article . Second, the Afzal and D'Souza studies tested autistic children, but not autistic children with gastrointesti nal dysfunction as wa s the ca se with the Uhlmann testing . (Ex. 63, pp. 4-5; Tr. 629A-31A.) Finally , Dr. Hepne r pointed to a study that is currently in progress, conducte d by herse lf and sever al others, to which I will refer as the \"W alker study .\" She stated t hat the \"preliminary data\" An expert witness for the petitioners in the Hazlehurst case, Dr. Corbier , did br iefly state65 the opinion that the enetics test results were reliable . (Hazlehurst Tr. 279A.) But he provided little explanation as to why he re ached that conclusion, and he did not claim t o have any expertise in PCR testing. I do not find that Dr. Corbier's brief statements conce rning this matter offer any substantial support for the va lidity of the Unig enetics te sting. 46from that study \"pre sent another step in support\" of the proposition that the measles virus per sists in the intestinal tiss ue of a utisti c childre n. (Ex. 63, p. 5; Tr. 634A-35A.) 2. Dr. Kennedy Concerning this issue of the validity of the Unig enetics finding s, petitioners also rely on the opinion of Dr. Ronald Kenne dy, who also testified, as noted above, conce rning the issue of whether thimerosal-c ontaining vacci nes can cause immune system damag e. As noted, Dr. Kenne dy has a Ph.D. in microbiolog y, and much experience in study ing viruses and in the development of vaccines. (Tr. 684-85; Ex. 110, pp. 1-3.) Dr. Kenne dy opined that the labora tory group that performed the testing in question was competent. He stated that the labora tory of Dr. John O'Leary, Dr. Orla Sheils, and their colleag ues has a good reputa tion, and has had its work published frequently in peer- revie wed medical journals in recent years. (Ex. 110, p. 7; Ex. 121, pp. 1-2; Tr. 738A-39, 818;66 Snyder Tr. 344A, 351A-52A; Snyder Ex. 30, p. 9.) He explained that in order to perform the particula r testing that resulted in the Uhlmann article , Drs. O'Leary and Sheils and colleagues opened a separ ate, for-profit laboratory business under the Unig enetics Ltd. name. (Tr. 812-13.) The implication of Dr. Kenne dy's testimony was that the general good reputa tion of the O'Leary labora tory in Dublin indicates that the work of the Unig enetics labora tory is also likely to have been competent. Dr. Kenne dy also stated that in the Unig enetics testing in question, the labora tory used proper proce dures, a nd took appropria te measur es to avoid contamination. (Ex. 110, pp. 7-8; Snyder Ex. 30, p. 9.) In addition, Dr. Kenne dy descr ibed a meeting that he attended with sever al other medical scientists, involving a discussion of the work of the Unig enetics laborat ory that resulted in the Uhlmann pape r. He stated that he a nd the other sc ientists aske d a Unig epresentative who attended the meeting , Dr. Sheils, many questions about the testing proce dures, and that Dr. Kenne dy and the other scientists came away with the impression that the testing was valid. (Tr. 808-17, 824A- 25, 844-48, 851A-52; Snyder Tr. 333A- 39A.) The petitioners first filed a version of Ex. 121, Dr. Kenne dy's supplemental expert repor t,66 on October 22, 2007. Howeve r, that version contained an error, so that on November 6, 2007, they filed a corrected version. My citations to Ex. 121 in this Decision are to the corrected version filed on November 6, 2007. 47D. Respondent's evidence Respondent relied upon sever al witnesses conce rning this issue, principally Dr. Brian Ward, Dr. Stephen B ustin, Dr. Be rtus Rima, and Dr. Thoma s MacDona ld.67 1. Dr. Ward Respondent first prese nted the testimony and expert repor t of Dr. Brian Ward, a medical docto r specia lizing in infec tious diseases and immunology , who has experience in the field of the PCR testing technique used in the Uhlmann, Afzal, D'Souza, and simil ar studies. (Ex. CC; Tr. 1795-98A, 1839, 1848-64A.) Dr. Ward explained that PCR is a sensitive technique, not easy to do proper ly, and subject to frequent false positives. He explained that the possibili ty of contamination, there by yielding false positives, is a frequent and serious problem in any labora tory carrying out PCR testing. ( Tr. 1839-43.) Dr. Ward, one of the authors of the D'Souza article , descr ibed in de tail how that study was conducted. (Tr. 1848-56.) He explained that, as noted above, when his group performed PCR testing utiliz ing the primers used by the Uhlmann team in their PCR work, the testing did yield \"positive\" finding s of measles virus from almost all of the tested children, including both the ASD children and the developmenta lly normal children. Howeve r, when the D'Souza researchers performed the additional testing techniques descr ibed in their article , it became clear that the samples which the PCR testing had found to be positive, did not, in fact, contain measles virus. (Tr. 1850-51, 1853A, 1856A.) This result was c onfirmed by the final technique known as \"sequencing ,\" which he descr ibed as the \"gold standard\" test, the test that will \"guarantee\" that one is in fact identify ing I also note that responde nt also submitt ed repor ts, relating to the issue of the validity of the67 Unig enetics testing, from two additional experts who did not ultimately testify at the evidentiar y hearings in Cedillo , Hazlehurst , or Snyder . One such authore d by Dr. Peter Simm onds, a Ph.D. expert in virolog y and PCR techniques, who studied the Unig enetics testing and found it to be unreliable , with its positive results due to either nonspecific primers or contamination. (Snyder Ex. P, entire repor t, espec ially pp. 8-9, 43, 84, 87, 119.) In addition, responde nt submitt ed the repor t of Dr. Michae l Gershon, spec ializi ng in neurog rolog who also opined that the Unig enetics me asles virus testing should not be considere d reliable . (Ex. T, pp. 8-12.) Because Dr. Simm onds and Dr. Gershon did not testify at any evidentiar y hearing, their opinions have played only a seconda ry role in my analy sis, but they do add additional support to the conclusion that I have r eached. In addition, the repor t and hearing testimony of another of the responde nt's experts, Dr. Dianne Griff in, while dealing mostly with other matters, did offer some commentar y on the issue of the validity of the Unig enetics testing. (Ex. V, pp. 5-9; Tr. 2831-36, 2854, Griff in indicated the view that the Unig enetics efforts at testing for measles virus were (Id.; see espec ially Tr. 2833, knowledg eable conce rning the measles virus in general, she stated that she does not claim to be a \"PCR expert\" in particula r. (Tr . 2835B.) Acc ording ly, I have not relied upon he r opinion conce rning this iss ue. 48the genetic materia l in question. (Tr. 1853A.) The process of sequenc ing demonstrated that the samples that had initially appea red to be measles virus materia l by the PCR testing using the Uhlmann prim ers in fact turned out to be human g enetic ma terial, not measles virus. (Tr. 1853A, 1856.) Dr. Ward explained, in sum, that the D'Souza study demonstrated that a major error of the Uhlmann group had been to use primers that produce d \"non-spe cific amplification.\" Those primers erroneously cause d the testing to identify measles virus materia l, when in fact no such measles virus materia l was pre sent. (Tr. 1850- 51, Ex. BB , p. 12; Snyder Tr. 964A- 65A.) Dr. Ward further testified that his labora tory later tested the Uhlmann primers on samples of intestinal (gut) tissue , and the results were similar to the analy sis of blood cells in the above- descr ibed 2006 12; Ex. BB, Att. 29.) The PCR testing using the Uhlmann primers on the intestinal tissue did generate a number of positive results, but when Dr. Ward and his colleag ues completed the \"seque ncing \" proce dure, once again the results showed human genetic materia l, not measles virus materia l. (Tr. 1860A.) These results were published as the D' Souz a 2007 ar ticle. (Ex. BB, A tt. 29.)68 According ly, Dr. Ward expressed the ultimate opinion that he could place no reliance on the work of the Unig enetics labora tory in purportedly finding evidenc e of measles virus in the tissue of autistic children, including in the tissue of Michelle Cedillo. (Tr. 1865.) 2. Dr. Bust in Respondent also prese nted the testimony of Dr. Stephen Bustin, a Ph.D. molecular biologist who has extensive experience in PCR testing. (Tr. 1933-36A.) Dr. Bustin was involved in certain litigation in Great Britain, which conce rned the same general causa tion issue involved in this case, i.e., whether the MMR vaccine can cause autism. Engaged as an expert witness by the vaccine69 Y. D'Souza, S. Dionne, E. Seidman, A. Bitton & B.J. Ward, No Evidenc e of Persisting68 Measles Virus in the Intestinal Tissues of Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease , 56 GUT 886 (2007). ( Ex. BB, Att. 29.) During the early part of this decade, litigation proce eded in Great Britain in which a number69 of claimants contende d that MMR vaccinations contributed to the causa tion of their autism spectrum disorders. Sayers v . SmithKli ne Be echam Plc., 2004 WL 1640222 (Que en's Benc h 2004). Unde r the British legal system, a British governme ntal body known as the Legal Service s Com mission (LSC) provided funding to the claimants to help them assemble and prese nt evidenc e supporting their claims. In September of 2003, howeve r, the LSC withdrew funding for the claimants conce rning their autism claims, concluding that the claimants were not likely to be able to demonstrate that the MMR vaccinations cause d their autism. Id. at paras. 1, 7. (See also Tr. 1116A- 1120.) Subsequently , in the absenc e of L SC funding, most of the autism claimants dec ided not to pursue their claims any further . Sayers , 2004 WL 1640222 at paras. 2, 24, 31. (See also Hazlehurst (continued...) 49manufa cture rs, he was asked to assess the validity of the Unig enetics laboratory's finding s as repor ted in the Uhlmann article . Dr. Bustin was given physical access to the Unig enetics labora tory, was able to inspect and utiliz e the lab's equipment, and had access to all of the data compiled by the Uhlmann researchers in their study . (Tr. 1962A, 1964A-66A; Ex. WW , pp. 3-6.) Dr. Bustin spent more than 1500 hours in his analy sis of the Uhlmann work. (Tr. 1967A.) He prepa red two extensive repor ts that were filed with the cour t presiding over the British l itigation. (Exs. W W, XX.) Dr. Bustin conclude d that the work of the Unig enetic s lab with respe ct to the detec tion of measles virus was sever ely flawe d, and should not be considere d reliable . (E.g., Ex. WW , pp. 7, 58, 61; Ex. XX, pp. 7, 53; Tr. 2035-37.) In addition to the lengthy expert repor ts that he prepa red for the British litigation, he prepa red an expert report (Ex. UU) for this case, and he also testified at length during the evidentiar y hearing in this case (Tr. 1933-2069). In his repor ts and his testimony , Dr. B ustin identified many differ ent problems with the Unig enetics la boratory and its work. Dr. Bustin explained tha t proper use of \"contr ols\" is crucial to deter mining whether a PCR technique is working proper ly. \"Positive controls\" are samples that definitely do have the targeted gene, w hile \"neg ative controls\" are samples that def initely do not include the tar geted g ene. O nly if the positive controls routinely test positive in a lab's PCR testing, and negative controls routinely test negative, can one be confident t hat the lab's test is working accurate ly. (Tr. 1938A-40.) But when Dr. Bustin closely examined the results of the Uhlmann study , he found that in approximately one-third of Unig enetics' testing procedur es (\"runs\"), the lab obtained positive results for their negative controls. Dr. Bustin testified that this result meant that contamination was rampa nt in the Unig enetics la 50-52.) (...continued)69 Tr. 661A.) (As far as I am aware, the British court has not issued any formal ruling conce rning any of the a utism claims.) A num ber of the ex perts pre sented in this case , by both the petitioners and the respondent, previously prepa red expert repor ts for use in that British litigation. Those experts included petitioners' experts Dr. Kinsbourne, Dr. Kenne dy, Dr. Byers, and Dr. Krigsman, along with responde nt's experts Dr. MacD onald. Appar ently , by order of the British court, experts who submitt ed such repor ts to the British court are not at liberty to divulge copies of those repor ts, and have restric tions as to the extent to which they may publicly discuss the contents of those repor ts. Those expert repor ts, and other documents that were submitt ed to the British court, rema in in a seale d file under the control of tha t court. As will be discussed below (p. 79), there is a proce dure by which access to documents from the seale d file may be soug ht from the court. In the spring of 2007, responde nt's counsel petitioned the British court and obtained copies of four expert repor ts that were filed with the British court by experts for the vaccine manufa cture rs. Copies of two of those repor ts, by Dr. Bustin, were filed into the record of this case (Exs. WW and XX), while copies of the other two repor ts, by Dr. Peter Simm onds and Dr. Rima, we re filed into the rec ord of the Snyder case (Snyder Exs. P and S). 50Dr. Bustin explained a particula r problem with the physical layout of the labora tory, which migh t well have resulted in the contamination that he believes to have plagued the Unig enetics laboratory. (Tr. 2021-23.) In addition, he discussed problems with the labora tory's notebo oks, which descr ibe in detail their testing proce dures. Those notebooks, he discovere d, had been altere d after the fa ct, which wa s certainly improper a nd perha ps fra udulent. (Tr. 2026-2032; see also Ex. WW , pp. 35, 37-38.) Dr. Bustin also testified that the Unig enetics Ltd. labora tory was not accredited, and that the labora tory declined to participa te in a quality -control program, so that \"ther e was never any70 independe nt quality assessment made of any of the work that was carried out by Unig enetics.\" (Tr. 2034, 2057A.) In addition, Dr. Bustin pointed out serious problems with the physical equipment that he observe d in the Unig enetics lab, problems that would have affected the PCR testing results. (Tr. 1998-2000; Ex. WW , pp. 15-16.) Unig enetics labora tory proce dures. For example, sometimes the guidelines of the testing equipment m anufa cture rs were not followed, which could erroneously make negative results appea r to be positive results. (Tr.71 2002, 2005, 2009-10A.) As another example, the technicia ns on some occasions used twice as much of a certain \"probe \" substance as on other occasions. (Tr. 2025A.) Dr. Bustin also pointed out problems with the quality of the RNA being used for the testing, concluding that about one-third of the samples used by Unig enetics should have been considere d unacc eptable for PCR because of the poor quality of the RNA. ( Tr. 1996-98; Ex. W W, pp. 17-19.) Dr. Bustin explained that some types of tissue samples are better suited for PCR testing than others, and that Unig enetics received two types of tissue samples, \"fresh-f rozen\" and \"formalin - fixed.\" (Tr. 1970A; Ex. WW at 18.) He testified that on a number of occasions the Unig enetics testing yielded equivalent outcomes from fresh-frozen and formalin-f ixed samples, a result that could only occur if the test was detec ting a contaminant, rathe r than measles virus. (Tr. 1970A-73, 2035; Ex. UU, p. 6; Ex. W W, p. 18.) Dr. Bustin noted that on two occasions, the Unig enetics technicia pos itive results for detection of measles virus on each occasion. (Tr. 1980-83A.) Dr. Bustin stated that such a result is impossibl e, A published article confirme d that Unig enetics ha d declined to participa te in the quality -70 control program. M. Afzal et al., Comparative Evaluation of Measles Virus-Specific RT-PCR Methods Through an International Collaborat ive Study , 70 J. MED. VIROLOGY 171 (2003). (Ex. V, Att. 1, p. 175.) Dr. Bustin's testimony suggested the possibili ty that the Unig enetics personne l might have71 been deliberately using incorre ct settings on their t esting machine, in order to generate \"positive\" results that might support the MMR/autism causation theor y. (Tr. 2009- 11A.) 51so that the supposedly positive results can only be explained by contamination in the labora tory. (Tr. 1975A-76A; 1982-83A .) Another problem Dr. Bustin involved \"discorda nt replica tes\"-- i.e., instances in which the Unig enetics labora tory tested two samples from the same source , which should have either been both positive for measles virus or both negative, but instead one tested positive and one negative. (Ex. WW , pp. 43-48; Tr. 2013-14.) Dr. Bustin stated that it is inappropr iate for a lab in such a situation to report the biopsy as either positive or negative; instead, the samples should be tested again. (Ex. WW , p. 43.) Yet Unig enetics repeatedly repor ted positive results in such situations, which Dr. Bustin descr ibed as an \"unac cepta ble scientific practice.\" (Ex. WW , p. 9, fourth par a.) Dr. Bustin's overall conclusion, after his complete assessment of the Unig enetics work, was72 that it is \"clear\" that, in its testing for measles virus RNA, that labora tory was erroneously detec ting a DNA contaminant , and not detec ting measles virus RNA. (Tr. 2035-37.) He stated that \"I do not believe there is any measles virus in any of the cases they have looked at.\" (Tr. 2036, emphasis added.) He added that this opinion extended specific ally to the Unig enetics test result repor ted for Michelle Cedillo. (Tr. 2037.) 3. Dr. Rim a Respondent also relied upon the testimony of Dr. Bertus Rima, whose exper t reports and hearing testimony were prese nted in the Snyder case. (Snyder Exs. S and V; Snyder Tr. 824A-73 938A.) Dr. Rima is a Ph.D. virolog ist with extensive experience in study ing the measles vaccine and in PCR testing. (Snyder Tr. 826A- 829A, 851A-52A .) Like Dr. B ustin, Dr. Rima was retained by the vaccine manufa cture rs involved in the above- descr ibed British litigation, and in that capacity obtained access to the Unig enetics labora tory and its records. (Snyder Tr. 849A-50A, 853A-54A.) Dr. Ri ma prepare d a lengt hy expert repor t for the British court. (Snyder Ex. S.) Like Dr. Bustin, Dr. Rima stated the opinion that the measles virus detec tion results repor ted by the Unigenetics labora tory, both in the Uhlmann study and in the testing of individuals such as Michelle Cedillo and Colten Snyder, were invalid and unreliable. (See, e.g., Snyder Tr. 846A, 902, 928A- 29A; Snyder Ex. S, part of Dr. Rima's observa tions, conce rning sever e problems he saw with the work of the Unig enetics labora tory, were simil ar to those of Dr. Bustin. For example, Dr. Rima confirme d Dr. Bustin's descr iption of an in one of the Unig enetics labora tory notebooks. In his leng thy expert repor t filed in the British litiga tion, Dr. Bustin also pointed to many72 other proble ms that he found with the Unig enetics w ork, too numerous to list here. ( Ex. WW .) An affidavit of Dr. Rima was filed into the record of this Cedillo case on May 22, 2007,73 attache d to responde nt's \"Motion In Limine .\" Howeve r, his opinion was prese nted in a much more complete f ashion in the Snyder case , so I quote her e from those materials. 52(Snyder Tr. 855A-56A.) He noted the fact that in certain instances the Unig enetics technicia ns had failed to do the necessary step of \"reverse transcr iption,\" yet still obtained a positive finding for measles virus RNA, an impossibi lity that indicated that the positive results could only have been a result of contamination. (Snyder Tr. 897A-98A.) Dr. Rima also agreed with Dr. Bustin's \"fresh -frozen\" samples and \"formalin-fixed\" samples, it was a nonsensical result that could be explained only by contamination. (Snyder Tr. 898A.) In addition, Dr. Rima agreed with Dr. Bustin that Unig enetics seriously erred in the way in which it treated \"discordant replicates\"- -instance s in which testi ng of two samples from the same source yielded one positive and one neg ative re sult. Dr. Rima stated that the Unig enetics pr actice of simply ignor ing the negative result in such situat ions \"is a wholly unscientific practice and indicates bias in the interpre tation of these results.\" (Snyder Ex. S, part B, p. 45, para. 4.31; see also Snyder Ex. S, part B, p. 19, pa ra. 3.35; Snyder Tr. 865A.) Dr. Rima also pointed to additional reasons for concluding that contamination was the reason for Unig enetics' positive finding s of measles virus. He pointed out that perhaps the most risky situation with regard to conta mination in a labora tory is when the lab uses large numbers of \"plasmids\" of a particula r virus, and noted that the Unig enetics labora tory in fact did utiliz e measles virus plasmids in its work, making it seem quite possible that contamination from plasmids was the reason for the Unig enetics positive finding s of measles virus. (Snyder Tr. 853A.) Further, he pointed out that in many instances in the Unig enetics testing, samples that were located closer to a positive control on the testing plate were more likely to be found positive, a probable result of contamination. ( Snyder Tr. 879A- 80A; Snyder Ex. S, part B, p. 19, pa ra. 3.34.) In short, Dr. Rima t estified that a number of measle s experts, like himself, had studied the efforts of the Unig enetics labora tory to detec t measles virus in human tissue, and conclude d that the Unig enetics testing \"simply does not work\" --i.e., such testing is not able to reliably detec t whether measles virus is prese nt. (Snyder Tr. 928A-29A.) Dr. Rima found the Unig enetics measles testing results to be complete ly unreliable and invalid. ( Snyder Tr. 846A, 902, 928A-29A; Snyder Ex. S, part B , pp. 75-76.) Dr. Rima a dded that this opinion applies to all of the Unig enetics testing for measles virus, including the test perf ormed on Miche lle Cedillo. ( Snyder Tr. 903.) 4. Dr. MacDonald Another of responde nt's experts was Dr. Thomas MacD onald, who filed an expert repor t and testified i n the Hazlehurst case. (Hazlehurst Ex. A; Hazlehurst Tr. at 603-76A.) Dr. MacDonald is Ph.D. immunologist who specia lizes in the immun ology of the human gut (intestines). (Hazlehurst Ex. A, p. 1; Hazlehurst Tr. at 603- 11A.) L ike Drs. B ustin and Rima, Dr. MacD onald was an expert in the British MMR/autism litigation descr ibed above. (Hazlehurst Tr. at 611A.) Unlike the situation with respe ct to Drs. Bustin and Rima, howeve r, Dr. MacD onald's expert repor t filed in the British litigation has not been unseale d by the British court, and, there fore, has not been filed into the rec ord of this ca se or the Snyder or Hazlehurst cases. There fore, Dr. Mac Donald, as 53an expe rt who was appar ently given access to medical records of the claimants in the British litigation, was not free to testify conce rning the Unig enetics testing records of those claimants. (Id. at 650A.) Dr. MacD onald did, howeve r, provide an opinion conce rning the validity of the Unig enetics testing. H e stated tha t the Uhlmann ar ticle was \" one of the worst\" medic al journal article s that he has ever seen (Hazlehurst Tr. at 650A), which was published in the \"wor st journal that has ever been seen, a journal which is subsequently no longe r in existence \" (id. at 649A). He opined that the Unig enetics te sting wa s not credible or re liable. ( Id. at 650A.) Dr. MacD onald's assig nment in the British litigation was to look at one particula r type of PCR testing among the techniques used by Unig enetics. Concerning his analy sis of that technique as used in the Uhlmann study , he wr ote as follows: I have had the opportunity to examine the majority of those so-ca lled positive in cell- PCR slides and discovere d ing discrepanc ies betwee n the methodologie s repor ted in the Uhlmann et al paper and what was actua lly done in the lab. The technique is completely unreliable with an unacceptably high experimental failure rate, many of the control sections were destroy ed during the pr ocessing , the wrong technica l controls were being used, and the claims of positivi ty or negativity were subjective and spurious. In cell-PCR does not detec t measles virus in the lymphoid tissue of children w ith autism. (Hazlehurst Ex. A, p. 14.) E. An alysis As noted above, after considering all of the evidenc e, I conclude that the Unig enetics testing for the de tection of mea sles virus was not reliable . I conclude that it is not likely that Unig enetics ever reliably detec ted the prese nce of measles virus, in the case of Michelle Cedillo, in the Uhlmann study , or in the other children whose specimens were tested by that labora tory. I found the testimony of the responde nt's experts conce rning this point to be far more persua sive than that of the petitioners' e xperts. I will detail the main rea sons for my conclusion below. 541. Failu re of other rese archers to replicate the Unigenetics findings In scienc e, when one research team makes a finding conce rning an important issue, the scientific community usually does not immediately endorse that finding as accurate . Instead, the first researc h team publishes its results, explaining its experimental proce dures. Then, other research teams will attempt to \"replicate\" the first group's finding s, by utiliz ing either the same experimental techniques as the first team, or other experimental proce dures. Only if differ ent research teams are able to re ach the same results, after their own experiments, doe s the scientific c ommunity become likely to accept the finding as probably true. (E.g., Snyder Ex. S, part B, p. 23, para. 3.49.) This is espec ially true in PCR testing, in which there is a great possibili ty that contamination in a labora tory can c reate \"false positives.\" ( Id.) In the case of the Unigenetics testing for detec tion of measles virus in humans, the Unig enetics finding s were, in fact, published in the Uhlmann article . Then, two other research teams did perform simil ar experiments in an attempt to replica te the results of the Uhlmann study , and those teams published their own results. But those other research groups have not confi rmed the Uhlmann finding s; instead, those groups reached results that, to the contra ry, strongly cast doubt on the validity of the Unig enetics study . One of the attempts to replica te the Uhlmann study , as noted above, was the Afzal 2006 study . Afzal and colleag ues tested certain blood cells, known as \"PMBCs,\" of 15 children suffe ring from autism spectrum disorders, all of whom had received the MMR vaccine, for measles virus. The researchers utiliz ed a number of testing methodologie s, but found none of the samples positive for measles virus by any test. (Ex. T, Att. 2; Tr. 1848.) The second study was also published in 2006, by D'Souza and colleag ues. As also detailed above, the D'Souza rese archers teste d the blood cells (PM BCs) of 88 children, 54 dia gnosed with ASD and 34 developmenta lly normal, for measles virus. (Ex. T, Att. 6, p. 1664.) At least 51 of the 54 ASD children, and at least 31 of the 34 developmenta lly normal children, had received the MMR vaccine. ( Id. at 1669.) The authors' ulti mate conclusion was that none of the studied childre n, in either the ASD group or the developmenta lly normal group, in fact had persisting measles virus infec tion. ( Id. at 1670-71.) Thus, two independe nt research teams have made efforts to replica te the Unig enetics results, but have failed to do so. This fact alone gives substantial reason to doubt the validity of the Unig enetics te sting. (Mor eover , the work of the D'Souza team ha s not only failed to re plicate the Unig enetics findings, but has also added an additional strong reason to doubt the validity of the Unig enetics te sting, a s I will detail in the following subse ction.) With respect to this issue of replica tion, witnesses for both parties have repor ted that one British research scientist, Dr. Cotter, did attempt, in the context of the above- descr ibed British litigation, to replica te the Uhlmann tea m's work, but t hose wit nesses differ concer ning the results of Dr. Cotte r's testing. Petitioners' expert Dr. Kenne dy, during hearing testimony , stated that he 55attended a meeting during which Dr. Cot ter orally repor ted that hi s testing reac hed results simil ar to those repor ted by Uhlmann. (Snyder Tr. 347A-49A.) Petitioners argue , thus, that Dr. Cot ter's alleg ed re sults support the validity of the Unig enetics te sting. (P2, p. 13; P4, two direc tly contra dicted Dr. Kenne dy's statements in this regard. Dr. Rima testified that Dr. Cotter was asked by the claimants' attorney s to attempt to replica te the Uhlmann work, but that when he did attempt to do so, he failed to obtain any positive results. (Snyder Tr. 894A-95A, 897A.) Simi larly, Dr. Bustin stated that Dr. Cotter's replica tion efforts failed to yield any positive results. (Tr. 2015A-16.) According ly, responde nt argues that Dr. Cotter's w ork is y et more e vidence of the unreliabilit y of the Unig enetics te sting. Given this very limited record conce rning Dr. Cotter's work, I conclude that it is simply impossibl e to draw any conclusions either way. No records of Dr. Cotter's work, and no testimony or statement f rom him, have be en pre sented. No c onclusions can r easona bly be dra wn. What is undisputed, howeve r, is tha t Dr. Cotter's work, whateve r its re sult, ha s never been published. On the other hand, the Afzal and D'Souza groups did, in fact, publish their work, subjecting it to scientific scrutiny . This publication factor affords good reason to place relianc e upon their results. Daubert v. Merre ll Dow Pharmace uticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 593-94 (1993). I do find it appropr iate to place relianc e on the published results of the Afzal and D'Souza studies, while I can draw no conclusions, in either dire ction, from the testimony conce rning Dr. Cotter.74 2. Sequencing Another important reason for my conclusion conce rns a proce dure known as \"seque ncing .\" As noted above, when testing for the prese nce of genetic materia l of a certain target, sequenc ing is the ultimate te st tha t can give assura nce that the testing has actua lly identified the genetic materia l in question, and not some other sort of genetic materia l. (Tr. 1853A.) Petitioners' own expert One other scientist involved in the British litigat ion, Dr. Peter Simm onds, also tried to74 replica te the finding s of the Uhlmann study . He performed PCR testing on samples from claimants from the British litigation di scussed above, but the results of his testing were differ ent from those of Unig enetics. Whil e Unig enetics repor ted positive results for measles virus in some of those samples, Dr. Simmonds found all of the samples to be negative for the prese nce of measles virus. (Snyder Tr. 896A-97A; Snyder Ex. P, see espec ially p. 43.) Dr. Simm onds' own lengthy repor t, filed into the Snyder record, descr ibes those efforts. (Snyder Ex. P.) Howeve r, the results of Dr. Simmonds' effort have not been published, to my knowledg e. (It seems likely that Dr. Simm onds was not at liberty to publish this work, because it was performed for the British court.) Further, Dr. Simm onds did not testify in Cedillo , Snyder , or Hazlehurst . According ly, in my resolution of t his issue, I have not accorded he avy weig ht to Dr. Simm onds' re sults. On the other hand, we do have Dr. Simmonds' lengthy writt en report , which provides even more detail conce rning his replication ef forts than would likely in a published pape r. Ther efore, Dr. Simmonds' failure to re plicate the U hlmann finding s does add at least some a dditional reason to doubt the reliability of the Unig enetics te sting e fforts. 56Dr. Hepn that sequenc ing is the \"gold standard\" for assure dly identify ing the prese nce of the targeted materia l, and petitioners' other expert, Dr. Kenne dy, agreed that sequenc ing is important. (Tr. 673A, 824A.) Both Dr. Ward a nd Dr. B ustin testified that in developing a new PCR test for a particula r target, as Unig enetics was attempting to do, a labora tory needs to perform the sequenc ing step on some of the samples that its new test has identified as containing the target, to ensure tha t the test is ide ntifying the target and only the target. (Tr. 1856A, 1945A.) Dr. Rima, too, testified t hat sequenc ing is a \"require d\" step in such a testing pr ocess, in order to confirm the identification of the target and ensure that the test is not a \"false positive.\" (Snyder Ex. S, part B, p. 21, para. 3.41; see also p. 46, para. 4.34.) He added that because of the high risk in PCR testing of conta mination c ausing false positives, it is espec ially important to carr y out sequenc ing. ( Id. at p 22, para. 3.47.) And Dr. Kenne dy acknow ledged that \"anyone that was doing PCR at the time, * * * y ou knew that y ou neede d to sequenc e to ver ify it.\" (Tr. 825.) In the ca se of the me asles virus dete ction testing perfor med by the Unigene labora tory, however, there is no persua sive evidenc e that Unig enetics ever performed the sequenc ing step to confirm their theory that they were identify ing measles virus. The Uhlmann article does not state that sequenc ing was underta ken. (Ex. 63, Tab U.) Both Dr. Bustin and Dr. Rima had access to the Unig enetics records, and neither mentioned any records of sequenc ing. Dr. Ward confirme d that there is no evidenc e that Unig enetics ever performed sequenc petitioners' two rning this issue, Dr. Hepne r, acknow ledged flatly that the Uhlmann researchers \"did not\" do sequenc ing. (Tr. 673.) And petitioners' other Dr. Kenne dy, acknow ledged that, to his knowledg e, no sequenc ing da ta has ne ver be en published by Unig enetics. ( Tr. 826.) Moreover, when other researchers did perform the sequenc ing proce dure, in conjunction with attempts to identify measles virus using PCR techniques simil ar to those used by the Unig enetics labora tory, their results cast gra ve doubt upon the reliabilit y of the Unigene tics techniques. First, as noted above, the D'Souza 2006 research team used the Uhlmann primers in PCR testing on human blood cells, and did obtain positive results for measles virus on most of the samples tested. But when the sequenc ing proce dure was then performed, it turned out that the materia l identified by the PCR test as measles virus materia l was, in fact, not measles virus, but human genetic materia l. (Ex. T, Att. 6, p. 1671; Tr. 1853A, 1856A.) A simil ar result occur red when the D'Souza team later tested the Uhlmann PCR primers on samples of intestinal (gut) tissue. That is, they obtained some \"positive\" results purporting to detec t measles virus, but when they completed the sequenc ing proce dure, on ce again the results showed human genetic materia l, not measles virus materia l. (Tr. 1859-61; Ex. BB, p. 12; Ex. BB, Tab 29.) PCR testing for measles virus was also performed by Nicholas Chadwick, who in 1996 was a Ph.D. student working in a London labora tory for Dr. Andre w Wakefield. (Tr. 2283-84; Ex. QQ, pp. 1-2.) Chadwick performed PCR testing on gut l for measles virus detec tion, and, althou gh the samples usually tested negative, occasionally he did obtain positive 57results. (Tr. 2284; Ex. QQ, paras. 8, 12.) But when he then performed sequenc ing on those positive samples, the seque ncing reve aled that a ll had been false positives. (Tr. 2284; Ex. QQ, para. 12.) In this regard, it is true that petitioners' expert Dr. Kenne dy did testify that he was told orally by Dr. Sheils of Unig enetics that the Uhlmann authors had done sequenc ing that confirme d their positive findings of me asles virus in the Uhlmann study children. ( Tr. 824A.) Howeve r, I simply find it to be quite unlikely that such sequenc ing was in fa ct done. The Uhlmann ar ticle itself does not mention sequenc ing. As Dr. Kenne dy himself admitted, no sequenc ing data was ever published. (Tr. 826.) The petitioners have not offered any statements from any of the 11 Uhlmann article authors to verify Dr. Kenne dy's asser tion that sequenc ing was done. Moreove r, the petitioners have failed even to suggest any reason why the Uhlmann author s might have actua lly succe ssfully done sequenc ing, yet never published the data. And, given how much public attention has been given to the MMR/autism controve rsy, it simply seems extremely unlikely that the Uhlmann authors would have failed to publish their sequenc ing work had they actua lly done it as Dr. Kenne dy descr ibes. According ly, I cannot credit the assertion that Unig enetics conducte d sequenc ing, confirming a finding of mea sles virus in the tested samples, but neve r published such wor k. In short, the evidenc e conce rning sequencing provides very important evidenc e that the Unig enetics testing should not be considered reliable , in two respe cts. First, the failure of Unig enetics to ever publish any sequenc ing data, to confirm that labora tory's alleg ed finding s of measles virus in their testing of human tissue, is very damag ing by itself. As Drs. Ward, Rima, and Bustin persua sively argued, when PCR researchers devise a new test, sequenc ing is a necessary step in order to ha ve any degree of confide nce in the result. Unig enetics' failure to publish sequenc ing data in this instance means that there is simply no reason to have confide nce in their results. As Dr. Ward added, the lack of sequenci ng by Unigenetics was a \"fatal flaw\" in their work. (Tr. 1912A.) Second, as explained above, when other researchers (i.e., the D'Souza group and Dr. Chadwic k) obtained purportedly positive findings of me asles virus using PCR techniques, the follow-up sequenc ing positive results for dete ction of mea sles virus by those technique s were in fac t false positives . In short, the evidenc e conce rning sequenc ing show s very strongly that the Unig enetics results must be considere d unreliable and invalid. 3. Problem s with Unigenetics procedures, fac ilities, and equipm ent As explained above, Drs. Bustin and Rima had full access to the Unig enetics labora tory, equipment, and records, and both of those highly -qualified experts pointed out a host of sever e problems with Unig enetics' facilities, equipment, and proce dures. I have already detailed above some of the problems pointed out by those experts ( see pp. 49-53 above) , and will not repeat them here. I simply note that I found both witnesses to be sincere and persua sive, so that all of those 58problems identified by the two experts give me another strong reason to doubt the validity of the Unig enetics te sting. Concerning this matter, the testimony of Drs. Bustin and Rima was also supported by the testimony of Dr. MacD onald. Dr. MacD onald, as noted above, also was an expert witness in the British litigation, and also had access to the Unig enetics records and facilities. (Hazlehurst Tr. 650A; Hazlehurst Ex. A, p. 14.) Dr. MacD onald commented only very briefly conce rning this issue. But he reported that in the particula r type of PCR testing that he examined, the Unig enetics technique was \"complete ly unreliable with an unacc eptably high experimental failure rate, * * * the wrong technica l controls were being used, and the claims of positivi ty or negativity were subjective or spurious.\" (Hazlehurst Ex. A, p. 14.) Dr. MacD onald's comments, thus, while ext reme ly brief and undetailed, do provide at least some support for the conclusions of Drs. Bustin and Rima about the Unig enetics pr ocedur es. Another important problem with the Unig enetics' work was the failure to use the proce dure of \"blinding\" in pe rforming the Uhlmann \"Blinding\" me ans that the labora tory technicia ns do not know whet her the particula r samples that they are analy zing are from the patient group of interest (in the Uhlmann study , autistic children) , or the \"contr ol\" group (in the Uhlmann study , the non-autistic children) . In scientific experiments, blinding is \"critical,\" to preve nt conscious or subconscious biases, or the desire to reach a certain result, from affecting the results. (E.g., 669-70, Tr. 2863.) The Uhlmann article did not state whether the technicia ns were blinded, but responde nt's expert Dr. Gr iffin stated that if blinding were used, tha t would ha ve been noted in the article . (Tr. 2866.) Respondent's expert Dr. Ward, who has performed PCR experiments himself, confirme d that his interpreta tion of the Uhlmann study was that it was not blinded. (Tr . 1846.) I conclude that the Uhlmann study likely was not blinded, and that such failure to use the blinding proce dure provides another strong reason to doubt the reliability of the Unig enetics testing repor ted in that study . To be sure, I note that the petitioners' two witnesses conce rning this general issue, Drs. Hepne r and Kenne dy, did try to defend the Unig enetics labora tory against the criticisms of Dr. Bustin and Dr. Rima. Both Dr. Hepne r and Dr. Kenne dy made general statements to the effect that, in its measles virus detec tion wor k, the Uhlmann team used iate appropria te iate steps to minimi ze the possibili ty of contamination. (Ex. 63, pp. 1-3; Ex. 110, pp. 7-8; Tr. 610A-28.) In addition, Dr. Kenne dy also descr ibed a meeting that he attended with sever al other medical scientists, involving a discussion of the work of the Unig enetics labora tory that resulted in the Uhlmann paper . He stated that during that meeting he and the other scientists asked the Unig enetics representa tive, Dr. Sheils, many questions about the testing proce dures, and that he and the other scientists came away with the impression that the testing was valid. (Tr. 808- 17, found the efforts of Drs. Hepne r and Kenne dy to defend the Unig enetics work to be largely ineffe ctive. Their testimon y was simply too summary and 59nonspecific to answe r the criticisms leveled by Drs. Bustin and Rima, which were specific and detailed. In this regard, I note that I have considere d Dr. Kenne dy's testimony conce rning the meeting descr ibed above. I do not doubt that such a meeting took place , that Dr. Sheils participa ted, and that Dr. Kenne dy and the others questioned her about the Unig enetics work in question. But I do not find that this testimony from Kenne dy gives me a strong reason to conclude that the Unig enetics testing can be considere d reliable . The meeting descr ibed by Dr. Kennedy was not a meeting of disinterested scientists. Rather, that meeting was called by the attorneys representing those claimants in the British litigation descr ibed above (see fn. 69) who contende d that their autism was cause d by the MMR vaccine. The attending scientists appar ently were individuals who either had already agreed to serve as paid experts for those claimants, or who were being recruited to serve as paid experts. (Tr. 809-810.) Thus, e ven to the extent that one accepts Dr. Kenne dy's asser tion that the group was favor ably impressed by Unig enetics work, the fact that such a group reached such a conclusion is not a par ticularly strong item of evidenc e that the Unig enetics te sting wa s reliable. Further, Dr. Kenne dy has told us very little about exactly what Dr. Shiels said that so impressed the group. No transcr ipt or notes of the meeting have been produce d. None of the other participa nts in the meeting have pr ovided conf irmation of Dr. K ennedy 's account. Given all of those circumsta nces, and in light of all of the other evidenc e of record in this case casting doubt on the validity of the Unig enetics work in question, I simply cannot accept Dr. Kenne dy's summary assura nce about this meeting --i.e., his testimony to the effect that \"we asked lots of questions, we were satisfied with Dr. Sheils' answe rs\"--as strong evidenc e that the Unig enetics testing was valid. In the context of all of the evidenc e conce rning that issue in the record befor e me, I cannot find that Dr. Kenne dy's testimony about the meeting is sufficie nt to persua de me to simply ignor e all of the specific criticisms of Drs. Bustin and Rima and to conclude that the Unig enetics te sting wa s reliable.75 Another item of evidence is a letter from Dr. Michae l Oldstone, a medical doctor75 specia lizing in viral immunobiol ogy. Ex. AA.) expert Dr. Kenne dy acknow ledged that Dr. Oldstone is a \"very eminent virolog ist\" with many publications in that field. (Snyder Tr. 393A.) Dr. Oldstone had been asked to consider eng aging in a collaborative resea rch projec t with Drs. Wakefi eld and O'Leary relating to the Wakefield MMR/causation theory . (Id.; Snyder Tr. 954A.) To help him decid e whether to participa te, Dr. Oldstone decide d to test the performanc e of the O'L eary labora tory in detec ting measles vi rus. He prepar ed samples, some of which were infec ted with measles virus, some not, and sent them to Dr. O'Leary for testing. Dr. O'L eary's assessments were wrong about 20 percent of the time during each of two rounds of testing. (Snyder Ex. AA; Snyder Tr. 954A-958A.) Dr. Oldstone then decide d not to engage in the collabora tive projec t with Dr. O'Leary. (Snyder Ex. AA; Snyder Tr. 958A.) Dr. Oldstone attempted to have the results of his test of the O'Leary lab published, but the group that gave Oldstone the funding to prepa re the samples prohibited him from doing so. (Snyder Tr. 954A, 958A.) Dr. Ward explained that the 20 percent error rate would be considere d completely issue the validity of the Unig enetics testing for measles virus, petitioners i n their briefs have raised severa l arguments. Some of those arg uments I have alrea dy addre ssed above ; others I will address he re. a. Dr. Hepner's criticism s of the Afzal and D'Sou za studi es One of the petitioners' primary arguments conce rning this issue (see P1 at 140-41, 151-53) has been that the Afzal 2006 and D'Souza 2006 studies were flawe d as attempts to replica te the Uhlmann work. Petitioners' expert Dr. Hepne r pointed to two differ ences between the Uhlmann study and both the Afzal 2006 and D'Souza 2006 studies, which she found to be signific ant. First, while Uhlmann tested intestinal (gut) tissue, Afzal and D'Souza tested blood cells (\"PMB Cs\"). Second, while Uhlmann tested childre n who had a \"deve lopmental disorder\" plus some type of gastrointestinal symptoms, both Afzal and D'Souza tested children who were autistic but did not have g astrointestinal problems. (Ex. 63, p. 4; Tr. 629A-31A.) Respondent's experts, howeve r, responde d effectively to this argument. As to the Afzal and D'Souza groups' decision to test blood cells instead of intestinal tissue, responde nt's experts stated that those researchers were unable to readily obtain a sufficie nt number of intestinal biopsy samples from autistic children. They explained that it would have been unethical to take intestinal biopsies from autistic children mere ly for such a research purpose, in the absenc e of a demonstrated need for gut biopsy because of actua l intestinal problems. (See, e.g., Tr. 1858A-59A, 1900A-01A; Snyder Tr. 895A-96A, 938A.) But, more importantly , responde nt's experts argued that testing blood cells instead of gut tissue was a fair and appropriate way to test the validity of the Uhlmann finding s, for two reasons. First, Dr. Ward explained that if, in fact, as the Uhlman n group theorized, measles virus was replica ting in the intestinal tissue of autistic children, then measles virus would necessarily have to be in those children' s blood cells as well. (Tr. 1849-50.) Dr. Bustin and Dr. Rima agreed. (...continued)75 inappropria diag ( Snyder Tr. 956A.) Petitioners' expert Dr. Kennedy attempted to answe r Dr. O ldstone's letter, sug gesting that it mig ht ha ve bee n the Oldstone labora tory that err ed. ( Snyder Tr. 335A- 37A.) How ever, I found Dr. Ward to be persua sive in arguing that such a possibili ty is not likely , in lig ht of Dr. Oldstone's 50-year history as a me ticulous reknowne d scientist. ( Snyder Tr. 958A- 60A.) Because Dr. Oldstone himself did not testify , and bec ause his data were not published (for whateve r reason), I have not place d any relianc e on this item of evidenc e. I mere ly note that this would simply amount to another reason to doubt the accuracy of the Unigenetics labora tory's the petitioners' experts persua sively refuted this point.76 Second, Dr. Ward also pointed out another reason why testing the blood cells was an appropr iate way to test the validi ty of the Uhlmann s tudy. He noted that the D'Souz a 2006 study demonstrated, through its sequenc ing data, that the Uhlmann primers were not effective at identify ing measles virus only. The Uhlmann primer s were, instead, \"nonspec ific\"- -i.e., they erroneously identified, as measles virus, materia l that was in fact human genetic materia l. (Tr. 1850- 57; Ex. BB, p. 12; Snyder Tr. 9 64A-65A.) He pointed out that if those primers give \"nonspecif ic results\" in any human biologic materia l (i.e., blood cells), then they are suspect to give nonspecific results in all biologic materia ls (e.g., gut tissue). (Tr. 1858A.) Petitioners did not attempt to refute this specific point. Next, the testimony from responde nt's experts, discussed above, also makes it clear that Dr. Hepne r is mistaken in the second part of her argument, when she argues that the Afzal 2006 and D'Souza 2006 studies should be disre garded beca use they studied autistic children without reg ard to gastrointestinal dysfunction, while Uhlmann studied children with both a developmenta l disorder and gastroin testinal dysfunction. That is, the work of the D'Souza group in its 2006 and 2007 articles demonstrates that it doesn't matter whether the Uhlmann group studied children with or without gastrointestinal dysfunction, because the D'Souza group showed, with its sequenc ing data, that the Uhlmann primers simply are not specific to measles virus only. The Uhlmann testing, rathe r, was erroneously identify ing human genetic materia l as measles virus. As Dr. Ward pointed out without refutation, if primers give nonspecific results in one type of biologic materia l, such primers are suspect in all types of mate rial. (Tr . 1857A-58A.) I find that responde nt's expert evidenc e in this regard was persua sive, and that such evidenc e convincing ly refutes this arg ument of Dr. H epner . Petitioners' expert , the measles virus76 would trave l throug h the body via the bloodstream. (E.g., Tr. 1085, 1135A, 1139.) There fore, said Dr. Ward, if Dr. Kinsbourne' s theory is right, then the virus should be found in the blood as well as the intestines and brain. (Tr. 1849-50.) To be sure, Dr. Kinsbourne did state that it was a \"possibility \" that at times the virus would be prese nt only in gut and brain, but not in the blood. (Tr. 1141-43.) But Dr. Kinsbourne did not explain why that possibili ty could occur . I found Dr. Ward to be persua sive conce rning this point, in testify ing that, if Dr. Kinsbourne' s causa tion theory is correct that a persistent measles virus infec tion is causing autism, then the prese nce of measles virus ought to be detec table in the blood. Further, another of petitioners' experts, Dr. Hepne r, acknow ledged that if measles virus was prese nt in the body , it could be in the blood. (Tr. 646- 47.) 62b. The O'Le ary laboratory's general reputation Another argument raised by petitioners involved Dr. Kenne dy's testimony that the O'Leary labora tory in general has had a good reputa tion, frequently having its work published in peer- revie wed medical journals in recent years, and even winning an award. (P1, pp. 155, 159, 253; Ex.77 110, p. 7; Ex. 818; Snyder Tr. 320A- 21A, 344A; Snyder Ex. 30, p. 9.) This argument does have some appea l. Respondent has not demonstrated the existence of any problems with the O'Leary labora tory outside of the measles virus detec tion efforts that are relevant here. It is, indeed, somewhat difficult to reconcile Dr. Kenne dy's testimony, concerning the general78 work of the O'Leary labora tory, with the evidenc e in this case of sever e problems in its measles virus detec tion effor ts. Howeve r, I conclude that the overall evidenc e weig hs strong ly in favor of a conclusion that, whateve r the general caliber of the work of the O'Leary labora tory group, the group's measles virus done larg ely under the Unig enetics L td. name, sim ply is not reliable . The overall evidenc e specific to that measles virus detec tion issue is simply too strong to be outweig hed by mere evidenc e of a good g eneral reputation conce rning other wor k. In this regard, two further observa tions are relevant. First, as noted above, the measles virus detec tion work was done, at least for the most part, under the Unig enetics Ltd. name. Dr. Bustin testified that Unigenetics Ltd. was not a ccredited, and that Unig enetics Ltd. de clined to participa te in a quality control program, so that \"ther e was never any independe nt quality assessment made of any of the work that was carried out by Unig enetics.\" (Tr. 2034, 2057A.) Significa ntly, petitioners never attempted re but that aspec t of Dr. B ustin's testimony . Second, the record also indicates that Unig enetics Ltd. is no longe r in business, and there is no evidenc e that the O'Leary labora tory has ever published any work defending the reliability of the Uhlmann s tudy, despite t he criticism of that study. Thus, it seems th at the O'L eary labora tory has not publicly defended the reliability of its efforts at measles virus detec tion during the early 2000s. According ly, considering all of the evidenc e of record, I conclude that, regardless of whether the O'Leary labora tory might have a solid reputa tion with respe ct to its other work, labora tory's efforts to detec t measles v irus in the ear ly 2000s were flawe d and unre liable. Dr. Kinsbourne made a comment to the same e ffect. (Snyder Ex. 29, p. 14.)77 I note that responde nt's expert Dr. Griff in, when asked by petitioners' about the78 general reputa tion of the O'Leary labora tory in the scientific community , replied that it was \"not very good.\" (Tr. 2866-67.) But she was not asked whether she was aware of work by that labora tory in areas other than measles virus testing, so it is not clear if she was referring to any other work besides the measles detec tion efforts. There fore, I do not place any relianc e on this particula r statement by Dr. Gr iffin. 63c. The Walker study Petitioners have also relied on a study that is currently in progress, conducte d by Dr. Hepne r and several others, often descr ibed as the \"Walker study .\" (See Ex. 59, Tab K; P. Trial Ex. 3.) Dr. Hepne r stated that the \"preliminary data\" from that study \"present another step in support\" of the proposition that the measles virus persists in the intestinal tissue of some autistic children. (Ex. 63, p. 5; see also Tr. 634A-35A.) After considera tion of the Walker study and the testimony about it in the record of this case, howeve r, I conclude that the study does not provide any substantial support to the proposition that the measles virus persists in the bodies of Michelle Cedillo or any other autistic individuals. Dr. Hepne r repor ted that she and three other researchers- -Steve Walker, Jeff Segal, and Dr. Ar thur Krig sman, the latter be ing a nother of pe titioners' experts in this case--are engaged in a study simil ar to the Uhlmann study , in that their objective is to perform PCR testing for the detec tion of measles virus on intestinal biopsies of children with both developmenta l delay and gastrointestinal symptoms. (Ex. 63, p. 5; Tr. 634A-35A.) Dr. Hepne r stated that the researchers generated \"multiple primer sets\" and \"tested them for their specific ity and sensitivity \" in identify ing the prese nce of measles virus. (Tr. 635A; Ex. 63, p. 5.) Dr. Hepne r and Dr. Krigsman testified that the study , which began in 2003, is not yet complete, but tha t the group conducte d some initial testing and prese nted \"preliminary data\" from the study at an autism-rela ted confe rence in 2006, in the form of a \"poster prese ntation\" (literally , a poster board descr ibing the study was set on an easel at the confe rence).79 (Ex. 63, p. 5; Tr. 474A-75, 634A.) Dr. Hepne r repor ted that of 82 biopsy samples tested in the study 's initial testing, which all came from children with both \"deve lopment al delay\" and \"GI [gastrointestinal] symptoms,\" 70 tested positive for measles virus. (Ex. 63, p. 5.) She further stated, without explanation, that her group was able \"to confirm vaccine strain specific ity\" in some of the80 positive samples. (Tr. 635A.) Petitioners, in their post-hear ing briefs, have relied on the Walker study as supportive of their view that the Unig enetics measles virus testing should be a gree. First, two of responde nt's experts, Dr. Ward and Dr. Bustin, each pointed to a number of flaws in the Walker study , based on the descr iption (Tr. 1861-65; 1952A- 59A.) Moreove r, a second important reason to discount the W alker study is the testimony of Dr. Hepne r herself. Dr . Hepne r stated that the initial data fr om her study were only \"ver y preliminary A copy of the materia l on the poster, descr ibing the study , was filed as Petitioners' Trial Ex.79 3, and an a bstract ( summary ) of the poste r presentation is filed as Ex. 59, Tab K. The transcr ipt says \"confer.\" I conclude , from the context, that Dr. Hepne irm.\" 64data.\" be inappropria te to \"draw any conclusions\" from those preliminary results. (Tr. 682.) She acknow ledged that her group at this time is still attempting \"to test this a ssay, to optimize the assay \" (Tr. 660A)-- i.e., to develop the test to a point where they can then be conf ident that their test is y ielding r eliable r esults. Part of developing a ny such test is to use \"negative controls\"- -i.e., to test samples that are known to be free of the target, to make sure that the test is not erroneously identify ing the target in samples that do not contain it. Howeve r, Dr. Hepne r explained tha t her group is still at the point of deve loping their negative controls. (Tr. 658, 681.) In short, Dr. Hepne r was forthrig ht in acknow ledging that, in terms of drawing any conclusions with regard to the issue of the validity of measles virus testing, the preliminary data available from her study simply are \"not useful a t this t ime.\" (Tr . 659.) In sum, it is clear that the Walker study must be disreg arded. First, both Dr. Ward and Dr. Bustin pointed out a number of reasons why one cannot draw any conclusions from, or place any relianc e on, the preliminary data from the Walker study . And even petitioners' expert Dr. Hepne r, one of the study 's own authors, has acknow ledged that the preliminary data from the study are \"not useful at this time.\" (Tr. 659.) According ly, I must agree with Dr. Hepne r on this point. I conclude that the W alker study is not useful in deciding the issue of whether the Unigene tics measles virus detec tion testing wa s Dr. Hepner conce rning D'Souza dy Petitioners have also relied on another argument advanc ed by Dr. Hepne r. (P1, p. 249.) Dr. Hepner pointed out that the D 'Souza 2006 research group, when doing PC R testing using the Uhlmann primers, w as succe ssful in finding me asles virus in the \"positive controls\"- -i.e., samples known to contain mea sles virus used in that study . She argues that this proves that the \"Uhlmann primer sets are capable of amplify ing the predic ted MV [measle s virus] target.\" (Ex. 120, p. 2.) This argument, howeve r, misses the key point of the D'Souza 2006 article and Dr. Ward's testimony . The crucial point of the D'Souza 2006 article is not that the Uhlmann primers fail to identify actua l measles virus when it is prese nt, but that the Uhlmann primers are nonspecific , and there by purport to identify measles virus when it is, in fact, not there . (See, e.g., Ex. T, Att. 6, p. 1672; Tr. 1850, 1853A-58A; Ex. BB , p. 12; 964A- 65A.) labora tory found measles virus protein in the intestinal tissue of autistic children in the Uhlmann study , via a technique known as \"immunohistochemistry regard, the petitioners rely, once again, on the testimony of Dr. Kenne dy about information that he alleg edly received orally from Unig enetics personne l. dy testified that during descr ibed meeting with Dr. Sheils of Unig enetics and other scientists in the course of the British MMR/aut ism litigation, Dr. Sheils stated that Unig enetics had Ex . 110, p. 8.) The record conce rning this point is confusing , because the issue was mentioned only briefly in the expert repor ts and ex pert testim ony--primar ily, by Dr. for petitioners (Ex. p. 8; Tr. 744-45, 828A; Snyder Tr. 329A-30A) , and by Rima for respondent (Snyder Tr. 849A, 914A-16A, 935A -36; Snyder Ex. S, part B, p. 44, para s. 4.25, 4.26). Dr. Rima stated a t one point that the technique of immunohis tochemistry \"was not used in the Uhlmann paper .\" (Snyder Tr. 849A, line 16.) Howeve r, the balanc e of Dr. Rima's testimony indicates quite clearly that Dr. Rima understo od that, according to the Uhlmann article , immunohis tochemistry had been used in the82 Uhlmann study . Dr. Rima's criticism, rathe r, was that the usage of immunohis tochemistry was just mentioned in the article , with no data or details conce rning the use of the technique being set forth in the paper . (Snyder Tr. 914A- 16A, 935A-936.) The record supports Dr. Rima's criticism. Dr. Kenne dy in his testimony did not point to any specific part of the Uhlmann article , but my own examination of the article indicates that the use of immunohis tochemistry was simply mentioned , without explanation, at four place s. (Ex. 63, Tab U, pp. 84, 87, 88, 89.) Howeve r, I found nothing in the Uhlmann article stating that any immunohistochemistry work had actua lly identified measles virus protein . And Dr. Rima was certainly correct that there seems to be no substantial prese ntation of any details or data in the article regarding any immunohistochemistry work. Indeed, Dr. Kenne dy himself acknow ledged that the alleg ed immunohistochemistry data were not published any wher e. (Tr . 744.) Petitioners did alleg e in one of their briefs that Figure 4E of the Uhlmann article (Ex. 63, Tab U, p. 88) \"showe d that protein was detec ted by the use of antibody CNA 42 by the O'Leary group.\" (P3, p. 29.) It is true that the words \"immunohistochemistr y with monoclonal antibody CNA42\" appea r in the caption to Figure 4E. Howeve r, as far as I can tell, that caption does not indicate that measles protein was detec ted--the word \"prote in\" does not appea r. Moreove r, neither Dr. Kenne dy nor any other expert witness for petitioners has ever provided an interpre tation of what that caption means, or in any way attempted to demonstrate that the text of the U hlmann article itself indicates that measles protein was detec ted. Again, Dr. Kenne dy himself clearly conce ded that the only evidenc e that measles protein was detec ted is not contained in the Uhlmann article , but instead that information came to Dr. Kenne dy only in the form of the alleg ed statements by Dr. Sheils at the above- descr ibed meeting during the British litigation. That is, during the hearing, Dr. Kenne dy was expli citly asked whether the information about the \"dete ction MV protein\" was paper ?\" He replied: \"No. I'm talking about additional information that I have from Dr. Kenne dy did not specify which children he was talking about. Presumably , he was81 referring to the c hildren who we re the subjects of the U hlmann study . Dr. Rima used the term \"immunocy tochemistry ,\" which is another name for82 immunohis (Snyder Tr. re Dr. Sheils presente d work * * *.\" (Tr. 744; see also Ex. 110, p. 8, line 11--infor mation came f rom \"pe rsonal communica tions;\" Tr. 853A.) Further, Dr. Rima was the only expert to comment in the record specific ally about Figure 4E of the Uhlmann article , and he commented that this Figure did not prese nt a \"convincing picture\" supporting the prese nce of measles virus pr otein. ( Snyder Ex. S, part B, p. 44, pa ra. 4.25.) There fore, based on the available evidenc e, I conclude that the Uhlmann article itself does not demonstrate that immunohis tochemistry performed by Unig enetics demonstrated the prese nce of measles protein in the tissue of autistic children. There fore, we have another situation in which the petitioners, as they did with respect to the issues conce rning sequenc ing and Dr. Cotter's replica tion simply upon Dr. Kenne dy's unsubstantiated representa tions about experiments that were alleg done, and positive results that were alleg edly achie ved, by other researchers. Once again, no written record of the alleg ed testing was produce d, no testimony from the researchers who alleg edly performed the work was produce d, nor did pe titioners e ven produce statements from the other scientists who were allegedly in the room with Dr. Kenne dy when Dr. Sheils alleg edly descr ibed the immunohistochemistry results. On this issue, as with the sequenc ing issue, I again find it to be crucial that the data in question has never been published or otherwise made available to other scientists. The gist of Dr. Rima's testimony was that, in scienc e, a mere statement in an article that certain testing has been done and certain results wer e achieved, without showing the dat a, is not sufficie nt to demonstrate to other scientists that, in fact, such results were accurate ly achie ved. To have scientific credibilit y, rathe r, the data must be shown. (Snyder Tr. 914A-16A, 935A-36.) In this instance, theref ore, he believes that it is unwar rante d to accept the conclusion that immunohis tochemistry finding measles viral protein wa s done, and done proper ly, since the da ta wer e not published. ( Id.) According ly, after full considera tion of this issue, I cannot find it to be likely that Unig enetics ever found measles virus protein via immunohis tochemistry in any autistic children in conjunction83 with its m easle s virus PCR testing.84 PCR expert, Dr. briefly upon the issue of83 immunohis tochemistry in the Uhlmann study . (Tr. 650-52A.) This testimony was somewhat confusing , but Dr. Hepne r seeme d to conce de either that immunohis tochemistry was not used in the Uhlmann study, or at least that the Uhlmann article does not demonstrate that immunohis tochemis try was used to de tect mea sles protein. As to the issue of Miche lle's own case, petitioners argue, without citation to because Unig \"routinely used immunohis tochemistry e labeling a sample 'posit ive,'\" then i t can be reasonably inferr ed that Unig enetics did immunohis tochemistry and found measles virus protein i n the particular sample of Mi chelle Cedillo. (P3, p. 30.) But, as explained above, there no persua sive evidenc reliably found virus protein by (continued...) Argum ent concerning \"h igh copy num bers\" Petitioners have argued that even if I conclude that there were some problems with the Unig enetics testing in general , I should never theless conclude that the Unig enetics testing was able in certain instances to accurate ly identify the prese nce of measles virus. Petitioners argue that in instances in which the Unig enetics testing found a \"high copy number\" --whic h they argue happene d in Michelle Cedillo's case--suc h results should be accepted as accurate ly indicating the persistenc e of mea sles virus. ( See, e.g., P1, pp. 140, 142, 246-48; P3, pp. 34-37; P 4, pp. 34-38.) I cannot ag ree, for severa l reasons. First, the appar ent premise of petit ioners' arg ument is wrong . Petitioners seem to imply that it is alway s true that the highe r the \"copy number\" repor ted on a test of a particula r biologic sample, the greater the amount of measles virus RNA that is necessarily contained in that sample. (E.g., P4, p. 35, lines 13-16.) According to the testimony of Dr. Ri ma, however, thi s assumption of the petiti oners is not correct. Dr. Ri ma ex plained that the \"copy number\" in a PCR test is derive d from a ratio betwee n the number of actua l copies found of the target, such as the F-gene of the measles virus, and the number of copies found of a \"houseke eping gene\" (which is found i n all cells of the body ) known a s \"GAPDH.\" There fore, if the test detec ts low numbe rs of the G APDH g ene, the n even if the ac tual number of me asles virus F-genes detec ted repor ted number\" the measles virus F-gene will never theless be \"high.\" (Snyder Tr. 868A-78A; Snyder Ex. S, part B, pp. 11-12.) There fore, Dr. Rima explained, when Unig eneti cs reported a \"high copy number,\" or \"high headline number,\" for a particula r sample, it did not necessarily mean that a particula rly large amount of measles virus materia l had been (alleg edly) detec ted. (Id.) To the contra ry, Dr. Rima te stified that when he studied the data85 from the Unig enetics measles detec tion efforts, he ted high copy numbers (\"headline figures\" ) largely were coming from situations involving low GAPDH counts , so that the tests were not necessarily indicating high levels of measles virus materia l. (Snyder Tr. 877A-78A.) Dr. W ard fully agreed with that expl anation by Dr. Rima. ( Snyder Tr. 950A, 965A.) And Dr. Bustin, too, testified that the fact that Unig enetics repor ted a \"high copy number\" in a particula r test does not mean that he would find that test to be re liable. (Tr . 2061A-64A, 2068A .) In addition, Dr. Rima further testified that even high copy numbers can be the result of contamination. ( Snyder Tr. 878A.) Dr. W ard, as well, t estified that a high copy number doe s not mean that the r esult is not a product of c 965A- 66A.) (...continued)84 immunohis tochemistry . there is no valid basis to conclude that measles virus protein was found in Michelle' s tissue. Dr. Kenne dy agreed that copy numbers are derive d from a relationship betwee n the number85 of actua l copies found of the target gene and the number of copies found of the \"houseke eping gene.\" (Snyder Tr. 385A.) 68Moreove r, Dr. Rima added that the extremely high copy numbers for measles virus repor ted for some samples, including those of Colten Snyder and Michelle Cedillo, were so high as to be \"complete ly and utterly biologica lly implausible\" on their face. (Snyder Tr. 930.) He explained that if the cells in those samples really had withi n them the presence of as many copies of the m easle s virus F-gene as repor ted in the Unig enetics results, they would be so \"stuffe d\" with the measles virus F-gene alone that there would be no room in the cells for the other cell components that must be there , such as the housekee ping gene. (Id. at 930-31A; see also Snyder Tr. 883A.) Dr. Ward made the same point. (Ex. BB , p. 12.) Petitioners' experts did not reply to this arg ument.86 Finally , I note that I have conclude d that the Unig enetics testing for measles virus was clearly flawed . The overa ll evidenc e demonstrates that it is unlikely that Unig enetics ever develope d a test that reliably detec ted the prese nce of measles virus. There fore, even if a particula r test, in the case of Michelle's Cedillo's tissue sample or any other biologic sample, was found to have a \"high copy number,\" there is still simply no reason to find that test to be valid. That is, if the test itself is clearly flawe d as a general matter, there is no reason to think that a \"strong ly positive\" result on that test is any more reliable than a \"weakly positive\" result. Accordingly, I find the petitioners' argument conce rning \"hig h copy numbers\" to be without merit as well. 5. No persuasive e vidence of vac cine-strain m easles virus The petitioners in this case, of course , need to demonstrate not only that Michelle Cedillo and other autistic children have persisting measles virus in their bodies, but that such persisting measles virus is vaccine-strain measles virus, i.e., derive d from an MMR vaccination rather than from the natura l, \"wild\" form of measles virus. The Uhlmann article , howeve r, does not even purport to show that the measles virus, which was claimed to have been found in the children's biopsies, was vaccine-strain measles virus. Simi larly, the tics test Mi chelle Cedillo's tissue purported to identify only measles virus, not vaccine-strain measles virus. As explained elsewhe re in this Part VI of this Decision, I have found that the Unig enetics testing is not reliable , and that the pe titioners have failed to demonstrate that measles virus of any type persists in the body of Mich elle Cedillo, or in the bodies of any other autistic children. According ly, there is no need to disc uss the evidenc e offered by the petitioners for the proposition that any measles virus that alleg edly persists in these children' s bodies is vaccine-strain measles This particula r aspec t of Dr. Rima's testimony was also supported by testimony from86 responde nt's expert Dr. Griffin. Dr. Griffin does not purport to be an expert in PC R (Tr. 2835B ), but she has excellent credentials as an expert conce rning the measles virus (see pp. 108-09, below). Dr. Griff in testified that the extremely high copy number repor ted for Michelle Cedillo was not \"biolog ically plausible.\" (Tr. 2783.) According to Dr. Griff in, that copy number, on its face, indicated the prese nce in the biopsied bowel tissue of more measles virus than would be prese nt even at the peak of an infec tion by the wild measles virus . (Tr. 2783-84.) If that was true, Michelle would have had, on Januar y 31, 2002, the date of the biopsy , all the symptoms of the measles disease. (Tr. 2784.) Yet there i s no evidenc e that Michelle wa s suffe ring from the symptoms of measle s when the biopsy was take n. 69virus. Nevertheless, in the interest of completene ss, I will briefly addre ss the items of evidenc e offered by petitioners in this reg ard. a. Exhi bit 130 Remarka bly, in all of the petitioners' expe rt repor ts filed in this Cedillo case, and in the lengthy hearing testimony by the petitioners' e xperts, the pe titioners offered virtually no evide nce conce rning this necessary element in their proposed chain of proof- - i.e., their claim that the measles virus, which they claim to persist in these children, is vaccine-strain measles virus. Nor did they addre ss this issue in their initial post-hear ing brief. (P1.) Rather, on Januar y 31, 2008, many months after the evidentiar y hearing in this case, the petitioners filed a one-pa ge document as their Ex. 130. The document contains four brief \"synopses of paper s.\" One of the four synopses, five paragraphs in length, seems to summarize an article by Dr. Sheils, Dr. O'Leary, and two other co-authors. The synopsis beg ins with the following lang uage: In a recent study [apparently a reference to the Uhlmann study ], our group descr ibed the prese nce of measles virus RNA genes in a new form of inflammatory bowel disease with concomitant developmenta l disorder. One of the many questions raised by the study asked if the measles virus detec ted was wild or vaccine type in origin. The objec tive of this pilot s tudy was to addr ess this point. (Ex. 130.) The next three paragraphs descr ibe the \"pilot study ,\" in highly technica l language. They indicate that the authors used a technique known as \"allelic discrimination\" in their attempt to distinguish betwee n wild measles and va ccine -strain. The last para graph the n rea ds as follows: The assay identified wild type measles in three brain blocks from an SSPE patient while 12 gut biopsies from affected children were deeme d to have vaccine strain prese nt. This pilot study further corroborate s our previous finding s of an association betwee n the prese nce of measles virus and gut abnorma lities in children with developmenta l disorder a nd indicates the origins of the virus to be vacc ine strain . (Ex. 130, emphasis added.) The petiti oners, in their l ater briefs filed i n this case, then quot ed the same language set forth above from Ex. 130, and argued that Ex. 130 proves that the measles virus detec ted in Mic helle Cedillo's intestinal as measles virus. (P3, p. 31; P4 p. 33.) Howeve r, there are sever e problems with Ex. 130 as an item of proof. First, if indeed Ex . 130 is a \"synopsis\" of a larger article , then petitioners have failed to submit the entire article . This synopsis provides only a very brief summary of the pil ot study , with no details. In addition, there is no evidenc e that either the synopsis or the larger article (if such exists) was submitt ed for scientific peer revie w and publication, a circumstance which, by itself, cause s one to be cautious about giving any credence to the article . 70Second , none of the petitioners' expert witnesses in either this case or the Snyder or Hazlehurst case s, so far a s I am awa re, ha s discussed this sy nopsis or endorse d its accur acy. Third, the only expert witness to addre ss Ex. 130 seems to have been Dr. Rima, an expert for responde nt in the Snyder case. Dr. Rima did discuss what appears to be the \"pilot study \" descr ibed in Ex. 130, though it was never specifie d exactly what study he was discussing. (Snyder Tr. 856A-87 863.) Dr. Ri ma ex plained in detail why he believes that the study did not accurate ly discriminate betwee n wild measles virus and vaccine-stra in measles virus. Petitioners have offered no evidenc e to contradic t this t estimony . According ly, I find that Ex. 130 does not offer signific ant evidenc e that vaccine-strain measles virus ha s been f ound in the biologic ma terial of a ny autistic person. b. The Walker study Petitioners also, in their final post-hear ing brief in this case, pointed to another item of evidenc e in the record. (P4, pp. 33-34.) They pointed to the ongoing Walker study , discussed above, and note that one of their experts who has worke d on that study , Dr. Krigsman, stated that in the study 's initial testing, six specimens were deter mined to be positive \"for vaccine-str ain-specific RNA.\" (Tr. 487A.) Howeve r, as I have already discussed above, the preliminary data from the Walker study , in the words of the petitioners' own expert and co- author of tha t study , Dr. He pner, is simply \"not useful at this time.\" (Tr. 659.) Thus, again in Dr. Hepne r's own words, it would not be appr opriate f or me to \"dr aw any conclusions\" f rom that data. ( Tr. 682.) c. Dr. Krigsm an's opini on with respec t to this issue, petitioners asser t in their brief that \"Dr. Krigsman stated that Michelle's biopsy revealed vaccine-strain measles virus the terminal ileal portion of the small bowel.\" (P3, p. 32, emphasis added.) Petiti oners cite Dr. Krigsman's expert repor t, wher e Dr. Krigsman did seem to asser t, in a single unex plained sentenc e, that the Walker study demonstrated \"with 100 percent certainty the vaccine origin\" of the measles RNA alleg edly detec ted in Michelle. (Ex. 59, p. 8, lines 27-29.) But, Dr. Krigsman's sentenc e points only to the Walker study as the evidenc e for his apparent \"100 percent certainty \" that Michelle had vaccine-strain measles virus RNA. And, as explained above, I do not find the Walker study to be signific ant evidenc e conce rning this point. Thus, I cannot assig n any weig ht at all to Dr. Krigsman's expressed opinion concer ning this point. It is not absolutely clear that Dr. Rima's discussion at Snyder Tr. 856A-63 descr ibes the87 \"pilot study \" abstrac ted at 130, but that appea rs likely . Certainly , Dr. Rima was descr ibing the same general work descr ibed in Ex. 130, i.e., the attempts by the O'Leary/Sheils labora tory group, using \"allelic discrimination,\" to distinguish betwee n the wild measles virus and the vaccine-strain measles virus. Further, even without that testimony of Dr. Rima, I would never theless find Ex. 130 to be without evidentiary value, f or the first t wo reasons set forth above . 71d. Sum mary conce rning vacc ine-strain issue In sum, I have found all of the items of evidenc e, upon which the petitioners rely conce rning this issue, to be insubstantial. According ly, even if I somehow could conclude (which I do not) that88 the Unig enetics testing demonstrates the prese nce of measles virus in the children in question, then petitioners would still have failed to demonstrate that such measles virus was vaccine-strain measles virus. 6. Anal ysis of other articles that pu rportedly found m easles virus in children wi th development al disorders The pe titioners in their briefs ha ve, as note d above, relied heavily on the Uhlmann article . Howeve r, there have also been three other published article s in which researchers have repor ted that they have utiliz ed PCR testing to find measles virus in the biologic material of children with developmenta l disorders. Petitioners in their briefs in this case have not specific ally relied upon those other three article s. Neve rtheless, because those other article s have been cited or mentioned in the expert repor ts or hear ing te stimony in this case, I note t hat I have studied those a rticles, and that I conclude that those article s, like the Uhlmann article , do not offer any persua sive evidenc e that measles virus in fa ct has be en found in the biolog ic mater ial of autistic per sons. a. Martin article The first of those article s, the Martin article , was authore d by five of the authors of the89 Uhlmann article . (Tr. 1847; compar e Ex. BB, Att. 67, p. 2, to Ex. 63, Tab U, p. 1.) The Martin article , like the Uhlmann article , descr ibes measles virus detection attempt s in the ileal lymphoid tissue of children with developmenta l disorders, and of \"control\" children without developmenta l disorders. The detec tion techniques were the same as those listed in the Uhlmann article . As in the Uhlmann article , the authors repor ted finding measles virus in most of the children with developmenta l disorders, but in only a few of the c ontrol children. None of petitioners' experts discussed the Martin paper , or cited it as support for the proposition that measles virus has been reliably detec ted in the tissue of autistic children. For that reason alone, I can not find that the Martin article supports a conclusion that measles virus has been reliably detec ted in autistics. Moreove r, the only expert to discuss the article was respondent's expert Dr. Ward, who explained that there is little detail in the Martin article , so that it may be that I note also that an expert committee of the Institut e of Medicine explored this issue, and88 indicated skepticism that the Unig enetics testing had reliably identified vaccine-strain measles virus. (Ex. J J, p. 128.) (F or a discussion of tha t Institut e of Me dicine Report, se e p. 124 below.) C. Martin, V. Uhlmann, A. Killalea, O. Sheils & J. O'Leary, M OLECULAR PSYCHIATRY S47-8 (2002). (E x. BB, Att. 67.) 72the article is descr ibing the testing of the very same samples as descr ibed i n the Uhlm ann arti cle. (Tr. 1847; Ex. BB, p. 11.) In any event, given the authors and the testing techniques describe d, it is fair to infer that the testing descr ibed in the Martin article s, even if not the same exact samples descr ibed in the Uhlmann article , was done by the Unigenetics laboratory , utiliz ing the same techniques utiliz ed in the Uhlmann study . There fore, the Martin study certainly provides no independe nt support for the pr oposition t hat the Unig enetics me asles virus testing was re liable. b. Bradstreet 2004 article Another of the three article s is the Bradstree t 2004 article . Among the authors of this article90 are both Dr. J.J. Bradstreet, who testified for the petitioners in the Snyder case, and Dr. Andre w Wakefield. The article describes testing for measles virus on samples from six children, three autistic and three developmenta lly normal. The te sting found the pre sence of mea sles virus in the three autistics, but not in t he deve lopmentally normal childre n. Thoug h the B radstre et study was ve ry small, the results might be c onsidered suppor tive of the validity of the Unig enetics testing, except for one circumstance. At the end of the article , the authors reveal that the testing was in fact, done by Unigenetics itself . (Ex. 61, Tab M, p. 44, in the \"Acknowledg ments.\") Thus, this study again provides no independent support for the petitioners' argument conce rning the issue of the r eliability of the Unig enetics me asles virus testing .91 c. The Kawashim a 2000 article The last of the three article s, the Kawa shima 2000 article , also included Dr. Wakefield as92 a co-author. (Ex. BB, Att. 55, p. 723.) In the study , the authors utiliz ed PCR to test blood cells (\"PMB Cs\") for measles virus. Of nine autistic children examined, three samples tested positive for measles virus, while sa mples from eig ht developmentally normal childre n all wer e neg ative. The Kawa shima article s does not make clear in what labora tory the PCR testing was done. Howeve r, there is no evidenc e that it was the Unig enetics labora tory, and another article in the record J.J.Bradstree t et al., Detec tion of Me asles Virus G enomic R NA in Cerebrospinal Flui d of90 Children with Regressive Autism , 9 J. AM. PHYSICIANS & SURGEONS 38 (2004). ( Ex. 61, Tab M.) Dr. Rima also pointed out additional reasons for distrusting the data contained in the91 Bradstree t 2004 article. (Snyder Tr. 884A-894A.) Further, Dr. Ward argued that the Bradstree t article was published in a journa l of dubious merit. (Ex. BB, p. 6; Tr . 1837.) H. Kawa shima, T. Mori, Y. Kashiw agi, K. Take kuma, A. Hoshika & A. Wakefield,92 Detec tion and Sequenc ing of Measles Virus from Peripheral Mononucle ar Cells from Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Autism , 45 D IGESTIVE DISEASES & SCIENCES 723 (2000). (Ex. BB, Att. 55.) 73indicates that Dr. Kawa shima runs a labora tory in Toky o, Japan. (Ex. V, Att. 1, p. 172. ) There fore,93 the fact that at least a few samples tested positive for measles virus in testing by a non-Unig enetics labora tory might be viewed as supportive of the validity of the Unig enetics measles detec tion efforts. Howeve r, I cannot find that the Kawa shima study offers any signific ant support, for sever al reasons. First, even the petitioners' own expert witnesses in the PCR area did not discuss the Kawa shima study , or opine that it supports their view that the Unig enetics testing was valid. If none of the petitioners' experts believe that the Kawa shima study supports their theory , I certainly cannot rely on it. Second, the record contains sever al items of evidenc e that cast doubt on the validity of the Kawa shima measles virus testing. In the D'Souza 2006 study , the re searchers in f act attempted to replica te the Kawa shima 2000 study . The D'Souza researchers used the same primer set utiliz ed by Kawa shima, and tested the same type of blood c ells tested by Kawa shima. Howeve r, the D'Souza team did not find any positive results on the samples t ested, casting doubt on the reliabilit y of the Kawa shima results. (Ex. T, Att. 6, pp. 1665, 1667-68, 1671.) The D' Kawa shima PCR data is \"unlikely to be true\" (id. at 1674), and stated that \"unintentional contamination\" was a plausible explanation for this appar ent error by the Kawa shima testing (id. at 1672). Next, Dr. Rima pointed out that the Kawa shima labora tory (unlike the Unig enetics labora ted in an international compar ison of labora tories that did measles testing. The result, howeve r, was that the Kawa shima lab \"turne d out to be extremely incapa ble of detec ting measles virus.\" (Snyder Tr. 901A; see also Ex. V, Att. 1, pp. 172, 175.) Another article also points out problems with the Kawa shima 2000 study . (Ex. T, Att. 1. )94 Finally , as noted above, Nicholas Chadwick in 1996 was a Ph.D. student working in a London labora tory for Dr. Wakefield. (Tr. 2283-84; Ex. QQ, pp. 1-2.) At that time both Dr. Wakefield and Dr. Kawa shima were seeking to deter mine if the m easle s virus was connected with a certain type of bowel disease , rathe r than autism. Chadwick's interac tions with the Kawa shima labora tory make it appea r very likely that Dr. Kawa shima's positive results in measles virus testing w ere \"false positives,\" the re sult of contamination. (Tr. 2286- 87; Ex . QQ, par as. 10- 11.) For all those reasons, I conclude that the Kawa shima 2000 article does not offer any support to the petitioners' c laim that the Unig enetics me asles testing was re liable. M. Afzal al., Compar ative Evaluation of Measles Virus-Specific RT-PCR Methods93 Through an International Collaborat ive Study , 70 J. MED. VIROLOGY 171 (2003). (Ex. V, Att. 1.) M. Afzal & P. Minor, Vacc ines, Crohn' s Disease and Autism , 7 MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY94 S49-50 (2002). (E x. T, Att. 1.) 74d. Sum mary conce rning the thr ee article s For the reasons set forth above, I conclude that none of the three cited articles offer any support to the petitioners' c laim that the Unig enetics me asles testing was re liable. 7. Experience of the experts Comparison of the experience and credentials of the parties' experts further supports a finding that petitioners have failed to demonstrate the reliability of the Unig enetics measles virus testing. As noted above, responde nt's expert Dr. Ward is a medica l doctor who has practiced medicine and held medical academic positions since 1981, specia lizing in internal medicine, infec tious (Tr. 1796A-97; Ex. CC, pp. 1-2.) He has been a member of the medical faculty at McGill University in Montreal since 1992, serving as Chief of the Infectious Disease s Section of that medical school from 2002 to 2006. (Ex. CC, p. 2; Tr. 1797.) He has published extensively , including over 80 peer-reviewed article s and a number of medical textbook chapte rs. (Ex. CC, pp. 13-23, 25-26; Tr. 1797-98A.) His testimony in this case and his list of publications indicate extensive experience in PCR testing and extensive experience with the measles virus. (Ex C C; Tr. 1796A-98A, 1839; Snyder Tr. 940.) Respondent also re lied upon the t estimony of Dr. Bustin, an expert who is extraordinar ily well-qua lified to testify conce rning the validity of PCR testing results. Dr. Bustin is a molecular biologist who obtained his Ph.D. in tha t field in 1982. (Tr. 1933; Ex. VV, p. 1.) He is the chief of the Molecular Science section of the medical school of the University of London. (Tr. 1934A.) Dr. B ustin has very extensive experience in PCR testing in it s various for ms, which he uses e very day in his scientific research and practice. (Tr. 1934A-36A.) During the past five years his labora tory has published fourtee n peer-reviewed article s conce rning PCR . (Tr. 1935.) In 2000 he wrote a medica l review article conce rning PCR that has since been cited over 1,000 times in other article s in the peer-reviewed medical literature , and another of his PCR article s has been cited more than 500 times. (Tr. 1935-36A.) He is the co-author of a book entitled A to Z of PCR , and has contributed c hapter s to other books on PCR . (Tr. 1936A .) Respondent's expert Dr. Rima is also very well-qua lified in the area of PCR testing for measles virus. A Ph.D. virolog ist, he has more than 33 years of research experience since receiving his Ph.D. (Snyder Tr. 825; Snyder Ex. W, pp. 1-2.) The primary focus of his research has been the measles virus and related viruses. (Snyder Ex. W, pp. 6-25; Snyder Tr. 826A.) Dr. Rima is head of the school of Biomedic al Science s at the Que ens Univer sity of B elfast, Northern I reland. ( Snyder Tr. at 824A-25.) He has published extensively , including well over 100 article s conce rning measles virus alone, a nd approximately 20 book (Snyder Tr. the Unig enetics testing as well. A Ph.D. immunologist, he is a Professor of Immunology and Dean for Resear ch at the medical school of the University of London. (Hazlehurst Ex. A, p. 1; Hazlehurst Tr. at 603-04A.) During a medical research career of more than 30 years, Dr. MacDonald has 75specia lized in the immunology of the human gut (intestines). ( Hazlehurst Ex. A, p. 1; Hazlehurst Tr. at 604A-11A.) He stated that he has had \"a particula r interest in the lymphoid tissue of the human gut\" (Hazlehurst Ex. A, p. 1), which is the type of tissue which Unig enetics tested in Michelle Cedillo a nd in the Uhlmann study . He ha s published at least 158 ar ticles conc erning gut immunology , written a book on that topic and edited se veral other such books, written many book chapte rs, and serve d in editorial positions on a number of medical journals. (Hazlehurst Tr. 607A- 09A.) Moreove r, in addition to extensive general experience in the field, each of those four experts for respondent has particular experience that is espec ially relevant to the Unig enetics testing in question. That is, as descr ibed above, Drs. Bustin, Rima, and MacD in the above- descr ibed British MMR/autism litigation, each had extensive access to the Unig enetics labora tory's records, facilities, and/or equipment. Dr. Ward, on the other hand, was a lead researcher on a team that actua lly used the Uhlmann primers and performed PCR testing in order to test the accuracy of the Unig enetics te sting, then published the r esults of its e fforts in peer-reviewed medical journals, in the form of the D'Souza 2006 and D'Souza 2007 ar ticles discussed above . The petitioners, on the other hand, relied on two experts conce rning the issue of the reliability of the Unig enetics measles virus testing. Dr. Hepne r received her Ph.D in molecular biology about four y ears befor e the tria l in this case ; she has about ten y ears of ex perie nce in working with PC R technolog y, including the years prior to obtaining her Ph.D. (Tr. 583A-84A, 636-37.) Dr. Kenne dy received a Ph.D. in microbiolog y in 1981, and is expert in microbiolog y and virolog y. (Tr. 684; Ex. 110, p. 1; Ex. 111, p. 1.) He is chairman of the Depa rtment of Microbiolog y and Immunology at Texas Tech University , and has a great deal of experience in study ing viruses, including the measles virus, and in the development of vaccines. (Tr. 685; Ex. 110, pp. 1-2; Snyder Tr. 357.) He has published more than 200 pe er-revie wed sc ientific ar ticles. (Ex. 110, p. 2.) In addition, Dr. Kenne dy, as an expert in the British MMR/autism litigation, also had the opportunity to revie w many of the Unig enetics labora tory records (Tr. 853A-54A) , and to question one of the Unigene Dr. S heils. (Tr. 808-17, 824A-25, 844-48, 851-55; Snyder Tr. 333A-39A.) Weighing the credentials and experience of the primary experts for both sides conce rning the issue of the validity of the Unig enetic s testing, I note as follows. Dr. Bustin clearly has the most impressive credentials and experience of all, in the particula r field of PCR testing . Dr. Rima clearly has the most experience in study ing the measles virus in particula r. Drs. Ward and MacD onald also, like Drs. Bustin and Rima, have very impressive acade mic backg rounds, publ ications, and len gth of experience , while Dr. Kennedy , too, has very impressive credentials in terms of academic backg round, publications, and length of experience . Dr. Hepne r, on the other hand, while certainly qualified to opine as an expert conce rning PCR , has far less experience , and far lesser academic and publication cre dentials, than all of the othe r experts. 76Thus, on the whole, there is certainly a strong contra st, in the experience and backg round relevant to this issue of the validity of the Unig enetics testing, betwee n the responde nt's four primary experts and the petitioners' two experts. Each of the responde nt's four experts has vastly more experience and academic credentials than Dr. Hepne r. Dr. Kenne dy does have impre ssive credentials in terms of academic backg round, publ ications, and length of experience. Howeve r, Dr. Bustin's PCR experience and Dr. Rima's experience with the measles virus far exceed Dr. Kenne dy's. Over all, the scale tips considera bly in the favor of responde nt's experts. There fore, this factor adds yet another reason for me to conclude that the Unig enetics measles virus testing should not be considere d reliable .95 8. Sum mary conce rning reliabilit y of the Unigenetics testing As explained in detail above, a number of factors have contributed to my conclusion that the Unig enetics testing for measles virus cannot be considere d reliable. As explained, the most important factors in my rejection of the Unig enetics testing are that the labora tory failed to publish any sequenc ing data to confirm the validity of its testing, the failure of the efforts by other labora tories to replica te the Unig enetics te sting, a nd the demonstration by the D'Souz a group that the Uhlmann primer s were \"nonspec ific.\" In addition, the testimony of Drs. B ustin, Ri ma, and Ma cDona ld convinced me that sever e problems existed with the procedures, facilities, and equipment of the Unig enetics labora tory, adding a secondary , additional reason to doubt the reliabilit y of the Unigene tics testing. Other important factors are the failure of the petitioners to supply any persua sive evidenc e that any detec materia l was vaccine-strain measles virus materia l, the drama tic contra st betwee n the credentials of the expert witnesses for the two sides, and the lack of persua siveness of the petitioners' ma in arg uments.96 Of course , this is not to say that a factfinder need always adopt the view of the expert with95 more experience or more striking academic credentials. Sometimes an expert with lesser experience or credentials may offer superior analy sis. In this case, it is simply noteworthy that responde nt's experts, in addition to offering more persua sive testimony , also do possess substantially superior experience and backg round conce rning the topic of the reliability of PCR testing for measles virus. As I will discuss in detail below, two committees selec ted by the prestig ious Institute of96 Medicine (IOM) have examined the evidenc e conce rning the issue of whether the MMR vaccine can cause autism, and both answe red that question in the negative . (See p. 124 below.) The 2004 IOM committee also comment ed specific ally conce rning the repor ted finding by the Unigenetics laboratory of evidenc e of measles virus in the intestinal tissue of autistic children, as repor ted in the Uhlmann article . (Ex. JJ , pp. 127-28.) The committee reached no firm conclusion conce rning the validity of the Unig enetics testing. The committee's discussion, howeve r, indicated that the committee had doubts conce rning the reliability of the testing, descr ibing the test results as \"questionable .\" (Id. at 128.) 77For all of those reasons, I conclude that the Unig enetics testing for measles virus was not reliable . I conclude that the Unig enetics labora tory never reliably detec ted the prese nce of measles virus, in the Uhlmann study or in the testing of individual samples of persons such as Michelle Cedillo and Colten Snyder. And, in particula r, I conclude that the purported detec tion by Unigenetics of measles virus in the tissue of Miche lle Cedillo was not reliable and cannot be considere d valid. F. Motion concerning Dr. Bu stin Petitioners have reque sted that I exclude from considera tion in this case the hearing testimony of Dr. Bustin, as well as two of his expert repor ts, Exs. WW and XX, because those two repor ts were filed shortly befor e the he aring in this case, and because Dr. B ustin had acc ess to the Unig enetics labora tory and records that may not have been available to petitioners' experts. There are two answe rs to this argument. First, while some of petitioners' conce rns in this regard may have some appea l at first glance , upon complete analy sis of the issue I see no good reason to disreg ard the repor ts and testimony of this competent and r eleva nt witness. The sec ond answe r is that the issue is really a moot one. Tha t is, while I have elected to inc lude an a nalysis of Dr. B ustin's testimony and those repor ts in this opinion, even if I were to complete ly exclude Dr. Bustin's testimony and all of his expert repor ts, nevertheless my ruling s conce rning (1) the issue of the reliability of the Unig enetics testing, and (2) the outcome of this case, would be the same . I will explain my reasoning c oncer ning this matter be low. 1. Background As explained above, on D ecember 20, 2006, the Petitioners' Steering Commi ttee (PSC) in the Omnibus Autism Procee ding (OAP) proposed that this Cedillo case become a \"test case\" in the OAP. They proposed that an evidenti ary hearing be held in June of 2007, conce rning both the evidenc e concer ning the PSC's first theory of general causation , and the evidence specific to this Cedillo case . (See pp. 12-13 above.) According to that proposal, which the three specia l masters adopted, the petitioners' expert repor ts in this case were to be filed in Februar y of 2007, and the responde nt's expert repor ts were to be filed in April. (Orde r filed F ebrua ry 1, 2007.) Eventually , a number of ex pert reports were, in fact, filed by the petit ioners on Februar y 20, 2007, and by the responde nt on April 24, 2007. A number of additional expert repor ts, howeve r, were filed after those agreed-upon Februar y and April deadlines. Petitioners filed expert repor ts of Dr. Hepne r on May 22, 2007, and Dr. Kenne dy on May 28, 2007. (Exs. 63, 110.) Respondent on May 31, 2007, filed an expert repor t from Dr. Bustin, as a response to the repor t of Dr. Hepne r. (Ex. UU.) All three of those experts were added to the list of witnesses schedule d to testify at the hearing. No party objected to the filing of any of those three expert repor ts, or to the addition of any of those three experts to the hearing schedule . 78On June 7, 2007, four days befor e the schedule d start of the evidentiar y hearing on June 11, responde nt filed Exhibits WW and XX. Those exhibi ts were copies of expert reports that97 Dr. Bustin had prepared and filed in 2003 and 2004 in the course of the above- descr ibed British MMR/autism litigation. (See p. 50 and fn. 69 above.) A recorded status confe rence to discuss those repor ts was conducte d on June 8, 2007. (Tr. 6-8-07.) At that confe rence, responde nt's counsel explained in detail the circumstances under which responde nt had obtained those two documents from the British cour t file, which is sea led and unavailable to the public absent specia l permission from the presiding judge . (Tr. 6-8-07 at 13-23.) Petitioners' counsel then I disreg ard those two exhibi ts in deciding this case, and that Dr. Bustin and other witnesses be prohibited, during the upcoming hearing, from discussing the contents of those two repor ts. (Tr. 6-8-07 at 23-30, 39- 41.) I filed a written Evidentiary Ruling on that same day, June 8, 2007, after the confe rence. In that Ruling I stated that, during the upcoming hearing, I would allow questions conce rning the two repor ts to be asked of Dr. Bustin or other witnesses. I also stated, howeve r, that I would defer , until after the he aring , the dec ision whether to rely upon those two repor ts in deciding this case. After the hearing, on August 8, 2007, petitioners addre ssed this matter again, filing a motion asking that I disreg ard both the two repor ts and all of the hearing testimony of Dr. Bustin. Respondent filed a deta iled response to that motion on S eptember 7, 2007. On Octobe r 2, 2007, I filed an O rder conce rning the petitioners' motion filed on Aug ust 8. I stated that petitioners-- have, as of this time, not demonstrated good reason for me to exclude these evidentiary items from considera tion in this case. The arguments made in petitioners' motion were extremely vague, failing to explain exactly what portion s of Dr. B ustin's reports and te stimony are prejudicia l, and why. Acc ording ly, I will not, at this time, exclude any of those items from considera tion. I will defer, rathe r, until the pos t-hea ring briefing in this case, the decision whether to rely upon those items in deciding the Cedillo case. Petitioners may make addit ional arguments conce if de in their post-he aring briefs. Subsequent to my Orde r of October 2, 2007, petitioners have filed four lengthy post-hear ing briefs. In those briefs, howeve r, they did not explain how they had been disadvantag ed at the hearing, nor did they further addre ss the issue of whether I should disreg ard Exs. WW and XX and Dr. Bustin's hearing te stimony in deciding this case. Under the court's electronic filing system, responde nt actua lly filed with the court on97 June 7, 2007, only the electronic \"notice of filing\" the documents (items 124 and 126 of the docket entries) ; the compac t discs containing the repor ts were not physically filed with the court until later. But petitioners' counsel actua lly received the full text of the documents, electronically , on J une 7, 2007. 792. Discussion The petitioners have raised two issues which, at first glance , might seem to have at least some appea l. One conce rn is the fact that two of Dr. Bustin's expert repor ts were filed just four days befor e the hearing, limit ing the time for petitioners' counsel to study the documents and prepa re to deal with them at the hearing. The second concern is that there might be a possi ble perception of \"unfa irness\" to pe titioners, a rising from the circumstance (1) that Dr. Bustin had a ccess to records of the Unig enetics te sting that may no longe r be available , and (2) that responde nt obta ined only a few documents from the British MMR/autism litigation, while many other documents rema in under seal in that file. I will discuss those two concer ns separ ately below. a. Fili ng sh ortly before trial It is very unfortunate that the two reports were filed just four days befor e the hearing. Obviously , that circumstance limit ed the opportunity for the petitioners' counsel and experts to study the documents befor e the hearing, to prepa re a response thereto at the hearing, and to prepa re to question Dr. Bustin about the repor ts. Howeve r, there are other considera tions that affected my original decision t o allow t he two reports to be dis cussed at the evidentiary hearing, and t hat now milit ate against the option of simply disreg arding the two repor ts and Dr. Bustin's testimony in this opinion. First, in this case, a number of evidentiar y items were filed by both parties at a very late stage of the proce eding s. For example, as noted above, the petitioners' expert repor ts were due to be filed in Februar y of 2007, and petitioners did file four expert repor ts on Februar y 20, 2007. (Exs. 55, 57, 59, 61.) Yet, while it was quite clear from those four filed expert repor ts that the validity of the Unig enetics testing was crucial to the case, none of petitioners' initial four expert repor ts were authore d by experts in PCR . Rather, the petitioners did not file the expert repor ts of their two PCR experts, Drs. Hepne r and Kenne dy, until May 22 and 28, respe ctively , very close to the hearing date and more than three months after the due date for petitioners' expert repor ts. Further, a number of other documents were filed in this case by both parties after May 25, 2007, which was the presc ribed deadline f or filing evidentiar y items.98 Second, one expert repor t (Ex. UU) and an affidavit of Dr. Bustin were already filed in this99 case prior to the filing of Exs. WW and XX, and Dr. Bustin was already scheduled to testify . Dr. Bustin's earlier-f iled repor t and affidavit addre same general issue addre ssed During the confe rence held on June 8, 2007, I asked petitioners' counsel if she was98 proposing that I should disreg ard all evide nce filed after May 25, 2007. She declined to suggest such a cour se. (Tr . 6-8-07, p. 46.) On May 22, 2007, responde nt filed a \"Motion In Limine ,\" seeking to exclude the testimony99 of petitioners' expert Dr. Krigsman. Attache d to tha t motion, as Attachment 4, was an affidavit of Dr. B ustin. (I note that I denied that \" Motion In Limine \" on May 29, 2007.) 80in Exs. WW and XX-- i.e., the reliability of the Unig enetics lab results. Further, much additional evidenc e was already in the record, filed by both parties, addre ssing that same general issue, so the petitioners' c ounsel ce rtainly were already generally prepa red to a ddress that issue a t the hear ing. In addition, responde nt filed the two repor ts on June 7 within about an hour of receiving them, so that there is no indication that the responde nt unrea sonably delay ed in filing those repor ts after receiving them. (Tr. 6-8-07, pp. 44.) Petitioners' arguments have suggested that responde nt's counsel were negligent or dilatory in not obtaining those repor ts from the British court at an earlier time. But, as responde nt's counsel explained, it was not c lear that petitioners' theor y of ca usation depende d on the validity of the Unigenetics testing until after the filing of the petitioners' expert report s on Februar y 20, 2007. (Tr. 6-8-07 at 13.) Further, responde nt's counsel descr ibed the proce ss by which the respondent there after soug ht documents relevant to Unig enetics from the British cour t, eventually receiving certain documents on June 7. (Id. at 13-23.) Considering all of the circ umstances, I can f ind no failure of diligenc e by responde nt in that reg ard. Further, throughout the history of the Vaccine Act, the specia l masters, including myself, have often been lenient in allowing new items of evidence to be filed just prior to, or even during the course of, evidentiar y hearings. Most often, the party seeking to introduce the late evidenc e has been the petitioner in the case. The specia l masters' reasoning in these situations has been that it is generally better to hear all of the relevant evidenc e than to decide a case based on incomplete evidence. The reme dy for the late filing in such situations has been to give the opposing party additional time, after the hearing , to obtain and file any new e vidence to rebut the late -filed item. On some occasions this practice has resulted in the need for a second evidentiar y hearing in the case, but the special master on those occasions generally has been willing to conduct such a second hearing when necessary , in the interest of reaching a decision based upon all of the relevant evidenc e. As I stated in my Evidentiary Ruling on June 8, 2007, I considere d it appropr iate to100 apply that general rationale to this case. Moreove r, because this case had been desig nated as a \"test case\" in the Omnibus Autism Procee ding, the outcome of which would give direc tion to other autism petitioners, it seemed a ll the more important to explore all potentially relevant evidenc e. I also note that, in this case, I have given the petitioners a very fair chance to rebut the late- filed evide nce c ontained in Dr. B ustin's two repor ts. In my Evidentiary Ruling on June 8, 2007, I promised petitioners a reasonable period of time after the hearing in which to seek evidenc e to rebut The case law conce rning this point is scant, since most such discretionar y deter minations,100 regarding whether to permit the filing of evidenc e, are made without written ruling s. Howeve r, two decisions illust rate the general conce pt that the Vaccine Act specia l masters should avoid the exclusion of relevant evidenc e. In Kaminski v. Secre tary of HHS , 39 Fed. Cl. 253, 255, 258 (1997), a judge found that the specia l master' s refusal to hear the testimony of an important witness was error, even though the witness was offered by responde nt only after the evide ntiary hearing. , 35 Fed. Cl. 23, 27-28 (1996), a judge conclude d that when relevant evidenc e was discovere d one month after the dismiss al of the case, the specia l master erred in failing to re-open the case and consider the evidenc e. See also Plavin v. Secretary of HHS , 612 (1997). 81the m aterial contained in the two reports. Indeed, they have actually had a post-hear ing period of well over a year in which to submit such evidenc e. And, in fact, they have submitt ed such rebuttal evidenc e, in the form of supplemental expert repor ts from their two PCR experts. (See Exs. 120 and 121, supplemental expert repor ts of Dr. Hepne r and Dr. Kenne dy, filed on October 22 and November 6, 2007.) Further, in my Evidentiary Ruling on June 8, 2007, I expli citly offered petitioners a second evide ntiary hearing , if desired, in which to prese nt any such evidenc e that they migh t be able to obtain. They never reque sted such a he aring . Also, they never reque sted that Dr. Bustin be made available for a dditional cross-examination, a re quest that I would have g rante d. Finally , in my Orde r issued on October 2, 2007, I expli citly invited petitioners, in their post- hearing briefs, to explain exactly what portions of Dr. Bustin's repor ts and/or testimony were prejudicia l, and why --i.e., to further explain their vag ue ar guments that the late filing of those two repor ts hamper ed them at the heari ng. Petitioners' four lengthy post-hear ing briefs, howeve r, contained no suc h specific argument. According ly, for all the reasons stated above, I conclude that the fact that Exs. WW and XX were filed shor tly befor e the he aring does not require that I disreg ard those repor ts, or any portion of Dr. B ustin's testimony . b. Acce ss to Bri tish litigat ion file Petitioners' arguments conce rning this matter have also sugges ted that the filing of Dr. Bustin's two repor ts obtained from the British litigation file is \"unfa ir\" to the petitioners, in two closely related but analy tically distinct ways. First, they perceive unfairne ss in the fact that respondent obtained only a few documents from the British file, while many other documents101 rema in in the seale d file, inacc essible without specia l permission of the British court. Second, they see unfairne ss in the fact that, in prepa ring the two repor ts in question, Dr. Bustin had access to records of the U nigenetics testing that may not have be en ava ilable to petitioners' e xperts. Along with Dr. Bustin's two repor ts, responde nt also obtained, from the British court,101 copies of two other expert repor ts that had been filed into the British litigation. Those repor ts were authore d by Dr. Rima and by Dr. Peter Simm onds. Respondent share d those other two repor ts with petitioners' c ounsel at the time, but did not file them into the re cord of this Cedillo case . (See my Evidentiary Ruling filed on June 8, 2007, footnote 2.) Respondent did later, howeve r, file those two Rima and Simm onds repor ts into the evidentiar y record of the Snyder case. (Snyder Exs. P and S.) Then, it was at the Cedillos' own request , and over responde nt's objection, that the \"general causa tion\" evidenc e from the Snyder and including the Rima and Simm onds repor ts from the British litigation, came to be \"imported\" into the evidentiar y record of this Cedillo case. (See pp. 14- 15 above.) 82Whil e these suggestions of unfairne ss might have some appea l at first glance , I conclude that they do not offer a good reason to disreg ard, in this case, the evidentiar y value of the two repor ts and Dr. B ustin's hearing testimony . Concerning the issue of access to the British litigation file, I note that in my Evidentiary Ruling issued on June 8, 2007, I encour aged (p. 3) petitioners' counsel to seek additional documents from that file after the hearing, even pledg ing to join petitioners' counsel in such a reque st. And102 efforts in that direc tion were, in fact, made on behalf of the Cedillos and the other autism petitioners, by the Petitioners' ttee (PSC) in the Omn ibus Autism Procee ding (OAP), led by attorney Thomas P ower s of the PSC. During the reg ular OA P status confere nces be tween July of 2007 and July of 2008, Mr. Powers repor ted that the PSC was exploring the possibili ty of petitioning the British court for release of additional documents. (See, e.g., Autism Updates filed into the Autism Maste r File on Marc h 27, 2008, pp. 2-3; April 23, 2008, pp. 2-3.) The PSC reque sted that the OAP specia l masters provide a letter supporting the PSC 's possible reque st, which the spec ial masters did provide. (See Autism Update filed Marc h 27, 2008, p. 2 and Ex. A.) Mr. Powers finally repor ted, howeve r, in July of 2008, that the PSC would not file an application with the British court. (See Autism Update filed July 8, 2008, p. 2; Orde r filed in this Cedillo case on July 30, 2008.) Mr. Powers explained that the PSC had sought to obtain six repor ts filed by experts f or the British claimants, but was unable to obtain the agreement of all such experts to have their repor ts disclosed publicly ; British attorney s consulted by the PSC advised that without agreement of the experts, the British court was unlikely to grant disclosure of the repor ts, so the PSC never filed an application. (See A utism Updates filed Mar ch 27, 2008, p. 3; April 23, 2008, p. 3; J uly 8, 2008, p. 2. )103 Whil e it is unfortunate f or the petiti oners that they have be en unable to obtain cooper ation from the claimants' experts in the British litigation, and there fore have been unable to obtain any additional ex pert reports from the British litigation fil e, I cannot see why that means that I should disregard the repor ts and testimony of Dr. Bustin. Dr. Bustin was willing to publicly affirm and defend, in 2007, the opinions that he stated in his British litigation repor ts. He was willing to answe r, under oath, petitioners' questions about those repor ts. Appar ently the experts who supplied repor ts for the British claimants were not willing to do the same, but that is not the fault of Dr. Bustin or respondent. I have been willi ng to study any item of evidence put before me by the Petitioners were given a list of the materia ls contained in the British litigation file, the same102 publicly -available document that responde nt used when deciding which materia ls to seek from that file. (See Item 129 on the electronic docket of this case, responde nt's filing of June 8, 2007, Attachment 1.) In the \"PSC Notice Re: UK Litigation Materia ls,\" filed into the Autism Master File on103 July 31, 2008, the PSC implied that it secured the ag reement of some , though not all of the British claimants' experts, to have their repor ts disclosed. Also, Dr. Kenne dy, one of those claimants' experts, testified t hat he had no objection t o the release of his repor t. (Snyder Tr. 424A-25A). In these circumstances, assuming that the PSC actua lly does find it important to see those expert repor ts, it is unclea r why the PSC did not petition the British court for access to those expert repor ts for whic h it could obtain the authors' permission. 83parties, and I would have been happy to analy ze any further documents obtained from the British file, but I simply do not find it logic al that I should disreg ard the repor ts of Dr. Bustin in these circumstances. Nor have pe titioners cited any legal authority suggesting why I should do so. The other suggested point of alleg ed unfairne ss seems to be that Dr. Bustin in 2003 and 2004 had access to Unig enetics records that may not now be available to petitioners' experts. In this regard, it may be that some or all of the Unig enetics records are unavailable , either because they are seale d in the British court file, or because they no longe r exist due to the demise of Unig enetics, or for some other r eason. Petitioners' c ounsel, howeve r, have not demonstrated tha t they have made any efforts to deter mine exactly wher e such records are located, whether such records have been destroy ed, etc., so they are in a poor position to complain about a lack of access to suc h records.104 Further, it appea rs that the British litigation file includes, in addition to expert repor ts, certain Unig enetics records. Neither the Cedillos' counsel nor the PSC attorney s have explained why, if they believe that they are disadvantag ed by a lack of access to Unig enetics records, they have never petitioned the British court for access to those Unigenetics recor ds, even if they believed that the court would not likely grant a ccess to the expert reports . Moreove r, petitioners' current expert Dr. Kenne dy was, like Dr. Bustin, an expert in the British litigation, and has expertise in PCR testing. Dr. Kenne dy explained that he did have his own non-publicly -available information about the opera tion of the tory. (Tr. 813-15.) Dr. Kenne dy not only receiving information orally from enetics principal Dr. Sheils during the above- descr ibed meeting of experts, but stated also that he and other experts had \"aske d for a lot of things\" that were not prese nted initially by Dr. Sheils, and those items of information were provided to him by Unig enetics at an unspe cified la ter time. (Tr . 815, lines 10-23.) Further, Dr. Kenne dy explained that he had access to many of the Unig enetic s labora tory notebooks. (Tr. 854A.) There fore, it appea rs that Dr. Kenne dy did, in fact, have access to at least some of the information to which Dr . Bustin also had a ccess.105 To be sure, althoug h the petitioners have not demonstrated as much, it does seem quite possible that access to the Unig enetics records is unavailable to petitioners at this time, because such That is, it seems to me that if the petitioners wish me to disreg ard relevant evidenc e based104 upon the petitioners' alleg ed lack of access to certain documents, it is incumbent on the petitioners' counsel to demonstrate that they in fact have no access to those documents despite efforts to obtain them. In fact, Dr. Kennedy had already introduced into t he record of this case his own \"insi de105 110, p. 8, line 11--before responde nt filed the two repor ts of Dr. Bustin which drew upon Dr. Bustin's access to the Unig enetics labora tory. Thus, es \"inside information\" about the Unig enetics labora was not available to respond ent's experts, petitioners are not well-plac ed to complain that it is unfair that Dr. Bustin had his own non-publicly - available source of informa tion about Unige netics. 84records either are in seale d British court files or were destroy ed. If that is the case, it would mean, as petitioners ha ve pointed out, tha t petitioners a re unable to ha ve their own expert now scrutinize the Unigene tics records t o deter mine whether Dr. Bustin's analy sis is accurate. Howeve r, even if I assume that petitioners do not in fact have any way to access such records at this time, I do not see why that logic ally means that I should there fore ignor e the repor ts and testimony of Dr. Bustin, just because he did have such access at the time that he prepa red Exs. WW and XX. Petitioners have not explained why, or pointed to any legal authority explaining why, I should there fore ignor e a witness who did provide re levant evide nce. c. Eve n if I were to disregard Dr. Bu stin's expe rt reports and h earing testim ony, all m y conclusions in this case would rem ain th e sam e. Finally , even if I were to completely exclude and disreg ard all of Dr. Bustin's repor ts and all of his hear ing te stimony , never theless all of my conclusions i n this case would r emain exactly the same . First, the testimony and repor ts of Dr. Bustin were relevant chief ly in establishing my conclusion discussed at pp. 58-60 above, i.e., that there were sever e problems with the facilities and proce dures of the Unig enetics labora tory. But even conce rning this narrow point, Dr. Bustin's testimony was not the only evidenc e. Dr. Rima provided extensive, convincing evidenc e to the same effect, and Dr. MacD onald provided some corroboration as well. (See discussion at pp. 52-54, 58-59 above.) I would have reached the same conclusion, that there were sever e problems with the Unig enetics facilities and proce dures, based just on the evidenc e supplied by Dr. Rima and Dr. Mac Donald, eve n without any information from Dr . Bustin. Second, even if there had been no testimony from Dr. Bustin, Dr. Rima, Dr. MacD onald, or any other expert who participa ted in the British litigation, conce rning the probl ems with the Unig enetics proce dures and facilities, never theless I still would have conclude d that the Unig enetics testing was not reliable . That is, as explained above (p. 77), the most important points in my rejection of the Unig enetics testing were (1) the fact that the labora tory failed to publish any sequenc ing data to confirm the validity of its testing, (2) the failure of other labora tories to replica te the Unig enetics testing, and (3) the demonstration by the D'Souza group that the Uhlmann primers were \"nonspec ific.\" The testimony by Drs. Bustin, Rima, and MacD onald, about the many problems with the Unig enetics labora tory and proce dures, was mere ly a secondary , additional reason to doubt the reliabili ty of the Unig enetics testing. According ly, I would still have found the Unig enetics testing to be unreliable even if there had been no repor ts or testimony at all from Drs. Bustin, Rima, or Mac Donald. According ly, for all the reasons se t forth above , I conclude (1) that ther e is no valid reason for me to disregard the evidenc e supplied by Dr. Bustin, and (2) that even if I did disreg ard that evidenc e, my conclusions conc erning all of the issues in this case w ould remain the sa me. 85VII PETIT IONERS HAVE NOT DEMONSTRATED TH AT THE MMR VACCIN E CAN CAUSE AUTISM IN GENERAL, OR THAT AN MM R VACCIN ATION DID CAUSE MICHELLE 'S AUTISM A. Su mmary of pe tition ers' theory The next step in petitioners' theory is that the vaccine-stra in measles virus, persisting in Michelle's body , damag ed her brain, there by causing her autism. In this regard, they rely primarily on the testimony of Dr. Marc el Kinsbourne, who has substantial credenti als as a pediatric neurolog ist. Dr. Kinsbourne accepts the accuracy of the testing of the gut biopsy of Michelle discussed above, as a demonstration t hat the vaccine- strain m easles virus persisted and replica ted in her body . (Tr. 1180A , 1183A, 1196A.) H e opined that the persisti ng virus invaded Michelle's brain, prompting a response of her immune system, and that the inflammation produce d by that response disorg anized certain critical circuits in her brain, there by causing the autism. (E.g., Tr. 1098A-1100.) In support of this theor y, Dr. Kinsbourne opined that autism is a neurolog ical disorder , the product of defective brain circuitry. (Ex. 61, p. 7.) He explained that the measles virus, in its \"wild\" non-vac cine form, has been found in the past to cause a number of neurolog ic disorders. Those disorders include \"mea sles encephalitis,\" which used to be a relatively common disorder after measles infec tion, and also two rare fatal neurolog as SSPE (subac ute 15-16; Tr. 1067A- 69A.) He stated that the measles virus, once inside a human body , is known to be both \"ente rotropic,\" meaning prone to invade the intestines, and \"neur otropic,\" meaning prone to invade the centr al nervous system and brain. (Ex. 61, p. 14; Tr. 1073.) He opined that since Michelle has experience d both chronic gastrointestinal problems and the chronic neurolog ic disorder known as autism, the most reasonable conclusion is that a single causa tive agent-- i.e., the vaccine-stra in measles virus- -is the ca use of both chronic conditions. (Ex . 61, pp. 12-14.) In Michelle's case, Dr. Kinsbourne also found the timing of the onset of Michelle's chronic intestinal symptoms and her symptoms of autism to be quite important. He opined that Michelle was a normally developing infant up until the time of her MMR vaccination on December 20, 1995, when she wa s about 16 months old. (Ex . 61, p. 19; Tr. 1040.) He testified that the episode of feve r and rash that Michelle experience d about one week after that vaccination was cause d by the vaccination. (Tr. 1070-71.) He stated that Michelle began to suffer diarrhe a \"within two weeks\" of the vaccination, which he viewed as the onset of her chronic gastrointestinal problems. (Tr. 1042.) He also stated that Miche lle's first sy mptoms of neurologic dysfunction, which later we re recognized to be symptoms of autism , began abruptly during the period of fever that began one week after that vaccination. (Ex. 61, p. 3; Tr. 1041, conce rning the timing of Michelle's symptoms-- i.e., his understanding that the onset of both Michelle 's chronic gastrointestinal symptoms and her autism 86occur red abruptly within about two weeks after her MMR vaccination--also contributed to his conclusion that the MMR vacc ination was a substantial fa ctor in ca Miche lle's autism. Finally , Dr. Kinsbourne also seeme d to find it important that Michelle's autism falls, in his opinion, into t he ca tegory of \"r egressive a utism.\" Regressive autism is a form of autism in which the child does not me rely fail to de velop normally , but a ctually loses skills in language and related areas, usually sometime during the second year of life. (Ex. 61, pp. 9-10; Tr. 1054-55, 1059A -60, 1176.) This aspec t of Dr. Kinsbourne' s testimony seemed to indicate his view that the MMR vaccine is likely to play a causa tive role specifically in cases of regressive autism , as opposed to autistic cases in which the child does not experience regression. And the petitioners' briefs also indicate that the petitioners' causa tion theory in this case is specific ally targeted to cases of regressive autism, as opposed to other c ases of autism. (E.g., P1 at 122.)106 B. Reasons for rejecting petiti oners' general theory After a complete analy sis of the record, I conclude that I must reject both petitioners' general theory conce rning the causa tion of autism, and their contention that the measles virus substantially contribut ed to Michelle's own autism. Petitioners have failed to demonstrate that it is \"more probable than not\" either that the MMR vaccine can cause or contribute to autism in general, or that a MMR vaccination did cause or contribute to Michelle's autism. In this Part B of Section VII of this Decision, I will discuss petitioners' and Dr. Kinsbourne' s general theory that the measles virus can cause or contribute to autism. There after, in Part C, I will discuss the issue of the specific causa tion of Michelle's own a utism. I will divide my discussion, conce rning petitioners' general theory that the measles virus can contribute to the c ausation of autism, into nine parts below. Those point s may be sum marized as follows: First, Dr. Kinsbourne' s general causation theory depends, in any individual case, upon the existence of a reliable labora tory test that finds persisting measles virus in the autistic child's body . Such a reliable test, howeve r, likely does not exist . Second, even if in some case a reliable test could demonstrate the existence of persisting vacci ne-strain measles virus in an autistic person' s body , the available evidenc e still does not demonstrate tha t measles virus per sistence in the br ain would re sult in autism . Third, the fact that the wild measles virus has never been shown to cause autism makes it quite unlikely that the vaccine-strain form of the measles virus c an ca use autism. Dr. Kins ated further his expert106 repor ts and hearing testimony in the Snyder case . (Snyder Exs. 29, 215; Snyder Tr. 438-563A.) I have fully considere d those repor ts and that testimony of Dr. Kinsbourne in reaching my conclusions stated in this opinion. 87Four th, Dr. Kinsbourn e's causation theory seems unlikely in light of sever al accepted understanding s conc erning the causa tion of autism. The theory seems doubtful in light of the accepted points that there is a strong genetic component to autism, and that the only non-g enetic factors that have ever been conclusively found to contribute to autism are factors that influence development during the early prenatal period. The petitioners' theory is also directly contradicted by autopsy studies demonstrating that the brains of autistic individuals show abnorma l features that, of nec essity , would have oc curred during specific parts of the prenatal period. Fifth, there are other difficulties with Dr. Kinsbourne' s theory , espec ially the contra dictions and testimony conce autism sy mptoms, under his causation theor y. Sixth, the testimony of Dr. Corbier, Dr. Hepne r, and Dr. Kenne dy fails to provide any substantial support to Dr. Kinsbourne' s causa tion theory . nt's experts conce rning this substantially exceed the qua lifications of the pe titioners' expert witnesses. Eighth, the epidemiolog ic evidence, consisting of numerous studies by qualified medical researchers around the world, adds another reason to reject the petitioners' theor y that the MMR vaccine ca n contribute to the c ausation of a utism. Ninth, two well-qua lified committees of medical experts, selec ted by the Institut e of Medicine, ha ve extensively studied the general MMR/autism causa tion issue, and have conclude d that the evidenc e favors rejec tion of the proposition that the MMR vacc ine ca n cause autism. I will ex plain eac h of these nine points in detail below. 1. Petitioners' theory depends upon th e existence of reliable laboratory test findings of persisting m easles virus, but n o such reliable findi ngs exist . Dr. Kinsbourne made it clear that his causation theory depende d upon assuming the existence of a reliable labora tory test that finds persisting measles virus in the autistic child's body . (E.g., Tr. 1180A, 1196.) Dr. Kinsbourne indicated that in no case could he opine that a person' s autism was cause d by the M MR vaccine in the absence of a reliable finding of persisting m easle s virus in the vaccinee' s body Howeve r, for the reasons already explained above in section VI of this Decision, I have conclude d that the Unig enetics labora tory results purporting to find persisting measles virus in Miche lle's case, and purporting to find persisting measles virus in other autistic children, are not reliable . Petitioners clearly have failed to demonstrate that any labora tory has reliably found persisting measles virus in any autistic individual. There fore, petitioners' and Dr. Kinsbourne' s general causation theory , that the MMR vaccine can contribute to the causa tion of autism, is left without expert support, and must be re jected f or that re ason alone . 882. The available evidence does not demon strate any substan tial likelihood that measles virus persistence in th e brain wou ld cause autism . Dr. Kinsbourne hypothesizes that Michelle's autism resulted, in substantial part, from the persistenc e of measles virus in Michelle's brain. Howeve r, responde nt's experts argued convincing ly that there is no good reason for c oncluding that the persistence of measles virus in a human brain would cause autism . Rather, those experts argued, the available evidenc e indicates that the per sistence of measles virus in a br ain would much more likely result in death . First, I note t he testi mony of Dr. Diane Griffin, who has very impressive credent ials as an expert on the measles virus. (Tr. 2743A-48A.) Dr. Griff in testified that Dr. Kinsbourne' s hypothesis that the measles virus enter s the brain and cause s autism is not biologica lly plausible. (Tr. 2795A- 97.) She stated that \" [w]e know a lot a bout w hat measles virus does when it gets in the brain, and none of it is autism.\" (Tr. 2796; see also Tr. 2865.) She explained that persisting measles virus infec tions of the brain are known to result in one of two conditions: SSPE and MIBE. (Ex. V, pp.107 9-10; Tr. Griff in stated that SSPE is the \"only disease cause d by persistent MV [measle s virus] infec tion in immunologically competent individuals.\" (Ex. V, p. 9.) In individuals who are sever ely immunologically deficient , on the other hand, persistent measles virus infec tion of the brain results in MIBE. (Ex. V, p. 10.) Both conditions a lmost alwa ys result in death, with MIBE taking a swifter course to that end. (Ex. V, pp. 9-10.) A second expert of responde nt, Dr. Brian Ward, a medical doctor specia lizing in infec tious disease and virolog y who has also studied the measles virus, simil arly testified that Dr. Kinsbourne' s hypothesis was specula tive and unlikely . Dr. Ward explained that when measles virus persists in a human brain, death results from S SPE or MI BE, and any other outcome would be \"ne w biology ,\" currently unknown to medical scienc e. (Tr. 1828A-29A, nt, pediatric neurolog ists Dr. Max Wiznitzer and Dr. Robert Rust, made essentially the same point. Dr. Wiznitzer testified that the only known result of a persisting measles virus brain infec tion would be death by SSPE or MIBE. (Tr. 1626-29.) He explained that the symptoms known to be cause d by measles virus in the brain are \"totally differ ent\" from the symptoms of autism . (Tr. 1627-28.) Dr. W iznitzer opined t hat Dr. Kinsbourne's theory \"does not follow any [known] biologic mode l of a sles infec tion the brain\" (Tr. 1774A ), so Kinsbourne' s theory would require a \"novel biologic model,\" for which no evidenc e exists (Tr. 1776A). Simi larly, Dr. Rus t testified t hat \"we understand espec ially what measles virus may or may not do within the nervous system,\" and that knowledg e is incompatible with the theory that the per sisting measle s virus would cause autism . (Hazlehurst Tr. 507A.) Dr. Rus t explained that Respondent's ex perts ex plained that the m easle s virus can have a third type of effect on107 the not direc tly cause d by the measles virus, but is the result of an immune-mediated proce ss prompted by a mea sles virus infec (Tr. 1626-29.) 89persisting measles in SSPE or MIBE. (Id. at 508A-09A.) He added that medical scientists were \"try[ing] to keep an open mind\" conce rning the issue of whether measles virus might cause autism as well, but noted that researchers had looked for that possibili ty (\"gone at that with a will\"), but simply had not found a ny evidenc e to support that theory . (Id. at 508A.) Of course , it is not impossibl e that persisting measles virus in a human brain might in some individuals have a resul t different from SSPE or MIBE. But Dr. Kinsbourne has supplied no evide nce for such a possibili ty, beyond his own unsubstantiated specula tion. And as to the issue108 of whether I should adopt Dr. Kinsbourne' s unsubstantiated s pecula tion on this point, conce rning what effect a persisting measl es virus might cause in a human brain, I find the evidenc e to weig h heavily in responde nt's favor . On this point, I have on one si de the testimony of Drs. Griff in and At the end of the evidentiar y hearing in this ca se, the pe titioners produce d an \"e ditorial\"108 published in a medical journal by Dr. Paul Dyken, in which Dr. Dyken prese nted a theory conce rning the existence of syndrome that he calls \"Mea sles Induced Neur oautist ic Encephalopathy \" or \"MINE.\" Dyken, Some Aspects about the Clini cal and Pathogenetic Characteristics of the Presume d Persistent Measles Infec tions: SSPE and MINE , 2 J. PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY 121 (2004). (P. Trial Ex. 17.) Dr. Dyken wrote that his postulated syndrome was \"first recognized in the late 1990s by Wakefield.\" (Id. at 122.) According to this theory , the vaccine-stra in measles virus cause s autism. ( Id. at 122-23.) This document of Dr. Dyken, and his MINE theory , were never mentioned by any of the petitioners' experts in this Cedillo case, nor did petitioners mention the document or theory in their post-hear ing briefs. The record contains no signific ant descr iption of Dr. Dyken's training , experience , or credentials. Strang ely, the only use of the document by petitioners in this Cedillo case was to ask a question about it to one of responde nt's witnesses, during the final minutes of the last day of hearing testimony in this case. (Tr. at 2847-53.) Howeve r, Dr. Kinsbourne did mention the document briefly during his hearing testimony in the Snyder case. (Snyder Tr. 455A-56A.) He noted that Dr. Dyken was one of the physicians involved in the above- descr ibed British litigation, and seeme d to suggest that Dr. Dyken's advocacy of the MINE theory supported Dr. Kinsbourne' causa tion theory . Howeve Ward opined that Dr. Dyken's MINE theory , which was published in an \"obscure\" medical journal, is not scientifica lly sound. (Snyder Tr. 942A -43A.) I reach the same conclusion. Dr. Dyken's editorial does not explain his theory in any detail. Dr. Dyken does not descr ibe any research of his own supporting his conclusion. Rather, as Dr. Ward suggested ( Snyder Tr. at 943A) , Dr. Dy ken seems to have merely looked at Dr. W akefield's 1998 article , accepted it as true, and proposed a new name for the type of measles- cause d autism that Wakefield had postulated. But I have found that Wakefield's 1998 article provides no support for the gene ral MMR /autism causa tion theory . (See pp. conclude that Dr. Dyken's editorial, too, offe rs no support to the petitioners' MMR/autism causation theor y. (I also note that when the petitioners electronically filed their Trial Ex. 17, the Dyken editorial, they filed only two of the article's four pages. I have read the entire document, and obtained my page references set forth above, from a \"pape r copy \" of the exhibit supplied by petitioners' c ounsel during the hea ring.) 90Ward, with vast experience study ing the measles virus, plus the simil ar testimony of Drs. Wiznitzer and Rust; on the other side is the testimony of Dr. Kinsbourne, who has no specia l expertise conce rning the measles virus. I find the responde nt's experts to be much more credible and persua sive on this point. I find it to be quite unlikely that a persisting measles virus in the brain would result in autism .109 3. The ev idence indicates that th e wild m easles virus has n ot been a cause of autism . The petiti oners' contention i s that the vaccine-strain form of the m easle s virus can persist in a child's body and contribute to the causation of autism . Yet petiti oners have virtually ignor ed the ver y important point that the available e vidence makes it appe ar very unlikely that the measles virus in its natural , \"wild\" form has ever been a cause of autism. It is noteworthy that in many causa tion controve rsies in the history of the Vaccine Act, petitioners have urged that if the wild form of a virus can cause an inj ury, then i t is plausible that the vaccine form of that vi rus can cause the same injury , since the vaccine-stra in version is an intentionally attenuate d--i.e., weakened- -form of the virus. In this case, in contra st, the petitioners seem to be advanc ing a novel approa ch to vaccine causa tion, by arguing that the weakened, vaccine-strain form of the measles virus can cause autism, even though the wild measles virus has never been s hown t o cause autism. Howeve r, none of the petitioners' experts have ever explained why the vaccine-strain form of the measles virus might be capable of causing autism, even though the wild form of the measles virus has never been shown to cause autism. In this regard, I note that respond ent's expert Dr. Ward supplied testimony demonstrating that it is extre mely unlikely that the wild measles virus has ever cause d autism. Dr. Ward noted that billions of infants worldwide were infec ted by the wild measles virus just during the period from 1948 until the early 1970' s, when measles vaccines beg an to be widely implemented. (Ex. BB, p. Dr. Kinsbourne pointed to research a rticles indicating that brain inflammation is present109 in autism. E.g., D. Vargas et al., Neuroglial Activation and Neuroinflammation in the Brain of Patients with Autism , 57 ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY 67 (2005). (EX. 61, TAB MMM); C. Pardo et al., Immunity, Neuroglia and Neuroin flammation in Autism , 17 INT'L REV. PSYCHIATRY 485 (2005). (Ex. 61, Tab ZZZ.) Respondent's experts, howeve r, did not contest the proposition that inflammation may be pre sent in the brains of a utisti c persons, and may possibly play a causal role in autism. They argue, rathe r, that Dr. Kinsbourne has failed to offer any persua sive evidenc e that the vaccine-strain measles virus can play any role in causing brain inflammation in autistic persons. For example, Dr. Wiznitzer noted that the authors of the Vargas article did not suggest that the inflammation descr ibed in the article s could result from a measles infec tion, MMR vaccine, or any type of vira l infection. (Tr . 1783A-84A.) Moreove r, as set forth above, responde argued persua sively that a chronic infec tion of the brain by the measles virus would likely result in death , not autism or chronic inflammation. Thus, I conclude that, althoug h inflammation may play a role in causing autism, petitioners have wholly failed to demonstrate that it is probable that the MMR vaccine can play a role in causing chronic brain inflammation or a utism. 915; Tr. 1826A-27.) Even today , perha ps 500,000 children each year are infec ted with w ild measles worldwide. (Tr. 1827.) Yet there have been no repor ted cases of autism being cause d by wild measles since 1948. (Ex. BB, p. 5; Tr . 1827.) Further, Dr. Ward explained that if the wild measles virus was in fact causing autism, epidemiolog ists would not have missed that association. That is because measles outbr eaks typically come in wave s, so that epidemiolog ists could easily notice if incre ases in autism occur red soon after measles epidemics. (Tr. 949A.) Dr. Ward noted that after widespre ad outbr eaks of measles in certain areas of the U.S. and Canada during the 1990s, no coincidenta l incre ases in autism in those areas we re note d. (Id.) Dr. Ward's testimony in that regard was supported by an epidemiolog ic study discussed by Dr. Fombonne during the hearing. The study analy zed whether the incidence of autism was110 affected by the wave s of measles outbrea k during the period betwee n 1966 and 1986, and found no association. (Tr . 2549-50A; Ex. P , Att. 28, p. 548.) Petitioners' expert Dr. Kinsbourn e did offer one item of evidence intended to suggest that the wild measles virus might be capable of causing autism. He wrote that a medica l article, published in German by Bosc h in 1948 repor ted that \"Heller's disease,\" a disease that \"often111 reaches an autistic endpoint,\" was \"triggered by a wild measles infec tion.\" (Ex. 61, p. 11.) Petitioners filed only a copy of the Bosc h article in its original German (Ex. 61, Tab QQQ) , not a n English translation. Howeve r, responde nt's expert Dr. Ward obtained an English translation of a summary of the article , and testified that the article descr ibed just two cases of \"infa ntile112 dementia,\" (Tr. 1825A -26A.) The Bosc h article cannot be said to offer signific ant support for the proposition that the wild measles virus can contribute to the causa tion of autism. First, it is unclea r to what extent the condition repor ted in the article , descr actua lly resembles autism. Moreove r, Dr. Ward testified that there have been no cases of autism after measles infec tion repor ted in the medical literature since 1948 (Ex. BB, p. 5; Tr. 1826A-27), and that the authors of the Bosc h article itself stated that they found no repor ted cases prior to 1948 (Tr. 1827). According ly, even assuming that Heller 's Dis ease resembles autism, the exi stence of onl y two case repor ts of autistic-like disorders, among the billions who have suffe red measles infec tion over many decades, hardly constitutes evidenc e of a causal relationship. Further, as noted a bove, the testimony of Dr. Ward and Dr. Fombonne indicates that an association of measles infec tion and W. Chen et al., No Evidenc e for Links Between Autism, MMR and Measles Virus , 34110 PSYCHOLOGICAL MED. 543 (2004). ( Ex. P, Att. 28.) Gerhard B osch, (Ex. 61, Tab QQQ.) Appar ently that Eng lish translation was neve r filed into the re cord of this case.112 92autism likely would have been noticed if it existed. Thus, the Bosc h case repor ts cannot be considere d as evide nce tha t the wild measles virus ca n cause autism. To the contra ry, the evidenc e provided by Dr. Ward and Dr. Fombonne makes it extre mely unlikely that the wild measles virus has ever cause d autism. And the petitioners have not even attempted to explain why the vaccine-strain measles virus might cause autism when the wild measles virus appar ently does not. redentialed measles expert,113 Dr. Griff she could not understand how the vaccine-strain measles virus might cause something that the wild measles virus does not. (Tr. 2779A.) This analy sis conce rning the wild measles virus, thus, provides another strong reason to conclude that the petit ioners' MMR/ autism causa tion theory has no validity .114 4. Petitioners' theory seems u nlikely in l ight of accepte d scientific understan dings concerning th e causation of auti sm. It is certainly true that there is still very much about the causa tion of autism that medical scientists do not yet understand. Howeve r, it is also true that the issue of the causa tion of autism has been studied intensively for many years, and much has been learned. Respondent's experts have argued that petitioners' general causa tion theory advanc ed in this case seems unlikel y in light of certain accepted scientific understanding s conce rning the causa tion of autism. I find that argument to be per suasive. a. Three basic scie ntific un derstandin gs concerning conce rning the autism, which appea r to be well-a ccepted and not disputed by the petitioners in this case, are relevant here. The first basic point is that there is a The petitioners did file a medical article that offers a suggestion why the vaccine-strain113 measles virus might cause autism while the wild measles virus does not. Paul Dyken, Some Aspects about the Clini cal and Pathogenetic Characteristics of the Presume d Persistent Measles Infec tions: SSPE and MINE , 2 J. PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY 121 (2004). (P. Tr. Ex. 17.) Dr. Dyken theorizes, without explanation, that while chroni c brain infec tion with the full-streng th wild measles virus cause s death, the vaccine-strain form of the virus might instead cause autism, because it is attenuate d. P. Trial Ex. 17 at 122. Howeve r, as discussed above (p. 90, fn. 108), none of the petitioners' experts have vouched for the validity of Dyken's theory , and responde nt's expert Dr. Ward persua sively explained w hy that article should not be g iven any credence . As explained above (p. 90, fn. 108), I find the Dy ken ar ticle to be of extremely dubious merit, and I do not find it to be competent evide nce f or any proposition. It is also noteworthy that while the petitioners contend that the strain of the measles virus114 contained in the MMR inoculation can cause autism, they have also never explained why that MMR- strain measles virus would be more likely to cause autism than the strains contained in the old monovalent measles vaccines (mea sles only, without rubella or mumps), which were used for many years prior to the introduction of the c ombined MMR vaccine . 93very strong genetic compone nt causa tion autism. (Ex. HH, 22; Ex. JJ, 33-34; Ex. P, p. 3; Tr. 1303A-08A, 1489A-1507, 1510.) This understanding of the strong genetic component of autism results from numerous medical studies. Family studies show that when a person has autism, members of that person' s family are much more likely to also suffe r from autism than nonrela ted persons (at least 10 times more likely ). (Ex. JJ, p. 34; Ex. P, para. 49.) Twin studies show that among fraternal twins, who share 50% of their genes, if one twin has autism, the second twin will have a chanc e of having autism about 25 times highe r than an unrela ted person; but among identical twins, who share 100% of their genes, the chanc e of the second twin having autism would be even gre ater, about 300 times the risk of an unr elated pe rson. (Ex. JJ, p. 34; Ex. Take n together, the family and twin studies indicate clearly that autism is strong ly genetic in character. In this regard, howeve r, there are two important qualifica tions. First, the evidenc e indicates that while autism is strongly genetic, it is not exclusively genetic. For example, even among identical twins, who share one hundred percent of their genes, there is a small percentag e of insta nces in which one twin experience s autism and the other does not, indicating that non-g enetic factors must play at least some role in some cases. Secondly , it must be stresse d that at this time scientists are able to identify a parti cular gene (or set of genes) , as the cause of the autism, in only a small percentag e of the cases of autism. For example, approximately three to four percent of children with autism have been identified as having a specific genetic defect known as \"Fragile X,\" while another disorder involving a specific genetic defect, known as \"tuber ous sclerosis,\" is identified in perha ps another one percent. (Tr. 1304.) While the family and twin studies descr ibed above certainly indicate that many other cases of autism must have genetic origins, a t this time it is not possible to pinpoint which other spec ific ca ses have genetic or igins. The second basic point is that some non-gene tic factors have been identified and acce pted as factors in causing autism, but those consist of exposures during the early prenatal period. (Ex. JJ, p. 33; Ex . P, para. 54; misoprostol, and rubella virus infe ction have be en found to inc rease the risk of autism. (Ex. JJ , p. 33; Ex. P, para. 54.) Importantly , the evidenc e indicates that those exposures cause interfe rence with fetal developmenta l that takes place at specific time periods early in the prena tal period. For example, it appea rs that thalidomide and valproic acid cause damag e occur ring betwee n 20 and 24 days after conce ption, while misoprostol and rubella virus infec tion affect the fetus during the first 12 wee ks of g estation. (Ex. P , para . 54; Ex . JJ, p. 33.) The thi rd basic point is that autopsy studies, comparing brains of a utisti c childre n to those of non-autist ic children, indicate that the autistic brains show particula r abnorma l features that of necessity would have occur red during specific parts of the prenatal period, as the unborn child develope d. (Ex. J J, pp. 33-34; ent The petitioners in this case do not dispute that genetics play a large role in the causa tion of autism. They argue, rathe r, that it is likely that genetics and the MMR vaccine can interact to result in autism in an indivi dual child. That is, they argue that g enetic f actor s likely make some infa nts' brains susceptible to damag e, and then the vaccine-stra in measles virus from the MMR-vacc ination become s the \"second hit\" that cause s the individual to become autistic. (P1, p. 119 fn. 117, pp. 121- 22; Tr. 1049A; scientific understan dings make petitioners' theory seem unlikely . i. General discussion The petitioners are correct that the existing evidenc e supports the idea that some cases of autism may be a result of a genetic/environmenta l interac tion. That is, the existing evidenc e indicates, as responde nt's witnesses acknow ledged, that autism is likely not 100% genetica lly deter mined. For example, even among identical twins, who share 100% of their genes, the outcomes conce rning the existence or the sever ity of autism are not alway s exactly the same. Moreove r, evidenc e also indicates, as noted above (p. 94), that certain environmenta l exposures during the early prenatal period also appe ar to play a causative role in a utism. Howeve r, the petitioners' causa tion theor y at that point take s a huge leap from the existing evidenc e, by asser ting that, since it is known that autism is not 100% genetic, and that some prenatal exposures seem to contribute to autism, we can there fore infer that the MMR vaccine is another environmenta l factor that can contribute t o the causation of autism . At that point, the petit ioners' argument goes far beyond the existing evidenc e. Moreove r, it seems to me that the three accepted points conce rning the causation of autism , set forth above, make the petitioners gene ral causation theory seem unlikely , in two ways. First, we know for certain that genetic factors and prenatal exposures can cause autism, while the evidenc e conce rning the possibili ty of causa tion by postnatal factors is weak, as will be discussed. This point, of course , certainly does not rule out the possibili ty of causa tion by a particula r postnatal factor, such as the measles virus, but it does make one cautious about attributing causa tion to any postnatal factor. Secondly , as noted above (p. 94), autopsy studies indicate that autism results from abnorma l brain development prior to birth . That finding is consistent with either genetic causa tion or causa tion by early prena tal environmenta l exposures, but it is inconsistent with causa tion by a vac cine that is re ceive d during the sec ond y ear of life. ii. Evidence conce rning possibili ty of c ausati on by postnat al factors The petitioners' briefs have pointed to a number of medical article s or other place s in the record wher e it is mentioned or specula ted that the causa tion of autism might of the article s cited by petitioners, there is mere ly a general mention of \"envir onmental factors\" as being linked or possibly linked to the causa tion of autism, without any specific ation of postnatal environmenta l factors. (See, 95e.g., the 418A-421A; Libbey 252; Trottier article , Hazlehurst Ex. G, Tab 51 (at p. 112, the article mentions \"early117 environmenta l insult,\" but a t p. 105 it is clarified that the author mea nt \"insults early in gestation \" (empha sis added) ); Vojdani article , Hazlehurst Ex. G, Att. 55, p. 189; Lainhar t article , Snyder118 119 Ex. 71, pp. 234.) Thus, t hese me ntions of \"environme ntal fac tors\" provide no support to the proposition that postnatal factors can cause autism, since, as explained above, it is well-a ccepted that certain prenatal environmenta ction--a re associated with autism. Some of petitioners' other citations to the record require a bit more comment, but again fail to offer any substantial support to the proposition that postnatal factors can cause autism. First, the petitioners point (P3, p. 7) to an article (Hertz-Picciotto article ), that mentions in its abstrac t ty that the \"early milieu\" (Ex. 61, Tab HH, p. 1119) might affect the development of autism. That article, howeve r, cites, as examples of environmenta l factors associate d with autism, only the same prenatal factors discussed above- -i.e., exposure to thalidomide, valproic acid, or rubella virus. (Id. at 1119.) They cite to (P3, p. 7) a few pages of the Dr. Corbier listed a number of differ ent \"envir onmental factors\" that he suspects might115 contribute to causing autism, but he did not specific ally say whether such factors could work only prena tally, throug h the mother, or could work postnatal ly. (Hazlehurst Tr. 417A-22A.) Even assuming that he meant that some of the factors could cause autism by affecting a child postnatally , Dr. Corbier offered absolutely no evide nce or explanation as to why he believes that such postnatal environmenta l factors might contr ibute to causing autism.

(Hazlehurst Ex. 58, pp. 17, 19, 20, 115.) Petitioners also rely (P3, pp. 7-8) on an article in which the authors suggest that unspecified environmenta l factors might be causing or affec ting autism by causing neurona l cell death \"some ti me after birth as a result of insult.\" (Kern and Jones article , Hazlehurst Ex. G, Att. 4, p. 494.) But I found that article to be122 of doubtful validity , espec ially since it found to be \"pivotal\" (id. at 490) the two studies by Holmes and B radstre et 2003 that I have f ound to be of dubious merit. (See pp. 29-30 above .) Petitioners also point (P3, p. 6) to a statement by another of responde nt's experts, Dr. Rust, indicating that autism can be ed\" by \"envir onmental influence s.\" (Hazlehurst Tr. 463A.) It is unclea r what Dr. Rus t meant by that statement. He did not say that post-natal environmental factors can contribute to causing autism. The only example that Dr. Rust provided of such \"envir onmental influence s\" was \"depr ivation, * * * wher e children don't get sensory input, sensory depriva tion.\" (Id.) It seems doubtful that he there by meant that sensory depriva tion could cause autism; from the context, it seems likely that he meant that such depriva tion could influence the course of autis m. In any event, Dr. Rust's basic point, in this part of his testimony , was that regressive autism is actua lly a result not of environmental factors but of genes , which begin to be \"expressed\" around the second year of life (\"it seems that that's a point at which additional genetic signa ls come on board that are meant to take the place of preceding signa ls\"--id. at 460A). Note that Dr. Rust stated that prenatal exposures can cause autism (id. at 464A-65A) , but a dded that he was not aware of any postnatal \"toxi c insults\" that could cause autism (id. at 465A.) Thus, this unexplained rema rk by Dr. Rust hardly constitutes signific ant evidenc e that postnatal environmenta l factors can c ontribute to causing autism. In addition, Dr. Kinsbourne himself testified that the question of whether infections can cause autism \" is being looke d at,\" a nd that there had bee n \"ra re\" cases in which \"encephalitis\" had been said to cause autism. Howeve r, he c ited no evidenc e for those statements. (Tr . 1052A-53A.) On the other hand, sever al items in the record do seem to suggest the possibility that postnatal factors might play some role in the causa tion of autism. Petitioners c ite (P3, p. 7) a case repor t of a boy who develope d autistic behavior after experiencing herpe s encephalitis at age 11.123 Petitioners cite (P3, p.6) a statement made by Dr. Andre w Zimmerman, one of responde nt's experts, who said that environmenta l factors \"may \" be involved in the causa tion of autism, in a context that Institute of Medicine, AUTISM AND THE ENVIRONMENT: CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES121 FOR RESEARCH (The N ational Aca demies Press 2008.) ( Hazlehurst Ex. 58.) Janet K. Kern & Anne M. Jones, Evidenc e of Toxicity, Oxidative Stress, and Neuronal122 Insult in Autism, 9 J. TOXICOLOGY & E NVTL. HEALTH 485 (2006). ( Hazlehurst Ex. G, Att. 4.) M. Ghaziuddin et al., Autistic Symptoms Following Herpe s Ence phalitis , 11 EUR. CHILD123 & ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY 142 (2002). ( Hazlehurst Ex. 37, Att. A.) 97implied postnatal factors. (Ex. 131, p.1.) They also rely on another article , which states that research in recent years has suggested that autism may not, as previously thought by some experts, be exclusively prena tal in origin. They point a lso to a French study which seems to sug gest that124 \"heavy metals\" mig ht possibly play in causing or influenc ing a utism.125 Petitioners also cite an article by Pardo suggesting the possibili ty of a role for postnatal126 environmenta l factors in causing autism. (Ex. 129.) At one point, that article states that \"envir onmental factors, including both materna l/ uterine and postnatal events, may well modify the underly ing genetic substrate and lead to greater abnorma lities in neurona l [brain cell] organization.\" (Id. at p. 436, emphasis added.) At another point, the article states that \"envir onmental factors\" can influence \"early postnatal brain development.\" (Id. at 435, figure 1.) (Neither reference, howeve r, indicates what type of \"e nvironmental fa ctors\" the authors had in mind, or wha t was mea nt by the \"early\" postnatal pe riod.) Finally, petitioners cite an article and Panja, which also suggests that various127 postnatal factors might contribute to the causa tion of autism. And I also note a rema rk made by one of responde nt's experts, Dr. Cook, that he was aware of a \"series of cases in Tanzania wher e it appea red tha t malaria c ontributed\" to the c ausation of a utism. (Tr. 1541A.) Thus, the article s and other cited items listed in the previous three paragraphs illust rate the important point that medical scienc e does not at this time completely understand the causa tion of autism, and is open to evidenc e of the possibili ty of postnatal factors playing a causa l role. Clearly , some scientists are currently exploring the possibili ty of a causa l role of postnatal factors, and possibly such a role may be confirme d in the future. But in scienc e, general conclusions conce rning causa tion are not usually based upon isolated repor ts of a single case or a few cases suggesting a causa l connec tion. Moreove r, it is signific ant that none of the petiti oners' experts have discussed those article s and the other cited items at all, failing to explain why such repor ts might offer any signific ant support to the proposition that postnatal environmenta l factors can contribute to the Martha R. Herbert, Autism: A Brain Disorder, or a Disorder That Affects the Brain?, 2124 CLINICAL NEUROPSYCHIATRY 354 (2005).

E, Att. 12.) 98causa tion of autism. Rather, as noted above (pp. 93-94), most of the e xisting data , accumulated128 over decades of research, supports the conclusion that autism is the result of malformation of the brain during the prenatal period, as a result of genetic factors and/or prena tal environmenta l exposures. There fore, a fe w unconf irmed items of evide nce indica ting the possibili ty of postnatal contributions to the causa tion of autism, while interesting , do not chang e the strong direc tion of the large majority of the available data. The balanc e of the existing evidence still leave s it as simply unclear whether postnatal environmenta l factors ever cause autism.129 iii. S ummary conce rning impact of ac cepte d science on petition ers' general causation t heory the existing evidenc e conce rning the causa tion of autism as a whole , I must conclude that such evidenc e tends to make the petitioners' theory advanc ed in this case seem unlikely . That is, as explained above, first we know for certain that genetic factors and prenatal exposures can cause autism, while it is as yet unclear whether postnatal factors play any causa l role. The pe titioners should not have waited until their post-hearing briefs to raise the f actua l128 contention that postnatal fa ctors in other than the MMR va ccina tion, have bee n shown to contribute to the causa tion of autism. Clearly , it would have been far better if petitioners had raised that contention in their prehe aring expert repor ts, and then had one or more experts discuss that contention during the evidentiar y hearing. It is true that specia l mast ers of this court are legally entitled to evalua te medical issues based on medical article s alone, if circumstances so necessitate. Moberly v. Secre tary of HHS, No. 98-910V, slip op. at 31 (F ed. Cl. Jan. 30, 2009). Howeve r, it is far better when specia l masters are given the opportunity to hear expert witnesses analyze such issues and article s. Thus, specia l masters should be informed of the existence of a factual contention prior to an evidentiar y hearing and should be supplied with any relevant article s prior to the hearing. The party raising the factual contention should then have an expert address those article s at the hearing. To be sure, it seems likely that the petitioners filed these particula r article s as a response to the responde nt's argum ent that only genetic factors and prena tal exposures have been reliably demonstrated to cause autism. But that argument was clearly set forth in responde nt's expert reports , filed well befor e the evidentiar y hearing in this case. The petitioners certainly could have filed t heir articles concerning various potential postnatal cause s prior to the hea ring, and then had an expert discuss and explain those article s at the hea ring. For example, responde nt's expert Dr. Eric Fombonne, an expert with extensive experience129 study ing the causa tion of autism, testified tha t, in contra st to the evidenc e with r espec t to prenatal factors, to date no postnatal environm ental factors have been reliably demonstrated to play a causa tive role in autism. (Ex. P, para. 48.) Dr. Fombonne explained that scientists have specific ally studied the question of whether infectious diseases suffe red by children postnatally , specifically including measles infection , are associate d with an incre ased risk of autism, but have found no such association. (Tr. 1305A.) Simi larly, the repor t of the Institut e of Medicine conce rning the causa tion of autism (see p. 124 below) stated that \"the c onsensus of most scientific ex perts is that autism is generally cause d by early prena tal exposures * * * or is linked to early developmenta l genes * * *. (Ex. J J, p. 33.) 99Second, the petitioners' theory is strongly contradicted by the above- discussed autopsy studies, which indicate that autism is caused by brain malfor mation occur ring prior to bir th. In this regard, howeve r, I must raise three caveats. First, as noted above, the causa tion of autism is still not well understood, and we also have the evidenc e discussed above (pp. 97-98) raising the possibili ty that postnatal factors might play a causa l role. There fore, my point se t forth in this section VII.B.4 of this decision is certainly not the strong est argument against the petitioners' theory . But this point does add at least some additional reason to be doubtful of the causa tion theory advanc ed by the petitioners in this case. Second, I want to be clear that, in includin g this point conce rning \"accepte d\" scientific understanding s, I do not mean to suggest that a petitioner's causa tion theory must automatically be rejected simply because it differ s from \"generally accepted\" medical thinking, or because it goes beyond \"generally accepted\" medical principles. To the contra ry, under the applicable case law, a petitioner certainly may advanc e a new and unproven medical theory , and may prevail on a causa tion issue via such a theory , if the petitioner can supply adequa te evidentiary support for that theory . Capizzano v. Secretary of HHS , 440 F.3d 1317, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2006). My point here, rathe r, is simply that because of the way in which the petitioners' general causa tion theory diverg es from scientifica lly accepted points, there is reason to be cautious in evaluating that theory . Third, I also wish to be clea r that I have not conclude d that Michelle Cedillo's ow n autism was caused by a genetic defec t. Respondent has not alleged that a genetic defect should be considered to be a \"factor unrela ted to the administration of the vaccine\" pursuant to \u00a7 300aa- 13(a) (1)(B), nor do I so conclude . In this case, the petitioners have failed , under part (A) of \u00a7300aa- 13(a) (1), to show that it is probable that Michelle's vaccination c ontributed to the causa tion of her autism, so that the burden never shifted to responde nt to demonstrate, under part (B) of \u00a7300aa- 13(a) (1), that some other factor cause d her autism. See, e.g., DeBazan v. Secre tary of HHS , 539 F.3d 1347, 1352 (F ed. Cir. 2008). My point in thi s part VI I.B.4 of this decision has nothing to do with the \"factor unrela ted\" analy sis in part (B) of \u00a7300aa-13(a) (1). Rather, my point simply is, once again, that the three above- descr ibed points of scientific knowledg e gument in this case unlikely . Finally , I note that it is certainly not nece ssary to resolve, in this case , the general question of whether any postnatal environmenta l factors, other than the MMR vaccine, can contribute to the causa tion of autism. That is, even if the evidenc e showed clearly that some postnatal factors can contribute to the causa tion of autism, that by itself would still do very little to advanc e the petitioners' general causa tion case here. The petitioners would still need to demonstrate that a particular postnatal factor, the MMR vacc ine, can contribute to the causa tion of autism. And that they have f ailed to do. 1005. Other problem s with Dr. Kins bourn e's theory a. Dr. Kins bourn e's testim ony concerning tim ing Dr. Kinsbourne' s testimony was vague and unpersua sive conce rning the issue of what might appropr iate time period , betwee n MMR vaccination and the onset of symptoms of autism, under his causa tion theory . Dr. Kinsbourne stated that, in Michelle's case, he believed that the vaccine-stra in measles virus enter ed Michelle's brain about seven days after her MMR vaccination (Tr. 1146), and he indicated that her autistic symptoms beg an during the period of fever about one week after the vaccination, or shortly there after. (Ex. 61, p. 3; Tr. 1041, 1175A-76, 1184A.) But Dr. Kinsbourne admitted that he really had no idea how long it would likely take, as a matter of patholog ic proce ss or physiologic process, for a measles virus enter ing the body via MMR vaccination to reach the brain. (Tr. 1146-47.) Under Althen , a petitioner must show a \" proxi mate temporal relationship betwee n vaccination and injury \"--i.e., it must be shown that the particula r vaccinee' s injury occur red within a time period after vaccination that would be medically expected for a vaccine-c aused injury of that type. 418 F.3d 1274, 1278 Cir. 2005). Howeve r, Dr. Kinsbourne, by acknow ledging that he does not know how long it would take the measles virus to reach the brain after an MMR vaccination, has, in effect, acknow ledged that he doesn't know what would be the appropr iate time period for onset of an autism condition cause d by an MMR vaccination. He acknow ledged, in effect, that he is mere ly guessing or speculating when he indicates that the alleg ed onset of Michelle's autism symptoms, which he appar ently assumes to have occur red about s even day s after her MMR vaccination or shortly there after, wa s an appr opriate time vacc ine-stra in measles virus likely reached Michelle's brain in about seven days, seems to be inconsistent with the rest of his general theory , and petitioners' general theory , of causation. Kinsbourne' s general causa tion theory , as I understand it, is that it is the persistence of the measles virus that cause s or contributes to autism. That is, according to Dr. Kinsbourne, in most infants who get the MMR vaccine, the measles virus is appro priately cleared from the body by the infant's imm une sy stem \"in a few weeks.\" (Ex. 61, p. 20.) But, according to the petitioners' theory , in some children a defect in the immune system results in a failure to clear the measles virus from the body , and the persisting measles virus then adver sely affects the br ain. ( E.g., Ex. 61, p. 11-12; Tr. 1087.) Howeve r, Dr. Kinsbourne seeme d to indicate that in Miche lle's case, her first autism symptoms occur red within about seven days of her MMR vaccination, or very shortly there after. (Ex. 61, p. 3; Tr. 1041, 1175A-76, 1184A.) That would be is prior to the period of a \"few weeks\" in which a normal immune system would clear the measles virus, according to Dr. Kinsbourne. Thus, if the vaccine-stra in measles virus was in fact already damag ing Michelle's brain within about seven days after her vaccination, the n this would not seem to be an example of damag e because of \"persistence\" of the virus, because, at seven days (or even two or three weeks) after vaccination, the period of a bnormally long \" persistenc e\" ha d not yet begun . 101There is another signific ant problem with Dr. Kinsbourne' s comments conce rning the timing of symptoms. Dr. Kinsbourne emphasized his view that Michelle was a normally developing child who experience d the onset of autism symptoms very soon after her MMR vaccination (e.g., Ex. 61, p. 3; Tr. 1040-42 , 1175A-76, 1184A). He seemed to imply that this appar ent ons et soon after the vaccination supported his theory that the vaccination caused the autism. For example, Dr. Kinsbourne asser ted that this appar ent timing of onset indicated that Michelle's autism was more likely the result of a \"disea se\" proce ss, \"rather than the aftermath of cong enital maldevelopment.\" (Ex. 61, p. 18.) He made simil ar comments during the Snyder hearing, stating that in regressive autism, \"something must have most likely happene d to chang e the trajec tory of development in such a radical wa y.\" (Snyder Tr. 479A- 80A.) The testimony of responde nt's experts, howeve r, refuted this aspec t of Dr. Kinsbourne' s reasoning. First, they demonstrated, as will be discussed below (pp. 127-30), that in Michel le's particular case, her f irst signs of a utism cination. Moreove r, responde nt's experts testified that even when signs of autism are first recognized during a child's second year of life, that does not provide signific ant evidenc e that some environmenta l factor played any type of causa l role in the autism. In this regard, those experts noted that, as explained above (pp. 93-94), there is a strong genetic component to autism, and that a number of disorders that are undisputedly genetic in origin, such as Huntington' s disease and Rett's syndrome, do not manifest themselves until long after birth. (E.g., Tr. 1495-1500; Ex. FF, pp. 3-4; Ex. P, paras. 38-39.) As the experts explained, some genes are innately \"prog rammed\" so that they will automatically be \"expressed\" or \"turne d on\" at a certain age, sometimes many months or even decades (e.g., Huntington' s disease) after birth, independent of any environmenta l factors. Respondent's experts, there fore, refuted Dr. Kinsbourne' s suggestion that the appea rance of autistic symptoms during the second year of life, in an individual with \"regressive autism\" or any other type of autism, would indicate that the individual's autism must have resulted at least in part from an environmenta l cause. This appar ent reasoning of Dr. Kinsbourne is simply contra ry to what is known of many genetic disorde rs. b. Dr. Kins bourn e's re liance on Dr. Wakefield's theory It is also noteworthy that when Dr. Kinsbourne, in his expert repor t, descr ibed his view that the measles vaccine can cause both autism and chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction, he began his discussion by citing the above- mentioned 1998 article by Dr. Andre w Wakefield and colleag ues, the article that initiated the controve rsy over w hether the MMR vacc ine ca n cause autism. (Ex . 61, p. 12.) In his very next sentenc e, Dr. Kinsbourne relied upon a follow-up article published by Wakefield and colleag ues in 2000. (Id.) These references indicate that Dr. Kinsbourne' s causa tion theory was influence d by Dr. Wakefield's causa tion theory . To be sure, Dr. Kinsbourne's theory conce rning the exact mechanism by which the persisting measles theor y harms the brain, there by causing the autism, differ s somewhat from Dr. Wakefield's original hypothesis. But Dr. Kinsbourne' s refer ences to Dr. Wakefield's original article do indicate that Dr. Kinsbourne' s 102theory was influenced by Wakefield's theory , and that Dr. Kinsbourne seems to rely on Wakefield's published articles a s corroboration for his theory . According ly, it is relevant to note that Dr. Wakefield's causa tion theor y has not only failed to gain acceptanc e in the medical community , but instead has been strongly criticized . I will discuss those criticisms below, in my discussion of the petitioners' gastrointestinal claims, since petitioners' gastrointestinal expert, Dr. Krigsman seeme d even more strongly influence d by Dr. Wakefield's theory . (See pp. 143- 44 below.) To be sure, this is a minor point, since Dr. Kinsbourne' s causa tion theory does differ , in the proposed mecha nism, from Dr. Wakefield's original theory . I have evalua ted Dr. Kinsbourne' s theory on its own merits , and simply found that t heory to be unpersuasive. Howeve r, the fact that Dr. Kinsbourne 's theory was influenc ed by Dr. Wakef ield's theory is at least worthy of note. c. Dr. Kinsbou rne's table of potential causes Another argument raised by nt conce rning Dr. Kinsbourne' s of \"Medic al Concomitants of Autism,\" provided in his expert repor t, which lists \"mea sles\" among the vi ral causes of autism. (Ex. 61, pp. 7-8.) Responde nt has pointed out that this table is very simil ar to the table provided by Dr. Kinsbourne in Chapter 18 of the 2006 edition of the medical textbook, Child Neurology , with the conspicuous exception that the table in the textbook did not include measles as a cause of autism. (Ex. 61, Tab PP, p. 1117.) Based upon this discrepa ncy, responde nt has argued that when writing for the general scientific community , Dr. Kinsbourne does not state the conclusion that the measles virus can cause autism, yet when testify ing in litigation in support of an MMR-autism link, he now conclude s that the measles virus can cause autism. (R1 at 52-53.) In raising this point, responde nt obviously is suggesting a lack of sincerity in Dr. Kinsbourne' s opinion offered in this case. Howeve r, I find it unnece ssary to deter mine whether such a harsh inference is warrante d. That is, even assuming the sincerity of Dr. Kinsbourne' s opinion, I have simply found his theory to be very unpersuasive , for all the reasons set forth in this Section VI I of this Decision.130 Respondent also criticizes Dr. Kinsbourne because his theory of causa tion in this case130 relies exclusively on the theory that the vaccine-strain measles virus cause d Michelle's autism , without prese own opi nion as to whether thimerosal-containing vacc ines played a r ole in weakening Michelle's immune system . (R1 at 48-49.) This particula r criticism is without merit. I do not see Dr. Kinsbourne' s opinion as in any way \"incompatible,\" as responde nt asser ts (R1 at 49), with the testimony of petitioners' other experts. As I have noted above, if Dr. Kinsbourne were able to persua de me that it is \"more probable than not\" that a persisting vaccine-stra in measles virus was a subst antial factor in causing Michelle's autism, then I would compensa te her for that condition, regardle ss of why that virus was able to persist. Dr. Kinsbourne simply chooses, reasonably enoug h, to leave to other experts the issue of why the virus was a llegedly able to per sist. (continued...) 1036. Opinion s of Dr. Corbier, Dr. Hepner, and Dr. Kennedy a. Dr. Corbier The Cedillos have stated in their briefs that, conce rning this MMR/autism general causa tion issue, they also rely upon the testimony of an expert offered by the petitioners in the Hazlehurs neurolog ist, does have considera ble experience in treating autistic children. (Hazlehurst Tr. 328A.) And Dr. Corbier's testimony does indicate his view that the MMR vaccine can play a role in causing autism, either by itself or in conjunction with thimerosal-c ontaining va ccine s, in persons 265A- 440A.) I was prese nt for the oral testimony of Dr. Corbier, and have carefully studied both his expert repor t and his oral testimony . I conclude that his testimony does not provide any substantial support (...continued)130 Simi larly, some of responde nt's other criticisms of Dr. Kinsbourne, for failing to be able to answe r certain questions in the area of virolog y, also seems to be misplaced. (See R1 at 49-50, fn. 34.) I do not find it unrea sonable for Dr. Kinsbourne to defer to other experts on certain specific questions outside the are as of his spec ial expertise. Howeve r, I do find that Dr. Kinsbourne' s prese ntation was very unpersuasive in many other very important respe cts, which I have de tailed above . Although his testimony was quite vague, Dr . Corbier see med to take a n approa ch to this131 \"general causa tion\" issue that is as least slightly differ ent from the theory offered by the petitioners and Dr. Kinsbourne in this Cedillo case. That is, in this case Dr. Kinsbourne contends that the role of the thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines is to weake n the child's immune system , there by allowing the vaccine-stra in measles virus to persist in the child's system, and that it is the persisting measles virus that affects the child's brain, causing the autism. Dr. Corbier, on the other hand, seeme d to suggest that the thimerosal in the thimerosal-c ontaining va ccine s might also, in some cases, directly affect the child's bra in, along with the measles virus. ( Hazlehurst Tr. 284A, 370A- 73A.) Although the petitioners in this case purport to rely upon Dr. Corbier's testimony in general , they do not seem to adopt this \"dire ct effect\" aspec t of Dr. Corbier's theory , so there is no need for me to discuss that theory here. (I note that this \"dire ct effect\" theory is the theory relied upon by the Petitioners' Steering Commi ttee under the PSC's second theory of general causa tion. Three test cases involving that second theory were tried in Ma y and July of 2008, and are currently in a post- hearing briefing proce ss.) But even if the petitioners in this case were to rely on this \"dire ct effect\" approa ch, I would respond that I found Dr. Corbier's testimony in this regard to be unper suasive. Dr. Corbier failed to offer a coher ent explanation of why he thinks that the thimerosal in thimerosal- containing vaccines can affect infant brains by causing autism. To the extent that he did suggest some reasons for his views concerning thimerosal, he seeme d to adopt faulty reasoning sim ilar to that of Dr. Aposhian discussed above, relying on the same flawe d Bradstree t and Holmes studies that I have also discussed above. (See, e.g., Hazlehur st Tr. at 373A-414A.) I found Dr. Corbier's testimony in this reg ard to be quite unpersua sive. 104for the theory that the MMR vaccine can play a role in causing autism. I conclude that Dr. Corbier has provided no persua sive explanation as to why he believes that the MMR vaccine can play a role in causing autism. Dr. Corbier, like Dr. Kinsbourne and many of the responde nt's witnesses, did explain that the measles virus can in some instances cause injury or death in humans, in the form of disorders such as measles encephalitis, SSPE, etc. (Hazlehurst Tr. 274A-77A.) He seeme d to then jump from that evidenc e to the conc lusion that the MMR vac cine- strain form of the mea sles virus is capable of causing autism in a person with genetic susceptibility . But Dr. Corbier never persua sively explained how he can reasonably make that startling jump, in light of the fact that autism is a disorder quite differ ent from measles encephalitis, SSPE, and the other disorders that are known to be ca used by the measle s virus. Dr. Corbier indicated that his vie ws in this reg ard a re he avily influence d by the fa ct that in Yates Hazlehurst and many children who are diagnosed with regressive autism, the symptoms of the autism were first recognized relatively soon after an MMR vaccination. (Hazlehurst Ex. 26, p. 16; Hazlehurst Tr. 303-07.) But this reasoning ignore s the fact that in the Unit ed States the fir st dose of MMR is usually administered between 12 and 18 months of age (Ex. P, Tab 38, p. 264; Ex. P , para. 35), whil e the first symptoms of regressive autism typically are observe d during the second year of life. (Tr.1055, 1288A; Ex. 61, Tab YYY, pp. 937, 946.) Thus, the time when the first symptoms of regressive autism are typically recognized simply happens to coincide with the period of time when most children receive the MMR vaccination. There fore, Dr. Corbier's infere nce of a causa l relationship, whene ver the initial symptoms of autism are observe d within eight or nine months after a n MMR inoculation ( Hazlehurst Tr. 306), is not per suasive. Dr. Corbier also stated that he has develope d a \"prof ile\" of children, and he seeme d to indicate that if a child fits within that profile, it is reasonable to conclude that an MMR vaccination contributed to that child's a utism. (Hazlehurst Ex. 26, p.16; Hazlehurst Tr. at 313A- 14A.) To f it the profile, a child must (1) ex perie nce normal deve lopment prior to receiving the M MR vaccine, (2) have signific ant chronic gastrointestinal (GI) problems, (3) have \"immunologica l disturbance s,\" and (4) experience the re gressive pha se of a utism wit hin nine m onths after an MMR vacc But Dr. Corbier never explained persua sively why he believes that, simply because a child falls within his \"prof ile,\" it can be reasonably inferr ed that the MMR vaccination contributed to the autism. Dr. Corbier seems to have been strong ly influence d by the fact that Dr. Wakefield and colleag ues hypothesized in their 1998 article that in children with both regressive autism and chronic gastroint estinal symptoms, a persisting vaccine-stra in measles virus acquir ed from MMR vaccination might be the cause of both. (Hazlehurst Ex. 26, p. 13; Hazlehurst Tr. 314A.) But Dr. Corbier failed to point to any evidence indicating that the Wakefie ld hy pothesis has any validity . (As I will set forth below (pp. 143-44), the Wakefield hypothesis has been strong ly criticized, and has been abandone d even by most of the very authors of tha t 1998 article. )132 S.H. Murch et al., Retraction of an Interpretation , (Letter) 363 LANCET 750 (2004). (Ex.132 T, Att. 25.) 105I also note that af ter attending Dr. C orbier' s hearing testimony , and care fully study ing his opinion, I simply found no reason to conclude that he is a reliable expert. He failed to put forwa rd a logic al explanation as to why he holds his views conce rning the causa tion of autism. His reasoning often seeme d jumbled a t best. He seeme d to be unfamiliar with the medical litera ture upon whic h he purported to rely. Dr. Corbier has not published, in any peer-reviewed journal, any article s relevant t o autism or to the causation issues conce rning which he opine d. (Hazlehurst Tr. 435A- 36A.) Dr. Corbier seems willing to give opinions conce rning causa tion, purportedly to the level of \"more probable than not,\" based on very scant evidenc e. He is willing to opine, for example, that a large number of differ ent factors can contribute to the causa tion of autism. (Id. at 418A-21A.) Whil e I do not doubt that Dr. Corbier was sincere in his beliefs conce rning the causa tion of autism, I simply did not find him t o be a reliable expert. In response to Dr. Corbier's expert repor t and oral testimony , responde nt offered the expert repor t and oral testimony of Dr. Robert Rust, a pediatric neurolog ist with much more extensive experience than Dr. Corbier. (Hazlehurst Ex. E; Hazlehurst Tr. 442-552A.) The testimony of Dr. Rust was simil ar to the testimony of responde nt's experts prese this general causa tion issue, as discussed above. I found Dr. Rust's testimony to be far more log ical and pe rsuasive tha n the testimony of Dr. Corbie r. I conclude , there fore, that Dr. Corbier's testimony , conce rning this general causa tion issue, again gives me no reason to conclude that the MMR vaccine can contri bute to the causa tion of autism.133 b. Opinion s of Dr. Hepner and Dr. Kennedy As noted above, in discussing this MMR/causation issue in their briefs, the petitioners have relied pr imarily on Dr. Kinsbourne , and also sec ondarily on Dr. Corbier . They have not indica ted relianc e, conce rning this issue, on any of their other experts. However, I note that two of the petitioners' other experts, Drs. Hepne r and K ennedy , offe red comments that might appea r to offe r at least some support to the petitioners' MMR/autism causa tion theory . There fore, I will discuss those comments her e. i. Dr. Hepner Petitioners' expert Dr. Hepne r, as noted above, is a Ph.D. molecular biologist. She testified chief ly conce rning the issue of the validity of Unig enetics testing. Dr. Hepne r did note briefly , howeve r, that she found the petitioners' general causa tion theory , that the MMR vaccine can The petitioners in their briefs in this case did not indicate any relianc e upon the testimony133 of a medical doctor prese nted as a witness by the petitioners in the Snyder case, Dr. J.J. Bradstree t. In any event, I have studied the testimony of Dr. Bradstree t, and I find that it does not provide a ny persua sive support to the proposition that the MMR vaccine can contribute to the causa tion of autism. 106contribute to the causa tion of autism, to be \"plausible\" \"logical.\" (Ex. 63, pp. 1, 6; Tr. 638-39.) Howeve r, other than testify ing conce rning the issue of the U nigenetics testing , Dr. He pner did not explain why she finds that general causa tion theory to be \"plausible.\" Moreove r, Dr. Hepner, on cross-e xamination, was asked specifically whether she could opine that such theory has been proven to the level of \"more likely than not.\" (Tr . 638.) She did not answe r in the af firmative, preferring to stick to her wording that the theory is \"plausible.\" ( Tr. 638-39.) According ly, since Dr. Hepne r did not offer an opinion conce rning the petitioners' MMR/causation issue to the level of \"more probable than not,\" and offered no explanation of why she believe s that the petitioners' theory is \"plausible,\" I conclude that Dr. He pner' s opinion offers no support to this causation theory of the pe titioners. ii. Dr. Kenn edy Another of petitioners' ex perts i n this Cedillo case, Dr. Ronald Kenne dy, at certain poi nts in his testimony seeme d to opine that the MMR vaccine can cause autism. As previously noted, Dr. Kenne dy is a Ph.D. microbiolog ist with experience in study ing viruses and developing vaccines. In his written repor t, Dr. Kenned y indicated the general opinion that if an infant is in a state of immune dysregulation, receives an MMR vaccination, and ex perie nces the onset of a \"neur ologic event\" soon after, and there is evidenc e that the vaccine-stra in measles virus persists in that child's system, then it is probable that the vaccine cause d the neurolog ic event. (Ex. 110, p. 7.) Later, during cross-e xamination at trial, he seeme d to indicate that if ther e existed evidence of per sistent measles vaccine-stra in virus in an autistic child's gut (intestines), then he could opine that the child's autism was \"more likely than not\" vac cine- cause d. (Tr. 761, 788- 89.) The first major problem with Dr. Kenne dy's opinion on this point, conce rning whether the MMR vaccine can be said to cause autism, is that it clearly depends on the assumption that there is a reliable labora tory result in an individual, demonstrating that the vaccine-strain measles virus persisted in that person' s body . (Tr. 784, 794-95.) But I have conclude d above (pp. 41-78) that the Unig enetics labora evidenc pe rsisting mea sles virus in Mic helle and others, have not been shown to be accurate or reliable . Thus, Dr. Kenne dy's opinion on this point, ba sed on an assumption that has been shown to be incorre ct, simply offers no support to the petitioners' c ase. Further, another problem with Dr. Kenne dy's appar ent opinion on this point is that he seeme d to wave r on this issue. It is signific ant that in neither his expe rt report, nor his oral testimony on direct examination in this case, did Dr. Kenne dy ever state that the persisting vaccine-stra in measles virus could cause autism in ge neral , or that it did cause Michelle Cedillo's a utism. The closest he came was in his written repor t, when he stated that a persisting measles virus could cause a \"neur ologic event.\" (Ex. 110, p. 7.) Only when asked by responde nt's counsel as to why he believed that the MMR vaccine could cause autism, did Dr. Kenne dy offer the testimony which seeme d at times to indicate that a persistent vaccine-stra in measles virus can cause autism . (Tr. 761, 788-89.) 107Moreover, Dr. Kenne dy seeme d to go back and forth on the issue of whether the MMR vaccine can cause autism. For example, at one point he said that it is \"plausible\" that MMR vaccine \"is causing autism\" generally, but he cannot say so \"absolutely .\" (Tr. 799, lines 19-24.) Then, asked whether it is \"more likely than not\" that the MMR vaccine cause s autism, he did not answer \"yes\" or \"no,\" but instead replied that the question \"would have to be examined on an individual-to- individual basis.\" (Tr. 799, line 25 to Tr. 800, line 3.) Dr . Kenne dy stated that the MMR vacc ine \"mig can\" cause autism, the appropr iate conditions\" (Tr. 800, lines 5-6), and that the MMR vaccine \"more likely than not\" is causing autism \"in an individual-to-individual situation\" (Tr. 800, lines 12-15). But he immediately added, confusing ly, \"Do I say that MMR cause s autism? Absolutely not. Can it, in an individual * * *? Yes, it could.\" (Tr. 800, lines 15-18.) Later, again in appar ent contra diction to other portions of his testimony , Dr. Kenne dy stated that he \"absolutely \" agreed with his own s tatement in a 2004 document that \"investig ators have failed to demonstrate causa lity 4-9.) Simi larly, he stated that he agreed with the conclusion of a medical committee (to be discussed below) that the evidenc e favor s rejec tion of a c betwe vac cine a nd autism. (Tr. 833-34.) In addition, in his testimony in the Snyder case, Dr. Kenne dy acknow ledged that he does not know the mechanism by which the measles virus supposedly could cause autism. (Snyder Tr. 432A.)134 According ly, after reviewing all of Dr. Kenne dy's testimony , I conclude that Dr. Kennedy likely does believe that it is probable than the vaccine-stra in measles virus can persist in the system of an infant with immune dysregulation, and there by cause autism in some individuals. But Dr. Kenne dy's hesitation, wave ring, and appar ent self-c ontradiction on this point cause s me to give his opinion little weig ht conce rning this issue. Further, Dr. Kennedy offered little explanation conce rning why he holds this opinion. And while Dr. Kenne dy, as a Ph.D. in microbiolog y and immunology , is well-qua lified to opine concerning some points of this case , the fact that he is not a medical doctor means that his te stimony conce rning this medical causation issue is substantially outweig hed by the testimony to the contr ary of the medical doctors who testified for responde nt conce rning this iss ue. There fore, I conclude that Dr. Kenne dy's testimony gives me no reason to conclude that the MMR vaccine can substantially contribute to the c ausation of a utism. 7. Experience of the experts Another point conce rns the experience and credentials of the experts upon whom the parties rely, conce rning this iss ue of the alleg ed ca usation of autism by the vaccine-stra in measles virus. Respondent's expert Dr. Griff in has studied the measles virus intensively for more than 30 years (Tr. I also note that, as far as I can find in the record, Dr. Kennedy was never asked to134 specific ally opine, nor did he opine, conce rning whether it is probable that Miche lle Cedillo's own condition of autism was vac cine- cause d. 1082443A), and has extraordinary credentials as an expert concern ing the measles virus (Tr. 2743A- 48A), as even petitioners' own ist, dy, acknow ledged (Tr. 851A). Dr. iffin She is the chair of the Depa rtment of Molecular Microbiolog y and Immunology at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. (Tr. 2740-41.) She has been an editor or editorial board member on a number of scientific journals relating to virolog y. (Tr. 2742A-43A; Ex. F, p. 5.) She has published more than 240 research article s in scientific journals, about 100 of which relate specific ally to the measles virus, the measles vaccine, or the MMR va ccine . (Ex. F, pp. 18-37; Tr. 2746.) She has written many book chapte rs and edited sever al textbooks conce rning virolog y. (Tr. Ex. F, pp. 948, 37.) One of the textbooks that she has edited, and for which she also wrote the specific chapte r on the measle s virus, is Field's Virology , considere d the \"bible\" of virolog y. (Tr. 2746-47.) Respondent's expert Dr. Ward, as previously noted, also has outstanding academic and publication credentials, in a medical career since 1981. (See p. 75 above.) His testimony in this case and his publication list indicate that he, too, has extensively studied the measles virus. (Ex. CC; Tr. 1796A-98A, 1839; Snyder Tr. 940.) Two other experts of responde nt, Drs. Wiznitzer and Rust, are, like Dr. Kinsbourne, pediatric neurolog ists of impressive credentials, but Drs. Wiznitzer and Rust also have very extensive experience in treating autisti c children in recent years, far more than does Dr. Kinsbourne. (Tr. 1565-1580, 1163A; Hazlehurst Tr. 452A-53A.) And another of responde nt's experts, Dr. Eric Fombonne, also filed a lengthy expert repor t (Ex. P) and testified at length, opining that it is not reasonable to conclude that the MMR va ccine can cause or contribute to autism. Dr. Fombonne is a medical doctor who has a very extensive and impressive backg round in study ing autism, publishing many medical articles concer ning the disorder, and has treated autis tic children on a regular basis for many years. (Tr. 1239- 1262A.)135 Concerning this general causa tion issue, the petitioners rely, in contra st, on only two medical doctors, Drs. Kinsbourne and Corbier, who have expressed the opinion that the MMR vaccine can cause autism. Dr. Kinsbourne does have impressive credentials in the field of pediatric neurolog y, and Dr. Corbier also is a qualified pediatric neurolog ist. However, Drs. Kinsbourne and Corbier clearly have far less expertise conce rning the measles virus than Drs. Griff in or Ward. And, while Dr. Kinsbourne has authore d a medical textbook chapte r on autism (Tr. 1168A-69), he also clearly has far less experience in treating autisti c patients, espec ially in recent years, than either Dr. Wiznitzer, Dr. Rust, or Dr. Fombonne. (Compare Tr. 1163A with Tr. 1253A-54A, 1576A-77A, Anot her pediatric neurolog ist with extensive experience with autism, Dr. Andre w135 Zimmerman, also filed an expert repor t for responde nt. (Ex. FF.) Dr. Zimmerman stated the opinion that the evidenc e does not support the proposition that the MMR vaccine can cause autism. (Ex. FF, p. 4.) Thus, Dr. Zimmerman's repor t certainly supports the result that I have reached in this case. Howeve r, because he did not testify at the evidentiar y hearing, his opinion has been far less important than that of the r espondent's e xperts who did testify , in leading to my conclusion. 109and Hazlehurst Tr. 452A-53A.) Indeed, Dr. Kinsbourne acknow ledged that he has not had an active clinical pediatric practice, treating autistic children or any other children, for the past 17 years. (Tr. 1163A.) On the other hand, Dr. Corbier has certainly treated many autistic children, but his length of experience in tha t regard, and his academ ic and researc h credentials with r espec t to autism, a re far less impressive than those of Drs. Rust, Wiznitzer, and Fombonne. (Com pare Hazlehurst experience relevant to this MMR/autism causa tion issue, betwee n the petitioners' two expert medical doctors conce rning this issue and the respondent's primary experts, adds y et another reason for me to conclude that the petitioners's causa tion theory must be rejec ted. 8. Epidem iology Numerous medical researchers have studied the issue of whether the MMR va ccine cause s autism. The results of those epidemiolog ic studies, taken as a whole, add another signific ant reason to rejec t the petitioners' c ausation theory in this case. a. All com petent epidemiol ogic studies have found n o association between MMR vacc ine and au tism. Epidemiology is \"the study of the distribution of disease in human populations and the study of factors which influence that distribution.\" (Tr. 2501.) After the above- descr ibed article by Wakefield in 1998 ra ised the issue of whether the MMR va ccine might ca use autism, a number of research groups in sever al countrie s conducte d epidemiolog ic studies c oncer ning that issue. With the exception of two studie s done by one suspect research pair (to be discussed below), all of the studies found no evidenc e of any association betwee n exposure to MMR vaccine a nd autism.136 i. Con trolled observational st udies Some of the studies fall within the category of \"contr olled observa tional studies,\" or \"case-control studies.\" (Ex. JJ, p. 84.) Severa l studies of this type have looked at the issue of whether the MMR vaccine is \"assoc iated\" with autism-- i.e., whether children who received MMR vaccination are more likely to be autistic than those children who didn't receive MMR vaccination, or whether the likelihood of experiencing autism varie s with the age at Technically , epidemiolog ic studies do not addre ss the question of whether Factor A136 \"causes\" Conditi on B, but instead whether the two are \"assoc iated.\" Two factors are said to be \"assoc iated\" if they occur together more often than would be expected by chanc e. (Tr. 1058-59A; Dorland's at 167.) If an \"assoc iation\" is found, then medical experts will evalua te other factors to deter mine if that associa tion is \"causal.\" (Ex. P , Att. 176, p. 156.) But if no association is found, then t hat result casts doubt on (thoug h does not entirely disprove) the proposition that Factor A is a significant c ause of Conditi on B. 110receipt of MMR vaccination. All of those studies have failed to find any association. (Ex. JJ, pp. 84- 85, 110-118; Ex. P , pp. 38-39; Tr. 2532-48.) For example, the first major study of this type was conducte d by Taylor and colleag ues,137 who survey ed records of British children and published their results in 1999. (Ex. P, Att. 145; Ex. P, para. 80; Ex. J J, pp. 88-89, Tr. 2533- 37A.) Tha t study took a dvantag e of the fact that the MMR va ccine was first introduced in Britain in 1988, so that one could compar e children born in earlier years who did not receive MMR vaccine with later-born children who did receive that vaccine. The study found that while there was a steady incre ase in autistic diagnoses throug hout the studied period, which was consis tent with the world-wide pattern, the introduction of the MMR vaccine did not result in any signific ant \"step- up\" in that steady trend; one would have e xpecte d a clear \"step-up\" if the MMR vaccine were in fact contributing to autism in any signific ant way. (Tr. 2533-35.) A number of other contro lled observa tional studies were done by researchers in sever al differ ent countries, utiliz ing a varie ty of study desig ns, all desig ned to deter mine whether autism was associate d with rec eipt of MMR vaccination, or whether autism was a ssociated with the timing of MMR vaccination. Those studies included a study by DeStefa no and colleag ues published in138 2004, a case-control study involving Americ an children (Ex. P, Att. 38; Ex. JJ, pp. 84-87, 110; Ex. P, pp. 2537A-39A) ; a study by Smeeth and colleag ues published in 2004, involving British139 children (Ex. P, Att. 137; Ex. P, p. 38; Tr. 2541A-45A) ; a second study by Taylor and colleag ues,140 published in 2002, which included additional data conce rning British children (Ex. P, Att. 146; Ex. JJ, pp. 92-93, 112-13; Ex. P, para. 109); a study by Farring ton and colleagues published in141 2001, which applied a differ ent form of analy sis to the British data previously revie wed by Taylor in 1999 (Ex. P, Att. 43; Ex.

And all of thos e studies failed to find such an association.146 E. Fombonne, & S.

One additional study of this type was the Madsen study published in 2002, a very large146 retrospe ctive cohort study involving Danish children born betwee n 1991 and 1998. See Kreesten Madsen, et al., Population-Based Study Rubella Vacc ination and Autism , 347 NEW ENG. J. MED.1477 (2002). (Ex. P, Tab 105; E x. JJ, pp. 98-99, 115-117; Ex. P, p. 39; T r. 2539A-41A.) The study compar ed children who had received MMR vaccines to children who hadn't, and found no association betwee n vaccine status and the development of autism. (Tr. 2541A.) This study seems, there fore, to offer additional support to the conclusion of the nine other controlled observational st udies discussed above . Howeve r, I have listed thi s 2002 Madsen study only in this footnote, for the following reason. I note that another study by Madsen, though with a largely diffe rent group of colleag ues, was published in 2003; that study considere d the pos sibili ty of a causa l relationship betwee n thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. See Kreesten Madsen et al., Thimerosal and the Occurrence of Autism: Negative Ecological Evidenc e From Danish Population-Based Data , 112 PEDIATRICS 604 (2003). (Ex. P, Tab 106.) Both studies obtained information conc erning the childre n's autism status from the Danish Psychiatric Central Resea rch Register. (Ex.P , Tab 105, p.1478; Ex. P, Tab 106, p. 605.) In the article descr ibing the 2003 study , the authors noted t hat a chang e in data recor ding in 1995, when outpatient autism diagnoses were first added to that Danish Register, m ay have exagg erated the rate of autism incidence in the y ear 1995 and there after. (Ex. P, Tab 106, p. 605.) A committee of the Institut e of Medicine (IOM), in revie wing that 2003 study , noted that such problem \"limits the study 's contribution\" to the causa lity analy sis. (Ex. JJ, p. 53.) When discussing the separ ate 2002 MMR-relate d study by Madsen and the differ ent group of colleagues, the IOM committee did not rema rk upon any simil ar analy tical problem that mig ht have be en cr eated by the 1995 chang e in the Danish data recor ding. Study ing the two articles myself, I find it to be unclear whether there is any simil ar problem. But, because (continued...) 112ii. Ecological stu dies Other epidemiolog ic studies fall within the category of \"ecologic al\" studies. Those studies, unlike the controlled observa tional studies discussed above, do not involve study ing the records of individual children. Instead, they look at rates of autism in a particula r population over time, in order to deter mine whether chang es in immuniz ation policy , such as the introduction or discontinuance of the MMR vaccination, ha d any effect on the rate of diagnosis of autism in that population. (Tr. 2532.) Severa l such ecolog ical studies have been done, and, with one exception to be discussed below, those studies failed to find any association betwe en MMR vacc ination and autism. For example, in 2004 Chen and colleag ues published a study of the British population147 cover ing the y ears 1959 throug h 1993. (Ex. P, Tab 28; E x. P, pa ra. 80; T r. 2548-51A.) The study noted that when the monovalent measles vaccine (the measles vaccine given separ combined with mumps and rubella va ccine s) was first introduced in Britain in 1968, there was no signific ant chang e in the incidence of autism. (Tr. 2550A.) Simi larly, when the MMR vaccine was introduced in Britain in 1988, repla cing the monovalent measles vaccine, again no signific (Tr . 2550A.) ecolog ical study was published by 2005, analy zing data148 conce rning P, para. 82; Tr. 2557A-58A.) The MMR vaccine was introduced in Japan in the late 1980s, but, due to a tainted strain of vaccine, there was a decline in usa ge over the next four y ears, followed by a total disc ontinuance of the vaccine. Yet the study data showed that those chang es in the MMR vaccine cover age of the population had no effect on the rate of diag nosis of autism during tha t period. (Tr . 2557A-58A.) (...continued)146 of the possib ility of a simil ar problem, in an abundanc e of caution, I have not included the 2002 Madsen study in my discussion above of \" controlled obser vational studies.\" My approa ch on this issue may or may not be overly cautious, but ultimately , it makes no differ ence to my overa ll analy sis of the epidemiolog ic data. Even excluding the Madsen 2002 study from considera tion, there are still nine other \"contr olled observa tional studies,\" from many differ ent countries, enoug h to support the overa ll conclusion. And if, instead, there is no good reason to exclude the Madsen 2002 study from considera tion, then there simply would be one more large study to support my general conc lusion. W.

P, Att. 83; Ex. JJ, pp. 104-05, 121-22; Ex. P, p. 32); and another study of150 Swedish children published by Steffenbur g and colleag ues in 2003 (Ex. P, Att. 140; Ex. P, p. 32).151 iii. S ummary conce rning studi es listed above In sum, following the Wakefield article in 1998, which raised the issue of whether the MMR vaccination might be a contributing factor in causing autism, a number of research groups in sever al countries have devised sever al differ ent types of studies to test the Wakefield hypothesis. Each of Dr. Fombonne also pointed to three other studies as providing evidenc e against an149 association betwee n MMR and autism: British et Mumps, Measles, and Rubella Vacc ine and the Incide nce of Autism Recorded by Gene ral Practitio ners: A Time Trend Analysis , 322 BRITISH MED. J. 460 (2001). (Ex. P, Att. 95; Ex. JJ, pp. 104-05, 120-21); a study of Canadian children, E. Fombonne et al., Pervasiv e Developmental Disorders in Montreal, Quebe c, Canada: Prevale nce and Links with Immunizations . 118 P EDIATRICS 139 (2006). ( Ex. P, Att. 74; Ex. P, p. 33; Tr. 2552-56); and a study involving C alifornia children, L . Dales et al., Time Trends in Autism and in MMR Immunization Coverage in Calif ornia , 285 JAMA . r, I see a problem with this a rgument of Dr. F ombonne. (This point was neve r raised in the petitioners' br iefs, but one of the petitioners' counsel seeme d to raise it in questioning Dr. Fombonne (Tr. 2704-05), so I will discuss it here.) Those three studies, to summarize, each found that while MMR use was fairly steady during the studied time pe riod (in Britain, Q uebec , and California, respe ctively ), the rate of autism diagnosis went up extremely rapidly at the same time. Dr. Fombonne pointed to those results as refuting the claim that MMR was associate d with autism. Howeve r, Dr. Fombonne believes that the incre ase in autism diagnosis during those time periods in question was largely, if not completely , due to a broade ning of the definition of autism, better awareness and case ascertainment, and other factors, rathe r than due to a true increase in the actua l incidence of autism. But if Dr. Fombonne is correct in that regard, then those three studies would not offer evidence against the M MR/autism causa tion theory , since it would simply mean that while MMR coverage was steady , the actual incidence rate of autism (as opposed to the rate of diagnosis ) also rema ined fairly steady . Of course , that woul d not mean that those studies could t hen be viewed as positively showing an associat ion betwee n MMR and autism , but the studies would then s eem to be neutral conce rning the issue of such an a ssociation, rathe r than c onstitut ing e vidence against such an a ssociation. According ly, in my analy sis I have not viewed those three studies as among those constituting evidenc e against the petitioners' c ausation theory . & Autism , 2 A UTISM 423 (1998). ( Ex. P, Att. 83.)150 S. Steffenbur g et al., Autism Spectrum Disorders in Children with Active Epilepsy and151 Learning Disabilit y: Comorbidity, Pre- and Perinatal Back ground, and Seizure Characteristic, 45 DEVELOPMENTAL MED. & CHILD NEUROLOGY 724 (2003). ( Ex. P, Att. 140.) 114the studies discussed and enumer ated above, howeve r, found no evidenc e that the MMR152 vaccination is associate d with autism. To be sure, none of those studies is definitive by itself. Whil e each of the study approa ches has its streng ths, each also has acknow ledged limit ations and weaknesses. Howeve r, when all of the studies are considere d together , the study results are highly153 signific ant. (E.g., Ex. P, Att. 76, p. 156.) First of all, the studies show that medical researchers have looked extensively for any affirmative evidenc e that the MMR vaccine contributes to the causa tion of autism, but have failed to find any such evidence. There fore, when taken together, the studies make it appe ar extre mely unlike ly that the MMR va ccina tion ha s played any signific ant role in the overall causa tion of autism since the introduction of the MMR vaccine. Of course , it is true that epidemiolog ic studies cannot prove definitively that Factor A never cause s Conditi on B; such a study An Institut e of Me dicine (I OM) re port noted t he ex istence of two additional studies that152 found no association between MMR vaccination and autism , which fell into a third category, i.e., studies of \"passive repor ting data.\" (Ex. JJ, pp. 123-124.) Those were Finnish studies: Annamar i Patja et al., Serious Adve rse Measles- Mumps-Rube Vacc ination During a Fourteen- Year Prospective Follow-Up , 19 PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASE J. 1127 (2000) (Ex. P, Att. 118); and Heikki Peltola et al., Mumps Fi nland , 284 JAMA 2643 (2000) (Ex. P, Att. 120) . Howeve r, as the IOM repor t describe d, those studies appea r to be of quite limit ed value conce rning the MMR/autism causa tion issue, e on \"passive r eporting data\" and other reasons. I have a ccorded no we ight to those two studies. I could write many pages desc ribing in detail t hose st udies, discussing the streng ths and153 weaknesses of the di fferent studi es, and explaining i n detail why certain of the studies seem to be of especially heavy probative value, others somewhat less so. But I do not find it necessary to provide such a lengthy discussion, f or two re asons. Fir st, the rec ord of this ca se conta ins not only the published article s descr ibing in detail virtually all of those studies, but also some lengthy descr iptions and discussions of those studies by well-qua lified experts. Respondent's expert Dr. Fombonne, an expert extremely well-qua lified conce rning autism (see discussion at p. 109 above) , descr ibed most of those studies, some at length, in both his expert repor t (Ex. P, pp. 31-48) and his hearing testimony (Tr. 2530- 77). I n addition, such studies are well-de scribed by a compre hensive repor t issued by the Institut e of Medicine (IOM) in 2004. (See Ex. JJ, pp. 65, 82-126.) (For a discussion of that 2004 I OM Report, see p. 124 below.) Second, the petitioners in this case simply have not contested the descr iptions and interpre tations of those studies by the IOM committee and by Dr. Fombonne. That is, the petitioners have not disputed responde nt's argument that the studies descr ibed above show clearly that the MMR vaccine does not pla y any signific ant causa l role in the causa tion of autism overall . Rather, the petitioners have argued that the studies should be considere d as irrelevant to the issue of whether the MMR vacc ine contributes to regressive autism , rathe r than autism in general. The petiti oners argue that regressive autism is a narrow subset of autism, and that none of the available studies have specific ally studied the issue of whether the MMR vaccine cause s regressive autism, so that the studies are simply irrelevant to case s involving re gressive a utism. I have dealt in detail with this \"irrelevanc y\" argument of the petitioners, at pp. 118-21 of this Decision. This footno te simply explains why I have not discussed each of the many individual epidemiolog ic studies in detail in this Decision. 115cannot ever completely rule out the pos sibili ty that Factor A cause s a tiny perce ntage of the cases of Conditi on B, a percentag e too small for the study to detect. However, when a varie ty of well- desig ned studies by differ ent researchers have looked extensively for evidenc e of an associa tion betwee n Factor A and Conditi on B, but have found none, not only can one conclude confide ntly that Factor A doe s not cause a signifi cant perc entage of ca ses of Condition B, but it is also rea sonable to interpre t those studies as casting at least some doubt on the proposition that Factor A ever cause s Conditi on B. In this case, the studies descr ibed above, taken as whole, show very clearly that the M MR vaccine does not cause any substantial portion of the cases of autism in the studied countries. And while those studies cannot completely rule out any possibili ty that the MMR vaccination might play some causa tive role in a tiny fraction of autism cases (a fraction too small to be detec ted by even the largest studies), it seems to me that the failure of so many studies to find any association between MMR vacci nes and autism at least casts some doubt upon the proposition that the MMR vaccine ever play s a role in c ausing autism.154 b. Stu dies by the Ge iers and by Wakefield As noted above, all of the studies that have addre ssed the MMR/autism causa tion issue published since the Wakefield article in 1998 have found no association betwee n MMR vaccination and autism, with two exceptions. Both exceptions w ere studies published by the re search tea m of Dr. Mar k Geier and his son David Ge ier. (E x. P, Att. 82; Snyder Ex. O, Tab 10; Ex. 119-20, 122-23; Ex. be sur e, the pe titioners in this case have not cited or relied upon those two studies, because, as I will discuss below (pp. 118-21), the petitioners argue that all of the epidemiolog ic studies done to da te are irrelevant to the petitioners' causa tion theory in this ca se. Howe ver, since I find that the epide miologic studies are of relevance , I have found it reasonable to examine those two studies, to see if they afford any signific ant counterweig ht to the many contra ry studies discussed above . Another epidemiolog ic study was published in September of 2008. Mady Hornig et al.,154 Lack of Association between Measles Virus Vacc ine and Autism with Enteropathy: A Case Control Study , 3 PloS ONE e3140 (2008), available at www.plosone.or g. Neither party has sought to make that study part of the record in this case, so I have not relied upon it. Howeve r, the abstrac t of that study states t hat the study \"provide s strong evidenc e against association of autism with persistent MV RNA in the GI tract or MMR e xposure.\" Thus, it appear s that the study would only add more weig ht to the conclusion that I have othe rwise r eached. D. Geier & M. Geier , A comparative evaluation of the effects of MMR immunization and155 merc ury doses from thimerosal-containing childhood vaccines on the population prevale nce of autism , 10 M ED. SCI. MONITOR P133 (2004). (Ex. P, Att . 82.) Mark R. Geier & David A. Geier , Pediatric MMR Vacc ination Safety , 18 INT'L Snyder Ex. 165.) 116After careful considera tion, I conclude that the Geier s' studies cannot be given any weig ht. Those studies were considere d by the Institut e of Medicine (IOM) committee that fully studied the entire MMR/causation issue in 2004 (Ex. JJ, pp. 102-05, 119-20, 122-23), and that committee conclude d that the studies were so flawe d as to be \"uninterpre table\" and to contribute nothing meaning ful (\"nonc ontributory pp. 119-120, 122-23). The committee noted that the studies were based on databa ses that themselves had \"significant limit ations\" (id. at 120), and that the studies' methodologie s had \"serious methodologic al limit ations\" (id. at 120, 123). The committee added that the Geier s' article s descr ibing the details,\" so that it was impossibl e to evalua te the studies. ( Id.) Other specific points of deficie ncy in the studies were also discussed. ( Id.) In addition, Dr. Fombonne analy zed the Geier studies, and found them to be \"seriously flawe d in sever al respe cts.\" (Ex. P, para. 81.) None of the expert witnesses for the petitioners vouched f or the re liability of the Ge ier studies. I have revie wed the Geier studies, a nd I agree with the analy sis of those studies se t forth in the 2004 IOM Report and in Dr. Fombonne' s repor t. I conclude that those two Geier epidemiolog ic studies are not reliable , and ca nnot be ac corde d any weig ht. I also note that in listing and discussing the epidemiolog ic studies relevant to the MMR/au tism causa tion issue, the IOM committee also mentioned the above- descr ibed original article published by Wakefield and colleag ues in 1998. (Ex.P , Att. 152; Ex. JJ, pp. 108-09, 124-26.) The authors of that article examined the m edica l records of 12 children w ho eac h had a history of loss of developmenta l skills, and also had intestinal symptoms. Ten of the 12 seeme d to have a disorder falling within the autism spectrum, and in most of those individuals the initial autistic symptoms were f irst noticed within two months after MMR vac cination. (Ex. P, Att . 152, p. 639; Ex. JJ, p. 125.) The authors conclude d from these finding s that they had possibly disco vered a \"unique disease p rocess\" or \"sy ndrome\" in which children had both developmenta l disorders and intestinal disorders, both potentially linked causa lly to the MMR vaccine. (Ex. P, Att. 152, pp. 639- 41.) That Wakefield article , howeve r, cannot be considere d to e conce rning the MMR/autism causa tion issue. The article was intended to raise a question about a possible causa l association-- a question that would then be addre ssed in the future by large epidemiolog ic studies. (Such studies have in fact taken place , and have failed to find any evidenc e of association-- see discussion at pp. 110-14 above). The study examined only 12 individua ls, far too few to yield any strong evidenc e conce rning causa tion. The 2004 IOM Report pointed out that \"because of the overla p in timing betwee n the typical age at which ASD symptoms are initially suspected and the [typical] schedule for MMR * * * vaccinations,\" it was hardly surprising that the Wakefield authors could find som e childre n whose a utisti c symptoms were first noted wit hin two months after MMR vaccination. (Ex. JJ at 126.) The IOM repor t conclude d that the Wakefield article was simply \"uninformative\" conce rning the MMR/autism causa tion ombonne also pointed out defic iencies in the Wake field ar ticle. (Ex. P, para. 62.) 117 I agree with the 2004 I OM Report t hat the 1998 Wakef ield article is simpl y uninformative conce rning the MMR/autism causa tion issue. I also note that, after Wakefield himself came under considera ble profe ssional criticism, ten of Wakefield's twelve co-authors on the 1998 article published a letter in which they clarified that a c ausal link betwe en MMR vacc ine and a utism had not been established by their study . Furthermore 125.) c. ers' \"irrelev ant\" As noted above, the petitioners have not disputed responde nt's argument that the studies descr ibed above show that the MMR vaccine does not play any signific ant causa l role in the causation of autism overall . Rather, the petitioners seem to argue that the studies perta in only to autism in general , and, should be considere d as irrelevant to the issue of whether the MMR vaccine contributes to regressive autism . The petitioners seem to argue that because regressive autism is156 a narrow subset of autism, and most of the epidemiolog ic studies have not specific ally addre ssed the issue of whether the MMR vaccine cause s regressive autism , the epidemiolog ic studies are there fore irrelevant to case s involving re gressive a utism. First, I must define \"regressive autism.\" Some individuals with autism do not mere ly fail to develop normally , but actua lly lose skills that they previously demonstrated, in language and related areas, usually sometime during the second y ear of life. This phenome non is sometimes descr ibed as \"autist ic regression,\" and sometimes it is said that individuals who fall into this pattern have \"regressive autism.\" (E.g., Tr. 1054-55, 1287A-89A.) There have been various estimates as to what percentag e of autistic individuals fall within this category, but many recent estimates have been near 20 percent. (Ex. P, para. 120; Ex. 61, p. 9; Ex. JJ, p. 33; 1054, 1290A.) Michelle Cedillo's autism has been descr ibed as regressive autism (althoug h this point is, in dispute--see footnote 168 at p. 132 below) , and it appea rs that many of the individuals who have f iled Vac cine Ac t petitions grouped into the Omnibus Autism Procee ding have also been descr ibed as suffe ring from regressive autism. The theory advanc ed by the petitioners in this case, and by the Petitioners' Steering Commi ttee (PS C) in the Snyder and Hazlehurst test case s, seems to be based upon the theory that \"regressive autism\" should be considered separately from other cases of autism f or the purpose of deter mining ca usation.157 The petiti oners did not addre ss the topic of epidemiolog y in any detail i n their post -trial156 briefs. Thus, the summary of their argument that I have stated above is my best guess as to what their argument is, based upon their brief quotation of Dr. Kinsbourne in their brief (P1, p. 123), other statements by Dr. Kinsbourne (Ex. 61, p. 10; Tr. 1059 A-60), and questions asked and statements made by their counse l at the hea ring (Tr. 2679- 80, 2889). The petitioners' general causa tion autism,\"see ms to157 assume that regres sive autism is such a distinct category of autism that the causes of regressive autism likely differ from those of other forms of autis m. That assum ption, howeve r, is much Petitioners have not supp lied persua sive evidenc e indicating that regressive autism has a (continued...) 118Thus, the petitioners here seem to argue that all of the epidemiolog ic studies descr ibed above should be considere d irrelevant to this case, and to a ll cases involving regressive autism, be cause , they suggest, such studies did not make any distinction betwee n regressive autism and non-re gressive autism. It is true that most of the epidemiolog ic studies discussed above generally did not make any distinction betwee n regressive and nonreg ressive autism. Thus, it is arguable that those epidem iologic studies, while providing very strong evidenc e that the MMR vaccination has not played any signific ant role in the overall causation of autism, do not necessarily complete ly rule out the possibilit y that the MMR va ccine might play some role in ca using the subset of autism known as regressive a utism. But petitioners are wrong in contending that the epidemiolog ic studies are completely irrele vant. First, while those studies cannot complete ly rule out any possibility that the MMR vaccination might play some causa tive role in a subset of the overall autism cases, it seems to me that the failure of so many studies to find any association betwee n MMR vaccine and autism at least casts some doubt on the proposition that the MMR vaccine ever plays a role in causing any type of autism, including regressive autism. Second, as Dr. Fombonne pointed out, five of the epidemiolog ic studies actua lly did make a distinction betwee n regressive and nonreg ressive autism, and thus do have some specific rele vance to the petitioners' \" regressive a utism onl y\" theor y. The first such study was the Taylor 2002 study . If the petitioners were correct that MMR158 is causing a signific ant amount of re gressive a utism but not nonreg ressive a utism, t hen one would expect that the proportion of regressive autism with respe ct to overa ll autism would have increased with the introduction of the MMR vaccine. Howeve r, the Taylor 2002 study indicated that the ratio of reg ressive autism to overa ll autism rema ined about the same in Britain after the MMR vaccine was introduced in 1988. (Ex. P, para. 122; Tr. 2564A-66A.) Simi larly, the 2001 Fombonne and (...continued)157 distinct cause or set of cause s. For example, there is no persua sive evidenc e indicating that regressive autism might be any less of a strongly genetic condition than other forms of autism. There has also been scatter ed discussion in the record concerning whether regressive autism should be considere d a district \"phe notype\" of autism. Howeve r, I find that it is unnece ssary for me to resolve the general questions of whether regressive autism is a category likely to differ from other forms of autism as to causa tion, or whether regressive a utism shoul a separ ate \"phenoty pe.\" Regardle ss of whethe r regressive autism is viewed separ ately for purposes of causa l analy sis, or considere d a separ ate \"phenoty pe,\" the petitioners simply have failed, for all the reasons set forth above, to supply any persua sive evidenc e that the MMR v accine play s any role in ca using any kind of autism, reg ressive or not. Brent Taylor et al., Meas les, Mumps, and Rubella Vacc ination and Bowel Problems or158 Developmental Regression in Children with Autism: Population Study , 324 BRIT. MED. J. 393 (2002). ( Ex. P, Att. 146.) 119Chakraba rti study also indicated that the proportion of regressive autism in British children159 rema ined the same after the introduction of . (Ex. P , para . 121; Tr. 2571A-72.) And yet another study involving British children, published by Smeeth and colleag ues in 2004,160 reached the same c onclusion. (Ex. P , para . 123.) Further, a 2006 study by Uchiy ama and colleag ues showed that the regression rate was no161 highe r among autistic Japane se children expose d to MMR than among those unexpose d, contra ry to what one would expect if the MMR vaccine cause d regressive autism. (Ex. P, Tab 87; Ex. P, para. 124; Tr. 2566A-67.) Finally , another epidemiolog ic study was desig ned specific ally to compar e autistic children with regression t o those without reg ression, and to test whe ther the two g roups were any differ ent with respe ct to the timing of MMR vaccination. That study was published by Richler and colleag ues in 2006. (Ex. P, Tab 124; Ex. P, para. 113; Tr. vs. nonreg ressive groups in sever al ways, and found no evidenc e of any differ ence betwee n the regressive and nonreg ressive groups, and no evidenc e that the regressive autism had any association with the timing of MMR vaccina tion. (Tr. 2572-76.) According ly, the petitioners are mistaken when they suggest that all of the published epidemiolog ic studies make no distinction betwee n regressive and nonreg ressive autism. The five studies discussed above provide im portant evidence that the M MR vaccine is not assoc iated with the specific subcate gory of regressive autism . The petitioners' experts had an opportunity to rebut Dr. F ombonne's testimony regarding those studies, but failed to do so. In sum, it is true, as a statistical matter, that the epidemiolog ic studies detailed at pp. 110-14 above, while showing clearly that the MMR vaccination could not be causing any substantial portion of the c ases of autism in general , do not complete ly rule out the possibili ty that the MMR vacc ine might be associate d with some small subset of autism, such as regressive autism. Nonethele ss, the balanc e of evidenc e from those studies w eighs against the petitioners' causa tion theory . First, it is indeed an exceedingly slight point in the petitioners' favor for them to claim that these many studies E. Fombonne & S. Chakraba rti, No Evidenc e for a New Variant of Measles- Mumps-159 Rubella-Induc ed Autism , 108 PEDIATRICS 58 (2001). ( Ex. P, Att. 60.) Liam Smeeth et al., ination and A St udy, 364 L ANCET 963 (2004). ( Ex. P, Att. 137.) T. Uchiyama et al., MMR-Vaccine and Regression in Autism Spectrum Disorders: Negat ive161 Results Presented from J apan , 37 J . AUTISM & DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS 210 (2007). (Ex. P , Att. 149.) J.

BB, Att. 84.) 120by differ ent researchers in differ ent countries have not complete ly ruled out the possibili ty of any merit to their causation claim. The larger point is that none of those m any competent studi es has yielded the slightest bit of evide nce in the petitioners' favor --and, of course , it is the petitioners' burden to show that the MMR vaccine does likely cause autism, not the responde nt's burden to show that there is absolutely no possibili ty of a c ausal link. Second, in my view the failure of so many studie s to find any association betwee n MMR vaccine and a utism, whil e not complete ly ruling out a possible c ausal role with re spect to a subset of autism, a t least casts considerable doubt upon the proposition that the MMR vaccine ever plays a role in causing any kind of autism, including r egressive a utism. Third, and most importantly , at least five studies do provide evidenc e directly relev ant to the petitioners' \"regressive autism only\" argument. Those five studies, as detailed at pp. 119-20 above, provide signific ant evidenc e against the theory that the MMR vaccine plays a causa l role even in the subset of autism known as re gressive a utism.163 d. Case law concerning epidem iologic evidence The case law is clear that there is no requireme nt that a petitioner supply supportive epidemiolog ic evidenc e. Causation-in-fa ct can be demons trated, in an appropr iate case, in the absenc e of epidemiolog ic evidenc e supporting an association betwee n the type of vaccination in question and the type of injury in question. Capizzano v. Secre tary of HHS , (Fed. Cir. 2006). Indeed, causa tion-in-fac t can be demonstrated without any support from medical literature at all. Id. at 1325-26; Althen v. Secre tary of HHS , 418 F.3d 1274, 1281 (Fed. Cir. 2005). That case law, of course , correctly recognizes the fact that with respect to many causa tion-in-fac t claims raised in Prog ram cases, the question of whether the type of vaccination in question can cause the type of injury in question simply has never been the subject of an epidemiolog ic study . For example, the Althen court neurolog ic damag e--the field was simply \"bereft of * * * proof\" as to Another argument that the petitioners seem to raise against the epidemiolog ic eviden ce163 advanc ed by the responde nt is that the non-Ame rican epidemiolog ic studies involved children who, prior to receiving their MMR vaccinations in question, received fewer thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines, and/or less total thimerosal, than U.S. children. There fore, petitioners seem to argue, the fact that MMR has not been associate d with autism in other countries should not be deeme d relevant to U.S. children , whose immune systems, according to petitioners, are alleg edly weakened by exposure to higher amounts of thimerosal prior to their MMR vaccinations. (Again, this point was not raised by petitioners' counsel in their post-hear ing briefs. But see the questions asked by petitioners' counsel at Tr. 2640A-52.) Such an argument, howeve r, must be rejected. As explained above (pp. 22-34), the petitioners have wholly failed to demonstrate any merit in their claim that the small amounts of mercur y contained in thimer osal-conta ining vaccines have any effect on infants' immune systems. There fore, there is no reason to disreg ard the MMR/autism studies from non-U.S. countries, simply because children in those other countries may have received amounts of thimerosal differ ent from the a mounts rece ived by U.S. children. 121whether such a vaccination could cause such an injury . 418 F.3d at 1280. In such a situation, wher e there have been no epidemiolog ic studies conce rning the general causation issue, it makes sense that evidence such as medical opinions and circumstantial evidenc e may be enoug h to demonstrate causa tion, in a particular case , to the require d level of \" more proba ble than not.\" Howeve r, the case law also teaches that when deciding issues of general causa tion that have been studied, a specia l master may properly consider whateve r epidemiolog ic evidenc e, or other relevant medical literature , that does exist. In Daubert v. Merre ll Dow Pharmace uticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993), the Supreme Court listed certain factors that federal trial courts shoul d utiliz e in evalua ting proposed expert testimony conce rning scientific issues. In , 195 F.3d 1302, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 1999), the Federal Circuit ruled that it is appropr iate for specia l masters to utiliz e Daubert's factors as a framework for evalua ting the reliabilit y of causa tion-in-fac t theories pr esente d in Progr am ca ses. One of the fa ctors listed in Daubert is whether the scientific theory \"has been subjected to peer revie w and publication.\" 509 U.S. at 593. The Court noted that while publication does not \"necessar ily\" correlate with reliability , since in some instances new theories will not yet have been published, never theless \"submission to the scrutiny of the scientific community is a component of 'good science ,'\" so that the \"fac t of publ ication (or lack thereof) in a peer revie wed journal thus will be a relevant, though not dispositi ve, considera tion in assessing the scientific va lidity \" of a theory . Id. at 593-94. Thus, Daubert supports the use of published medical literature as a tool in evalua ting causa tion theories. And, in fact, in the Terran case, the specia l master relied upon a published epidemiolog ic study , known as the National Childhood Ence phalopathy Study (NCES), in deny 1998 55290, at *10- 11 (Fed. C l. Spec. Mstr. Jan. 23, 1998)), and the Feder al Circuit affirmed (195 F.3d at 1315-17). Further, in Grant v. Secretary of HHS , 956 F.2d 1144, 1149 (Fed. Cir. 1992), the Federal Circuit specified that in Vaccine Act cases \"epide miologica l studies are probative medical evidenc e relevant to causa tion,\" though suc h studies are not nece ssarily dispositi ve. Consist ent with the , Terran , and Grant , specia l masters have routinely found that epidemiolog ic evidenc e, and/or other medical journal article s, while not dispositive , should be considered in evaluating scientific theor ies. For example, in Scott v. Sec retary of HHS , No. 03-2211V Spec. Aug. 21, 2006), a specia l master found medica l literature submitted in that ca se to be he lpful, though not ne cessa rily \"dispositive,\" in resolving a dispute betwee n medical experts. In Garcia v. Secre tary of HHS , No. . Mstr. Nov. 12, 2008), a specia l master found the argument of the petitioners' expert to be more persua sive than that of the responde nt's expert, in part because the theory of the petitioner's expert was supported by a published repor t of a committee of the Institut e of Medicine. In Williams v. Secre tary of HHS , Cl. Spec. Mstr. Sep. 11, 2007), a specia l master noted that \"medica l or scientific literature \" can help to carry a petitioner's causa tion burden. *28 (Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. Aug. 29, 2007), it was noted that specia l masters routinely use medical litera ture in orde r to eva luate ca usation theories. 122Further, in the Prog ram case law there have been many ruling s in which judge s expli citly stated approva l of a specia l master' relianc e upon epidemiologic studies to e causation theories. See, e.g. Moberly v. Secre tary of HHS , No. 98-910V, slip op. at (Fed. Cl. Jan. 30, 2009); Estep v. Secre HHS , 23 Cl. Ct . 1 (1991). According ly, the case l aw concer ning the use of e pidemiologic e vidence in Prog ram cases is clear. There is no requireme nt that epidemiolog ic evidenc e support a causa tion-in-fac t claim. Nor would it be proper for a specia l master to base a causa tion ruling entirely on epidemiolog ic evidenc e; the specia l master must consider all the evidenc e of the record, including opinion evidenc e, circumstantial evidence , etc. How ever, in those rela tively infreque nt instances in which a general causa tion issue has been the subject of epidem iologic studies, and therefor e publi shed st udies are available in peer-reviewed medical journals, it is quite appropr iate for the specia l master to consider such epidemiolog ic evidenc e, and to give that evidenc e appropr iate weig ht under the circumstances, along with all of the other e vidence of re cord. e. Sum mary conce rning epidemiol ogy The numerous epidemiolog ic studies done over the past ten years, when taken together, make it very unlikely that the M MR vaccination has pl ayed any signific ant role in the overall causation of autism. It is true, as the petitioners argue, that the availa ble epidemiologic studies do not complete ly rule out the possibili ty that the MMR vaccine might be associate d with some small subset of autism, such as regressive autism. Howeve r, there are three reasons why the epidemiolog ic evidenc e still must be said to provide signific ant evidenc e against the petitioners' general causa tion theory set forth in this case. First, none of the numerous competent studies has yielded the slightest bit of evide nce in the petitioners' favor . Second, the failure of so many studies to find any association betwee n MMR vaccine and autism, while not complete ly ruling out a possible causa l role with respe ct to a subset of autism, at least casts considerable doubt upon the proposition that the MMR vaccine ever plays a role in causi ng any kind of autism , including reg ressive autism. And, third, five studies provide evidenc e that is directly relev ant to the petitioners' \"regressive autism only\" argument, supply ing signific ant evidence against the theory that the MMR vaccine plays a causa l role even in the subset of autism known as re gressive a utism. According ly, my conclusion is that the epidemiolog ic evidenc e does provide yet another strong reason to rejec t the petitioners' g eneral causation theory prese nted this case. Conclu sions of th e Institu te of Medic ine com mittees Another part of the record in this case adds additional weig ht to my conclusion conce rning this MMR/autism tion issue. That is, two very well-qua lified groups of medical experts have studied the issue of whether the MMR vac cine c auses a utism, and both groups have reached a conc lusion against the proposition that the MMR vaccine cause s autism. 123I refer to two repor ts published by the Institut e of Medicine, which is the medical arm of the National Academy of Science s. The National Academy of Science s (\"NAS\") was created by Congr ess in 1863 to be a advisor to the federal governme nt on scientific and technica l matters (see An Act to Incorporate the National Acade my of Scienc es, ch. 111, 12 Stat. 806 (1863)) , and the Institute of Medicine (\"IOM\") is an offshoot of the NAS established in 1970 to provide advice conce rning medical issues. (Ex. JJ, p. iv.) When it enacted the Vaccine Act in 1986, Congr ess specific ally direc ted that the IOM conduct studies conce rning potential causa l relationships betwee n vaccines and illnesses. \u00a7 300aa- 1 note. In the interve ning y ears, the IOM has formed committees which have prepa red numerous repor ts concerning issues of possible relationships betwee n vaccinations and injuries. (For a list of such repor ts, see Ex. JJ, p. 25.) Two of those repor ts are of direc t releva nce to the g eneral causation issue involved in this case. (Ex. HH and Ex. J J.) In the first of those repor ts, issued in 2001 , an expert committee selec ted by the IOM extensively examined all of the information then available conc erning the same ge neral causa tion controve rsy at issue here, i.e., the question of whether the MMR vaccine can cause or contribute to autism. After a lengthy discussion, that 2001 IOM Commi ttee reached the conclusion that \"the evidenc e favor s rejection of a causa l relationship at the population level betwee n MMR vaccine and ASD.\" (Ex. HH, p. 60.) The committee's conclusion, that the evidenc e \"favors rejection\" of a causa l relationship, was the strongest possible negative conclusion that the commi ttee could have reached. ( Ex. HH, p. 19.) By 2004, considera ble additional evidenc e was available conce rning the MMR/autism general causa tion issue, so the IOM assembled another committee to study the issue again. And once again, the 2004 IOM Commit tee, after study ing the additional evidenc e that had become available since 2001 along with the earlier evidenc e, reached the same conclusion, that the evidenc e \"favors rejection of a causa l relationship betwee n MMR vaccine and autism.\" (Ex. JJ, pp. 8, 126, 151-52.) It is quite appropr iate that I assig n at least some evidentiar y weight to the conclusions of those two IOM committees. As noted above, when it enacted the Vaccine Act in 1986, Congress specifically directed that the IOM conduct studies conce rning potential causa l relationships betwee n vaccines and il lnesses. That di rection obviously implies that when such studies are performed by IOM committees, spec ial masters should ca refully consider those studies in deciding Vaccine Act cases.164 Respondent has also asser ted that numerous other prestig ious expert medical groups,164 beside the IOM committees discussed above, have also \"rejected any link between vaccines and ASDs.\" (R1 at 61.) But, with two exceptions, responde nt has not supplied docume ntation that such bodies have stated any such conclusions, so I cannot place any relianc e on any alleg ed conclusions of any other scientific bodies. One exception is a repor t issued by the Medica l Resear ch Coun cil (MRC) of the United King dom in December of 2001, which was filed as an attachme nt to Dr. Ward's repor t. Medica Council, MRC Review of Autism Researc h: Epidemiology and Causes, Dec. 2001, London. (Ex. B B, Att. 70.) The MRC appe ars to be the British counter part to the United States' National Institut e of Health or the Institut e of Medicine. (Tr. 1246A.) The MRC (continued...) 124Moreove r, I note that during the 15-year history of the Vaccine Act, specia l masters have consistently relied upon the repor ts of the Institut e of Medicine. E.g., Terran v. Secre tary of HHS , 41 Fed. Cl. 330, 337 (1998) (affirming specia l master' s relianc e on conclusions of IOM), 1302 (Fed. Cir. 1999); Ultimo v. Secre tary of HHS, 28 Fed. Cl. 148, 152 (1993) (affirming specia l master' s on HHS , 26 540 (1992) (same) ; Manville v . Secre tary of HHS, 63 Fe d. Cl. 482, 491 (2004) (same ); Ryman v. Sec retary of HHS, 65 Fed. Cl. 35, 39, (2005) (same); Capizzano v. Secretary of HHS , No. 00-759V, at *2 Golkiewicz, June 8, 2004) (\"Considering the IOM's statutory charge, the scope of its revie w, and the cross-se ction of experts making up the committee, the specia l masters have consistently accorded great weig ht to the IOM's finding Mstr. Abell Mar. 30, 2004) (\"[T]he Court gives great deference to the finding s of the Institut e of Medicine on the issue of cause and effect betwee n vaccines and discrete injuries.\"); Malloy v. Se HH Secre of HHS 96-783V, W *3-4 n.2 Spec . Jan. 2001); Castil lo HHS , No. 95-652V, 1999 WL 605690, at *11 (Fed. C l. Spec. Mst r. Wright Jul. 19, 1999); Schell v. Se cretary HH S, Cl. Spec. Mstr. B aird F eb. 22, 1994). To be sure, I stress that I am certainly not allowing the judgme nt of the IOM committees to substitut e for my own. The conclusion of those committees constitutes only one item of evidenc e, among many , conce rning the general MMR/autism causa tion issue in own conclusion conce rning this ge neral causa tion issue would, indeed, be exactly the same if the I OM repor ts had never been issued. I simply find it appropr iate to acknow ledge the conclusions of those repor ts, and to point out t hat those conc lusions do harmoniz e with my own conc lusion here. (...continued)164 concluded that the medical evidenc e available at that time did not support a causa l relationshi p betwee n the MMR vacc ine and a utism. ( Id. at 3, 25, 28-31.) The second exception is a repor t from the World Health Organization. That organization's Global Advisory Commi ttee on Vaccine Safety conducte d a revie w of the evidenc e, and conclude d that \"no evidenc e exists of a causa l association betwee n MMR vaccine and autism or autistic disorders.\" World Health Organization, MMR and Autism - A Review for the Global Advisory Committee on Vacc ine Safety , WEEKLY EPIDEMIOLOGICAL RECORD (January 24, 2003). (Ex. TT, p. 1.) The conclusions of those two committees supply yet another reason to reject the petitioners' general theory , advanc ed in this case, that the MMR vaccine can contribute to the causa tion of autism. 12510. Sum mary conce rning general causation i ssue For all the reasons stated above, I conclude that the petitioners have failed complete ly to demonstrate that it is \"more probable than not\" that the MMR vaccination can be a substantial factor in contributing to the causa tion of autism, in individuals suffe ring from regressive autism or any other type of autism. To the contra ry, the evidenc e that I have revie wed makes it appea r extre mely unlikely that the MMR vacc ine ca n contribute to the c ausation of a utism. C. Reasons for rejecting th e claim t hat th e MMR vacc ine subst antial ly contribut ed to Michelle Cedillo's aut ism I must also reject the claim that the MMR vaccine substantially contributed to Miche lle Cedillo's autism, for seve ral re asons set for th below. 1. I have rejec ted the petitioners' \"general causation \" theory . In the page s above, I have expl ained at length why I have rejec general can contribute to the causa tion of autism. Thus, since the petitioners have failed to demonstrate any validity to their general causation theory , it follows inescapa bly that they have also failed to de monstrate that the autism of Miche lle Cedillo herself was c aused by her MMR vac cination. 2. Petitioners' theory depends upon th e existence of a reliable laboratory test finding of persisting m easles virus, whi ch does not exist in Michelle's case . Dr. Kinsbourne made it absolutely clear that his causa tion theory depende d upon assuming the existence of a reliable labora tory test that finds persisting measle s virus in an autistic child's body . He indicated that in no case could he opine that the MMR vaccine cause d a person' s autism in the absenc e of a reliable finding of persisting measles virus in the vaccinee' s body . (E.g., Tr. 1180A, 1183A, 1196A.) Howeve r, for the reasons already explained above, I have conclude d that the Unig enetics labora tory result purporting to find persisting measles virus in Miche lle's case is not reliable . There fore, petitioners' and Dr. Kinsbourne' s conclusion that the MMR vaccine substantially contributed to Miche lle's autism must be rejec ted for tha t reason alone. 3. Dr. Kins bourn e relied upon incorrect assum ptions concerning th e tim ing of Michelle's autism symptom s. Dr. Kinsbourne also made it clear that, in offering his causa tion opinion in Michelle's case, he relied upon the certain assumptions c oncer ning the timing of the onset of Michelle's symptoms of autism. He opined that Michelle was a normally developing infant, with no indications of autism, until the time of her MMR vaccination on December 20, 1995. (Ex. 61, p. 19; Tr. 1040.) He further testified that Michelle's first symptoms of autism then began quite abruptly about seven days after that vaccination, or within a few days there after. (Ex. 61, p. 3; Tr. 1041, 1175A-76, 1184A.) Howeve r, upon a complete analy sis of the record, I conclude that these assumptions of 126Dr. Kinsbourne were not correct. To the contra ry, the evidenc e shows that (1) Michelle e xhibited symptoms of autism prior to her MMR vaccination, and (2) Michelle did not experience an abrupt onset of autism sy mptoms shortl y after her MMR vaccina tion. ysis of the record, e specially c ertain videos, demon strates th at Michelle was exhibit ing sym ptom s of autism even prior t o the MMR vacc inati on in question . i. Dr. Fom bonne and Dr. Wi znitzer Respondent relied upon two experts who testified that there is much evidenc e that demonstrates that Michelle was exhibi ting symptoms of autism even prior to her MMR vaccination of De cembe r 20, 1995. Those w itnesses wer e Dr. Eric F ombonne and Dr . Max W iznitzer. Dr. Fombonne, as noted above, is a pediatric psychiatrist with extensive experience in examining and tre ating autistic children, and in study ing the issue of the c ausation of a utism. (Tr. 1239-62A.) Dr. Fombonne descr ibed sever al differ ent categories of evidenc e that indicate the prese nce of autism in Michelle prior to the MMR vaccination. (Tr. 1328A.) First, he noted that Michelle's medical records contain notations indicating that Michelle was exhibi ting signs of social and language delay , an important component of autism, prior to her MMR vaccination. One record indicated that Michelle did not smile until she was four to six months of age. (Tr. 1328A-29, Ex. 7, p. 3 (note that p. 3 of Ex. 7 is p. 2 of Dr. Roth's repor t).) Dr. Fombonne explained that children usually smile well befor e that time, so this would be evidenc e of a delay in social development. (Tr. 1329.) He further noted that some records i ndicated that Michelle had about 10 words by the age of 15 \u00bd months, when she received her MMR vaccination. (Tr. 1329; Ex. 7, p. 3; Ex. 4, p. 2.) Assumin g that repor t to be accurate , Dr. Fombonne explained that most children have about 40 words by the age of 16 months, so that the report of only 10 words was an indication of delay in language deve lopment. (Tr. 1330A- 31.) Next, Dr. Fombonne pointed to the fact that Michelle's head circumfe rence was abnorma lly large during her f irst y ear of life, whic h is ty pical of a utism. (Tr. 1335-37; Ex. 8, pp. 7-8.) Also, Dr. Fombonne noted that he had revie wed all of the Cedillo family videos of Michelle during the period prior to her MMR vaccination, and found many examples of autistic behavior . (Tr. 1337-50A.) During the evidentiar y hearing, Dr. Fombonne display ed a number of examples of such videos, pointing out specific behavior s that, in his view, constit uted autistic behavior by Michelle during the pre-vaccination period. Examples included Michelle failing to respond to her name, failing to make eye contac t, failing to play with toys in a fashion typical of her age group, failing to use communicative gestures, failing to use any words, engaging in certain stereoty pical \"hand- flapping\" movements, and tending to fixate exclusively on a non-human stimul us (in this case, a Sesame Street video) to the exclusion of social intera ction. (Tr. 1340-50A.) He explained tha t all 127of these behavior s were abnorma l for children of Michelle's age, and all were indicative of autism. 165 (Id.) Dr. Wiznitzer, a pediatric neurolog ist who also has had extensive experience in diagnosing and treating autistic children, also revie wed the videos of Michelle. (Tr. 1645, 1756, 1779.) He commonly uses videos in his clinical practice conce rning autistic children, both for confirming the diagnosis of autism and for pinpointing the time of onset of the condition. (Tr. 1644-45, 1699-1700, 1757-58.) Dr. Wiznitzer testified that he found much evidenc e of autism on the videos of Michelle prior to her MMR vaccination of December 20, 1995. (Tr. 1647-67.) Like Dr. Fombonne,166 Dr. Wiznitzer, during the evidentiar y hearing, display ed a number of excerpts from those videos, and pointed to specific behavi ors that he found to be clear examples of autistic behavior in Michelle, behavior s that would not be expected in childre n who ar e not autistic. ( Id.) Dr. Wiznitzer pointed to a video in which, when Michelle was nine months of age, she engaged in certain repetitive hand movements typical of autism, movements that later became even more define d when she was in her second and third years of life. (Tr. 1656-57A.) Dr. Wiznitzer pointed out many instances of the same types of behavior noted by Dr. Fombonne, including a lack of eye contac t or the failure to sustain eye contac t; a lack of social engagement with the adults around her; a marke d tendenc y to prefer watching videos or examining objects to the exclusion of interac ting with people; and the fact that it was much more difficult for adults to attrac t her attention than would be the case with typical children of that age . (Tr. 1651-67, 1781 -82A.) Also like Dr. Fombonne, Dr. Wiznitzer testified that Michelle used no words in the videos, and for the most part did not even make non-ver bal sounds in interac tion with the people around her, as would be ty pical for a child of that age. (Tr. 1651, 1659A, 1661-62, 1780.) Dr. Wiznitzer explained that all of these behavior s were not ty pical of c hildren of that a ge, and w ere indicative of a utism. (Tr. 1647-67, 1781-82A.) Dr. Fombonne also pointed to notations in the medical records indicating that Michelle had165 delay s in motor skills prior to her MMR vaccination. He argued that Michelle was later than the average child in both sitting independe ntly and walking . (Tr. 1332-34A, 1462-63; Ex. 7, p. 3.) Dr. Kinsbourne acknow ledged that Michelle was relatively late in reaching those milestones, but suggested that Michelle was within the wide range of normal varia bility in those cases. (Tr. 1062A- 63.) As Dr. Kinsbourne acknow ledged, Mi chelle was certainly slower tha n average in meeting these two motor skill milestones. Howeve r, the record of this case is not clear as to the limit s of the range of normality in these areas, espec ially as to walking . Further, it is not clear to what extent motor skill delay s are closely tied to autism. There fore, I do not consider the evidenc e as to Michell e's possible delay s in these motor skills as signific ant evidenc e of autism in Michelle preda ting the MMR vac cination. Dr. Wiznitzer testified that he revie wed the videos and reached his conclusions conce rning166 them independe ntly, without consulting with anyone else. 1667, 1771A-72A.) 128Dr. Wiznitzer also noted that Michelle's abnorma lly large head size during her first year of life wa s evidenc e of a utism t hat pre -existed her MMR vacc ination. (Ex. DD, p. 4.) In this regard, both Dr. Fombonne and Dr. Wiznitzer emphasized that Michelle's parents were certainly not blamewor thy in failing to recognize that those behavior s in Michelle constituted early evidenc e of autism. (Tr. 1362-64, 1667-71.) Indeed, Dr. Fombonne testified that it was quite common for e ven pedia tricians to fa il to recog nize the ear liest signs of a utism. Petition ers' argum ents erning this point of possible pre-vaccination evidenc e of autism, the petitioners did offer some counter -evide nce, which merits discussion. One witness in this regard was Michelle's mother, There sa Cedillo, and several points that Mrs. Cedillo made are important. First, she offered an alterna tive explanation for a particula r instance of Michelle's behavior in the video dated December 17, 1995, which Dr . Wiznitzer had interpre ted as the autis tic behavior known as \"hand regard.\" (Tr. 2878A-79; 1649-51A.) Mrs. Cedillo's explanation conce rning this particula r behavior seems plausible, so I have not place d any relianc e upon Dr. Wiznitzer's particula r behavior . Cedillo showed a photograph of Michelle smili ng just prior to Christmas during her first year of life. (Tr. 2879-80.) That photogr aph and testimony seems to show that Michelle did smile by about age 3 \u00bd months, contra ry to the medical record cited by Dr. Fombonne, which had estimated her first smile at age 4 to 6 months. (Tr. 1328A- 29; Ex. 7, p. 3.) There fore, I have not place d any relianc e on Dr. Fombonne' s particula r point conce rning late smiling. Third, Mrs. Cedillo testified that Michelle used sever al words for a purpose, not in mere imitation, during the pre -vaccination per iod. (Tr. 2875A- 76A.) Mrs. Cedillo seeme d to have r eal memories of Michelle using those words, and this testimony does stand in contra st to the testimony of bot h Dr. Fombo nne and Dr. Wiznitzer that, in all of the videos of Mi chelle that they revie wed, she never used any functional words. (Tr. 1460A-61A, 1651, 1659A, 1661-62, 1780.) It does seem surprising that if Michelle did use sever al words func tionally , as Mrs. Cedillo de scribed, that such usage was never captur ed on any of the family videos of Michelle. Yet I certainly do not doubt either that Mrs. Cedillo was honestly relating her m emories, or that Drs. Fombonne and W iznitzer were honestly and accurate ly descr ibing what they saw on the videos. Howeve r, I do not need to resolve this anomaly in the evidenc e. Whil e both Dr. Fombonne and Dr. Wiznitzer doubt that Michelle ever used ten words functionally , as the Cedillos later reporte d to her doctors (Ex. 7, p. 3; Ex. 4, p. 2), Dr. Fombonne testified that even assuming that Michelle did have such use of about 10 words, that would still be abnorma lly slow language development, since most children have about 40 words by age 16 months. There fore, Michell e's limited word use would still be an indication of a delay in language deve lopment. (Tr. 1330A- 31.) The petitioners' other arguments of autism Concer ning the issue of Michelle's hea d circ umfere nce, pe titioners' counsel have suggested that her head was not abnorma lly large compar ed to her height and weig ht, 129which were both well above average. Howeve r, in both his expert repor t and his hearing testimony , Dr. Fombonne explained that even taking into account Michelle's length and weig ht, her head size still must be considere d abnorma l, a condition that is associated w ith autism. (Tr. 1456A-1460A; Ex. P, pp. 60-61.) Dr. Fombonne' s testimony in this regard was not contra dicted by any expert, and I found it to be persua sive. Finally , petitioners' expert, Dr. Kinsbourne did state generally that he watche d the videos of Michelle during the pre-vaccination period, and did not see any evidenc e of autism. (Tr. 1063-65.) I did not find this general testimony , howeve r, to be of much value. Dr. Kinsbourne acknow ledged that he has no experience revie wing videotapes as part of the treatment of autism (Tr. 1171), which contra sts with the extensive experience that Dr. Wiznitzer has with such revie w. (Tr. 1644-45, 1699- 1700, 1757-58). Further, in the area of spotting evidenc e of autistic-like behavior , Dr. Kinsbourne is also obviously disadvantag ed, since he has no experience in treating autistic children for the past 17 years. This contra sts strong ly with the extensive experience of both Dr. Fombonne and Dr. Wiznitzer in treating autistic children during that time period. (Tr. 1163A, 1253A-54A, 1576A- 77A.) And most importantly and Dr. Wiznitzer, as descr ibed above, display ed a number of videos of Mi chelle during the hearing , and point ed out Michelle's specific behaviors that they deemed to be evidenc e of autism during the pre-vaccination period. Petitioners had the opportunity for rebuttal-- i.e., their counsel could have had Dr. Kinsbourne, or some other expert witness, exhibi t the same videos and state any disagreeme nts with Dr. Fombonne' s and Dr. Wiznitzer's Petitioners, howeve nted no such rebuttal by . Thus, interpre tations of Michelle's nted by Drs. Fombonne and Wiznitzer, highly qualified witnesses whom I found to be honest and credible, stand unrebutted. I conclude that those behavior s were, in fact, evidenc e of autism in Michelle that preda ted of autis m In short, for the reasons set forth above, I conclude that Dr. Kinsbourne was mistaken in his assumption that Michelle display ed normal development prior to her MMR vaccination of December 20, 1995. To the contra ry, the evidenc e strong ly indicates that Michelle was already showing evidenc e of br ain abnor mality and of a utism prior to her MMR b. The m contradict abru pt onset of auti sm symptom s about seven days post-vacc inati on. Thus, as demonstrated above, Dr. Kinsbourne was wrong in his assumption that Michelle display ed no sy mptoms of autism prior to he r MMR va ccina tion in question. But he also er red in a second assumption, i.e., his understanding that Michelle's first symptoms of autism began abruptly about one week after her MMR vaccination on December 20, 1995, or within a few days there after. (Ex. 61, p. 3; Tr. 1041, 1175A-76, 1184A.) That is, Dr. Kinsbourne stated his expert repor t that 130Michell e experie nced the onset of fever on December 27, 1995, and then the very next day she \"stopped talking\" and ceased to respond to her name. (Ex. 61, p. 3.) At the evidentiar y hearing, Dr. Kinsbourne again indicated that Michelle abruptly \"fell silent,\" ceased to \"utter any words at all,\" and lost the desire to be held (Tr. 1041), althoug h he was less clear as to exactly when that occur red. At one point he indicated that it occur red within seven days of the vaccination (Tr. 1184A); at another point he seeme d to state that it occur red when Michelle's fever \"abated,\" which would have been a few days later. (Tr. 1041.) In either event, howeve r, Dr. Kinsbourne emphasized that Michel le's loss of speec h and onset of other symptoms was \"unusually abrupt\" (Tr. 1175A) and \"came on re r, a ssumption of Dr. Kinsbourne- -i.e., that Michelle suffe red an abrupt loss of words, loss of reaction to stimul i, and loss of the desire to be held, occur ring about seven days post- vaccination or within a few days there after--is not supported by the contempora neous medical records. That is, a detailed record exists of Michelle's visit to her pediatric ian on Januar y 6, 1996, which was 17 days after the MMR va ccina tion of December 20, 1995. That record contains many details about Michelle's symptoms of the previous 17 days. Specifica lly, the pediatric ian's note indicates that Michelle had a \"fever and rash last week,\" and that the fever got better but then \"spiked up\" again. (Ex. 8, p. 1.) The record further indicates that Michelle's second episode of fever \"starte d [with] cough yesterda y [Januar y 5]. Gagging to point of vomiting,\" the following morning (\"toda y\"), Michelle's tempera ture, taken at home, was 105.7 degrees. (Id.) Howeve r, despite containing all those notations about various symptoms, that pediatric ian's note makes no mention w hatsoeve r of any symptoms that would seem to be sy mptoms of autis m. The record does not mention any loss of speech or words, or that Michelle no longe r responded t o her name, or that she lost the desire to be held. Given the amount of detail in the pediatric note on that date, it seems likely that if Michelle's parents had, in fact, mentioned any such chang es in behavior , the pediatric ian would have recorded that in the note. But there is no mention of any such symptoms. Significan tly, the record of Michelle's next visit to the pediatric ian, on Marc h 15, 1996, contains a notation that Michelle \"talks less since il l in Jan[uary ].\" (Ex. 8, p. 1.) This notation is very important since, with the benef it of hindsight, it would appea r to be the first mention in the medical r ecords of symptoms of Michelle's autism. But the notation indicates only a reduction in Michelle's speech, not that she abruptly ceased to speak a ltoge ther. The notation fails to mention either a lack of reaction to her name, or a loss of the desire to be held. In fact, the record states that Michelle \"seems to hear well,\" which contradicts the asser tion that she had ceased to respond to her name. Thus, this Marc h 15 notation, indicating some type of reducti on in speec h over the two- month period since the Januar y 6 visit, is a far cry from Dr. Kinsbourne' s assumption that Michelle experience d, in late December or early Januar y, an abrupt and total loss of speec h, loss of reaction to her na me, and loss of the de sire to be he ld. I do acknow ledge that Michelle's mother, Theresa Cedillo, has provided statements at various times which offer at least some support to Dr. Kinsbourne' s assumption that Michelle's first symptoms of autism occur red suddenly , shortly after Michelle's vaccination of December 20, 1995. 131For example, in an affidavit prepa red for this litigation, Ms. Cedillo suggests that in late December of 1995 Michelle suddenly stopped talking, stopped playing, stopped responding to her name. (Ex. 54, paras. 12, 14, 21.) Howeve r, as explained above, Michelle's medical records do not support those asser tions. Further, during the evidentiar y hearing in this case Mrs. Cedillo herself acknow ledged that Miche lle's behavior chang e came on gradually over the following y ear, rathe r than abruptly after the fever episodes. (Tr. 400-01A.) And this explanation by Mrs. Cedillo at the hearing is consistent with the fact that Michelle was never taken to any doctor during the year after the pediatric visit of Marc h 15, 1996. Had there been an abrupt , drastic chang e in Michelle's behavior , Michelle's parents would not likely have waited another full year to seek further medical attention. To be sure, I do not conclude that Mrs. Cedillo was ever, in her affidavi ts or her hearing testimony , intentionally failing to tell the truth as she reme mbere d it at that time. After observing her testimony during the evidentiar y hearing, I certainly have a favor able impression of her as an honest person. It is simply the case that human memories often become less accurate with the passag e of time, espec ially with respe ct to emotionally -charged events. I conclude that the most accurate account of the progression of Michelle 's early autism symptoms comes from (1) the records made during the pediatric visits in Januar y and March of 1996, when Mrs. Cedillo's memory was fresh, and (2) the infere nces that can be draw n from the lack of any further physician visits over the following year. Cucuras v. Sec retary of HHS , 26 Cl. Ct . 537, 542 (1992).167 In sum, I conclude that Dr. Kinsbourne, in opining that the MMR vaccine contributed to the causa tion of Michelle's autism, based his opinion on another signific ant mistaken assumptio n of fact--his assumption that Michelle suddenly and abruptly lost all speec h, ceased to react to her name, and lost the desire to be held, about seven days after her MMR vaccination. To the contra ry, the overa ll record demonstrates that her family noticed symptoms of Michelle's autism gradually after the pediatr ic visit of J anuar y 6, 1996, and over the following year.168 I do note that this particular mistaken assumption by Dr. Kinsbourne does not by itself totally negate his causa tion opinion as to Michelle. That is, Dr. Kinsbourne did explain that he could still give a vaccine-c ausation opinion in an individual case, even wher e the first symptoms of autism took I note also that responde nt's expert Dr. Fombonne, who has much experience treating167 autistic children, explained that most parents of autistics repor t that the symptoms of autism appea red gradually , over a number of months. Parents usually cannot date the onset more precisely than that. (Tr. 1285A-87A.) This testimony supports my conclusion that the symptoms of Miche lle's autism, like those of other autistic children, gradually beca me more e vident over a period of months. As noted above, Dr. Kinsbourne also seeme d to rely on the assumption that Michelle's168 condition falls within the category of \"regressive autism.\" Respondent's witness Dr. Fombonne, howeve r, arg ued that Michelle should not be considered as falling into the reg ressive categ ory. It is unnece ssary , howeve r, to resolve this dispute. Whether Michelle's autism is considere d \"regressive\" or not, petitioners have failed to de monstrate that regressive autism in ge neral can be vaccine-c aused, or that Michelle's ow n autism was vac cine- cause d. 132place up to three months (or perha ps even longe r) after an MMR vaccination. (Tr. 1176-78A.) There fore, this particula r mistaken assum ption of fact is not fatal to Dr. Kinsbourne' s opinion by itself. But I mention it here because it demonstrates yet another erroneous assumption upon which Dr. Kinsbourne relied.169 4. No ev idence of brain i nflam mation Dr. Kinsbourne' s hypothesis, as previously noted, is that the persisting vaccine-stra in measles virus invaded cells in Michelle's brain, prompting an immune system response , and that the inflammation produce d by that response disorg anized critica l circuits in her brain, there by causing the autism. (Tr. 1098A-1100.) Petitioners, howeve r, failed to supply any evidenc e of brain inflammation in Michelle. To the contra ry, responde nt's expert Dr. Wiznitzer, a well-qua lified pediatric neurolog ist who has trea ted m any autistic children, testified that Michelle \"did not show any evidenc e of inflammation * * * [of] the brain on any medical testing.\" (Ex. DD, p. 2, emphasis added.) Respondent's expert Dr. Griff in noted that Michelle Cedillo's EEG result was normal, and was not characteristic of measles virus infec tion of the brain. (Tr. 2796.) And responde nt's expert Dr. Ward stated that Michelle's repeated CT scans and MRI scan showed no sign of centr al nervous system (\"CNS\") inf lammation. (Ex. BB, p. 8.) Thus, the fact that the petitioners failed to demonstrate any evidenc e of brain inflammation in Michelle adds a nother re ason to reje ct their aused. 5. Sum mary conce rning causation of the autism of Michelle Cedillo In sum, for all of the reasons stated above, I conclude that the petitioners have failed to demonstrate that the MMR vaccine received by Michelle Cedillo on December 20, 1995, contributed in any fashion to the ca usation of her autism.170 Also, Dr. Kinsbourne stated that Michelle started with diarrhea within two weeks of her169 MMR vaccination, and \"from then on,\" up \"to nt day,\" she had diarrhe a. (Tr. 1042.) This reflects a gross misunderstanding of the actua l record conce rning Michelle's gastrointestinal symptoms. As I will explain in detail below (p. 149), the medica l records demons trate that Michelle's chronic constipation began many months prior to her MMR vaccination, while her chronic diarrhea did not beg in until m ore tha n three y ears after that vacc ination. In this regard, Dr. Kinsbourne indicated that the fact that Michelle experience d both autism and chronic gastrointestinal symptoms after receiving the MMR vaccination was an important factor in his conclusion that Michelle's autism was vaccine-c aused. (Ex. 61, pp. 12-14.) Thus, the fact that Dr. Kinsbourne so grossly misunderstood the record, as to the timing of Michelle's gastrointestinal symptoms, is yet another reason to reject his conclusion t hat the MMR vaccination contributed to the ca usation of Michelle' s autism. At one point in their post-hear ing briefs, petitioners state, without further elabor ation, that170 (continued...) 133VIII PETIT IONERS HAVE NOT DEMONSTRATED EIT HER THAT THE MMR VACCIN E CAN CAUSE CHRONIC G ASTROINTE STINAL DYSF UNCTION, OR THAT AN MMR VACCIN CAUSE CHRONIC G ASTROINTE STINAL PROBLEMS IN MICHELL E In this case, the petitioners have contende d, as a general matter, that the strain of the measles virus contained in the MMR vaccine sometimes persists in the gastrointestinal tissue of children, causing chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction. They also contend that Michelle Cedillo herse lf rs from such condit ion. I conclude, howeve r, that the petitioners have failed to demonstrate, to the level of \"more probable than not,\" either that the MMR vaccine can cause chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction in general, or that an MMR vaccination did cause chronic gastrointestinal problems in Michelle. A. Backgroun d inform ation concernin g the hu man gastroi al system The following backg round informa tion concer ning the human g astrointestinal sy stem may be helpful in understanding my discussion of the petitioners' allegations conce rning \"gastrointestinal dysfunction.\" The the stomach (\"gaster\" ) and the intestines. (Dorland's at 756, 759.) Howeve r, the term \"gastrointestinal tract\" is used to refer to the entire system for digesting and voiding food, extending from the mouth to the anus. (This tract is also known as the \"digestive tract.\") It appea rs that the petitioners and their experts at times used the terms \"gastrointestinal dysfunction\" or \"gastrointestinal symptoms\" to refer to any type of problematic sy mptoms i nvolving the dig estion and def ecation functions. I will use those t erms in the same way. The pa rties and e xperts at times have used \"GI\" as short for \"gastrointestinal,\" and I will also do so at times. Once food is taken into the mouth and swallowed, it passes down throug h four major components of the gastrointestinal tract--the esophag us (a long tube from the mouth to the stomach), the stomach, the small intestine, and the large intestine--be fore being voided as stool. (Tr. 2099- 2103A; R. Trial Ex. 15, p. 1.) The insides of those four components are lined with soft tissue, which can become inflamed for any of a number of reasons. (Tr. 2088A-89.) I will use the term (...continued)170 \"if the specia l master finds that Michelle was autistic befor e her MMR vaccine, he may certainly also find that the vaccine signific antly aggravated an under lying c ondition.\" (P3, p. 14.) I have found, as noted a bove, that Miche lle likely was autistic prior to he r MMR vaccina tion. (See pp. 127-130 above.) Howeve r, in the record of this case I find no persuasive evidenc e that the MMR vaccine played any role in \"a ggravating\" her a utism. I ndeed, Dr. Kinsbourne himself stated t hat if a child was \"showing evidenc e of an emer ging autistic disorder befor ehand [i.e., prior to vaccination] , then I would causation to a vaccination.\" ( Snyder Tr. 536A- 536B.) Thus, there is simply no expert testimony that would support an \"a ggravation\" contention. 134\"gastrointestinal inflammation\" to refer to inflammation anywher e in those four components. The term \"intestinal inflammation,\" on the other hand, will refer more narrowly to inflammation within the large and small intestines. The terms \"bowe l\" and \"gut\" were often used, by the expert witnesses and in the medica l literature, to r efer to the intestines. ( Dorland's at 244, 804.) As will be discussed in detail below, the petitioners have alleg ed that Michelle Cedillo suffe rs from chronic gastroint estinal inflammation. Their expert has opined that Michelle has suffe red from \"inflammator y bowel disea se,\" \" Crohn's disease ,\" and \" enter ocolitis.\" \"Inflammatory bowel disease,\" also known as IBD, is a term that encompa sses a number of disorders involving chronic inflammation of the human digestive tract. (Tr. 428, 2088A; Dorland's at 536.) Although a number of disorders involving chronic inflammation of the digestive tract can fit within the category of IBD, the two most common disorders are Crohn's disease and ulcer ative colitis. (Tr. 428, 2089.) \"Crohn's disease\" is a particula r type of chronic inflammatory condition, which can involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract, but most c ommonly involves the terminal ileum, a pa rt of the small intestine. (Tr. 430A-31A , 2091A-92A; Dorland's at 531.) \"Enter ocolitis\" means inflammation of both the large intestine (the main part of which is known as the colon) and the small intestine. (Tr. 422, 2092.) I also note that the suffix \"-itis\" means inflammation, so that \"esopha gitis\" means inflamm ation of the esophagus, \"gastritis\" means stomach inflammation, etc. The experts have also discussed two types of conditions that have been found in Michelle's intestines. The first condition is \"lymphoid \"LNH.\" The experts explained that the lymphoid tissue in the lining of the digestive tract is formed into \"lymph nodes\" or \"nodules,\" and when those nodules become enlar ged, the condition is known as LNH. 2150A.) iptions of ex aminations of the intestines, re fer to the prese nce of LNH. The second condition is \"aphthous ulcer s,\" also known as \"aphthous ulcer ations,\" which occur in the lining of the gastrointestinal tract. One of responde nt's experts explained that the term refers to a type of tissue erosion that can occur anywher e in the digestive tract. (Tr. 2120.) He testified that common \"cold sores\" or \"canker sores,\" which people often experience in their mouths, are a type of aphthous ulcer , and that aphthous ulcer s in the intestines are simil ar. (Tr. 2120, 2126- 27.) The experts differ regarding the signifi cance of both LNH and aphthous ulcer s, both in general and in Michelle's case. Respo ndent's experts view those conditions as common and not suggestive of inflammation, while petitioners' expert argues that they are signs of inflammation in Michelle's intestines. Tha t issue will be addre ssed below. 135 B. Petition ers' e vidence conce the issue Dr. Arthur Krigsman, a pediatric gastroente rolog ist, who filed an expert repor t (Ex. 59), and testified orally at the evidentiar y hearing (Tr. 408-574). In his expert repor t, Dr. Krigsman stated the opinion that Michelle's chronic gastrointestinal problems have been cause d by her MMR vaccination. (Ex. 59, pp. 7-9. ) He wrote that the \"most compelling factor\"171 supporting that opinion \"is the simple chronolog y of events\" --i.e., the fact that, as he understood the Michelle's c hronic g and have c ontinued since that time. ( Id. at 6.) Dr. Krigsman further noted, in his expert repor t, that he was relying on the \"patter n of bowel inflammation\" in children with both autism and gastrointest inal complaints, the pattern first repor ted in the 1998 Wakefield article . (Id. at 7-8.) He wrote that such pattern was supported by the Unig enetics testing and the Walker study discussed above. (Id. at 7; see my discussion of the172 Unig enetics testing and the Walker study at pp. 42-44, 64-65 above.) He opined that Michelle's case fits tha t pattern, stating that her condition is a \"classic\" case of the \"ASD-G I disease\" pattern. (Id. at 8.) In his hearing testimony , Dr. Krigsman further explained his opinion. He stated the view that wher e a labora tory test finds evidenc e of measles virus in the gastrointestinal system of an autistic173 child who has experience d GI inflammation, the measle s virus is the likely cause of that GI inflammation. (Tr. 488A, line 13, throug h 489A, line 6.) As a basis for that opinion, Dr. Krigsman pointed to the finding by the Unig enetics lab of \"mea sles virus genome in the inflamed guts of autistic children who had bowel symptoms\" (Tr. 489A, lines 10-21), combined with a \"pattern of inflammation\" in the bowels of these children \"consistent with viral infec tion,\" and finding s of \"lymphoid hyperpla sia\" (Tr. 489A, lines 22 throug h 490, line 3). He further opined t hat Miche lle Cedillo's own gastrointestinal condition, which he usually descr ibed as \"enterocolitis\" or \"inflammatory bowel disease,\" falls into this pattern, and is, there fore, likely to be the result of the vaccine-stra in me asles virus which he be lieves to be pe rsisting in her body . (Tr. 489A, lines 1-6.) Ex. 59 was not paginated as originally submitt ed by Dr. Krigsman. Accordingly, I will171 refer to the electronic pagination in the upper- right-hand corne r, according to which the first pag e of his text is pag inated as 2, the last pag e as 9. Dr. Kr igsma n cited the a the Unig page 488A, line 24, the transcr ipt contains the word \"ileo\". From the context, I173 conclude that Dr. Krigsman actua lly said \"ileal,\" which is the adjec tival form of the word \"ileum,\" a par t of the small intestine. 136C. Respondent 's evidence Concerning the petitioners' alleg ations about gastrointestinal dysfunction, responde nt relied primarily on the evidenc e supplied by four experts, Drs. Hana uer, Griff in, Gershon, and MacD onald. 1. Dr. Hanau er Respondent's primary witness offered in response to Dr. Krigsman's testimony was Dr. Stephen B. Hana uer, a gastroenterolog ist. Dr. Hana uer provided both a written expert repor t (Ex. X) and hearing testimony (Tr. 2076-2200). He provided an ex tensive analysis of Michelle's own ca se, in which he detailed his disag reements with Dr. Krig sman's opinion. He we nt in detail throug h the medical records of the examinations of Michelle's gastrointestinal system, specific ally of her multipl e endoscopie s and biopsies, pointing out how the results of those examinations are inconsistent with Dr. Krigsman's conclusions. (Tr. 2108A-43.) Dr. Hana uer also made it clear that he disag rees completely with Dr. Krigsman's general opinion that the MMR vaccine can cause chronic gastrointestinal dy sfunction by persisting in a child's body . I will discuss the specifics of Dr. Hana uer's analy sis of Dr. and of Miche lle's spec ific ca se, below. 2. Dr. Griffin Respondent's expert Dr. Diane Griffin, as noted above (pp. 108-09), has extensive experience conce rning the m easle s virus. Her expert report, while largely devoted to other matters, did offer brief instruction conce rning the topic of whether the MMR vaccine can cause chronic GI symptoms. Dr. Griff in noted that while the measles virus sometimes does invade the GI system (\"gut lymphoid tissue\"--E x. V at 2), it \"does not usually cause gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., diarrhe a or constipation)\" (Ex. V at 2; see also Tr. 2864-65). I note that Michelle Cedillo's most prominent chronic gastrointestinal mptoms were diar rhea constipation. 3. Dr. Respondent filed a written repor t of Dr. Michae l Gershon, a medical doctor specia lizing in neurogastroenterology, addressing the issue of the causation of Michelle's gastro intestinal symptoms. (Ex. T.) His analy sis concerning Michelle's gastrointestinal symptoms is simil ar to that of Dr. Hana uer. (Id. at pp. 13-15, 20-22.) Like Dr. Hana uer, Dr. Gershon, after revie wing Michelle's medical records, found that Dr. Krigsman was not justified in concluding that Michelle suffe red from chronic GI inflammation . Dr. Gershon conclude d, contra ry to Dr. Krigsman's view, that there exists no significant evidenc e that MMR vaccination leads to inflammatory bowel dis ease (\"IBD\"), and that there exists \"no evidenc e that MMR cause d Michelle Cedillo to a gastrointestinal illness.\" ( Id. at 22.) 137Dr. Gershon di d not testify during any hearing, so his opinion is of lesser importance than that of Dr. Hana uer, but Dr. Gershon's opini on does add additional support to the conclusion that I have r eached. 4. Dr. MacDonald Dr. MacD onald, a Ph.D. immunologi st who specia lizes in the gastrointestinal immune system, testified in the Hazlehurst case that there is no valid evidenc e to support the \"autistic enter ocolitis\" causa tion theor y upon which known as \"LNH,\" a condition of the lining of the intestines, which Dr. Krigsman found to be indicative of intestinal inflammation. Dr. MacD onald explained that LNH does not indicate intestinal inflammation, and is not an a bnormal finding in children. ( Id. at 616A-19.) D. Experience and background of the experts One important factor, which influence d my analy sis conce rning this issue, is the experience and credentials of the experts who prese nted evidenc vaccine-strai n measles virus. The petitioners' expert, Dr. Krigsman, does have important credentials relevant to this issue. He is a board- certified pediat ric gastroente rologist, and he has practiced pediatric s or gastroente rolog y since 1995, when he completed his g astroente rolog y fellowship. (Tr . 409; Ex . 60.) Howeve r, there are problems wit h Dr. Krigsma n's practice history and his resume tha t are relevant to the cr edibility of his expert opinion given in this case. Dr. Kr igsma n, afte r working as an attending physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New Yor k from 2000 to 2004, left that hospital's employ under questionable circumstances. (Tr. 499A-500, 558-560.) According to Dr. Krigsman's own testimony , the hospital restric ted his privileg es to perform endoscopie s (an invasive proce dure with some risks) in the belief that Dr. Krigsman was performing medically unwar rante d endoscopie s on children f or research purpose s. Dr. Krigsman later joined a medical practice in Texas, with the same Dr. Andre w Wakefield whose 1998 article initiated the theory that the MMR vaccine can cause autism and GI symptoms. (Tr. 491-92A.) In 2005 Dr. Krigsman was fined $5,000 by the Texas State Board of Medica l Examiners, appar ently in pa rt bec ause the website of tha t medical pra ctice had represente d that he was available to see patients at a time when he was not yet licensed to practice medicine in that state; in part because of his \"disciplinary action\" by the Lenox Hill Hospital; and in part because of his \"falsification\" and \"attempted conce alment\" of a prior disciplinary action by the Florida medical board. ( Tr. 501-503; R. Trial Ex. 2, p. 2--\"A pplicant #391.\") There also were questions vitae (\"C.V.\" petitioners introduced into this proce stated that he was an \"Assistant Clini cal Professor\" at the New York University Medica l School (Ex. 60, p. 3), but Dr. Krigsman acknow ledged on 138cross-e xamination that he has never taught a class there (Tr. 503). His C.V. also listed four items under the heading of \"Publications\" (Ex. 60, p. 4), but on cross-e xamination Dr. Krigsman acknow ledged that only one of the four items re prese nted an a ctual publication (Tr . 504-06). On the other hand, the witnesses upon whom responde nt relies, conce rning this issue, have very impressive backg rounds. Dr. Hana uer is board- certified in both gastroente rolog y and internal medicine. (Tr. 2078A; Ex. Y, p. 1.) He is a Professor of Medi cine at the University of Chicag o, wher e he is the chief of the gastroente rology section. (Tr. 2077A; Ex. Y, p. 1.) His section sees about 6,000 patients per year, and he himself maintains an active clinical gastroente rolog y practice, performing about 12 or more colonoscopies each week. (Tr. 2082-83.) Within the field of gastroente rolog y, Dr. Hana uer subspecializes in an area extremely pertinent here, the area of gastrointestinal inflammation, or IBD. (Tr. 2079A.) He chair ed the Interna tional Organization for Inflammatory Bowel Disease , and also chair ed the Infections, Immunology, and Inflamma tory Bow el Disease section of the American Gastroenter ology Association. (Tr. 2079A; Ex. Y at 2.) For the past 14 y ears, he has be en the Co-Direc tor of the Inflammatory Bow el Disease Resear ch Center at the University of Chicag o. (Tr. 2085.) He has serve d as editor-in-c hief of a publication known as the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Monitor , as a section editor of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Journal , and as a member of the editorial board of twelve medical journals. (Tr. 2083-84; Ex. Y at 3.) Dr. Hana uer has published more than 280 article s related to gastrointestinal issues, virtually all related to GI inflammation, and has also published over 70 medical book c hapter s. (Tr. 2083; Ex. Y, pp. 4-31.) Respondent's expert Dr. Griff in, as previously noted, has studied the measles virus for more than 30 years. (Tr. 2743-48.) She is a medical doctor specia lizing in molecular biology , immunology , and virolog y. (Tr. 2739A-41.) She is the chair of the Depa rtment of Molecular Microbiolog y and I mmunology at the John Hopkins S chool of Public Hea lth. (Tr. 2740-41.) She has been an editor or editorial board member of a number of scientific journals relating to virolog y. (Tr. 2742A-43A; Ex. F, p. 5.) She has written many book chapters and edited sever al textbooks conce rning virolog y, and published more than 240 research article s in scientific journals. (Ex. F, pp. 18-37; Tr. 2746.) Even one of s virus. (Tr. 851A.) Respondent's third expert in this area, Dr. Gershon, also has impressive c redentials. He is a medical doctor specia lizing in neuro gastroenterology , and has studied immunology and bowel disorders since obtaining his medical degree in 1963. (Ex. T, p. 1.) He has authored nearly 350 scientific article s and book chapte rs, as well as a book conce rning bowel function. (Ex. T, p. 2; Ex. U, pp. 4-31.) He has serve d on editorial boards of scientific journals, including the journal Gastroenterology . (Ex. T, p. 2.) He is a faculty member a t Columbi a University medical school, wher e he recently stepped down after serving as chair of that school's Depa rtment of Anatomy and Cell Biolog y. (Ex. T, p. 1.) Finally , respo ndent's fourth expert, Dr. MacDonald, has excellent credentials as well. As noted above, Dr. MacD onald is a Ph.D. immunologist who, during a medical research career of more 139than 30 years, has specia lized in the immunology of the human gut (intestines). (Hazlehurst Ex. A, p. 1; Hazlehurst Tr. at 603-07A.) He is a Professor of Immunology and Dean for Research at the medical school of the University of London. (Hazlehurst Ex. A, p. 1; Hazlehurst Tr. at 603-04A.) He stated that he has had \"a particula r interest in the lymphoid tissue of the human gut\" (Hazlehurst Ex. A, p. 1), which is the tissue involved in Dr. Krigsman's alleg ation of inflammation in Michelle Cedillo. He has published at least 158 article s conce rning gut immunolog y, written a book on that topic, edited sever al other such books, written many book chapte rs, and serve d in editorial positions on a number of medica l journals. ( Hazlehurst Tr. 607A- 09A.) Thus, as was the case with the issues of the validity of the Unig eneti cs testing and the causa tion of autism , I again see a very signific ant differ ence, in the backg rounds of the parties' experts r eleva nt to this gastrointestinal dysfunction causa tion issue. One differ ence is the that Krigsman specia lizes in gastroente rolog y, rathe r than general gastroente rolog y, so that in that one respect Dr. Krigsman does have an edge over the responde nt's primary expert, Dr. Hana uer, a gastroente rolog who does not specia lize in pediatric gastroente rolog y. In other respe cts, howeve r, there is a vast differ ence in responde nt's favor , as is made clear by the descr iption of the experts' credentials above. Concerning the area of gastrointestinal inflammation , Dr. Hana uer has far more expertise than Dr. Krigsman. Dr. Griff in has much more expertise than Dr. Krigsman conce rning the measles virus . All four of responde nt's experts have much longe r experience in their fields than does Dr. Krigsman in his. All four have high- ranking academic positions at prestig ious universities, and have published very extensively , in contra st to Dr. Krigsman's single actual medical publication. This very substantial differ ence in backg round and experience level, then, combined with the problems with Dr. Krigsman's practice history and resume detailed on pp. 138-39 above, is one factor leading to my conclusion that the responde nt has prese nted a far more persua conce rning causation issue. E. An alysis concerning th e petitioners' general theory that th e MMR vacc inati on can cause chronic gastroin testinal dysfunction After considering the evidenc e offered by Dr. Krigsman, along with the evidenc e offered by the responde nt in response , I conclude that the petitioners have failed to demonstrate that it is \"more probable than not\" that the MMR vaccination can cause chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction. I found Dr. Krigsman's testimony to be quite unpersua sive, and to be substantially outweig hed by the testimony of the responde nt's experts, espec ially that of Dr. Hana uer. There are a number of reasons for this conc lusion. 1401. Dr. Krigsm ption concernin g Krigsman's entire general causa tion was based upon an erroneous assumption conce rning the reliability of the Unig enetics testing. Dr. Krigsman, in essenc e, based his general causation opinion on the foll owing chain of reasoning: (1) The Uhlmann s tudy performed by the Unig enetics labora tory, along with the Walker study, has demonstrated that the vaccine-stra in measles virus often persists in the intestinal tissue of children with autism and chronic gastrointestinal problems. (2) It is likely that a persist ing measles virus would cause chronic GI inflammation , in turn causing chronic symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhe a, and constipation. (3) The refore, if a child has bee n shown by a labor atory test to have a persisting measles infe ction in the GI tract after MMR vaccination, and has shown evidenc e of chronic inflammation and other chronic GI symptoms, and the chronic GI symptoms appea red within six months after an MMR vaccination, then it is reasonable to conclude that the chronic GI inflammation and other symptoms were caused , at least in signific ant part, by the MMR vaccination that introduced the measles virus into the body . (Ex. 59 at 7-9; Tr. 488A-90, 536A.) Thus, Dr. Krigsman made it clear that both his general causation opinion, as well as his specific causa tion opinion in any case, depende d upon the assumption of the reliability of the Unig enetics testing for the prese nce of meas les virus. Dr. Krigsman is, in fact, relying on the Unig enetics testing in two differ ent ways. First, in forming his general causation theory , he relied upon the general accuracy of the Uhlmann study . Second, in forming his specific causation conclusion in a particula r case, he would depend upon the reliability of the specific labora tory test, again performed by Unig enetics, that alleg edly found the presence of the measles virus in that person' s intestinal tis sue. Howeve r, for the reasons set forth above (pp. 41-78), I have conclude d that the Unig enetics testing for measles virus, in both the Uhlmann study and in the subsequent testing of individuals such as Michelle Cedillo, was not reliable. There fore, Dr. Krigsman's entire approa to general174 causa tion simply has no proba tive value, because it is based upon the incorrect assumption of the reliability of the Unig enetics te sting. 2. Dr. Krigsm an's theory lacks support, an d is based upon t he heavily-c riticized \"autis tic enterocolitis\" th eory of Dr. Wakefie above, Dr. Krigsman based his g eneral causa tion opinion on the reliability of the Uhlmann study 's general conclusion that children with both developmenta l disorders and gastrointestinal problems are often infec ted with measles virus in their intestines, while Dr. Krigsman also relied on the ongoing Walker study , in which he is one of the174 participa ting researchers, as supportive of the results of the Uhlmann study . Howeve r, I have already explained (p. 64-65 above) why I find that the \"preliminary data\" from the Walker study cannot be given any evidentiar y weig ht. 141developmenta lly normal children with GI problems are rarely so infec ted. Howeve r, as previously discussed, I have conclude d that the Uhlmann study was unreliable . There fore, with the Uhlmann study discredited, Dr. Krigsman' s general causation theory is simply left wi thout any evidentiar y support. Dr. Krigsma n has not pointed to any other possible basis for his theory. For instance , Dr. Krigsman did not point to examples in medical hist ory of any type of virus pe rsisting in intestinal tissue and causing chronic GI symptoms. To the contra ry, Dr. Hana uer, an expert well-qua lified conce rning GI inflammation, testified that he is unawa re of any examples of viral persistenc e in intestinal tiss ue ca using chronic inflammation. (Tr. 2093, 2161A.) Ne ither Dr. K rigsman nor any xpert for petitioners contra dicted Dr . Hana uer on this point. Moreove r, in constructing his general causa tion theory , Dr. Krigsman clearly based his theory on the \"autistic enter ocolitis\" theory that evolved from Dr. Wakefield's seminal 1998 article mentioned above. In his expert repor t, Dr. Krigsman indicated that he sees a causa l connec tion betwee n the MMR vaccine and a disease category that he descr ibed as \"autistic enter ocolitis.\" (Ex. 59, p. 7.) And at the evidentiar y hearing, Dr. Krigsman again used the term \"autistic enter ocolitis\" to descr ibe the disease category that he believes to be MMR-cause d. (Tr. 515, 519A, 523-24A.) Indeed, Dr. Krigsman's use of the term \"autistic enter ocolitis,\" along with his asser tion that Michelle Cedillo's illness is a \"classic\" case of \"ASD-G I disease,\" perha ps might create the impression that \"autistic enter ocolitis\" is a recognized disease category, accepted by the medical community . That, howeve r, is not the case . To the contra ry, Dr. Ha nauer , very experience d in the specific area of infla mmatory bowel disorders, testified that the term \"autistic enter ocolitis\" is not utiliz ed in any gastrointestinal textbook of which he is aware. (Tr. 2143.) Simi larly, Dr. Gershon stated that both the terms \"autistic enter ocolitis\" and \"ASD-G I\" are not recognized by \"gastroente rolog ists as a scientific community .\" (Ex. T, p. 16.) Dr. Fombonne and Dr. MacD onald both testified that there exists no evidenc e to support such a diagnostic category. (Tr. 1416, 1423A-24A; Hazlehurst Tr. 662-63.) And Dr. Krigsman himself admitted that two leading textbooks on gastroente rology, which he acknow ledges to be authoritative, do not use the terms \"autistic enterocolitis\" or \"ASD-GI .\" (Tr. 522A-25A.) Thus, it is clear that the diagnostic category of \"autistic enter ocolitis,\" develope d by Dr. Wakef ield and adopte d Kr igsma n, is not a medica lly-recognized categ ory. In fact, the record indicates that the term \"autistic enter ocolitis\" evolved from Dr. Wakefield's above- mentioned 1998 article ; the term appea rs in sever al article s published over the following years by Dr. Wakefield and a small group of his followers. (Ex. T, p. 16; Hazlehurst Tr. 634A.) One such article using the term \"autistic enter ocolitis\" was published in 2000 by 142Wakefield and colleag ues. (Ex. 61, Tab NNN, p. 13.) And it is clear that Dr. Krigsman, in175 developing his causation theory , was influence d by those article s. For example, Dr. Krigsman testified that his initial idea, that autistic children with gastrointestinal symptoms might be suffe ring from I BD, was trig gered when he read that very Wakefield 2000 a rticle. (Tr. 415- 16A.)176 Given that Dr. Krigsman's general causa tion theory was influence d by the \"autisti c enter ocolitis\" theory develope d by Dr. Wakefield and colleag ues, it is fair to note that Dr. Wakefield's \"autistic enter ocolitis\" theory, and his credibilit y in developing the theory , have come under sever e criticism. For example, see the discussion at pp. 123-25 above conce rning various committees of medical experts who have considere d and rejected Dr. Wakefield's causa tion theory . Further, responde nt's experts in this case provided much testimony relevant to the credibilit y of Dr. Wake field's proc edure s in developing his theory . For example, Nicholas Chadwick in 1996 was a Ph.D. student working in a London labora tory for Dr. Wakefield, performing PCR testing for measles (Tr. 2283-84; which was collabora ting with Wakefield in the area of measles detec tion, convince d Chadwick that Kawa shima's positive results in measles virus testing were \"false positives,\" the result of contamination. (Tr. 2286-87; Ex. QQ, paras. 10-11.) Chadwick related that conclusion to Dr. Wakefie para. 11, Tr . 2287.) Neve rtheless, Wakefield submitt ed for publication a manuscript relying on the purportedly positive results from Ka washima's PCR testing. (Tr . 2290A; Ex. QQ, para. 14.) Chadwick asked t hat hi s own name be taken off the manuscript, because he was not comforta ble with the data. (Tr. 2290A.) Dr. MacD onald descr ibed the Wakefield \"deception\" (Hazlehurst Tr. 646A), in two respe cts. He opined that the article delibera tely descr ibed normal finding s in the intestines of the autistic children as \"patholog y\"--i.e., abnorma lity indicative of disease- -in order to create the false impression that the autistic children had much more intestinal patholog y than the non-autistic children in the study . (Id. at 644-46A.) Dr. MacD onald also testified that the article misrepre a photog raph of a child's c ecum ( a par t of the large intestine) as being a photogra ph of the c hild's ileum (a part of the small intestine). (Id. at 647A-48A.) He opined that it was \"highly unlikely \" that this mi srepr esenta tion was a mistake, a s opposed to delibera te dec eption. ( Id. at 648A.) Andre w Wakefield et al., Enterocolitis in Children with Developmental Disorders , 95 AM.175 J. GASTROENTEROLOGY 2285 (2000). ( Ex. 61, Tab NN N.) Dr. Krigsman testified that the article that triggered his interest was \"written by Professor176 John Walker Smit h, among st others\" (Tr. 415), and was published in September of 2000 in the Americ an Journal of Gastroe nterolog y. (Tr. 416A.) The Wakefield 2000 article mentioned above was, in fact, published in the September 2000 edition of that journal, and included John Walker- Smit h as a c o-author. 143Dr. Rima descr ibed an interac tion with Dr. Wakefield, in which he informed Dr. Wakefield of a specific contamination error in Wakefield's measles detec tion efforts. Dr. Wakefield, howeve r, retra ct his claim that measles ma terial ha d been ide ntified. ( Snyder Tr. 843A- 46A.) Further, as noted above, after public criticism of the \"autistic enter ocoli tis\" theory, ten of Wakefield's twelve co-authors on the original 1998 article published a letter in which they formally \"retract[ed]\" the ca usation (Ex. T, Att. 125.) At177 the same time, the British medical journal that published the 1998 article , the Lancet , revie wed alleg ations of impropriety by Dr. Wakefield and his co-authors in the submissi on of the article . (Snyder Ex. O.) The Lancet editors noted that some of the children descr ibed in the article were also part of the legal action against the vaccine manufa cture rs, in which Dr. Wakefield was also involved. (Id. at 1.) The editors conclude d that this circumstance constituted a financ ial conflict of interest by Wakefield, whic h Wakefield should have disclosed to the Lancet , but did not. ( Id. at 2.) Dr. MacD onald, indeed, went so far as to opine that Dr. Wakefield's \"autistic enter ocolitis\" theory was mere ly an \"invention\" created for litigation purposes. (Hazlehurst Tr. 662A.) Simi larly, Dr. Rust summarized Wakefield's proce ss of developing and disseminating his general theory , and descr ibed 06A.)178 To be sure, the petitioners in this case have stressed that they rely upon Dr. Krigsman as their expert conce rning the causa tion of GI symptoms, not Dr. Wakefield. Thus, they argue that criticisms of the personal integrity of Dr. Wakefield are not relevant here. Howeve r, because Dr. Krigsman's general causa tion approa ch clearly was strong ly influence d by Dr. Wakefield's theory , criticisms of Dr. Wakefield's \"autistic enter ocolitis\" theory are relevant, and criticisms relating to Dr. Wakefield's credibilit y in developing that theory are of relevance as well. There fore, it is a noteworthy point that not only has that \"autistic enter ocolitis\" theory not been accepted into gastroente rolog y textbooks, but that theory , and Dr. Wakefield's role in its development, have been strong ly criticized as constituting def ective or fraudulent scienc e.179 Simon H. Murch et al., Retraction of an Interpretation (Letter) 363 LANCET 750 (2004). 177 (Ex. P , Att. 114.) Respondent's counsel submitt ed Respondent's Trial Exhibit 7, representing that the178 document wa s a copy of a pa tent application filed by Dr. Wakef ield for a new ty pe of monova lent (mea sles only) measles vaccine. Respondent's counsel suggested that this demonstrated that Wakefield had a financ ial incentive to discredit the MMR vaccine, so that a marke t would be created for his new measles vaccine. (Tr. 1207.) The document does appea r to be a part of a patent application submitted by Dr. Wakef ield, but the document does not indicate precisely what patent Dr. Wakefield sought. From the document, I cannot deter mine if the patent was for a measles vaccine, or something else. According ly, I have disregarded that trial exhibi t and responde nt's representa tion as to its relevanc e. I note also that prior to his 1998 article initiating the theory that the MMR vaccine can179 (continued...) 144Finally , as explained the other causa tion theories of petitioners, I stress that I am not automatically rejecting Dr. Krigsman's causa tion theory simply because it has not met with widespre ad medical acceptanc e. At times novel theories can be persua sive. Howeve r, it is the petitioners' burden to demonstrate that there is sufficie nt supportive evidenc e to justify the adoption of a proff ered new theory. In this situation, Dr. Krigsman has failed to point to any persua sive evidenc e for his theory on was cont radicted by D r. Griffin's testim ony. Next, I note that Dr. Krigsman's opi nion also was contr adicted by another of re spondent's experts, Dr. Diane Griffin. As previously noted, Dr. G riffin ha s excellent cre dentials as an expert conce rning the measl es virus. In her expert repor t, Dr. Griff in noted that while the measles virus sometimes does invade the GI system (\"gut lymphoid tissue\"--E x. V at 2), it \"does not usually cause gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., diarrhe a or constipation)\" (id., emphasis added) . This opinion obviously contra dicts Dr. Kr igsma n's view that the MMR vac cine should be considere d the likely cause of chr onic GI symptoms i n autistic children. 4. Dr. Krigsm an's general lack of cre dibilit y as a witness As explained above, Dr. Krigsman based his general causa tion theory square ly upon the Wakefield article and the Uhlmann study , which have been shown to be unreliable , and pointed to no other evidentiar y support for his general theory . Thus, the only rema ining support for Dr. Krigsman's gene ral theory is whateve r gene ral credibility he person ally has as an ex pert witness. Howeve r, I did not find Dr. Krigsman to be an expert upon whom I could reasonably rely for sound opinion and judgme nt. There are sever al reasons for this conclusion conce rning Dr. Krigsman. First, I note the problems concern ing Dr. Krigsman's practice history and resume, set forth above at pp. 138-39. Second, I note that Dr. Krigsman's testimony concerning Miche lle's own case put his general reliability as an expert into a poor light. As explained below at pp. 149-50, Dr. Krigsman based his testimony conce rning Michelle's case on a grossly mistaken assum ption as to the history of (...continued)179 cause the combination of autism and gastrointestinal disorders, during much of the 1990s Dr. Wakefield had advoca ted a theory that the MMR va ccine cause d Crohn's dise ase and/or other inflammatory bowel dis eases. (E.g., Hazlehurst Tr. 629A-33A; Ex. BB, p. 10; Ex. BB, Att. 89.) Howeve r, whe n that theory was e xamined by other scientists, it was not confirme d. One r esearch group demonstrated a flaw in Wakefield's testing proce dures measles virus. (Hazlehurst Tr. 631A-32A; 10; E x. B, Att. 45, pp. 167-68.) Further, sever al research groups published studies indicating that, contra ry to Wakefield's claims, measles virus was not present in the gastrointestinal tissue of Crohn's patients. (Hazlehurst Tr. Resear ch Council revie wed that theory of Dr. Wakefield, and issued a repor t pointing out problems with the theory . (Hazlehurst Tr. 631A.) Thus, the theory was \"largely dismiss ed\" by the medical c ommunity . (Ex. BB, p. 10.) 145Michel opinion conce rning Michelle's case either without examining Michelle's medical records at all, or after badly misreadin g those records. Either way, such a mistake reflects poorly on the general reliability of his expert opinion. Similarly, Dr. Krigsman's reliability as an expert witness was also damag ed by his application of his general causa tion theory to Michelle's case. That is, while his stated theory involves chronic intestinal inflammation cause d by a persisting measles virus, he applied his theory to an individual case--Miche lle Cedillo--in which there exists no persua sive evidenc e of chronic intestinal inflammation , as opposed to other, noninflammat ory, GI symptoms. I note that, in Dr. Krigsman's view, Michelle has suffe red for many years, beginning about three weeks after MMR vaccination, from chronic intestinal inflammation --i.e., chronic \"ente rocolitis,\" which means inflammation of both her large and small intestines--ca used by a persisting measles virus infec tion. (E.g., Ex. 59, p. 7; Tr. 489A.) Howeve r, on the issue of whether Michelle in fact has suffe red from any form of chronic intestinal inflammation , I found that Dr. Krigsman's testimony was quite unpersua sive, and was substantially outweig hed by a combi nation of the medical records and the testimony of Dr. Hanau er and responde nt's other experts. Dr. Hana uer spent considera ble time during his hearing testimony pointing out in detail how the results of Michelle' s gastrointestinal examinations were inconsistent with Dr. Krigsman's conclusion that Mich elle has suffe red from chronic intestinal inflammation since her vaccination. (Tr. 2108A-43.) I have set forth a full discussion of the evidenc e conce rning the issue of alleg ed intesti nal inflammation at pp. 150-61, below. The general point here, howeve r, is that while Dr. Krigsman stated a general theory involving intestinal inflammation (\"enteroc olitis \"), in practice he seems to be willing to apply his theory to a case with no persua sive evidenc e of intestinal inflammation. He seems willing to apply his the ory to any case involving any type of chronic GI symptoms, whether those symptoms involve evidenc e of intestinal inflammation or not. In my view, this a dds further reason to doubt Dr. Krigsman's180 general credibilit y as a witness, and, there fore, to doubt the validity of his general theory that the MMR vaccine can c ontribute to the ca usation of chr onic GI symptoms. 5. Epidem iologic contradict petition ers' theory . As descr ibed above, there have been many epidemiolog ic studies that have considere d the issue of whether the MMR vaccine is associate d with autism . In contra st, there have been only a few studies that are relevant to the issue of whether the MMR vaccine is associate d with gastrointesti nal disorders . But those few studies do affor d some evidenc e relevant to the general issue of whether the MMR vacc ine ca uses g astrointestinal dy sfunction. Dr. Krigsman seems highly inclined to diagnose the presence of gastrointestinal180 inflammation on the basis of almost any chronic GI symptoms. For example, he diagnosed Michelle with \"inflammatory bowel disease\" in July of 2003, befor e he had even met and examined her. (Ex. 28, p. 84; Tr. 515.) 146First, three epidemiolog ic studies compar ed child ren with regressive autism to those with nonregressive autism. If, as petitioners theorize, the MMR vaccine cause s chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory disorder s in children with regressive autism, one would expect to see more chronic inflammatory GI disorders in the r egressives. B ut that was not found in the studies. In two of the studies, there were no more chronic gastrointestinal symptoms in the children with regression than in the nonreg ressive c hildren. (Ex. P, Att. 112; Ex. P, Att. 60; Tr. 2572.) I n the third study , the181 regressives did experience somewhat more chronic GI symptoms , such as chronic diarrhe a, but did not experience more chronic GI \"disorder s,\" a category that included Crohn's disease and colitis. 182 (Ex. BB, A tt. 124, pp. 11-12.) Second, one study found no temporal association betwee n MMR vaccination and the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms in children with autism. (Ex. P, Att. 12.) If petitioners' theory were183 correct, one would expect to see GI symptoms often having their onset soon after MMR vaccination, but that was not the ca se in this study . Finally , another study looked at the incidence of gastrointestinal problems in British children over long periods of time, both befor e and after the introduction of the MMR vaccination in Britain. It concluded that, after the introduction of the MMR vaccination, there was no increase in the percentag e of autistic children who suffe red from GI symptoms. (Tr. 2565A ; Ex. P, Att. 146.) 184 That result, once again, is contra ry to what one would expect if the MMR vaccine were causing gastrointestinal symptoms in autistic children; if that were the case, one would expect the percentag e of autistic children with GI sympto ms to have increased after the introduction of the MMR vaccination. In sum, there are only a few epidemiolog ic studies relevant to the issue of whether the MMR vaccine cause s chronic gastrointesti nal dysfunction . Howeve r, the results of those studies make it Cynthia A. Molloy & Patricia Manning -Courtney , Prevale nce of Chronic Gastrointestinal181 Symptoms in Children with Autism and Autistic Spectrum Disorders , 7 AUTISM 165 (2003). (Ex. P, Att. 112); Eric Fombonne & Suniti Chakraba rti, No Evidence for a New Variant of Measles- Mumps-Rube lla-Induce d Autism , 108 PEDIATRICS e58 (Ex. P , Att. 60.) Jennife r Richler et al., Is There a 'Regressive Phenotype ' of Autism Spectrum Disorder182 -Rubella Vacc ine? A CPEA Study , 36 AUTISM & DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS 299 (2006). ( Ex. BB, Att. 84.) Corri Black et al., Relation of Childhood Gastrointestinal Disorders to Autism: Nested183 Case-Control Study Using Data from the UK Gene ral Practice Researc h Database , 325 BRIT. MED.

Brent Taylor et al., Meas les, Mumps, and Rubella Vacc ination and Bowel Problems or184 Developmental Regression in Children with Autism: Population Study , 324 BRIT. MED. J. 393 (2002). ( Ex. P, Att. 146.) 147seem unlikely that the MMR vaccine cause s chronic GI problems. According ly, this factor adds another reason to rejec t the g eneral causation theory of the pe rning general causation of gastr ointesti nal dysfunction In short, I found that the evidenc e put forth by petitioners, conce rning the general proposition that the MMR vaccine can contribute to the causa tion of chronic GI dysfunction, was very weak. 185 The petitioners' evidenc e was signific antly Hana uer. have not made a persua sive case conce rning this iss Michelle Cedill o's gastroint estinal sym ptom s Because I rejected above the arguments of the petitioners' expert as to the general proposition that the MMR vaccine can cause chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction, it is clear that, for the same reasons, I must also reject the petitioners' argume nt that Miche lle Cedillo's chronic gastrointestinal problems were cause d by her MMR inoculation. In addition, there are sever al more reasons to rejec t petitioners' spec ific conte 1. Dr. Krigsm an's opini on was bas ed on an erroneous ass umption concerning th e validity of the Unigenetics testing . First, Dr . Krig sman, who g ave the only opinion specific to Miche lle's own gastrointestinal symptoms, made it clear that his opinion in Michelle's case relied upon the assumption that a reliable labora tory test had found evidenc e of persisting measles virus in Michelle's intestinal tissue. (E.g., Tr. 531-33A, 538A.) Howeve r, I have conclude d that the Unig enetics testing that purported to find evidence of persisting measles virus in Michelle's system was not reliable . There fore, Dr. Krigsman's opinion conce rning Michelle's GI symptoms is, obviously evidentiar y weig ht. Dr. Jean-Ronel Corbier, who testified for the petitioners in the Hazlehurst case, did185 indicate his view that a persisting measles virus could contribute to causing gastrointesti nal symptoms as well as autism. Howeve r, in discussing the issue of gastrointesti nal dysfunction in their post-hear ing briefs, the petitioners have not specifically relied upon Dr. Corbier's opinion. Moreove r, Dr. Corbier's testimony woul d not assist petitioners in any event. First, Dr. Corbier's opinion, like that of Dr. Krigsman, assumes that the Unig enetics testing for measles virus, repor ted in the Uhlm ann st udy, was reliable ( Hazlehurst Tr. 272A-73A, 278A-79A) , but I have concluded otherwise. Second, Dr. Corbier, a neurolog ist, did not appea r to have any particula r expertise in gastroente rolog y. (See, e.g., Proveris Corp. v. Innovasy stems, Inc., 536 F.3d 1256, 1268 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (the fact that a witness is qualified as an expert in one scientific area does not qualify that witness to opine in other areas); Nimely v. City of New York, 414 F.3d 381, 399 n. 13 (2d Cir. 2005) (same) .) And t hird, I simply did not find Dr. Corbier to be a r eliable e xpert in g eneral, as explained at p. 106 above . 1482. Dr. Krigsm an's opini on was bas t assum ption concerning Michelle's gastroin testinal symptom history. It is also noteworthy that Dr. Krigsman seeme d to have a grossly mistaken understanding of the history of Michelle's gastrointestinal symptoms. In his repor t, he wrote that the \"most compelling factor\" supporting his opinion in Michelle's case was \"the simple chrono logy of events.\" (Ex. 59, p. 7.) Dr. Krigsman wrote that Michelle's diarrhe a began about \"18-20 days\" after her MMR vaccination on December 20, 1995. (Id.) He later indicated that his understanding of Michelle's history was that Michelle experience d the onset of chronic diarrhea soon after her MMR vaccination, and that such diar rhea lasted for \"a good year or two\" (Tr. 509), followed by a per iod of chronic constipation and difficult stooling for another year or two, followed by another period of chronic diarrhe a. (Tr . 509, 535A.) Howeve r, a simple reading of Michelle's medical records demonstrates that Dr. Krigsman's understanding was clearly wrong . Whil e it would be expected that virtually any infant might occa sionally experience temporary periods of diarrhe a associate d with temporar y infec tious illnesses, the medical records from the period of 1996 throug h 1999 do not indicate the prese nce of any chronic or persistent diarrhe a during that period. To the contra ry, the record of a visit by Michelle to her pediatric ian on Marc h 15, 1996, about three months after Michelle's MMR vaccination, states that she was \"stooling well,\" indicating an absenc e of diarr hea or any other stool ing problem at that time. (Ex. 8, p. 1.) Further, Michelle's treating gastroente rolog ist, Dr. Ramon Montes, wrote a repor t on May 22, 2000, descr ibing her chronic gastrointestinal symptoms; he noted that l gastrointestinal symptoms\" consisted of constipation, not diarrhe a. (Ex. 44, p. 58, emphasis added.) Dr. Montes, in that same repor t, added that Michelle's chronic constipation subsided about \"1 year ago,\" and that she \"has not had any formed stools since;\" this indicates that Michelle's chronic diarrhea (i.e., a lack of \"formed stools\") began about one year prior to that visit of May 2000, or about May of 1999 . (Id.) That repor t of Dr. Montes does not say when the chronic constipation began, but indicates that the consti pation was associated with milk consump tion (id.), and a record from June 2, 1995, long before Michelle's MMR vaccination, indicates that Miche lle was \" [e]xtremely 2% milk.\" ( Ex. 8, p. 3.) Simi larly, a history form filled out on Januar y 31, 2002, stated that Michelle's chronic diarrhe a had continued for about \"2 \u00bd years.\" That record confirms that the onset of her chronic diarrhe a occ urred in mid-1999. (Ex . 44, p. 7.) In short, the medical records indicate that Michelle's chronic constipation may have begun many months prior to her MMR vaccination in question, and, more importantly , that her chronic diarrhea did not begin until mid-1999, more than three years after that vaccination. Thus, those186 Concerning Michelle's history of diarrhe a, I acknow ledge that there have been statements186 from Mrs. Cedillo that offer at least some support to Dr. Krigsman's assumption that Michelle's chronic diarrhe a began soon after her MMR vaccination of December 20, 1995. (See, e.g., Tr. 232A- (continued...) 149records show that Dr. Krigsman gravely misunderstood the temporal history of Michelle's gastrointestinal problems, so that the \"most compelling factor\" that he relied upon was simply wrong .187 3. Dr. Krigsm an's opini on was bas ed on an in correc t conclusion that Michelle expe of Michelle's case was that she has suffe red for many years, beginning very soon after her MMR vaccination of December 20, 1995, from chronic gastrointesti nal inflammation , specific ally including inflammation of her intestines , which he believes to be cause d by a persisting m easle s virus infec tion. At various ti mes, Dr. Krigsma n has allege d that Michelle has \"inflammatory bowel disease,\" also known as \"IBD,\" which encompa sses a number of types of chronic inflammation of the dig estive trac t (e.g., Ex. 59, p. 7; Tr. 427A), or that she has \"Crohn's disease,\" which is a specific form of IBD (e.g., Tr. 428, 470A-72A). He has also repeatedly characterized her as suffe ring from chronic \"ente rocolitis,\" which specific ally means inflammation of both he r large and small intestines . (E.g., Ex. 59, pp. 7, 9; Tr. 422, 470A, 489A-90.) Howeve r, on the issue of whether Michelle has in fact suffe red from chronic enter ocoliti s, IBD, Crohn's disease, or any form of chronic gastrointestinal inflammation , I found the testimony of Dr. Krigsman to be quite unpersua sive, and to be substantially outweig hed by a combination of the medical records and the testimony of responde nt's experts, espec ially Dr. Hana uer. The evidenc e demonstrates that while Michelle did have some inflammation of her esophag us and mild inflammation of her stomach in 2000, there has never been, despite multiple diagnostic proce dures, any competent evidence of inflammation in her intestines , and ther e has be en no evide nce of chronic inflammation anywhere in her dig estive sy stem since the g astritis in 2000. (...continued)186 33.) Howeve r, I cannot accept those particula r statements of Mrs. Cedillo as accurate . As noted above, I certainly do not believe that Mrs. Cedillo was e ver intentionally failing to tell the truth to the best of her memory . Perhaps Mrs. Cedillo does reme mber some episode of temporary diarrhe a shortly after the MMR vaccination , thoug h that episode is not noted in the medical records. And certainly the medical records absolutely support Mrs. Cedillo's memory that Michelle did suffe r from years of chr onic diarr hea. Howeve r, the medical records, as descr ibed above, indica te clea rly that Michelle's extended period of chronic diarrhe a did not begin until mid-1999 . On this specific point, I find that the medica l records ar e the be st evidence . I note that responde nt's initial brief pointed out the errors in Dr. Krigsman's understanding187 of Mi chelle' s symptom history (R1, p. 38), y et, in their reply brief, the petitioners di d not attempt to defe nd Dr. n's a in IBD, explained persua sively that Dr. Krigsman was not justified in reaching a diagnosis of IBD or enter ocolitis based on Michelle's chronic clinical symptoms of diarrhe a and constipation. For examp le, he testified that while diarrhe a can be cause d by bowel inflammation, it can also be cause d by many other factors. (Tr. 2100A-07.) He explained that Michelle's pattern of alterna ting diarrhea and constipation, combined with abdomi nal pain, could not justify a diagnosis of IBD, but would instead suggest another disorder known as \"irritable bowel syndrome.\" (Tr. 2105A, 2107-08A.) He testified that the existence of Michelle's chronic constipation actua lly preclude d a diag nosis of g astrointestinal inflammation. (Tr. 2107.) In addition, Dr. Hana uer explained how chronic diarrhe a can be a result of constipation. He testified that when a person is constipated, a large amount of fecal materia l can build up and stretch the rectum, leading to diarrhe a that flows around the build-up. (Tr. 2103A-04A.) And, in188 Michelle's case, the medical recor ds offer support to a conclusion that such a phenomenon might explain Michelle's diarrhe a. For example, there are notations of \"fecal impaction,\" meaning a collection of harde ned feces in the rectum (Dorland's at 915), accompanied by diarrhe a. (E.g., Ex. 36, p. 9.) There are also notations of \"over flow diarrhe a,\" again suggesting diarrhe a flowing around a fecal obstr uction in the rectum. For example, actua lly overf low diarrhe a.\" (Ex. 28, p. 241.) Another record states that Michelle's diarrhe a \"is overf low diarrhe a around a massive fecal impaction.\" (Letter of Dr. Schneider filed on 10-31-00.) Thus, those medical records, along with Dr. Hana uer's testimony , indica te that Michelle's chronic diarrhe a may be related to her c onstipation, rather tha n having anything to do with GI inflammation. b. Specific analysis of the rec ords of Michelle's endoscopie s, biopsies, and t he PillCam study An even more important factor, contra dicting Dr. Krigsman's notion that Michelle has had chronic gastrointestinal inflammation , is the evidenc e conce rning the exam inations of Michelle's gastrointestinal system, specific ally of her multipl e endoscopie s and biopsi es. (Tr. 2108A-43.) Dr. Hana uer pointed out in detail how the results of those examinations were inconsistent with Dr. Krigsman's conclusion that Michelle has enter ocolitis or IBD. He noted that the results of those tests were generally considere d normal by Michelle's a ctual tre ating physicians, with no evidenc e of inflammation in he r intestines. Dr. Hana uer explained tha t it was incorre ct for Dr. Krigsman to diagnose IBD without patho logical evidenc e of intestinal inflammation, espec ially in light of multipl e tests in which no inflammation of her intestines was found. ( E.g., Tr. 2098A- 99.) One of responde nt's experts' in the Hazlehurst case, Dr. Mac Donald, also de scribed the188 same phenomenon of \"over flow diarrhe a\" fecal 674A.) MacD onald, like Dr. Hana distinguished this overf low diarrhe a from the diarrhe a that a person would g et with g astrointestinal inflammation. ( Id.) 151Specifica lly, Dr. Hana uer discussed in detail the results of the five occasions upon which Michelle unde rwent endoscopies and biopsies, along with an additional set of imag es of her digestive system taken by a \"PillC am.\" There are two types of endoscopie s that were performed on Michelle at various times. In an \"upper endoscopy ,\" a tiny came ra attache d to a flexibl e cable is passed throug h the m outh and down throug h the esophag us and st omach into the top part (duodenum) of the small intestine. In a \"lower endoscopy ,\" also known as a \"colonosc opy,\" the came ra is passed throug h the anus into the large intestine, also known as the colon, and then into the lower part (\"ileum\" ) of the small intestine. During such proce dures, the endoscopist visually examines the tissues for signs of disease or other abnorma lity. In addition, during either type of endoscopy, biopsies of tissue may be collec ted for micr oscopic study . (Tr. 2096.) On each of the five occasions when endoscopie s were performed on Michelle, the gastroente written was seen throug h the came ra. In addit ion, biopsies (tissue samples) were collected during each proce dure, and on each occasion, those biopsies were microsco pically examined by a specialist, resulting in a \"pathology repor t.\" During his testimony , Dr. conce s and biopsies, those repor ts were inconsistent with Dr. Krigsman's conclusion that Michelle suf fered from chronic g astrointestinal inflammation. Dr. Ramon Montes, a pediatric gastroente rolog ist in Phoenix , Arizona, performed an \"upper endoscopy \" on Miche lle on J une 12, 2000. Dr . Montes generated a written repor t concer ning tha t \"esopha gogastroduodenosc opy,\" which is the more precise name of the proce dure. (Ex. 44, pp. 64- 65.) His repor that Dr. Montes observe d \"erosive esophag itis\" in the esophag us and \"gastritis\" in the stomach (id. at 65), but that the \"duodenum,\" a part of the small intestine, was \"norma l except for mild nodularity \" (id. at 64). Biopsies were collecte d during that endoscopy , and the resulting189 patholog y repor t indicates that the two samples from the duodenu m were normal (\"no histopathologic finding s\"), while in the esophag us and stomach (\"gastric antrum\") there were mild incre ases in white blood cells (\"eosinophils\"). (Ex. 21, p. 3.) Dr. Montes commented on those patholog ical finding s in the esophag us and stomach in his next written repor t conce rning Michelle, a letter that he wrote after examining Michelle on October 3, 2000. (Ex. 44, pp. 31-33.) In that letter, Dr. Montes descr repor t--as showing \"gastroesopha disease in addition to focal gastric antral inflammation.\" (Id. at 31.) During his hearing testimony, Dr. Hana uer explained that \"gastroesopha geal reflux disease,\" also known as \"GERD,\" is a condition in which st omach acid i nappropr iately moves up throug h the esophag us, there by causing the \"erosive esophag itis\" note d in the surgical ity\" as \"LNH.\" As will be189 discussed below (p. 157), intestinal finding s of LNH are comm on, and do not indicate inflammation. 152Concerning that endoscopy of June 12, 2000, in both the surgical repor t (Ex. 44, pp. 64-65) and the October 3 letter (Ex. 44, pp. 31-32), Dr. Montes did not mention inflammatory bowel disease, or any form of infla mmation of the intestines . Michelle underw ent a follow -up endoscopy , also performed by Dr. Montes, on December 11, 2000. (Tr. 2113A; Ex. 44, pp. 41-42.) The chief observa tion made during that endoscopy , as repor ted in the surgical repor t, was that the \"erosive esophag itis,\" which had been observe d during the endoscopy of June 12, 2000, had now \"resolved.\" (Ex. 44, p. 42.) Further, in the stomach Dr. Montes could see \"no nodularity nor ulcer ation\" (id. at 41), and the duodenu m appeared \"norma l\" (id. at 42). A patholog y report descr ibes the microscopic evalua tion of the tissue biopsied the December 11 endoscopy . (Ex. 44, pp. 43-44.) The patholog ist examined the tissue from the esophag us and found it t o be unre marka ble. ( Id. at 43, 44.) I n the stomach, the pa thologist found evidenc e of \"mild superf icial chronic gastritis,\" which was \"non-spe cific.\" (Id. at 43, 44.) Thus, the one abnorma lity found in the December 11 endoscopy was the microscopic evidenc e of \"gastritis\"-- i.e., inflammation in the stomach--that was characterized as \"mild,\" \"super ficial,\" and \"non- specific .\" (Id.) And that microscopic finding followed a visual finding by Dr. Montes of \"gastritis\" in the endoscopy on June 12, 2000. (Ex. 44, p. 65.) Howeve r, Dr. Hanau er explained that the gastritis observed in Michelle during those two endoscopie s was not evidenc e of inflammatory bowel disease. (Tr. 2111A-12A, 2114A-15. ) Further, in his letter of June 4, 2001, Dr. Montes, who190 performed both endoscopie s, indicated that the important finding of the second endoscopy was that Michelle's former \"erosive esophag itis\" was heale d, adding that the results of the microscopic examination of the biopsies indicated \"only a mild, nonspecific chronic gastritis.\" (Ex. 44, p. 5, emphasis added.) This use of the words \"only \" and \"mild\" indicate that Dr. Mon tes, like Dr. Ha nauer , did not find the nonspecific gastritis to be a sig nificant finding . On Januar y 31, 2002, Dr. Montes performed both an upper endoscopy and a lower endoscopy (colonoscopy ) on Michelle. (Ex. 44, pp. 13-15.) According to the surgical repor t, the upper endoscopy found the stomach and the upper part of the small intestine, the duodenum, to be \"unre marka ble,\" meaning normal (id. at 13). The colonoscopy found the lower part of the small intestine (the \"terminal ileal mucosa\" ) to be \"norma l, without signs of inflammation\" (id. at 14). The surgical repor t descr ibed \"mild nodularity \" in the small intestine and \"excessive nodularity \" in the large intestine (id. at 14). Dr. Hana uer and Dr. Krigsman \"LNH.\" They explained that the lymphoid tissue in the lining of the digestive tract is formed into \" lymph node s\" or \"nodules,\" and when those nodules become enlar ged, the condition is known as 445A- 2115-16, 2150A.) Dr. Hanaue r stresse d that LNH is a common, normal finding in children, I note an error in the hearing transcr ipt in this regard . In his letter of October 3, 2000,190 Dr. Montes wrote that the June 12 endoscopy showed \"focal gastric antra l inflammation.\" (Ex. 44, p. 31.) Respondent's counsel quoted that phrase from that letter during the examination of Dr. Ha nauer , but the word \" gastrointestinal inflammati on. (Tr. 2115-16, 2150A.) And Dr. Krigsman himself stated that the 2002 colonoscopy , despite its finding s of \"nodular ity\" in both intestines, was \"norma l.\" (Tr . 426, 510.) The patholog y repor t for those 2002 upper and lower endoscopie s found all of the biopsied tissue, from the esophag us and both the large and small intestines, to be \"unre marka ble\"- -i.e., normal, without inflammation. (Ex. 44, p. 17; Tr. 2117.) In addition, biopsy sampl es from those 2002 endoscopie s were also sent to a patholog ist in Britain for examination. The samples from the esophag us and small intestine were found to be completely normal (\"no histologica l abnorma lities\"). (Ex. 28, p. 178.) The samples from the large intestines were found to have \"feature s that would be in keeping with colonic lymphoid nodular hyperpla sia,\" but the patholog ist added that in spite of such features, there was \"no evidenc e of active inflammation\" in any of the samples. (Id.) This appar ently indicates that that patholo gist, like Dr. Hanaue r, did not find the presence of lymphoid nodular hy perpla sia to be evide nce of inflammation . (Id.) Michelle's next set of endoscopie s were performed by Dr. Krigsman himself. 191 Dr. Krigsma n performed both upper and lower endoscopies on Michelle on September 25, 2003 . (Ex. 28, pp. 454-56.) The the descr ibes certain finding s in the esophag us and the stomach that Dr. Hana uer was not a ble to inter pret (see Tr. 2124-25), but makes no mention of any abnorma lities in the duodenum portion of the small intestine. (Ex. 28, p. 455.) In descr ibing the lower endoscopy (colonoscopy ), Dr. Krigsman only (sic ) dal uer Dr. Krigsman's finding s conce rning the 2003 endoscopie s. He explained that the obs ervation of aphthous ulcers in the intestines on endoscopy does not justify a conclusion that the individual has intestinal inflammation . (Tr. 2125-28A.) He testifi ed that common \"cold sores\" or \"canker sores,\" which people often experience in their mouths, are a type of aphthous ulcer s, and that aphthous ulce rs in the intestines a re simil ar. (Tr. 2120, 2126-27.) He stated that aphthous ulcer s can be cause d by many differ ent factors, including the prepa ration of the bowel for the endoscopy , or the taking of certain nonpresc ription medications. (Tr. 2126, 2128A.) They can a lso be \"pa rt of the normal i ntestinal lining.\" (Tr. 2126.) Thus, Dr. Ha nauer explained, Dr. Krigsman erred in concluding that Michelle's intestines had inflammation based on the prese nce Michelle's mother testified that she did research via the Internet concerning possible cause s191 of autism and gastrointestinal symptoms. (Tr. 251A-52A.) She read about Dr. Krigsman, contac ted him, and eventua lly took Michelle to New York, wher e Dr. Krigsman practiced, to be examined by him in S eptember of 2003. s of \"ly mphonodular hy perpla sia\" in the intestines are also common, and do not indicate intestinal inflammation. (Tr. 2115-16, 2149- 50A.) In addition, a patholog y repor t rning the endoscopie s of September 2003 was prepa red, and was revie wed by Dr. Noam Harpaz, a patholog ist descr ibed by Dr. Hanauer as \"one of the world's authorities on inflammatory bowel disease.\" (Ex. 28, pp. 407-08; Tr. 2129A.) That patholog y repor t conclude d that all of the biopsied materia l from the intestines was \"within normal limit s,\" the only irregularity on any tissue being some \"mild chronic nonspecific gastritis\" in the stomach. (Ex. 28, pp. 707-08.) Michelle under went one more set of endoscopie s, both upper and lower, on June 8, 2006, performed by Dr. Dana Ursea . The surgical repor t conce rning the upper endoscopy states that it was a \"norma l examination.\" (Ex. 49, p. 20.) The surgical repor t for the lower endoscopy indicates, at its \"asse ssment\" line, an \"abnor mal examination.\" (Id. at 23.) Howeve r, Dr. Hana uer indicated that the \"abnor malities\" observe d by Dr. Ursea did not indicate inflammation . (Tr. 2134A-35.) The surgical repor t indicates that two of the four sections of the colon yielded a \"norma l exam.\" (Ex. 49, p. 23.) The report further indi cates that a third section of the colon, the \"transverse \" portion, had \"one aphthous ulcer .\" (Id.) Also, in the fourth section of the colon, the \"sigmoid\" portion, it appea rs that aphth ous ulcers were also observe d. (Id.) Dr. Hana uer, howeve r, reiter ated that aphthous193 ulcer s are not indicative of bowel inflammation, so that those \"abnor mal\" finding s in two sections of the colon do not indicate inflammation. (Tr. 2134A-35, 2174A-75.) Further, in her \"comments\" after Ursea herse lf wrote \"no gross colitis\" (Ex. 49, p. 24), seeming ly indicating Dr. Ursea 's own view that the aphthous ulcer s that she repor ted were not evidenc e of \"colitis\" ( i.e., inflammation of the colon) . The patholog y repor t from those endoscopie s of June 8, 2006, once again indicated no intestinal abnorma lities. Specifica lly, the repor t states that for all of the biopsies collecte d from the intestines (colon, duodenum), there was \"no pathologic diagnosis.\" (Ex. 49, p. 82.) Dr. Hanaue r noted that this means that the tissue was nor mal. (Tr. 2135.) Finally , at the time of her last biopsi es, in June of 2006, Michelle also underw ent another diagnostic proce dure, known as a capsule imag ing,\" \"capsule endoscopy ,\" or \"PillC am study .\" In that proce dure, a pill with a came ra in it went down throug h her digestive system, wirele ssly sending back imag es of her digestive tract. (Tr. 455-62.) The parties have not identified, in the medical records filed in this case, any written repor t descr ibing the results of that PillCam study . Howeve r, during his hearing testimony , Dr. Krigsman showed some imag es from that study , arguing that they supported his conclusion that Michelle has experience d chronic intestinal inflammation. (Tr. 456- 468.) The re port 35.)193 155Dr. H anaue r, however, analy zed the same image s, and ex plained why they do not indicate intestinal inflammation. Dr. Hana uer descr ibed the features of Michelle's intestin es, on which Dr. Krigsma n's testimony had relied, as \"mucosal breaks,\" very shallow erosions of the intestinal walls, simil ar to \"aphthous ulcers\" but shallower. (Tr. 2135-36A.) He stated that about 15% of normal intestines have such features. (Tr. 2136A.) Most importantly , Dr. Hana uer then showed imag es of intestines with actual Crohn's disease, and pointed out that such imag es were quite different from the imag es of Michelle's intestines ta ken by the PillCam. (Tr. 2137-41.) He noted, for ex ample, that the lesions in Crohn's di sease were 10 to 50 t imes as dee p as the erosions noted in Michelle's intestines. (Tr. 2138A.) I found this particula r testimony of Dr. Hana uer, conce rning imag persua Petitioners did not prese nt testimony from Dr. Krigsman, or any other e xpert, to re but that testimony of Dr. H anaue r. To summarize, the medical records show that Michelle had upper endoscopie s on five occasions, and lower endoscopie s on three occasions. Each of the five upper endoscopie s involved examination of the \"duodenum,\" the upper part of her small intestine. Each of the three lower endoscopie s involved examination of both her large intestine (colon) and the lower part (ileum) of her small intestine. Yet none of those proce dures yielded any signific ant evide nce of intestinal inflammation . None of the pathology repor ts ever indicated any inflammation of either the large or small intestines. None of the surgical repor ts ever indicated a diagnosis of IBD, enter ocolitis, Crohn's disease , or any other diag nosis of inflammation of either intestine. It is true that Michelle's first endoscopy , in June o f 2000, indicated \"erosive esophag itis,\" which had resolved by her second endoscopy in December of 2000. Further, both of those 2000 endoscopie s indicated evidenc e of \"gastritis.\" But both the esophag itis and the gastriti s did not involve Michelle's intestines , which is crucial because Dr. Krigsman alleg es chronic enteroc olitis , which specifie s inflammation. Further, all of the patholog y repor ts for the three upper endoscopies performed after 2000 indicate no finding of inflammation of either the stomach or esophag us, other th an \"mild nonspecific \" gastritis in one part of the stomach in 2003, and \"mild\" esophag itis in one part of the esophag us in 2006. Those patholog y results, thus, indicate that there was no sustained, chronic inflammation of even the esophag us or stomach. And, to repeat, none of the patholog y repor ts ever indicated a ny inflammation of either of the intestines . In addition, there were repor ts of \"nodular ity\" or \"aphthous ulcer s\" in intestines in sever al of the surgical repor ts of the endoscopie s, as noted above. And Dr. Krigsman also interpre ted some of the im ages from the P illCam study to indicate aphthous ulcer s Hana testified that such symptoms are common observa tions, and are not indicative of intestinal inflammation . X, p. 2; Tr. 2115-16, 2125-28A, 2134A-36A, 2149-50A, 2174A- 75.) There fore, I conclude that the medical records of Michelle's endoscopie s, biopsies, and the PillCam study strong ly support Dr. Hana uer's conclusions (1) that Michelle has never been shown to suffe r from intestinal inflammation of any kind, and (2) that while Michelle did have some inflammation of her esophag us and stomach in 2000, and one finding of \"mild\" inflammation in each 156of those ar eas since , she has not suff ered from chronic inflammation of eve n those parts of he r GI tract. c. Addition al discussi on concerning i ssue of gastroin testinal inflam mation In addition, certain other parts of the record furnish additional support to my conclusion that Michelle likely did not suffe r from chronic gastrointestinal inflammation , nor any intestinal inflammation. First, a pediatric gastroente rolog ist, Dr. Ramon Montes, treated Michelle from 2000 to 2002, and performed the endoscopie s in June 2000, December 2000, and Januar y 2002. Dr. Montes never diagnosed Michelle to be suffe ring from IBD, or any intestinal inflammation. To the contra ry, after examining the ileum section of Michelle's small intestine in 2002, Dr. Montes wrote that it \"appe ared normal without signs of inf lammation.\" (Ex. 44, p. 14.) Second, there were a number of tests on Michelle which looked for evidenc e of leukocy tes in Michelle's stool samples, which would have indicated GI inflammation, but such testing was alway s neg ative. (Tr . 2142, ate that Dr. Krigsman during the hearing in this case repeatedly pointed to two types of finding s in Michel le's intestines, , and opined that those finding s supported a conclusion that she was suffe ring from intestinal inflammation. (Tr. 443-468.) Howeve r, Dr. Hanauer explained persua sively that those finding s do not constitute evidenc e of inflammation. (Ex. X, rolog ist studied Michelle's records, intestinal f indings of LNH and aphthous ulcer s on endoscopy are very common and do not support a conclusion of intestinal inflammation, in general or in Michelle' s case. (Ex. T, pp. 8, 13, 15, 22.) Further, another of responde nt's experts, Dr. MacD onald, a specia lizes in the human gastrointestinal immune system, also testified that LNH is not indicative of GI inflammation. (Hazlehurst Ex. A, p. 7; Hazlehurst Tr. 616A-19.) He testified that LNH is espec ially common in children (Hazlehurst Tr. at 616A), and that a good endoscopist when seeing LNH will note its prese nce, but the finding will still be of \"no diagnostic signific ance\" (id. at 619). Dr. MacD onald also testified that LNH can be cause d by constipation, which is important because Michelle suffe red from chronic constipation for years. (Tr. 670A.) I found the prese ntations of Drs. and Moreove Michelle's treating gastroente wrote that Michelle's ileum \"appe ared normal without signs of inflammation and only mild nodularity .\" (Ex. 44, p. 14.) This notation clearly indicates that Dr. Montes, too, found the prese nce of some \"nodular ity\" in Michelle's small intestine to be \"norma l,\" and not to be a sign of inflammation.194 Simi larly, the British pathol ogist who LNH in Michelle's colon tissue194 (continued...) 157It is also noteworthy that Dr. Krigsman himself stated that Michelle's 2002 colonoscopy , which found \" excessive nodularity \" in t he lar ge intestine (Ex. 44, p. 14), was \" normal.\" ( Tr. 426, 510.) Given that admission that a finding of \"excess ive nodularity\" is a \"norma l\" tions of \"nodular ity\" in other endoscopie s demonstrates intestinal inflammation become s even le ss cre dible. Dr. Krigsman also pointed to the results of certain testing done on Michelle-- i.e., that she had an eleva ted \"c-reactive protein an -as e that Michelle had chronic intestinal inflammation. (Tr. 432-33A.) Dr. Hana uer testified, howeve r, that there were other reasons for those test results, and that those results did not justify a conclusion that Michelle suffe red from intestinal inflammation, in light of the repeated endoscopy and biopsy results which did not find inflammation. (Tr. 2130-32A.) Dr. Gershon, too, explained that the eleva ted \"OmpC count\" did not indicate ga strointestinal inflammation. (Ex . T, pp. 13-14.) Dr. Krigsman also pointed to the fact that Michelle has experience d both arthritis and uveitis, inflammatory conditions of the joints and eyes, as evidenc e that Michelle also had inflammation of her intestines. (Tr. 471A.) Dr. Hana uer, howeve r, testified that such an infere nce was not justified. (Tr. 2130; Ex. X, p. 3.) Finally , Dr. Krigsman indicated that his opinion that Michelle had chronic bowel inflammation was based on a combination of a number of symptoms-- i.e., the endoscopic finding s of aphthous ulcer s and LNH, plus her history of diarrhe a and abdominal pain, and the test results and prese nce of arthritis and uveitis mentioned in the previous two paragraphs. (Tr. 470A-72A.) Dr. Hanaue r, however, opined that this constellation of sy mptoms descr ibed by Dr. Kri gsman did not justify a diagnosis of intestinal inflamm ation, in light of the lack of evidenc e of inflammation in the biopsies collecte d during her multiple endoscopie s. (Tr. 2172.) d. Medical rec ord notat ions cited by petitioners With regard to this issue of whether Michelle experience d chronic GI inflammation , in their initial post-hear ing brief petitioners pointed to a number of medical records which noted that Michelle had suffe red from \"inflammatory bowel disease,\" \"colitis,\" \"Crohn's disease,\" or \"enterocolitis ,\" all of which would indicate some form of gastrointestinal inflammation. (P1, pp. 38-59.) Howeve r, Dr. Hana uer discussed the issue of those medical record notations. (Tr. 2194A- 96A.) All of those notations were made after Dr. Krigsman wrote a letter on July 10, 2003, diagnosing Michelle wit h \"inflammatory bowel dis ease\" and \"ente rcolit is.\" (Ex. 28, p. 84.) And almost all of those not ations were in records of physicians who were not gastroenterologists , and (...continued)194 nevertheless found those samples to be free from \"active inflammation,\" indicating that such patholog ist also found L NH not to be a sig n of inflammation. (Ex. 28, p. 178.) 158thus not qualified to diagnose gastrointestinal inflammatory disease. Dr. Hana uer indicated that195 such notations did not represent independe nt conclusions of such physicians that Michelle in fact suffe red from g astrointestinal inflammation; rather , those phy sicians wer e mer ely noting that they had read or been told of a repor t by a previous treater, Dr. Krigsman, which stated that Michelle had chronic GI inflammat ion. (Tr. 2194A-96A.) Dr. Hana uer noted that such repor ts of diagnoses frequently \"get carried over\" from one physician to another , \"without any level of revie w\" or \"without or evide primar y data.\" (Id. at 2195A-96A .) I found that testimony of Dr. Hana uer to be persuasive. In revie wing medical records in Prog ram cases for nearly 20 years, I have often noted the phenomenon that Dr. Hana uer descr ibed, in which physicians during a visit note in a medical record what they have been told about prior diagnoses of the patient. I t seems likely that many physicians, being told that a gastroe nterolog ist (Dr. Krigsman) had diagnosed IBD, would simply write in their notes that Michelle carried a diagnosis of I BD. Notations by two physicians, howeve r, do merit additional discussion, since those notations were recorded by gastroenterologists . First, Dr. Sharon Taylor saw Michelle on October 16, 2003, and wrote that Michelle had a \"diag nosis\" of \"Crohn's disease,\" and that she had \"suff ered in the past from enter ocolitis, gastritis,\" and other conditions. (Ex. 28, p. 9.) Howeve r, that record seems to indicate that Dr. Taylor was consulted on that occasion specific ally because Michelle was having trouble with her feeding tube, which neede d prompt attention. (Ex. 28, pp. 9-11.) Dr. Taylor's role was simply to examine Michelle to devise an immediate solution for the tube problem. (Id.) There is no indication that Dr. Taylor performed any of the type of testing or \"wor k-up\" that likely would be performed by a gastroente rolog ist befor e diagnosin g Crohn's disease or enter ocolitis. My conclusion from those circumstances, thus, is that Dr. Taylor was not making her own diagnosis of Michelle, but was sim ply stating that she had been told by Michelle's paren ts that Michelle had a diagnosis of Crohn's disease and/or enter ocolitis. I note that Dr. Taylor mentioned those conditions in the very first sentenc es of her note conce rning the visit, which is the obvious place for a physician to rec ord statements fr om the family descr ibing the pa tient's backg round. Simi larly, petitioners point to by Dr. Dana Ursea , another gastroente rolog ist, when she saw Michelle on Februar y 2, 2006, and April 19, 2006. (P1, pp. 56, 58.) According to the records that I have identified among the medical records filed in this case, Dr. Ursea actua lly saw Michelle on at least four occasions. Dr. Ursea consulted on Michelle's case in the hospital in October of 2005, when Michelle was hospitaliz ed for a broken leg (Ex. 49, pp. 62- 66); saw Michelle at her office on Februar y 2 and April 20, 2006 (Ex. 27, pp. 222-227); and then Dr. Hutter, hematolog ist (P1, p. 38); Dr. Crawf ord, pediatric p. 40); physician (P1, p. 51); ibed endoscopie s and PillCam study on Michelle on June 8, 2006 (Ex. 49, pp. 20-24). I n the notes of he r enc ounters with Michelle, Dr. U rsea wrote in Oc tober of 2005 tha t Michelle had a \"history of Crohn's disease.\" (Ex. 49, p. 62.) She wrote in Februar y of 2006 that Michelle had a \"history of chronic antra l colitis.\" (Ex. 27, p. 226.) Lastly, she wrote in April of 2006 that Michelle had \"multiple medical problems * * * including inflammatory bowel disease like enter ocolitis ( sic).\" (Ex. 27, p. 222.) Based on those records, howeve r, I cannot conclude that Dr. Ursea ever made her own independe nt diagnosis that Michelle had chronic gastroin testinal inflammation of any kind. Dr. Ursea was first consulted when Michelle enter ed a hospital in October of 2005 for a broken leg, and experience d diarrhe a during that hospitaliz ation. (Ex. 49, p. 62.) During that consultation, Dr. Ursea spoke by telephone with Dr. Krigsman, descr ibing him as \"[Michelle's] gastroente rolog ist past two years.\" (Id.) Clearly , Dr. Ursea was told by Dr. Krigsman that Michelle had a \"history of Croh n's disease.\" (Id., emphasis added.) Simi larly, the letter that Dr. Ursea wrote conce rning her office visit with Michelle in Februar y of 2006 repor ted that Michelle had a \"history of chr onic antra l colitis.\" ( Ex. 27, p. 226, emphasis added.) And in the letter de scribing the April 2006 visit, whe n Dr. Ursea wrote that Michelle had \"multiple medical problems including autism, seizure disorder and inflammatory bowel disease like enter ocolitis\" (Ex. 27, p. 222), Dr. Ursea clearly was summari zing Michelle's medical history, not herse lf diagnosing autism, seizure disorder, or inflammatory bowel disea se. Thus, I conclude that in her medi cal record notations descr ibing Michelle as having \"inflammatory bowel disease,\" Dr. Ursea was not issuing her own independe nt diagnosi s that Michelle was experiencing chronic intestinal inflammation, but was mere ly recording that Dr. Krigsman had diag nosed those conditions in the past.196 In sum, I have carefully studied the medical records cited by petitioners in their brief that descr ibe Michelle as suffe ring from inflammatory GI conditions. I conclude that those rec ords do not indicate that any physician other than Dr. Krigsman actua lly independe ntly diagnosed Michelle with intestin al inflammation, or any chronic inflammation anywher e in her ga strointestinal tract. And I find that Dr. Krigsman was not a credible witness, so that his own diagnosis in that regard is not reliable. Of course, Dr . Ursea then per formed he r own endoscopie s on Michelle on June 8, 2006,196 as desc ribed a bove (pp. 155- 56). The pa rties have not identified any records created by Dr. Ur sea after those endoscopie s, so I have no way of knowing what Dr. Ursea 's opinion of Michelle's condition was after that examination. It is noteworthy , howeve r, that Dr. Ursea found the results of her upper endoscopy of Mi chelle to be \"normal\" (Ex . 49, p. 20), and that in the lower endoscopy , despite the aphthous ulcer s she found \"no gross colitis\" (id. at 24) (\"gross\" in this context likely means \"visible\"-- Dorland's at 800), meaning no visible inflammation. Then, the pathology repor ts of those endoscopie s came back negative for inflammation of the intestines. (Ex. 49, p. 82.) Thus, perha ps Dr. Ursea , after those endoscopie s and pathology repor ts, might have conclude d that Michelle did not have intestinal inflammation. We simply don't know what her impression was at that point. 160Further, even if I were to conclude that Dr. Ursea (or some other physician) did herself diagnose chronic intestinal inflammation, that would not chang e my opinion conce rning whether Michelle likely did e xperie nce chronic gastrointestinal inflammation. I am still impressed that the strongest evide nce by f ar, conce rning Dr. Krigsma n's allega tion of chronic GI inflammation, was Dr. Hana uer's testimony about the specific s of the endoscopie s and biopsies of Michelle, in which he demonstrated that the results of those proce dures were inconsiste nt with chronic GI inflammation. Dr. Hanaue r, an expert extremely well-qua lified in the area of GI inflammation, testified in detail why the results of those proce dures were inconsistent with Dr. Krigsman's conclusion. On the other hand, the record of this case supplies no explanation of why Dr. Ursea (or any other physician) might have reached any contra ry view. I conclude that Dr. Hana uer's testimony , supported by the above- from Drs. Gershon, MacD onald, and far more197 persua sive evidenc e than the unexplained statements in the medical records of Dr. Ursea or the other physicians cited by petitioners. There fore, the medical record notations cited by petitioners do not chang e my conclusion conc erning this inflammation is sue. e. Sum mary concerning allegation of gastroin testinal inflam mation in Michelle According ly, while Dr. Krigsman based his conclusion-- i.e., that Michelle's gastrointestinal symptoms were vaccine-caused--on the premise that Michelle had chronic GI inflammation (i.e., IBD or enter ocolitis), the evidentiar y record in this ca se ac tually makes it appe ar completely unproven, and very unlikely , that Michelle ever had any intestinal inflammation, or any chronic inflammation anywher e in her GI tract.198 G. Sum mary conce rning causation of gastroint estinal sym ptom quite clear that Michelle Cedillo herse lf has, very unfortunate ly, suffe red from many ongoing gastrointestinal symptoms, including constipation, diarrhe a, gastroesophageal reflux, vomiting, abdominal pain, and others. Dr. Hana uer, for example, pla inly acknow ledged as much. (Tr. 2143, 2144A, 2153A.) Further, it is also true that children suffe ring from regressive autism, or other types of autism, have often suffe red from chronic gastrointestinal problems. As noted above, the re cord of this case c ertainly does not contain a de finitive expl anation of e xactly to what extent autistic children tend to have more GI problems than non-autistic children, or why autistic children might be more susceptible to GI symptoms. An Institut e of Medicine committee noted that it is In addition to his testimony conce rning LNH and aphthous ulcer s, discussed above,197 also indicated his view that the pathologic evide nce from the biopsies is crucial. Like Dr. Hana uer, Dr. Gershon indicat ed that Dr. Krigsman is not justified in diagnosing IBD or enter ocolitis or Crohn's disease in light of the fact that the patholog ic repor ts from Mich elle's biopsies were uniformly negative conce rning inflammation of the intestines. (Ex. T, pp. 15-16, 21.) Moreove r, I also note that after Dr. Hana uer prese nted at the hearing his detailed criticism198 of Dr. Krigsman's opinion, petitioners had the opportunity to respond with rebuttal testimony of Dr. Krigsman or any other witness, but petitioners did not prese nt any rebuttal testimony conce rning the issue of g astrointestinal --e.g., abnorma l eating patterns- -that may cause GI problems. (Ex. JJ, p. 128.) Two of responde nts' experts, Dr. Wiznitzer and Dr. Fombonne, offered that same possible expl anation. (Tr . 2716A-17A; Snyder Ex. Y, p. 4.) Howeve r, it is not necessary for me to deter mine, in this case, to what extent autistic children have an increased risk for ga strointestinal dysfunction, or to deter mine why, in general, autis m or regressive autism might be associate d with excessive GI problems. Rather, the issues relevant here199 conce rn whether the MMR vaccine plays a causal role conce rning chronic GI symptoms in autistic children; specific ally, whether the petitioners have been able to demonstrate (1) that the MMR vaccine can, in general , contribute to causing chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction in autistic children, and (2) whether an MMR vaccination did contribute to the causa tion of Miche lle's own chronic GI symptoms . For the reasons set forth above, I conclude that the petit ioners in this case have failed to make a pe rsuasive c ase c oncer ning e ither issue.200 IX PETIT IONERS' EVIDENCE CONCERNING THE COMBINATION OF REGR ESSIVE AUTISM P LUS GASTROINTES TINAL DYSF UNCTION IS NOT PERSUASIVE In their post-hear ing briefs, the petitioners in this case have separately organized and prese nted t heir evidence conce rning their theorie s (1) that the M MR vaccine can contribute to the causa tion of autism , and (2) that the MMR vaccine can contribute to the causa tion of chronic gastrointesti nal dysfunction . Acc ording ly, in the sections of my opinion above, I have separately analy zed the evidenc e conc erning those two theories. Howeve r, I do recognize that, at a number of place s in their expert repor ts and their hearing testimony , the petitioners' experts indicate that these two causa tion alleg ations are closely intertwined . For example, Dr. Kinsbourne explained that a major part of his reasoning involved the fact that Mic helle Cedillo has experience d both chronic gastrointestinal problems and autism. He opined that because (1) the Unig enetics lab found evidenc e of persisting vaccine-stra in measles virus in Michelle's intestine, (2) the measles virus is prone to invade both the intestines and the brain, and Petitioners in their briefs have cited article s that indicate that children with regressive199 autism of ten have suffe red from GI symptoms. (P1, p. 230; P2, pp. 8-9, 21.) But that much is not in dispute, as noted above. I have examined those article s, but I conclude that those article s provide no signific ant evidenc e that the MMR vaccine can cause chronic GI symptoms, in autistic children or any one else . Petitioners have also alleg ed that Michelle's conditions of arthritis and uveitis were cause d200 by her MMR vaccination. (P1 at 229.) Howeve r, this claim is based completely on the petitioners' theory that Michelle has chronic MMR-cause d gastrointestinal inflammation. Having rejected that GI inflammation claim, I must also reject the claim that Michelle's arthritis and uveitis were vaccine- cause d. 162(3) Michelle has both chronic intestinal symptoms and autism, then the most reasonable conclusion is that a single causa tive agent--i.e., the vaccine-stra in measles virus--is the likely both chronic conditions. (Ex. 61, pp. 12-14.) Simi larly, Dr. Krigsman indicated the view that Michelle's autism and her chronic GI symptoms \"in fact represent a single systemic disease,\" cause d at least in part by the MMR vacc ine. (Ex. 59, p. 2.) As previously noted, this general idea, that there exists a group of children who suffe r from both autism and chronic GI dysfunction, both cause d by the MMR vaccine, derive s direc tly from the 1998 article by Dr. Wakefield and colleag ues. In that article , Wakefield posited the possible existence of a \"unique disease proce ss\" (Ex. P, Tab 152, p. 639) or \"syndrome\" (id. at 641) involving a comb ination of chronic GI dysfunction and autism. Since then, proponents of that theory have often used the term \"a utisti c ente rocolitis\" to ref er to that theor ized disease proc ess. Indeed, in this case Dr. Kinsbourne himself referred first to the 1998 Wakefield article in descr ibing his above- mentioned theory conce rning a \"sing le cause \" for both GI symptoms and regressive autism. (Ex. 61, p. 12.) Dr. Krigsman, as well, used the term \"autistic enter ocolitis,\" as well as the term \"ASD-G I disease\" (ASD meaning autism spectrum disor der), to descr ibe the category of children in which he believes Michelle to fall. (Ex. 59, pp. 7, 9.) Simi larly, Dr. Corbier, who testified in the Hazlehurst case, also propounded the theory that the combination of regressive autism and chronic GI dysfunction, coupled with the onset of symptoms relatively soon after MMR vaccination, supports a concl usion that the MMR vaccination played a role in causing both the autism and the GI dysfunction. ( E.g., Hazlehurst Ex. 313A-14A .) According ly, the purpose of this Section IX of this Decision is simply to point out that while in the pages above I have analy zed the autism and GI causa tion claims separately , as did the petitioners in their post-hear ing briefs, I have not failed to consider the argument of Dr. Kinsbourne and the others that the combination of the two conditions in a child supports the conclusion that both conditions resulted, at lea st in part, from the MMR vaccine. I have considere d that argument, but found it to be unpersua sive. First, both Dr. Kinsbourne' s and Dr. Krigsman's arguments, regarding a combination of the two types of conditions, are based, as stressed above, on the assumption of valid labora tory test results finding evidenc e of persisting vaccine-stra in measles virus in the autistic children' s intestinal tissue. Howeve r, since I have conclude d above that the Unig enetics testing is not reliable , both the general causa tion arguments of Drs. Kinsbourne and Krigsman, and their specific causa tion opinions in Michelle's c ase, must fa il for that re ason alone . Moreover, after considering the testimony of the petitioners' experts conce rning this \"combination\" argument in the overa ll context of the evidenc e in this case, I simply do not find this argument to be at all persua sive. In the pages above, I have examined in detail both the petitioners' evidenc e concer ning w hether the MMR vacc ine ca n contribute to the c ausation of autism , and the evidenc e conce rning whether the MMR vaccine can contribute to the causation of chronic 163gastrointesti nal dysfunction , and I have conclude d that the overa ll evidenc e strong ly contra dicts the petitioners' claims on both counts. The fact that some children have both types of conditions does not give me any more reason to conclude that either or both conditions were causa lly related to MMR vaccina tions. According ly, I reiterate that, after considering the argument of the petitioners' experts pointing to the combination of autism and GI dysfunction in a child as an indication that both conditions were vacc ine-re lated, I must reject that a rgument. X PETIT IONERS HAVE NOT DEMONSTRATED TH AT MICHELLE 'S MMR VACCIN ATION CONTRIBUTE D TO HER MENTAL RETARDATION OR HER SE IZUR E DISORDER Petitioners also have suggested that Michelle's MMR vaccination contributed to the causa tion of her mental retardation and her seizure disorder. This argument is completely deriva tive of their theory that the MMR vaccine cause d Michelle's autism . The petitioners note that both mental re tarda tion and seizure disorder s are statistically associate d with autism-- i.e., persons with autism are more likely to suffe r from those conditions than persons without autism. They also point out that both of those conditi ons, like autism, result from defective brain function. They theorize that whateve r injured Michelle's brain, causing her autism, also likely cause d her mental retardation and her seizure disorder . The problem for petitioners in this regard, of course , is that they have failed to demonstrate that the MMR vaccine contributed to the causa tion of Michelle's autism , for the reasons detailed above. There fore, their deriva tive argument, conce rning the causa tion of Michelle's mental retardation and se izure disorder, must fail as w ell. XI PETIT UMENT CONCERNING NOTATIONS OF raised an argument conce rning certain notations of physicians and other service- providers who examined or treated Michelle. (P1, pp. 191-98; P3, pp. 9-14.) Petitioners argue that those notations those individuals believed that Michelle's autism was vaccine-c aused. In this regard, I note that in the Capizzano opinion, the U.S. Court of Appea ls for the Federal Circuit stressed that \"medica l records and medical opinion testimon y are favor ed in vaccine cases, as treating physicians are likely to be in the best position to determine whether 'a logic al sequenc e of cause and effect shows that the vaccination was the reason for the injury .'\" 440 F.3d 1317, 1326 (Fed. C ir. 2006) (emphasis added, citatio n omitted). Simi larly, in sever al recent cases, judge s of this c ourt, in resolving Vaccine Act causa tion issues, have relied heavily upon the 164statements of treating physicians contained in the vaccinee' s medical records. E.g., Zatuchni v. Secretary of HHS, 69 Fed. Cl. 612, 623 (2006); Kelley v. Secre tary of HHS , 68 Fed. Cl. 84, 100 (2005). According ly, I have carefully studied those notations cited by petitioners. However , I conclude that they do not offer any substantial support to the petitioners' contentions that Michelle's autism, or any of her other c onditions, were va ccine -caused. Specifically, the petitioners quote nine notations in Michelle's records from eight individuals, including four physicians who treated Michelle and four non-phy sicians who Petitioners seem to urge that each of the notations indicates that the writer believed that Michelle's autism was vaccine-c aused. Howeve r, a close look at the quoted notations indicates that in none of those nine notations was the writer indicating such a causa tion opinion. First, in seven of the nine notations, the writer mere ly indicated awareness of a temporal relationship , betwee n Michelle's period of fever after the MMR vaccination and the appea rance of symptoms of Michelle's autism sometime there after. This is true of the notations from the records of the physicians Dr. Crawf ord and Dr. Lott; the first notation from the physician Dr. Gupta; and the notations by the non-phy sicians Lisa pist), and n (psycholog ist). None of those seven notations indicates the opinion that the vacc ination play ed a r ole in causing the autism.202 The second quoted notation from Dr. Gupta is from a letter in which Dr. Gupta replied to a letter from Michelle' s mother. In her letter, Mrs. Cedillo had appar ently asked whether Michelle might be exempted from vaccination require ments, and Dr. Gupta mere ly wrote that such an exemption could be arrang ed. (Ex. 24, p. 36.) Again, Dr. Gupta's letter in no way indicates that Dr. Gupta believed that Michelle's MMR vaccination caused Michelle's autism, or any of her other conditions. Petitioners refer to Ms. Ligio, Dr. Roth, and Dr. Freema n as \"phy sicians\" (P1, p. 198), but201 from the r ecords it appear s that the first is a non-phy sician audiolog ist who works for a physician, and the latter two are non-phy sician Ph.D. psy cholog ists. To be sure, when a physician notes, in a medical record, the existence of a temporal202 relationship between a vacc ination and a medic al symptom, that physician m ay well be indica ting a question in the phy sician's mi nd whether there is a causal relationship, or a suspicion that there might be a causa l relationship. Howeve r, that is quite different from an indication that such physician has reache d a conclusion conce rning a causa l relationship, or even believes such a relationship to be likely . In sever al Prog ram opini ons, judge s and special masters have not ed that the mere fact that a physician mentions a vaccination in a medical record, or notes that a symptom occur red soon after a vaccination, is not evidenc e that the physician causa lly attributed the symptom to the vaccination. E.g., Moberly v. Secre tary of HHS , No. 98-910V, slip op. at (Fed. Cl. Jan. 30, 2009); Caves v. Secre tary of HHS , No. 07-443V, slip op. at 8 (Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. Nov. 25, 2008); Carter v 2007). 165Finally , one of the quoted notations, from the neurolog ist Dr. William Masland, does express an opinion the MMR vaccine caused Michelle's autism. (P1, pp. 192-93.) Dr. Masland, writing after examining Michelle on May 2, 1997, noted that Michelle lost her speaking ability after her post-MMR fever episodes, and stated that \"it would appea r that there was some neurolog ical harm done at the time of the fevers;\" he added that \"given the overa ll history , it would appea r the neurolog ical problem now is depende nt upon the febrile episodes and is not a structura l or systemic problem, such as a chromosomal abnorma lity or one of the inborn errors of metabolism.\" (Ex. 28, p. 207.) These statements do indicate that at that time, Dr. Masland was theorizing that Michelle's episodes of fever play ed a r ole in causing neurolog ical har m to her. Howe ver, D r. Masland a dded that \"[w]hether this was a post-immuniz ation phenomenon or a separ ate occur rence, would be very difficult to say.\" (Id.) That last statement, thus, indicates that Dr. Masland was unsure whether the fevers were cause d by the MMR vaccine or by an unspecifie d \"sepa rate occur rence.\" (Id.) Further, at that poi nt in time, Dr. Masland believed t hat Michelle was suffe ring only from an \"impairment of auditory perc eption.\" ( Id.) No one had y et diag nosed Michelle w ith autism . Thus, while Dr. Masland definitely did suspect on May 2, 1997, that Michelle's \"fevers\" might have cause d neurolog ical harm, he did not necessar ily attribute her \"fevers\" to the MMR vaccination. Further, at that early point in time Dr. Masland did not even yet know that Michelle's203 condition constituted autism. According ly, those specula tions of Dr. Masland hardly constitute signific ant evidenc e that Michelle's autism was vaccine-c aused. We do not know what Dr. Masland's later opinion, once he had all the facts, would have been. And, in contra st, responde nt in this case has prese nted the opinions of a number of experts with very impressive credenti als conce rning autism, who have studied not only all the facts of Michelle's case, but also the vast amount of evidenc e conce rning the general issue of whether the MMR vacc ine ca n cause autism. Those experts have stated unequivoca lly that the MMR vaccine did not cause Michelle's autism, and they have been willing to defend that opinion in open court, under oath and under cross-e xamination. It seems astonishing for petitioners to now suggest that Dr. Masland's extremely brief, unexplained specula tions contained in his letter of May 2, 1997, should be held to outweig h the opinions of those experts of responde nt. In short, I have carefully evalua ted this argument of petitioners conce rning the cited notations in the medical records, but those notations do not chang e my conclusions conce rning any of the causa tion alleg ations raised by the petitioners in this case.204 Note that the expert with the most impressive credentials in study ing the measles virus and203 MMR vaccine, Dr. Griff in, opined that while Michelle's first post-MMR episode of fever likely did result from that va ccina tion, her second febrile episode, a few days later, likely was not a result of the MMR. (Tr. 2816A.) Thus, perha ps Dr. Masland's reference to a \"sepa rate occur rence\" indicates that he, too, doubted that the se cond fe brile episode w as related to the MMR vacc ination. In their R PROGR AM CA SES As another argument in their briefs in this case, the petitioners raise a contention entitled \"Miche lle is like other vaccine-injured children who have been compensa ted chief ly of a list of 22 Prog ram c ases in which a vaccinee' s injury or condition was found to be vaccine-c aused. Petitioners contend that Michelle is \"like\" those vaccinees who were compensa ted for their injuries, so that there fore Michelle should be compe nsated for her me dical conditions. I find no merit to this argument. Michelle's case bears no resemblance at all to most of the cited cases, except for the fact that each case involved an alleg ation of \"causation-in-fa ct.\" It is true that seven of the cited cases involved MMR vaccines which were found to have cause d various neurolog ic conditions, and that Michelle, too, suffe rs from a neurolog ic abnorma lity. Howeve r, the theories of proof involved in those seven cases bear no resemblanc e whatsoever to the petitioners' theory of causa tion in this case. Petitioners have not suggested any simil arity in the theories of proof, and I have found none. None of those cases involved a theory that the vaccine-stra in measles virus, or any vaccine-stra in virus, can persist in the body and there by cause chronic disturbance s in the g ut or the bra in. In effect, the logic of this fina l argument of the petitioners seems to be simply that because some injuries or conditions have be en found by specia l masters of this court to be vac cine- cause d, (...continued)204 petitioners do not mention Dr. Krigsman. Dr. Krigsman, howeve r, is a physician who did treat Michelle on at least one occasion in person, in September of 2003, and who supervised Michelle's gastrointestinal care by telephone and e-ma il for some time there after. And Dr. Krigsman has opined that Michelle's g astrointestinal problems have been c aused by the MMR vacc ine. Howeve r, it is notew orthy that Dr. Kr igsma n was not a phy sician who mer ely happene d to treat Michelle in the ordinar y course of her illness. Base d on the statements of Miche lle's mother (see Tr. 256, 322-27), it appea rs that Mrs. Cedillo soug ht Dr. Krigsman out, even flying cross- country to see him, precisely because Dr. Kr igsma n was a known proponent of the theory that the MMR vaccine can c ause a utism and ga strointestinal dy sfunction. It is not surprising that some parents, like the Cedillos, after becoming interested in vaccine- autism causa tion theories through their own I nterne t research, may seek out those phy sicians who have taken such a public stance . Howeve r, I do not find it likely that the judge s who wrote the Capizzano , Zatuchni , Kelley , and that type of physician-se lection proce ss in mind when they wrote of the importance of the opinions of \"tre ating physicians.\" In any event, I have fully considere d Dr. Krigsman's repor t and testimony , and I have simply found his prese ntation, \"treating physician\" though he may be, to be very unpersuasive , for reasons set forth a bove. 167based upon expert testimony , temporal relations hips, and other circumstantial evidenc e, then all \"causation-in-fa ct\" claims should be found merit orious. This contention is without merit. Petitioners neglect to mention that while i t is true that a subst antial num ber of \"causation-in-fa ct\" claims have been found meritorious over the 20-year history of the Prog ram, it is also true that many more such claims, numbering in the thousands, have been rejec ted by specia l masters. The fact is, of course, that in each case the specia l masters must evalua te the particular evidenc e and the particular causa tion theory prese nted, and deter mine whether it is \"more probable than not\" that the vaccination in question contributed substantially to the causa tion of the injury alleg ed. In some cases the specia l master will find that a causa l connec tion has been shown, to the necessary level of probability , and in some ca ses the spec ial master will not.205 In this case, the petitioners have advanc ed a the ory of ca usation quite unlike any causa tion theory that I have previously seen in the 20 years of the Prog ram's history . I have carefully evalua ted that theory . Based upon all of the e vidence , I have f ound that theory to be without merit. XIII PETIT IONERS' CASE FAILS THE ALTHEN TES T A. The Althen test In its ruling in Althen , the U.S. Court of Appea ls for the Federal Circuit discussed the \"causation-in-fa ct\" issue in Va ccine Act ca ses. The c ourt stated as f ollows: Concisely stated, Althen's burden is to show by preponde rant evidenc e that the vaccination broug ht about her injury by providing : (1) a medical theory causa lly connec ting the vaccination and the injury ; (2) a logic al sequenc e of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury ; and (3) a showing of a proxi mate temporal relationship betwee n vaccination and injury . If Althen satisfies this burden, she is \"entitled to recover unless the [gover nment] shows, also by a preponde rance of evidenc e, that the injury was in fact cause d by factors unrela ted to the vac cine.\" 1274, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citations omitted). In the pages above, I have already set forth in detail my analy sis in rejecting petitioners' \"causation-in-fa ct\" theories in this case. In this section of my Decision, then, I will briefly explain how that analy sis fits specifically within the three prong s of the Althen test, enumer ated in the first sentenc e of the Althen excerpt set forth above. The short answe r is that while the Althen test has been the subject of slightly varying interpre tations, under any causa tion evidenc e in this case would fall fa r short of sa tisfying the test. I note that I myself have made finding s in favor of causa tion-in-fac t contentions in many205 Prog ram c ases, a nd have a causa tion-in-fac t claims. 168B. Appli cation of Althen Prongs 1 an d 2 to thi s case One interpre tative issue with the Althen test conce rns the relationship betwee n the first two elements of that test. The first two prong s of the Althen test, as noted above, are that the petitioners must provide \"(1) a medical theory causa lly connec ting the vaccination and the injury ,\" and \"(2) a logic al sequenc e of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury .\" Initially , it is not absolutely clear how the two prong s differ from each other. That is, on their faces, each of the two prong s seems to require a demonstration of a \"causal\" connect ion betwee n \"the vaccination\" and \"the injury .\" Howeve r, a number of Prog ram opinions have conclude d that these first two elements reflect the analy tical distinction that has been descr ibed as the \"can cause \" vs. \"did cause \" distinction. That is, in many Prog ram opinions issued prior to Althen involving \"causation- in-fac t\" issues, specia l masters or judge s stated that a pe titioner need de monstrate (1) that the type of vac cination in question can cause the type of injury in question, and also (2) tha t the particular vaccination received by the specific vaccinee did cause the vaccinee' s own injury . E.g., Kuperus v. n.42 (Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. Aug. 8, 2002). (As an example of the \"can cause /did cause \" distinction, in this very case the petitioners have attempted to demonstrate (1) that the MMR vaccine can cause autism, in general, and (2) that Michelle's particula r MMR vaccination of December 20, 1995, did cause her own autism.) Thus, a number of judge s and specia l masters of this court have conclude d that Prong 1 of Althen is the \"ca n cause \" requirement, a nd Prong 2 of Althen is the \"did ca use\" r equire ment. See, e.g., Doe 11 v. Secre tary of HHS , *24 (Fed. Cl. Spec. Mst r. July 20, 2007). And, m ost importantly , the Fede ral Cir cuit itself it?\" test, used by the specia l master in that case, was equivalent to the first two prong s of the Althen test. Pafford v. Secretary of HHS , 451 F.3d 1352, 1355-56 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Thus, interpre ting the first two prong s of Althen as specifie d in Pafford , under Prong 1 of Althen a petitioner must demonstrate that the type of vaccination in question can cause the type of condition in question, and under Prong 2 of Althen that petitioner must then demonstrate that the particular vaccination did cause the particular condition of the va ccine e in question. A few decisions of judge s and specia l masters have discu ssed issues with respe ct to the precise interpre tation of Prong s 1 and 2 of Althen . E.g., Doe 11, 83 Fed. Cl. at 173-74; Scott v. Secre tary Cl. 2008). Howeve r, it is not necessary , in this case, to delve into any such pot ential interpre tative i put forwa rd in this case could not satisfy any of the prong s of the Althen test. 169That is, as set forth in detail above, I have conclude d that petitioners have fallen far, far short of demonstrating either that the MMR vaccination can contribute, in general, to the causa tion of either autism or chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction , or that her MMR vaccination did contribute to the causa tion of Miche lle Cedillo's own autism and GI symptoms. Thus, petitioners' arguments conc erning all of those causa tion issues would fail under virtually any interpre tation of Althen's Prong s 1 and 2. Moreove r, there can be no doubt whatsoeve r that the Althen test ultimately require s that, as an overall matter , a petitioner must demonstrate that it is more probable than not that the particula r vaccine was a substantial contributing factor in causing the particula r injury in question. That is clear from the statute itself, which states that the elements of a petitioner's case must be established by a \"prepondera nce evidenc e.\" \u00a7 300aa- 13(a) (1)(A). And, regardle ss of the precise meaning of Prong s 1 and 2 of Althen , in this case the overa ll evidenc e falls far, far short of demonstrating that it is \"more probable than not\" that the MMR vaccine contributed to the causa tion either C. Appli cation of Prong 3 to th is case Finally , petitioners have also failed to satisfy the third element of Althen , as to either their autism claim or their c laim conce rning gastrointestinal sy mptoms. The third element of the Althen test, set forth above, require s \"a showing of a proxi mate temporal relationship betwe en vaccination and injury .\" 418 F.3d at 1278. That is, under this third element of the Althen test, the petitioners would need to demonstrate that the first symptoms of Michelle's autism, a nd/or the first symptoms of he r chronic g astrointestinal problems, occur red in a time frame that would be consistent with ca usation by the MMR vacc ination in question.206 In this regard, I must again separate my discussion conce rning the petitioners' two major causa tion claims, relating to (1) autism and (2) chronic gastrointestinal difficulties. Concerning the autism claim, as discussed above (p. 101), Dr. Kinsbourne's testimony failed to e stablish, even to the level of \"more probable than not,\" what might be an appropr iate time period , in general , betwee n MMR vaccination and the onset of symptoms of autism, under his causa tion theory . To be sure, Dr. Kinsbourne did indicate that the onset of autism at any time within three months after vaccination would be an appropr iate time pe riod. (Tr. 1176-78A.) Howeve r, Dr. Kinsbourne also admitted that he really has no idea how long it would likely take, as a matter of patholog ic proce ss or physiologic proce ss, for a measles virus enter ing the body via MMR vaccination to reach the brain. (Tr. 1146-47.) Thus, Dr. Kinsbourne, by acknow ledging that he does not know how long it would take the measles virus to reach the brain after MMR vaccination, has, in effect, acknow ledged that he really doesn't know what would be the appropr iate time period for onset of an autism In other words, the petitioners must demonstrate the existence of a \"scie ntific as discussed in an MMR vaccination. He acknow ledged, in effect, that he is mere ly guessing or speculating when he indicates that, as a general matter, the onset of autism symptoms anytime within three months afte r vac cination would be a ppropriate . as to Miche lle's own case, Dr. Kinsbourne was simply shown to be wrong in his assumption that the first symptoms of Michelle's autism appea red in the first sever al weeks following her MMR vaccination. To the contra ry, as explained above, I conclude that Michelle was already exhibi ting signs of autism even prior to the MMR vaccination. (See pp. 127-30, above.)207 According ly, for both of the reasons descr ibed in the previous two paragraphs, Dr. Kinsbourne 's testimony has fa iled to satisfy Prong 3 of Althen as to Michelle' s autism . Next, conce rning the claim as to chronic gastrointesti nal symptoms , again the petitioners have failed to show that the first symptoms of Michelle's chronic gastrointestinal symptoms occur red in a time frame that would be consistent with causa tion by Michelle's MMR vaccination. First, Dr. Krigsman never even attempted to state what would be an appropr iate time period after vaccination, in general , for the onset of vaccine-c aused gastrointestinal symptoms after MMR vaccination. Dr. Krigsman did testify that Michelle's chronic diarrhea , which he assumed to be the beginning of her chronic gastrointestinal symptoms, began about 18 to 20 days after her MMR vaccination, and then continued for years there after. (Ex. 59, p. 6; Tr. 509.) This seems to indicate that he believes that such a time frame, about 20 days post-vacc ination, would be appropr iate for the onset of MMR-cause d gastrointestinal symptoms. Howeve r, as noted above, Dr. Krigsman was complete ly wrong in his assumption as to when Michelle's chronic gastrointestinal symptoms actually did begin, since, in fact, Michelle's e xtended pe riod of chronic diarrhea actua lly did not begin until more than three years later . (See p. 149 above.) There fore, petitioners have also failed to demonstrate that Michelle's chronic gastrointesti nal symptoms began in a time frame that would be consistent with causa tion by the MMR vaccine, and thus have failed prong (3) as to that causa tion theory as we ll. D. Sum mary conce rning application of Althen elements to thi s case According ly, for the reasons explained above, I conclude that as to both of their causation theories, concerning Michelle's autism and Michelle's chronic gastroint estinal symptoms, petitioners clearly have f ailed to satisfy any of the thre e prong s of the Althen test.208 Dr. Kinsbourne made it clear that for him to provide a causa tion opinion, the first207 symptoms of the child's autism must appea r during the time period soon after vaccination. He stated that if there were symptoms of a utism prece ding the vaccination, he could not attribute the autism to the vacc ination. ( Snyder Tr. 536A- 37A.) Because the petitioners to \u00a7 300aa- (1)(A ), of208 demonstrating that any of Michelle's vaccinations played any role in causing any of her medical (continued...) 171E. Legal argum ents raised by petitioners In their initial post-hear ing brief filed in this case, petitioners set forth some general discussion of the legal considera tions in a causa tion-in-fac t case, under the Prog ram statute and the Althen test. (P1, pp. 172-187.) Most of their points are correct statements of the applicable law. As petitioners stress, their burden is to demonstrate causa tion by a \"prepondera nce of , 418 F.3d at 1279. They need not demonstrate that the vaccination was the sole cause or even a predominant cause of Michelle's conditions, but only that it was a \"substantial factor\" in causing any of her conditions, and a \"but for\" cause . . Petitioners' causa tion need not necessarily be supported by epidemiolog ic evidenc e or othe r medica l literature, but could, in appropr iate circumstances, be accomplished by medical opinion and/or circumstantial evidenc e. Althen , 418 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Petitioners need not demonstrate the exact biologica l mechanism of causa tion. Knudsen v. Secre tary of HHS , 35 F.3d 543, 549 (Fed. Cir. 1994). And the Federal Circuit has also stated that \"close calls regarding causation are resolved in favor of injured claimants.\" Althen , 418 F.3d at 1280. I have kept all of these points in mind in deciding this case. I have not require d a level of proof gr eater than \"more probable t han not,\" which has also been describe d as \"50 percent plus a feather.\" I understand fully that petitioners are not alleg ing that the MMR vaccine was the sole cause of Michell e's disorders, but are alleg ing only that the vaccine contributed to the causa tion of her disorders, possibly in conce rt with an underly ing genetic vulnera bility. I have looked beyond the epidemiologic evidenc e to deter mine whether the overall evide nce--i.e., medical opinion and circumstantial evidenc e and other evidenc e considere d as a whole --tips the balanc e even slightly in favor of a c ausation showing as to any of Michelle' s conditions. This case, howeve r, is not a close case. The overa ll weight of the evidenc e is overwhelmingly contrary to the petitioners' causa tion theories. The result of this case would be the same even if I totally ignor ed the epidemiolog ic evidenc e, declined to consider the video evidenc e, and/or excluded the testimony of Dr. Bustin. The result would be the same if I restric ted my consideration to the evidence origina lly filed i nto the record of this Cedillo case, disreg arding the general causa tion evidenc the Hazlehurst and Snyder cases. The petitioners' evidenc e has been unpersua sive on many differ ent points, conce rning virtually all aspec ts of their causa tion theories, each such defic iency having been discussed in detail above. The petitioners have failed to persua de me that there is validity to any of their general causation arguments, and have also failed to persua de me that there is any substantial likelihood that Michelle's MMR vaccination contributed in any way to the causa tion of any of Miche lle's own disorders . To the contra ry, based upon all the (...continued)208 conditions, the burden never shifted to responde nt to establish an \"alter native cause \" for Michelle's conditions. ed. Cir. 2008). 172evidenc e that I have revie wed, I find that it is extre mely unlikely that any of Michelle's disorders were in any way causa lly connec ted to her MMR vac cination, or a ny other va ccina tion. In short, this is a case in which the evidenc e is so one-sided that any nuance s in the interpre tation of the ca usation case law would make no differ ence to the outcome of the case . XIV CONCLUSION The record of this case demonstrates plainly that Michelle Cedillo and her family have been though a t ragic and painful ordea l. I had the opportunity , in the courtroom during the evidentiary hearing, to meet and to observe both of Michelle's parents, and a number of other family members as well. I have also studied the records descr ibing Michelle's medical history , and the efforts of her family in caring for her. Based upon those experience s, I am deeply impressed by the very loving, caring, and coura geous nature of the Cedillo family . Those family members clearly have done a wonder ful job of coping with Michelle's conditions, and in caring for her with great love. I admire them g reatly for their dedica tion to Mi chelle' s welfa re. Nor do I doubt that Michelle's parents and relatives are sincere in their belief that the MMR vaccine played a role in causing Michelle's devasta ting disorders. Certainly, the mere fact that Michelle's autistic symptoms first became evident to her family during the months after her MMR vaccination might make them wonder about a possible causa l connec tion. Further, the Cedillos have read about physicians who profe ss to believe in a causa l connec tion betwee n the MMR vaccine and both autism and chronic gastrointest inal problems. They have visited at least one physician, Dr. Krigsman, who has expli citly opined that Michelle's own chronic gastrointestinal symptoms are MMR-cause d. And they have even been told that a medical labora tory has positively identified the prese nce of the persist ing vaccine-stra in measles virus in Michelle's body , years after her vaccination. After study ing the extensive evidenc e in this case for many months, I am convinced that the repor ts and advic e given to the Cedillos by Dr. Krigsman and some other physicians, advising the Cedillos that there is a causa l connec tion Michelle's MMR vaccination been very wrong . Unfortuna tely, the Cedillos have been misled by physicians who are guilty, in my view, of gross medical misjudgment. Neve rtheless, I can understand why the Cedillos found such repor ts and advice to be believable under the circumstances. I conclude that the Cedillos filed this P rogram c laim in good f aith. Thus, I feel deep sympathy and admiration for the Cedillo family . And I have no doubt that the famili es of countless other autistic children, families that cope ever y day with the treme ndous challeng es of caring for autistic children, are simil arly deser ving of sympathy and admiration. Howeve r, I must decide this case not on sentiment, but by analy zing the evidence. Congress desig ned the Prog ram to compensa te only the families of those individuals whose injuries or deaths can be linked causa lly, either by a Table Injury presumption or by a preponde rance of causa tion-in- fact evidenc e, to a listed vaccination. In this case the evidenc e advanc ed by the petitioners has fallen 173far short of demonstrating such a link. According ly, I conclude that the petitioners in this case are not entitled to a Prog ram a ward on Michelle's be half.209 /s/ Georg L. Hasting s, Jr. ___________________________________ Geor ge L.
