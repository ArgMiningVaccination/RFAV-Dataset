Rotavirus gastroenteritis is a leading cause of infant death in the developing world. Since its discovery in 1963 and its later recognition as a human pathogen, rotavirus has been rec-ognized as the leading cause of infectious gastroenteritis worldwide, including in developedcountries. Although improvements in the quality of water, housing, and sanitary infrastruc- tures and the use of antimicrobial therapy have reduced the frequency of gastrointestinal disease caused by other enteric pathogens, the magnitude of rotavirus infection has re-mained unchallenged. However, in recent years, the introduction of live-attenuated rotavirus vaccines has re- sulted in a signi cant reduction in the number of cases of severe gastroenteritis in developed as well as developing countries where the use of vaccine has been introduced. A decreasein infant deaths caused by gastroenteritis has already been observed in some developingcountries. The development of vaccines was possible only because of a better understanding of antigenic determinants and molecular structure of the virus, and through an enhancedknowledge of the complex pathogenesis behind this viral infection. In the future, thisknowledge may allow scientists to design new antiviral treatment modalities for those chil- dren with severe disease, especially those who are malnour-ished or are immunocompromised, with conditions thatresult in a suboptimal immune response to the vaccine, orin situations in which the vaccine would be contraindicated. Although current vaccines have demonstrable effective- ness, assessments of changes in strain ecology, which maylead to lesser effectiveness of vaccine programs, are takingplace. We will summarize the existing knowledge on rotavirus, its disease and complications, its changing epidemiology andpathogenesis, and the development of preventive and ther-apeutic strategies. protein WHO: World Health Organization *Ryan White Center for Pediatric Infectious Disease, Indiana University School of Medicine, Riley Hospital for Children, Indianapolis, IN.Article gastrointestinal disorders Pediatrics in Review Vol.33 No.10 October 2012 439 at Health Sciences Library State Univ Of New York on February 20, 2013 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from Epidemiology Acute gastroenteritis caused by rotavirus is an extremely common illness of childhood, with 72% of cases occur-ring in children younger than age 5 years. (1) Rotavirus infection is the most common cause of hospitalizations for acute gastroenteritis, accounting for 30% to 70% of all such admissions. Ninety- ve percent of children in the United States have had a case of rotavirus infection by age 5 years, with 1/67 to 1/85 having been hospital- ized by that time. This prevalence translates to 55,000 to 75,000 admissions per year, 75% of which are in those younger than 2 years old. Length of stay averages vary according to age, with children under 2 years of age hos-pitalized for 3 days and 2- to 4-year-olds for 2 days. Three percent to 5% of adult gastroenteritis admissions are due to rotavirus infection. Rotavirus is responsible for 40% of all outpatient visits for diarrhea. Annually, rotavirus costs w$1 billion to the health-care system. European studies have revealed a very similar inci- dence of rotavirus when compared with the UnitedStates. As a matter of fact, the incidence globally mirrors that seen in the United States. There seems to be no dif- ference in infection rates between the developing anddeveloped worlds, indicating that improved sanitation is unlikely to decrease incidence. (1) Overall, there are an estimated 111 million episodes of rotavirus annually that require some sort of home care, 25 million clinic vis- its, and 2 million admissions per year. In Africa alone,rotavirus accounts for one third of all hospital admis- sions. The result of this global rotavirus disease burden is 440,000 to 600,000 deaths each year. The majority of deaths are in Asia and Africa with 23% of the associ- ated deaths occurring in India alone. Only 20 to 60 deaths are attributed to rotavirus in the United States annually. Hospital-acquired cases also make a signi cant contri- bution to the overall disease burden, with estimatedevents of 10.7% in the younger-than-2-years-old popula-tion and 4.8% in the 2- to 4-year-old age group. (1) Ac- tual rates have been estimated at 0.46 to 15.8/1,000 patient days. Hospital-acquired infections account for w27% of the total rotavirus hospital burden annually, which correlates with one out of every three cases in the hospital occurring in a patient admitted for another diagnosis. These rates have remained stable for the last20 years, indicating that increased efforts to promote hand hygiene likely have little impact on nosocomial spread. Rotavirus is three times more likely than in fluenza and six times more likely than respiratory syncytial virusto be transmitted nosocomially.It is likely that the epidemiology of rotavirus cases is underestimated because many children are managed clin- ically without complete diagnostic testing, and the com-prehensive coding necessary for adequate tracking forepidemiologic purposes is possibly lacking. Transmission Rotavirus tends to peak in late winter or early spring,whenw83% of cases occur. (1) In the United States, the disease generally used to begin in the southwest inNovember or December and spread in a north and eastpattern until it completed its course in the northeast inApril or May. However, since the introduction of rotavi- rus vaccines, this spatiotemporal pattern is becoming less evident. (2) Although in warmer climates infections areobserved year long, some seasonality may be noted still.The main route of spread is fecal -oral. Transmission is compounded by close person-to-person contact and con-tact with contaminated environmental surfaces. Transmission is very effective due to several factors, in- cluding large numbers of virions being shed in the stool, a low infectious dose required, and prolonged asymptom- atic shedding for as long as 3 weeks. Only 1 to 10 organ-isms must survive to infect the bowel, so neutralization bygastric acid is likely to be incomplete. Within households,w20% of adult contacts will develop symptoms owing toeasy transmission. There is also some suggestion that airborne transmis- sion can occur in the cooler months. Virus has been iso- lated from the respiratory tract and may even aerosolize with emesis. Airborne transmission also has been postu-lated to contribute to hospital-acquired infections withrotavirus because hand hygiene and isolation have not de-terred rates over several years. Very rarely, outbreaks haveoccurred related to contaminated food and water. Virology Before understanding the pathogenesis of the disease andhow best to treat and prevent it, knowledge of the struc-tural components of rotavirus is imperative. Rotavirus is a member of the Reoviridae family. Its name comes from its\"wheel-like \"appearance. Seven rotavirus groups, A through G, have been identi ed. Group A causes most human disease. Rotavirus contains 11 segments of double-stranded RNA. These segments are responsiblefor the six structural (viral proteins [VPs]) and six non-structural proteins (NSPs) that comprise the complextriple-layered capsid structure. NSPs are produced within infected cells and function in the replication cycle of the virus, interacting with hostgastrointestinal disorders rotavirus 440 Pediatrics in Review Vol.33 No.10 October 2012 at Health Sciences Library State Univ Of New York on February 20, 2013 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from proteins and modulating pathogenesis, and they may be responsible for immune responses to infection. VP7 forms the outer capsid protein structure of the virus,whereas VP4 forms spikes through the surface of the vi-rus. Both induce neutralizing antibodies, which may pro-tect against future disease. VPs are used to classify rotavirus. antigen) are used for classi cation, which can be a bit confusing. This differentiation can beachieved through the use of neutralization and genotypesequencing assays. Viruses usually are referred to by theirG-serotype alone (for example, G1, G2, G3, etc). P types also are determined by similar typing methods, but results may not be concordant; so a dual system isused for their classi cation. P serotypes are referred to by numbers (for example, P1, P2, etc), and P genotypes are denoted in brackets (P[8], P[4], etc). P genotyping the preferred classi cation method because P serotype as- says are dif cult to standardize. There are at least 19 G and 28 [P] known types. At least 11 VP4 P types and 10 VP7 types have been isolatedfrom humans. Many combinations of these may occurin nature. However, not all infect humans. In human dis-ease, four combinations are responsible for w90% of distribution of these types also varies. Theemergence and distribution of newer types may be in flu- enced by immune selection, which may result from vac-cine use. (3) As mentioned, NSPs are responsible for much of the pathogenicity of the virus. NSP3 has been associated withsystemic spread, whereas NSP2 (and NSP5 and 6) are in- volved with the formation of cytoplasmic viroplasms. NSP4 is a key enterotoxin responsible for cellular death,as well as secretory and nondividing mature enterocytes cells are responsible for diges- tive and absorptive functions. In flammatory changes usu- ally are mild, if present. Although malabsorption has been considered the main end result of infection, a more com-plex multifactorial process is responsible for the diarrhealillness and its systemic complications. The absorption of sodium and water and the release of digestive enzymes are decreased. Undigested mono- anddisaccharides, carbohydrates, fat, and protein pass in the colon, resulting in diarrhea. In addition, the enterotoxin NSP4 has been found to block the function of the entericnervous system, resulting in the active secretion of fluids into the lumen of the intestine. This effect results fromthe release of calcium within the cells as well as the disrup-tion of the integrity of the tight junction between cells. Viremia occurs during rotavirus infection. Extraintes- tinal disease may be the end result in some children. Ro-tavirus antigenemia was detected in 90% of children withrotavirus-positive stools. Infectious virus was detected in100% of sera from serum antigen-positive children. The amount of antigenemia detected was inversely propor- tional to the amount of antirotavirus immunoglobulinA the serum. Rotavirus-speci c intes- immunoglobulin A is responsible for protectionagainst subsequent infection. CD8\u00fe T cells help shorten the course of primary infections. Interferon also may helpcontain the severity of rotavirus infection and prevent sys-temic spread. Clinical Presentation The incubation period of rotavirus is 1 to 3 days. Gener-ally, symptoms begin abruptly with vomiting and diarrhea.However, there is a wide clinical spectrum, includingasymptomatic disease, depending on the infecting geno-type. Vomiting usually dissipates within 1 to 2 days asgastric emptying improves, but diarrhea persists for an av- erage of 5 to 8 days, with a range extending as long as 21 days. The diarrhea is both osmotic and secretory innature and can result in 8 to 20 stools per day. The stoolsare malodorous and very watery, but blood is a rare nd- ing. Fever will occur in approximately one third of in-fected individuals. Duration of symptoms is w3t o7 days, although shedding can continue asymptomaticallyfor several weeks. Rotavirus is much more likely to lead to dehydration compared with other viral causes of diarrheal illness dueto the volume of diarrhea it induces. Severity of diseasecorrelates with age at rst onset. If the rst infection oc- curs between 3 and 35 months of age, it is likely to be ofthe most severe variety. At this age, infection can progressall the way to necrotizing enterocolitis. As many as 30%to 40% of necrotizing enterocolitis cases could be second- ary to rotavirus infection. Less severe infections in young infants (younger than 3 months of age) likely are due totransplacental maternal antibodies. Although repeat in-fections can occur throughout life, protective immunityameliorates serious disease after one to two infections,which correlates with fewer hospitalizations for thoseolder than 5 years. Extraintestinal manifestations of rotavirus, although rare, have been described. Encephalitis, encephalopathy,benign seizures, myositis, poliomyelitis-like paralysisgastrointestinal disorders rotavirus Pediatrics in Review Vol.33 No.10 October 2012 441 at Health Sciences Library State Univ Of New York on February 20, 2013 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from have been reported. Bacterial bloodstream infections may occur as a complication of rotavirus. Certain populations have been studied extensively with regard to rotavirus, including patients having various forms of immunode ciency. In severe combined immu- node ciency (SCID) disease, the incidence of rotavirus infection is w1 in 50,000 to 100,000. In both SCID and HIV-infected patients, the severity of clinical illnessappears to be consistent with that seen in nonimmunode- cient counterparts, although both the symptomatic pe- riod and the shedding phase can continue for signi cantly longer periods. Chronic diarrhea may develop, and hep- atitis has been described more frequently in immuno-compromised children. Diagnosis Most children with less-than-severe nonbloody gastroen- teritis will not require a diagnostic evaluation. Most rotavirus infections are diagnosed solely on the basis ofclinical ndings. Rotavirus was identi edrst by direct visualization via electron microscopy. This method ishighly sensitive and speci c. However, its utility in the evaluation of large sample numbers during the peak sea-son is encumbered by the slowness of direct visualizationtechniques. Specialized equipment and highly trained op- erators are required also, making this choice an impracti- cal method during peak season. Antigen techniques, including enzyme immunoassay and latex agglutination, are widely commercially avail-able. Enzyme and latex agglutination testscan be performed on fresh stool specimens sent in cleancontainers with no preservatives or media. These assaysare easy, fast, and have high sensitivity and speci city (70%- 98%). The tests are extremely reliable in the rst few days of illness when the viral load is high and havean excellent positive predictive value in the peak season. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tech- nology is available in research laboratories. This testinghas the greatest potential for sensitivity and speci city and can be run on small specimens with few virions, mak-ing it superior for diagnosis late in the disease course. However, its expense and risk of cross-contamination, as well as limited availability, make it a rare commodity. Culture generally is not done in diagnostic laborato- ries because cell cultures for the most part are resistantto infection by rotavirus virions. With the antigen techni-ques being excellent performers as well as inexpensive,cultures offer little additional value. Serologic tests areused only for grouping new isolates, de ning epidemiol- ogy, or furthering research issues and are not useful inclinical diagnosis.Techniques such as culture, electron microscopy, and polymerase chain reaction are not used routinely.However, these procedures may be of clinical utility inoutbreak investigations or when infections in immuno-compromised hosts may be related to vaccine strains.Testing also may be bene cial in patients with extraintes- tinal complications such as hepatitis, pneumonitis, en-cephalopathy, and convulsions. Caution is merited whenevaluating infants with gastroenteritis who have recently received oral rotavirus vaccine. These infants may have detectable vaccine-derived antigen 3 to 9 days after vac-cination, whereas peak shedding is observed 6 to 8 dayspostvaccination. Treatment Supportive Care The management of rotavirus gastroenteritis is support- ive. Fluid replacement, nutritional support, and symp- tomatic relief are the key components of this therapy.The infant over age 3 months is more likely to requiresupport because these patients are more likely to have se-vere disease. Most patients can be managed at homethrough the use of oral fluids (oral rehydration solutions [ORSs]). Even patients with vomiting can be hydratedeffectively by mouth. A nasogastric tube can be used in children unable to take fluids by mouth. Children who are not dehydrated or vomiting should continue to take their usual diets. Children who are severely dehydrated orhave persistent vomiting will need intravenous fluids. A detailed discussion of fluid management is beyond the scope of this publication. Readers are encouraged to re-view excellent sources of information for further assis-tance on this key component of supportive therapy (see Suggested Reading). Probiotics Probiotics have been used to \"treat \"rotavirus gastroen- teritis. A randomized double blind-controlled hospitalized children revealed that probiotics de- creased the duration of diarrhea when compared with ORS therapy alone. Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG appeared to be the most effective product. Yogurt fluid treatment and Saccharomyces boulardii were comparably effective in the treatment of acute nonbloody diarrhea inchildren, but the duration of diarrhea was shorter in thosereceiving S boulardii . Immunoglobulins The oral administration of immunoglobulin was associ-ated with a faster recovery from acute gastroenteritisgastrointestinal disorders rotavirus 442 Pediatrics in Review Vol.33 No.10 October 2012 at Health Sciences Library State Univ Of New York on February 20, 2013 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from when compared with a placebo. This modality of treat- ment has been used in children with chronic diarrhea, fre- quently among immunocompromised children. Nitazoxanide Of interest, when andGiardia, in combination with probiotics, the median dura-tion of hospitalization and duration of diarrhea weresignicantly reduced when compared with ORS therapy alone. Prevention Therst lines of defense against any infectious disease are hand hygiene and sanitation efforts. Rotavirus infection is no exception. However, the incidence of rotavirus has not been attenuated in areas of improved hygieneand sanitation, likely due in part to the small numberof virions required to cause symptomatic infection. Con-tact isolation and appropriate cleaning of environmentalsurfaces, however, must be maintained. Due to the heavy disease burden, morbidity, and costs associated with rotavirus infection, it is reasonable to as- sume that if the protection afforded by natural infection were to be duplicated, disease could be attenuated signif-icantly and possibly prevented. Additionally, the vaccinecould have a substantial priming effect if, after being im-munized, children who are then exposed to circulatingwild type virus might have a boosted immune responseas a result. Rotavirus Vaccines Therstrotavirusvaccine(RotaShield,Wyeth-AyerstPhar- maceuticals, Philadelphia, PA) was licensed in the UnitedStates in 1998 but was withdrawn a year later due to con-cerns over increased risks of intussusception. Currently,there are two vaccines available commercially in the UnitedStates andin many other countries(Table Rotarix; GlaxoSmithKline, Philadelphia, PA) were found to be highly effective (98% -100%) in preventing severe gastroenteritis, and both have demonstrated reductionsin diarrhea-related hospitalizations. (4)(5) No increase incases of intussusception was observed in these randomized,placebo-controlled studies. In 2006, the World Health Organization (WHO) rec- ommended use of the rotavirus vaccines in the United States and Europe. Several observations can already be made with regard to the impact of rotavirus vaccinationin these regions. In the 2007 -2008 season, despite there not being a full year of vaccination, reduction in diag-nosed cases of rotavirus were greater than expected, in-dicating that any degree of vaccination may inducesome herd immunity. Vaccination was shown in thattime period to result in de layed onset and decreased peak numbers of hospitalizations, indicating ef cacious immunogenicity in infants. The following season, 2008 -2009, revealed slightly less effectiveness, with increased admissions in the 2 to4 years of age range. However, this is the group thatwould not have been immunized at the time. Based onthese ndings, the WHO extended its recommendations for rotavirus vaccine to be included in all national vacci-nation programs around the world in 2009. The WHOprioritized efforts in nations in which diarrheal disease ac-counts for >10% of childhood mortality. Studies from Latin America and Africa have demonstrated signi cant reductions in hospitalizations, diarrhea-related health-care visits, (6)(7) and, in one study, diarrhea-relateddeaths (Table 2). (8) Vaccines and Intussusception Adverse events from vaccination are very few. The majorconcern, a possible increase in intussusception, has been the effect most discussed and studied. Per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the attributable intus-susception risk is 40 cases per 3.9 million doses. This nd- ing led to an initial precautionary alert and a currentcontraindication regarding use of the vaccine in infantswho have a history of intussusception. However, the Ad-visory Committee on Immunization Practices considersthe bene t of protection against severe rotavirus disease to outweigh the possible increased risk of intussusceptionafter rotavirus vaccine. Recently, postlicensure surveillance from Brazil and Mexico demonstrated a slight increase in cases of intus-susception in association with receipt of RV1. (6) InBrazil, a 1.9 to 2.6 increase in risk was observed 1 to 7days after the second dose of vaccine. An increased riskwas observed after the rst dose in Mexico. The com- bined annual excess of 96 cases of intussusception inthese countries (with ve deaths due to intussusception) due to RV1 needs to be put into perspective with the factthat the vaccine prevented w80,000 hospitalizations and 1,300 deaths attributed to diarrhea each year. Vaccines and Immunocompromised Hosts Several special populations deserve mention with regard to rotavirus vaccination. The vaccine is contraindicated in patients who have SCID. However, often, SCID may gogastrointestinal disorders rotavirus Pediatrics in Review Vol.33 No.10 October 2012 443 at Health Sciences Library State Univ Of New York on February 20, 2013 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from undetected for long periods due to persistent maternal antibodies. This lack of detection can result in inadver- tent immunization in this population at risk. Vaccinationhas been shown to cause severe gastroenteritis withprotracted viral shedding for as long as 6 months. Riskof inadvertent vaccination is one of the reasons fora movement to consider adding SCID to the newbornscreening panel. In patients who have HIV, no increase in adverse events were seen in comparison with the general popula-tion, and the maximum time of viral shedding postvacci-nation was w7 days, the same as in patients who are HIV negative. There was no effect on the immunosuppressiveeffects of the primary HIV disease. Vaccine Use in Developing Countries In resource-limited settings, there have been concerns that the vaccine may not be as immunogenic as in the developedworld. This difference may be due in part to host and en-vironmental factors, such as ma lnutrition with poor absorp- tive capacity, interference by breast milk antibodies, or concurrent enteric infections. There is concern also that im-munity may be more at risk of waning over time in re-source-limited countries because the short-lived intestinalresponse may dominate versus a long-term response, andsystemic responses may be less robust. However, studiesin El Salvador have revealed that one dose confers w50% protection and would have its greatest impact in the 2-to 6-month age range when the risk of death is greatest. Vaccination programs in El Salvador revealed a 40% to 50% reduction in admissions for gastroenteritis due to ro-tavirus in the 2008 -2009 season and, overall, w76% pro- tection. Additional studies in India, which accounts for23% of worldwide deaths due to rotavirus, have revealedthat 44,000 deaths, 293,000 admissions, and 328,000 outpatient visits are prevented by the national rotavirusTable 1.

Multiple studies have revealed that population bene ts with herd immunity interrupting transmission may be greatest in the resource-limited countries. Vaccine Usage and Strain Ecology In Central Australia, the G1P[8] or RV1 vaccine wasfound not to have a protective effect against rotavirus dis-ease caused by an outbreak-associated G2P[4] strain. (3) Vaccine effectiveness against rotavirus-related hospitali- zation was only 19%. This lack of protection may bethe end result of a shift in the genotype strain ecology re-sulting from widespread vaccination. Further studieswill be needed to assess this possibility. Newer effectiveand less expensive vaccines will be needed, especiallyfor countries with limited-resources. Several candidatevaccines (for example, 116E) are undergoing study.

Managing acute gastroenteritis amongchildren: oral rehydration, Rotavirus is a leading cause of gastroenteritis worldwide. The greatest morbidity and mortality is observed among young infants in the developing world. Fever, vomiting, and diarrhea are the most common signs and symptoms of the disease. Although highly sensitive and specic antigen assays are commercially available, most diagnoses can be made based on clinical manifestations and will notrequire diagnostic testing. Treatment is supportive, with special attention to be placed on the replacement of fluids. In most instances,this goal can be achieved through the use of oralrehydration solutions. The use of probiotics, oral immunoglobulins, and nitazoxanide has been shown in some studies to be ofbenet in children with prolonged diarrhea. However, further studies are needed before these therapies can be recommended for all patients. The most dramatic effect on disease activity has been observed in countries in which rotavirus vaccination has been incorporated. These vaccines have been shown to be effective and safe. Widespread vaccination will continue to alter the epidemiology of the disease and will prevent many hospitalizations and save many lives.gastrointestinal disorders rotavirus Pediatrics in Review Vol.33 No.10 October 2012 445 at Health Sciences Library State Univ Of New York on February 20, 2013 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from PIR Quiz This quiz is available online at http://www.pedsinreview.aappublications.org.
