Oils as well as other herbal preparations may also act by triggering a particular gland into action or by balancing its hormonal secretion in some way. It is also known that many oils work as phytohormones in the same way that soya phytohormones work on the body. As an example, clary sage contains oestrogen in the oil; many herbs contain these hormones within the plant itself. A list of the endocrine glands and the oils that act upon them is given in Table 1.1 | | Table 1. The Endocrine Glands and the Oils That Act Upon Them[1] juniper, lemon, supply - aniseed, fennel, and decrease milk supply - cypress, geranium, peppermint| |Ovaries||Oestrogen stimulants - aniseed, angelica, rosemary, sage; oestrogen inhibitor - cumin; progesterone Medicine Vibrational medicine is a term used to describe any medicine that has an effect on a person's energetic level. An energetic level may in turn be described as a level that affects the auras, chakras and the meridians. Examples of vibrational medicinal therapies include homeopathy, Bach flowers, cymatics and reflexology. Our other senses, sight, sound and tastes also have corresponding therapies - therapeutic touch, colour therapy, music therapy and taste therapy. Another example of vibrational medicine is known as 'subtle aromatherapy' because it relates to our sense of smell. Like the universe, which is never still, every one of our cells vibrates with its own life and this vibration is reflected in our health and our own experiences of life. The purpose of vibrational medicine is to change a cell's vibration, where it has become unbalanced, to its correct form. This correction of cellular vibration also assists in the correction of any imbalances in the corresponding energy chakras. From Susan Leigh we learn that \"there are hundreds of energy centres in and around the body, which comprise the body's subtle energy system. Seven points in the body are generally accepted as the primary energy centres and are known as the chakras\".[2] Leigh goes on to state: \"The physical body has dense mass. The energetic body has no mass; it is subtle. So be subtle with essential oils\". Oils To be sure that you have chosen the right oil to balance a specific chakra, you should look not just at its chemical properties but also at its spiritual effect. In order to get the best results from oils they should be used homeopathically. Remember the adage \"the less oil you use gives the most benefit\". The aromatic qualities of plants have been used traditionally for religious ritual, meditation and prayer for thousands of years. Fragrances were chosen in history for their ability to promote feelings of oneness with the universe, and closeness with diverse Gods in the same way that incense is used in many churches in England today. Frankincense and myrrh are mentioned every Christmas in the story of the birth of Christ and are identified as precious gifts taken to the manger by the Magi. In other cultures, as smoke rose up from incense and other oils, so prayers would be delivered to their Gods. Most of these spiritual uses have been passed down as traditions in many places. The known physical and psychological effects of essential oils are often indicators of their subtle curative properties. For example clary sage is known to aid people with emotional problems while rosemary promotes mental clarity and relieves mental fatigue. On a subtle level, clary, according to Fischer-Rizzi, \"is one of the most enigmatic essential oils in aromatherapy's mysterious medicine chest\". And, \"while it helps reduce deep-seated tension, it remains stimulating, regenerative and revitalizing\".[3] On a physical level, the oil of jasmine \"is close in chemical structure to human perspiration and unique in its ability to be absorbed by the skin. It is especially helpful for woman's health problems\". Fischer-Rizzi goes on to say, \"it seems to increase the attractiveness of the person wearing it. On a higher plane it represents intuitive wisdom. It possesses strong yang energies\".[4] Signature The signature of a plant, its life and where it grows, all give us information about its spiritual state. A flower's colour and its signatures are the key to how flower essences are chosen and may have an affinity to the chakra of that colour. All plants have powerful harmonizing qualities that combine both earthly and celestial energies. If we study it closely the plant itself tells us what condition it is able to treat. The life force of the plant seems to be drawing us towards another dimension. Its subtle, vibrational energies working to influence the finer energies of our central nervous system. Intuition Intuition is also useful in choosing oils. The author was trying to help someone and simply placed four different oils into a bottle of sweet almond carrier. Intuition told her what to use. She handed the bottle to the client with instructions and the client on the return visit told her:\"Look! I can put my arm right up\". The client was healed. Was it the author...no...it was some higher power. The author only did what she was told. Table 2 (below) indicates the commonly accepted relationships between the chakras and the endocrine glands. Ann Berwick[5] has added suggestions for corresponding essential oils. | | Table 2. Commonly Accepted Relationships Between the summarizes how to find which chakras are too open, blocked or balanced. Find each chakra's needs and use oil, based on the following notes, intuition or the colour of the oil and its signature, to bring about a balanced self. | | Table 3. Guide for Diagnosing the Health of the Chakras |Too open||Blocked|| Essential oils that resonate with the base chakra are oils that are grounding and strengthening. These include patchouli, vetiver and myrrh. Fischer-Rizzi[6] suggests: \"The earthly fragrance of the vetiver oil supports all those who have lost touch with the earth or with their roots\". The colour associated with this chakra is red, any flower or herb that is red is also able to help balance the base chakra. Oils that resonate with the sacral chakra need to be creative and to have an affinity with the reproductive organs. These include sandalwood, jasmine, rose and ylang ylang. Any essential oil that is reputed to be an aphrodisiac is sensual and warming in nature and also resonates at the sacral chakra. Aphrodisiac oils include clary sage and ylang ylang. Rose and neroli both or which are calming and soothing oils and jasmine and sandalwood, which are sedative oils, also resonate with the sacral chakra. Note, jasmine and sandalwood may have a hormonal effect on the body. Other oils that are stimulating and aphrodisiac include cardamom and any warm spicy oil. The colour associated with this chakra is orange, any flower or herb that is orange or peach is also able to help balance the sacral chakra. Essential oils that resonate with the solar plexus chakra are oils that are linked to the digestive system and include sandalwood, myrrh and manuka. The solar plexus is often the place on our body where we feel nervous, uncomfortable in company, or perhaps apprehensive when we are going on holiday or doing anything unusual. Any oils that are carminatives such as coriander, ginger, lemon, sweet marjoram and sweet orange would be helpful in these situations. The colour associated with this chakra is yellow, any flower or herb that is yellow is also able to help balance the solar plexus chakra. Oils that resonate with the heart chakra are oils that are associated with loving and caring and include bergamot, jasmine, melissa, neroli and rose. All these oils indicate a great love of the earth and nature. Davis [7] says: \"Bergamot is uplifting, and lifts the spirits\". Other uplifting oils associated with the heart chakra include orange, coriander, cypress and frankincense. The colour associated with this chakra is green, any flower or herb that is green, also includes foliage and flowers that are cream; is also able to help balance the heart chakra. Essential oils that resonate with the throat chakra are oils that are connected to communication and self-expression, grounding and strengthening. These include chamomile and tea tree. Oils that affect this chakra are those that lift the spirit emotionally and include clary sage, geranium, German chamomile and cajuput. Calming oils like lemon, sweet marjoram and melissa are also helpful. The colour associated with this chakra is bright blue; any flower or herb that is aquamarine or blue is also able to help balance the throat chakra. Oils that resonate with the brow chakra are those that are connected with the higher functions of consciousness and include myrrh, jasmine and neroli - all oils with strong aromas. The colour associated with this chakra is indigo or dark blue; any flower or herb that is dark blue or purple is also able to help balance the brow chakra. Essential oils like basil and rosemary are considered cephalics and able to assist with connecting the mind to bring spiritual clarity. Valerie Worwood[8] suggests clove \"for using when we are afraid and in need of angelic assistance, or need to believe they (angels) are close by. To send with joy our thanks to these realms in celebration\". Oils that resonate with the crown chakra are oils that are spiritual and full of enlightenment, prayerful and show us wisdom. These include lavender, blue chamomile, jasmine and rose. Davis (1991)[9] says that rosewood has a very special significance as it \"has a steadying effect on the nerves, and ...it is useful to use during examinations or when driving long distances\". Rosewood also clears our senses and with lavender can connect us to our higher vibrations thus aiding the crown chakra to open. Worwood[10] in her book The Fragrant Heavens lists many oils that open the crown chakra and assist the angels to connect to us. Pages 74 to 82, includes: \"Benzoin that...enables the spirit to receive blessings. Clary...bringer of harmony and purpose. For the times when we pray for assistance from the angels. Geranium allows us to be centred enough to bring the angelic realms closer for comfort and reassurance\". The colour associated with this chakra is violet, any flower or herb that is purple, mauve or violet is also able to help balance the crown chakra. Frankincense and sandalwood are also very important as they link the crown chakra with the base chakra. There are other essential oils that resonate with both the crown and the base chakras; among them lavender, melissa, jasmine and rose. Five Elements The five elements are another way of looking at choosing oils in order to balance the body. The five elements are: Wood, Fire, Metal, Earth and Water. Wood is that quality in nature that is solid yet supple, alive, growing and spreading outward. Roots suggest trees and tree oils would be helpful to remedy any wood related deficiencies. These would be oils such as eucalyptus, cedarwood, cypress, and vetivert, which is extracted from the roots of an aromatic grass. Fire is the quality of nature that is heating, warming, and burning, destructive, ascending, blazing and illuminating. Remedies to cure fire-related deficiencies would need to heat the ice; here spicy and warming oils are needed. Suggestions could include ginger, sage, pine, patchouli or peppermint. Metal is that quality in nature, which is mouldable, hard and strong, responsive to heat, conductive and protective. Remedies to counter metal deficiency symptoms such as would be needed for those stuck in a rut, fearful or stubborn would need to be uplifting and spiritually arising. Suggestions include jasmine, neroli, myrrh and palmarosa - especially where healing was also needed. Earth is the quality in nature that is fertile, nourishing, solid and stable, restful and alert. Anyone who is restless, not walking on solid ground or anxious may be suffering from a lack of earth energy. Oils to help might include lemon, sweet marjoram, sweet orange or rosemary. Water is that quality in nature which is soaking and sinking, cold, yielding and fluid, tending to stillness and yet powerful. People who 'swim against the tide', anxious and fearful types or those who are cold and inward looking would need to be healed to be able to rise against their unhappiness. Some people may be so pre-occupied with their life that they may not know they are unhappy. In these cases, oils that calm the spirit, to allow time for healing and those that unblock chi that has become stagnant, such as lavender, neroli, frankincense, sandalwood and rose can be used. All offer a spiritual quality that enhances and finds the true purpose of living. The flow of life, as seen from an eastern viewpoint, is known as the life force or chi.. Having an understanding of the five elements help us to understand the basic elements of life. When the chi that flows round the body stagnates or fails to flow properly the organs suffer. Various oils can assist the chi to flow properly and to remedy organ dysfunctions. Uses of Oils The different oils all have their own curative properties and though not in any way comprehensive, the following oils may be considered for specific conditions. Essential oils that possess anti-spasmodic and nerve relaxant properties and smooth the flow of chi include lavender, mandarin, sweet marjoram, petitgrain, basil, German chamomile and Roman chamomile. To overcome congestion caused possibly by stagnant chi, use the oils of grapefruit, cajuput, patchouli or juniper berry. If the spleen and stomach fail to fully transform food and fluids, phlegm accumulates. The oils that are best to remove phlegm accumulation are marjoram, rosemary, basil, eucalyptus, juniper or grapefruit. To ensure that the spleen-chi is working, the oils that should be used need to have properties that are vaso-constricting - in other words they should be able to assist the blood to circulate. Cypress, clary sage, neroli and lemon are very effective for this purpose. If concentration is difficult it might be an indication that the spleen-chi is weak. Oils that are stimulating in this instance include frankincense, jasmine, black pepper, cedarwood, sweet orange and lavender. All may be used to help rebalance the chi. Problems relating to appetite or digestion may be being caused by spleen-dampness. Oils to balance this dampness need to be warming and include, for instance, ginger, fennel, juniper berry, aniseed, angelica and frankincense. The liver spreads the chi throughout the body and oils that are anti-spasmodic and nervines are helpful in curing liver problems. These include lemon, sweet marjoram, lemongrass, basil, juniper, lavender and Roman chamomile. When you identify that it is the liver-chi that is stagnant you will know that the oils needed should be relaxing or a relaxant. Among those favoured would be lavender, basil, clary sage, coriander, lemon, bergamot and melissa. An excess of yang-chi suggests oils with calming features. Oils that calm the spirit include lemon, neroli, sweet orange, frankincense, geranium, ginger and rosemary. Heart-yang deficiency is the opposite of yang-chi excess in many ways. This deficiency needs an oil that awakens the spirit, for instance jasmine, petitgrain, peppermint, myrrh, rose and frankincense. The kidneys control the jing-chi and water. If these are not balanced, oils that are diuretics may be used. Juniper, lemon, basil, German chamomile, sandalwood and rosemary are to be recommended. Juniper also helps to balance the zhi, the will-power. Outline of Oils Often Used in Subtle Aromatherapy Aniseed Aniseed is sweet, warm and drying and useful for treating damp cold conditions. It is also known to stimulate the chi and is to be recommended for any condition, which involves chi constraint. The warm spicy scent brings a comforting effect to the mind. According to Peter Holmes[11], \"such conditions might include heart-chi constraint with palpitations and nervousness, lung-chi constraint with dry coughing, intestine-chi constraint with colicky pain and indigestion or uterus-chi constraint with menstrual cramps and irregular periods\". Basil Basil has qualities that are both warming and drying; it is mainly used as a yang tonifier. Its drying nature also indicates that it is useful for eliminating damp and expelling phlegm. It is mainly used for treating lung-cold-phlegm problems. Holmes[12] describes basil \"as stimulating the lungs, dries damp, expels phlegm and relieves wheezing. Basil should be used to support the body's yang for asthmatics and bronchial conditions when constant fatigue, cold and depression are prominent\". Cedarwood This oil is sweet and warming, it is used for embalming and thus for long life. It brings in positive energy. Useful to connect with the earth, it is grounding and centring and strengthens confidence and the will power. Cedarwood promotes a calm meditative state to better receive healing energy and, at the seventh chakra it brings a spiritual clarity to a soul crying out for peace of mind. Fischer-Rizzi[13] suggests: \"The oil may help provide warmth and comfort and help stabilize energies thrown out of balance\". Chamomile Both the German and Roman varieties of chamomile are similar, but though they are not identical both help to circulate and regulate the chi. They balance the emotions and enable a person to have an acceptance of their limitations, thus promoting patience. Chamomile oils are also well known for their ability to clear heat and reduce inflammation. They ease negativity, grief and sadness, which aid those who are nervous and who have behaved immaturely, 'like little children'. They help to connect the fifth and seventh chakras helping to facilitate communication and the realization of spiritual truths. The oil is particularly useful for treating conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, dermatitis, eczema, and pruritis. Holmes[14] suggests \"using German chamomile to stimulate and restore the liver and gall bladder\". Clary Sage This oil has energetic qualities that enable relaxation to take place. It aids the circulation of chi and calms the spirit. The ability for clary sage to relax and circulate chi also indicates that its psychological benefits are a balance between stimulation and relaxation. Davis[15] suggests using clary to \"bring us more closely in touch with dreamland, which can teach us so many spiritual lessons. It may be used to encourage vivid dreams or to enhance dream recall. Use it in an evening bath or a few drops on the pillow\". Coriander This oil is healing and anti-inflammatory and brings feelings of security to anyone who is not grounded. It is anti-spasmodic and calming to the digestive tract and able to bring calmness to the solar plexus chakra. It also calms the spirit and shen (mind). Everlasting It is eternal by name and nature and helpful for anyone who has lost contact with the earth and who is not grounded. The plant grows in hot, dry places and it uses this signature to bring to humans the love of the outdoors and sunshine, even on dark spiritual days when the soul will not thrive. It dissolves energy blockages and helps to balance the upper energy chakras. Everlasting integrates compassion and spirituality and brings a love of others. For the sixth chakra it brings a sense of intuition and communication in psychic measures. It may also be helpful for the base chakra because, according to Fischer-Rizzi[16] \"its earthly fragrance may be beneficial for those who have lost contact with the earth, have become too celebral, or acquired cold feet\". Frankincense This oil or herb has been valued in religious ceremonies for thousands of years. It slows down the breathing and is calming to the soul and spirit. It also calms any chakras that are fiery and over heated. It is especially good for chakras six and seven as it quietens and clarifies the mind. It also brings about a meditative mind and a new enlightenment of self and encourages an unconditional love for all. Geranium Geranium has properties that are both calming to the nerves and also to the hormone system. Geranium has an affinity with the sacral chakra and aids feminine creativity. It is protecting to both the spirit and soul. Battaglia[17] recommends geranium for \"balancing the adrenal cortex, whose hormones are essentially of a regulatory nature. It is ideal for treating stress\". Ginger Ginger is warming and helpful to anything to do with the digestive tract. It is a classic remedy for scattering wind-cold, and helpful for ridding the body of cold, sneezing and respiratory problems, and also aiding us when emotionally cold. Ginger aids in tonifying the stomach and the spleen-yang. Holmes[18] suggests \"ginger stimulates and warms the uterus and thus has an affinity with many chakras, certainly from the base to heart\". Jasmine Jasmine is known as the 'King of Flowers' and has a long history of use in perfumery. It is an expensive oil that harmonises the whole person and calms and soothes the spirits. Jasmine releases worry to allow living in the present; it is also useful as an aid for meditation and relaxing. At the sixth chakra it enhances intuition and reduces fear. It connects spirituality and sexuality, thus connecting the base with the crown chakras. Lavender This oil is known as an all-rounder as it has so many uses. It has a long history in both medicine and perfumery. It is useful oil for removing excess-yang, for reducing an angry spirit and inflammation, (anger and heat in the body). It calms both the heart-chi and the shen. It acts on both the sympathetic and autonomic nervous systems and balances them. This oil brings together all the chakras and balances the aura. If you do not know which oil to buy to begin with, this is the one! Myrrh Myrrh is thought to enhance spirituality and is used in meditation and in church rituals. It is especially valuable for people who are stuck in a rut emotionally and/or spiritually and want to move on in life. Myrrh supports earthy manifestations of dreams and visions by linking the higher energy centres with the base energy centre. Myrrh eases sorrow and grief and brings calm to the heart chakra, as well as aiding communication it is helpful to the seventh chakra as it assists in our moving forward on our spiritual journey. Neroli Neroli is especially useful for the seventh chakra because it beings nourishment for the spirit and soul in all of us. It may also be used as a natural tranquilliser for shock, depression or anxiety. The energetic qualities of neroli are cooling and calming making it a useful oil to use for hot spontaneous conditions of the heart such as agitation, insomnia and hypertension. According to Battaglia[20] this oil \"may be used in the same way that Bach's Rescue remedy is used\". Peppermint This oil brings a clear head and refreshes the spirit. It has an affinity for the throat chakra as it clears the communication channels. It has been listed as both a cooling and a warming oil. Peppermint scatters wind-cold and is suited to any disturbances in the digestive tract from mouth to anus, thus connecting the first and fifth chakras. It stimulates the flow of chi into the stomach and intestines. It is anti-spasmodic and is able to calm an angry stomach and spleen-chi. Peppermint also balances many of the chakras. According to Gumbel[21]: \"Peppermint oil has a special connection to everything aqueous, to blood, to tissue fluid, lymph, spinal and cerebral fluid. It is used in massage to stimulate the lymph system and drainage of lymph fluids\". Rose The energetic qualities of rose are cooling and moist and these qualities indicate that rose oil is recommended where there is excess heat. Rose oil is also indicated for liver-chi stagnation, which is associated with depression, constipation and headaches. Rose is a nervous sedative and is one of the most complex oils known - it contains over 300 chemicals. Its many components (chemicals) can all be used to balance the human body with its many parts. The whole body and all the chakras in it benefit from the rose's signature. Rose oil brings in positive energy and seals the aura when its healing work is done. It also brings love and compassion to the heart chakra and heals emotional wounds. At the seventh chakra it brings a sense of spiritual connection and completeness. From Battaglias' Book[22] I found the following extract interesting: \"In Chinese and Sanskrit manuscripts rose was highly praised. Li Shin-Chen tells us of a highly fragrant rose, Rosa rugosa, which is cultivated in China: 'Its nature is cooling, its taste is sweet with a slight bitterishness, and it acts on the spleen and liver, promoting the circulation of the blood. It is prescribed in the form of an extract for haematemesis, and the flowers are used in all diseases of the liver, to scatter abscesses, and in blood diseases generally... Essence of rose is made by distilling the flowers of Rosa rugosa. Its medicinal action is upon the liver, stomach, and blood. It drives away melancholy.' In both ancient art and literature the rose was the predominant flower symbol. Its blossom symboliZes beauty, love, youth, perfection and immortality.\" Rosemary Rosemary is considered to be one of the best tonics for the central nervous system. It acts as a brain stimulant and has a long history of improving the memory, aiding psychic protection and intuition. It inspires love of self and others and strengthens the will-power. Davis[23] suggests: \"It strengthens the heart. It may be considered a middle aged executives best friend\". Rosemary has an affinity with the sixth energy chakra and is used to promote clear thoughts and insights; it also strengthens the nervous system. Sandalwood This oil has a calming, harmonizing effect and takes away fears and anxiety. It is indicated for hot, agitated emotional states that lead to headaches, insomnia and nervous exhaustion. It is also bitter and astringent, and useful for removing problems of a hot, inflammatory and catarrhal nature. It can be used in all healing work and connects all the chakras one with the other. It connects us to the earth whilst providing health for the mind and consciousness. It settles anxiety, brings self-esteem and opens the heart to receiving healing energy. Yogis describe sandalwood as 'oil that has a fragrance of the subtle body and the centre of highest insight and enlightenment'. Vetiver This oil has a deep, smoky and earthly fragrance and it is not surprising that it grounds and centres. The nurturing qualities of this oil indicates its usefulness in supporting the body's yin functions. Where the yin is deficient it raises it with its grounding qualities. It joins the first and seventh chakras together by its grounding and the way that it promotes spiritual calmness and wisdom. Fischer-Rizzi[24] who writes many aromatherapy books said of vetiver: \"This essential oil connects us to the earth's energies. It is a source of vital energy and regeneration. The earthy fragrance of the oil supports all those who have lost touch with the earth or with their roots. Vetiver nourishes people who have cold feet or who have their heads in the clouds. When we lose contact with the ground beneath us, with reality, we pay the price of a weakened immune system. When we touch with the earth, we breathe fresh air, enjoy the magic of an open fire, and feel the wind blow through our hair\". Vetiver connects us with the earth and so acts to bring in the energy allowing relief from tension and stress. References 1. Berwick Ann. Aromatherapy - A Holistic Guide. Llewellyn Publications.

Carolyn Byerly - Tammy Grimard said.. Hi Carolyn, I had a total thyroidectomy and RAI (nuked any remaining thyroid cells) 10 yrs ago and I'm also on synthroid. I am concerned that your thyroid medication may be totally out of whack, which can cause other health issues as well. It sounds like your dosage may be too high. Please see your doctor! and see if your dosage needs to be adjusted. Even if you have been okay on the same dose for years, something may have changed in your body that requires a dose change. Once you know that is settled, then use essential oils for any symptoms that remain. - Amanda said.. "}
