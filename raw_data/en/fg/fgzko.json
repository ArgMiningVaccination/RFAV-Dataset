Presentation description: This presentation will discuss the role of Spirituality in naturopathic medicine; the benefits of Spiritual interventions on health and well being; cautions when incorporating Spirituality with patients; and provide attendees with experiential examples of simp le, practical and effective mindfulness/meditation techniques intended to benefit both doctor and patient. Studies demonstrate our health is improved with spiritual care and it is suggested that 60 -90% of primary care visits are related to stress. It follows then, to incorporate spirituality as part of patient (and self care). As naturopathic physicians, we are in a unique position where spirituality is embedded in our Principles and Therapeutic Order. By remembering to connect to the Vis (Spirituality), whether through simple inquiry, nature cure or meditation/mindfulness - we strengthen our resiliency, self awareness and ultimately, our vitality.
