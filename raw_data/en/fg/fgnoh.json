Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS): A medical condition where the immune system cannot function properly and protect the body from disease. As a result, the body cannot defend itself against infections (like pneumonia). AIDS is caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). This virus is spread through direct contact with the blood and body fluids of an infected individual. High risk activities include unprotected sexual intercourse and intravenous drug use (sharing needles). There is no cure for AIDS; however, research efforts to develop a vaccine are ongoing. [ Active immunity: The production of antibodies against a specific disease by the immune system. Active immunity can be acquired in two ways, either by contracting the disease or through vaccination. Active immunity is usually long-lasting, but individuals may remain susceptible to variants of the etiologic agent or disease.] Acute: in a health effect). Adjuvant: [Listen [MP3]](/vaccines/terms/media/Adjuvent.mp3) A vaccine component distinct from the antigen that enhances the immune response to the antigen. Adverse event: An undesirable medical condition that occurs following vaccination, which might be associated to the vaccine or its components, or which might be pure coincidence. [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)](/vaccines/acip/index.html): A group of medical and public health experts who develop recommendations on the use of vaccines in the U.S. civilian population. The recommendations stand as public health guidance for the safe use of vaccines and related biological products.

Anaphylaxis: [Listen [MP3]](/vaccines/terms/media/Anaphylaxis.mp3) An immediate and severe allergic reaction to a substance such as a food or drug. Symptoms of anaphylaxis include breathing difficulties, loss of consciousness, and a drop in blood pressure. This condition can be fatal and requires immediate medical attention.

Association: The degree to which the occurrence of two variables or events is linked. Association describes a situation where the likelihood of one event occurring is related to the presence of another event or variable. However, an association between two variables does not necessarily imply a cause-and-effect relationship. The term association and relationship are often used interchangeably. See [causal](#causalassoc) and [temporal](#temporalassoc) association. Asthma: A chronic medical condition in which the bronchial tubes (in the lungs) become easily irritated. This irritation leads to constriction of the airways, which results in wheezing, coughing, difficulty breathing and production of thick mucus. The cause of asthma is not yet known, but environmental triggers, drugs, food allergies, exercise, infection, and stress all have been implicated.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD): A developmental disability that can cause significant social, communication, and behavioral challenges. ASD is usually diagnosed between 18 and 30 months of age. At this time, the cause of autism is not known although many experts believe it to be a genetically based disorder that occurs before birth. B B cells: Small white blood cells that help the body defend itself against infection. B cells are produced in bone marrow and can develop into plasma cells which produce antibodies.

[ Community immunity: A situation in which a sufficient proportion of a population is immune to an infectious disease (through vaccination and/or prior illness) to make its spread from person to person unlikely.

It involves production of protein molecules called antibodies to eliminate foreign organisms from the body. Immunity: Protection against a disease. There are two types of immunity, passive and active. Immunity is indicated by the presence of antibodies or other components in the blood and can usually be determined with a laboratory test. See [active](#active) and [passive](#passive) immunity.
