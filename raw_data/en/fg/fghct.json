Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditor's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance wi th auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audit contained in Government Auditing Standards , issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. As disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, Sanford's consolidated financial statements include the operations of the Sanford foundations, the Sanford health plans, and certain other less significant Sanford subsidiaries and affiliates. These entities were audited by us in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, but were not audited in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and, accordingly, are not covered by our reports in accordance with Government Auditing Standards . An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In ma king those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiv eness of Sanford's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significan t accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, based on our audits, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Sanford and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations, chan ges in its net assets, and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Deloitte & Touche LLP Suite 2800 50 South Sixth Street Minneapolis, MN - 2 -Other Matters Other Information Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole. The accompanying Consolid ated Supplemental Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards for the year ended December 31, 2019 as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200 , Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards , is presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the consolidated financial statements. Such supplementa ry information is the responsibility of Sanford's management and was derived from and relates directl y to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. This supplementary information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in ou r audit of the consolidated financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the consolidated financial statements or to the consolidated financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the Unit ed States of America. In our opinion, such information is fairly stated, in all material respected, in relation to the consolidated financial statements as a whole. Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards In accordance with Government Auditing Standards , we have also issued our report dated April 16, 2020, on our consideration of Sanford's internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regula tions, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters for the year ended December 31, 2019. The pu rpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. The report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering Sanford's internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

The Society , together with its affiliates, provides senior care services across the United States and operates skilled nursing facilities, residential housing for seniors, home and community based health services and affordable housing projects.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICI ES The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting . The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles genera lly accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions . Such estimates include allowances for contractual adjustments and implicit price concessions (bad debts) , medical and self -insured claims payable, post -retirement benefit obligations, and fair value measurement of assets and liabilities acquired through the business combination which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and l iabilities at the date of the f inancial statements. Estimates a lso affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. CASH Cash consists of deposits in banks and does not include any cash equivalents. At times, cash accounts exceeded federally insured limits. Management believes that the institutions where cash accounts are maintained are financially stable and that the credit risk related to deposits is minimal. INVENTORIES Inventories are reported at l ower of cost or market. Inventories include supplies, which are generally based on average cost method , and pharmaceuticals, which are based on the first -in, first -out cost method. OTHER CURRENT AND NON- CURRENT ASSETS Other assets consist of prepaid exp enses, beneficial interest in life estates, and the current and non -current portion of notes and contributions receivable. INVESTMENTS AND INVESTMENT RETURN (LOSS) Sanford invest s in various securities, including debt and equity instruments. Investment s ecurities are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit and overall market volatility. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities, it is reasonably possible that changes in the value of investment securities could occur and such changes could materially affect the value of investments. Investments are stated at fair value of the underlying securities. Investment return used to fund initiatives is included in other operating revenue. All other investment return (loss), including realized and unrealized gains and losses, are recorded as non -operating income (expense) , unless restricted by donor s. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Land , land improvements, buildings, equipment (including software), and construction in process are reported at cost or market value at the time of purchase. Depreciation is calculated using the straight -line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: Land and land improvements 8-25 years Buildings 20-40 years Building equipment 5-25 years Move able equipment 3-20 years Management annually reviews the carrying value of long -lived assets for potential impairment. There were no impairment losses duri ng the year s ended December 3 1, 2019 and 2018. NON- OPERATING PROPERTY Non -operating property consists primarily of real estate held for future development. Real estate is recorded at cost or market value at the time of purchase . RIGHT OF USE ASSET AND OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES Sanford leases various facilities and equipment under non -cancelable operating leases expiring at various dates through December 2036 , and records the corresponding right of use asset and operating lease liabilities on the balance sheet . Right of use asset is calculated as the lease liability plus any prepaid lease payments and initial direct costs, less any lease incentives. Renewal options to extend the lease term that are reasonably certain to be exercised are included in the measurement of lease s. Operatin g lease liabilities are calculated as the present value of the remaining lease payments , discounted at 5.0 %. Sanford excludes operating leases with terms of twelve months or les s and includes any fixed non- lease components in lease measurement. - 12 - GOODWILL A ND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill represents any excess of acquisition price over fair value of net assets acquired . The balance was $58,272 and $39,302 as of December 31, 201 9 and 2018. The annual impairment test was performed resulting in no impairment char ges f or the year s ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Intangible assets are amortized over the terms of the agreements. The balance, net of accumulated amortization, was $24,861 and $17,951 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. NOTES RECEIVABLE As part of the recruitment process, notes with forgiveness provisions may be issued to certain providers and employees . Notes are repayable over periods varying from one to ten years and are issued at current interest rates . As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, notes receiv able from providers and employees totaled $47,952 and $47,994, with balances due or to be forgiven within one year reported within other current assets and non-current balances outstanding reflected as notes receivable. MEDICAL CLAIMS PAYABLE Medical clai ms payable represents the estimated amount payable to non -Sanford healthcare providers and includes claims reported and actuarial estimates of incurred b ut not reported claims. The liability for these medical benefits reflects management's best estimate a nd is based on historical payment patterns as well as current utilization and cost trends. Actuarial adjustments are reflected in the operating results in the period in which the change in estimate is identified. OTHER LIABILITIES Current portion of othe r liabilities and non- current liabilities primarily consist of professional and general liability claims reserves , workers' compensation insurance reserves , deferred revenue, security deposits, asset retirement obligation, accrued taxes and interest , and t he current portion of operating leases and residential housing deposits . DEFERRED COMPENSATION Sanford offers management and providers the ability to participate in non - qualified plans created in accordance with applicable provisions of the Internal Reve nue Code. The plans permit deferral of salary , and the accumulated deferred compensation balance is not available to employees until a distributable event, as defined within the plan documents. All amounts of compensation deferred under the plans, and all income attributable to those amounts, are solely the property of Sanford until paid or made available to the employee or other beneficiary. The related assets are reported within assets whose use is limited at their fair market value , and t he related liabi lities are reported as non- current liabilities. RESIDENTIAL HOUSING DEPOSITS Residential housing deposits received in advance for admittance into residential units typically have varying refundable portions based upon time restrictions and vacancy of the unit. The nonrefundable portion of the deposits are amortized into other operating revenue over the life expectancy of the occupant and fully recognized when the occupant vacates the unit. NET ASSETS Net assets not subject to donor imposed stipulations are reflected as net assets without donor restrictions. Net assets with donor restrictions are those whose use has been limited by donors to a specific purpose, period of time, or that must be maintained in perpetuity. Gifts and other resources with restri ctions are recorded as direct additions to net assets with donor restrictions. When a restriction is met, or a donor -imposed restriction changes, net assets are reclassified and reported as net assets released from restrictions within other operating revenue , non -operating expense , or releases for acquisitions of property and equipment . Donor restricted gifts whose restrictions are met within the same year as received are reported as contributions without donor restrictions in the accompanying consolidate d financial statements. NON- CONTROLLING INTEREST Sanford has less than 100% ownership in ten tax credit limited partnerships and Good Samaritan Insurance Plan, LLC. Sanford controls these entities and accordingly has consolidated them into the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019. The net assets attributed to the non -controlling partner s are reported as net assets without donor restrictions - non-controlling interest on the consolidated balance sheets. - 13 - OPERATING AND NON- OPERATING ACTIVITIES Income from operations includes all revenues and expenses related to core operations. The primary objective of operations is to meet the healthcare needs of individuals . All activities directly associated with this objective are considered operat ing activities. Non-operating items primarily include investment return (loss) , contributions from business combination, net rental income from non-operating property , and other expenses which consist of loss on extinguishment of debt, contributions, and income taxes . CHARITY CARE AND COMMUNITY BENEFITS Sanford provides care to patients and residents without charge or at amounts less than its established rates regardless of their ability to pay. These patients and residents meet criteria as defined by San ford's charity care policies . Sanford does not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care. Accordingly, these amounts are not reported as net patient revenue or net resident revenue. The total cost of charity care (estimated by appl ying an overall cost to charge ratio to the charges incurred) was $90,581 and $87,431 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Sanford also provides a variety of services and benefits designed to improve the health in the communities served. These b enefits include education and promotion of health activities, civic involvement, community funding, and medical research. PREMIUM REVENUE Premium revenue represents gross premiums earned in the year for which fully insured services are covered. Premium r evenue includes amounts paid by employer groups and individual members, as well as state and federal governments. Premiums are contractual and are recognized in the coverage period in which members are entitled to receive healthcare services. Premiums received in advance of a coverage period are recorded as other accrued liabilities. OTHER OPERATING REVENUE Other operating revenue is primarily generated by pharmacies, reference lab s, mobile diagnostic services, and various other retail or rental operations and are recognized when services are performed or products are delivered. Other operating revenue also includes contributions without donor restrictions . INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense includes interest costs incurred on borrowed funds ( net of interes t income earned on investments held by trustee under bond indenture agreements ), deferred financing costs, and fees paid to maintain assets held by trustees under indenture, remarketing, and liquidity facility agreements. Deferred financing costs are amort ized over the period the obligation is outstanding using the effective interest method. Interest costs are capitalized during the construction of capital assets as a component of the cost of acquiring those assets , of which no interest cost s were capitaliz ed in the years ended December 31, 201 9 and 2018. INCOME TAXES Certain wholly owned subsidiaries are subject to income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the financial and income tax reporting basi s of assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates and laws. A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. The deferred income tax provision or bene fit generally reflects the net change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year. Deferred tax assets of $4,761 and $7,626 have been recorded in other assets and d eferred tax liabilities of $55 and $89 have been recorded as other non -current liabilities as of D ecember 31, 2019 and 2018. The current income tax provision reflects the tax consequences of revenues and expenses currently taxable or deductible on various income tax returns for the year reported. Sanford paid an insignificant amount of federal and state income taxes for the year s ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. - 14 - NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Accounting Standards Upda te (ASU) No. 2014- 09), which provides a framework for the recognition of revenue, with the objective that recognized revenue properly reflect amounts an entity is entitled to receive in exchange for goods and services. This guidance, which includes additio nal disclosure requirements regarding revenue and obligations related to contracts with customers, was effective for Sanford on January 1, 2018. The presentation of the financial statements and respective note disclosure in Note 3 has been adjusted to comply with this standard using a modified retrospective method of application. The most significant impact is presentation of the statement of operations, where the provision for bad debts is now reflected as a direct reduction to net patient and resident revenue and is no longer presented as a separate line item. The standard does not significantly impact how Sanford accounts for net patient revenue, net resident revenue, and other operating revenue and does not apply to the r ecognition of premium revenue. In May 2015, the FASB issued Fair Value Measurement (ASU 2015- 07, Topic 820) : Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or its Equivalent) , which removes the requirement to include investments in the fair value hierarchy for which fair value is measured using the net asset value (NAV). This guidance was adopted by Sanford on January 1, 2018 and the presentation of the fair value footnote disclosure has been adjusted to comply with this standard. In August 2016, the FASB issued Presentation of Financial Statements of Not -For-Profit Entities (ASU No. 2016- 14), which simplifies and improves how not -for-profit entities classify net assets as well as the information presented in the financial statements and notes ab out liquidity, financial performance and cash flows . This guidance was effective for Sanford on January 1, 2018, and the presentation of the financial statements Notes 2 , 16, and 1 7 have been adjusted and Note 5 has been added to comply with this standard . In March 2017, the FASB issued Compensation- Retirement Benefits (ASU 2017- 07, Topic 715) : Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost , which requires an employer to report the service cost component in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period. It also requires the other components of net periodic pension cost an d net periodic postretirement benefit cost to be presented separately fro m the service cost component and outside income from operations. This guidance was effective for Sanford on January 1, 2018 and did not significantly affect the financial statements . In February 2016, the FASB issued Leases (ASU No. 2016 -02), which is inte nded to improve financial reporting related to leasing transactions, and in July 2018, the FASB issued Leases, Targeted Improvements to ASC 842 (ASU 2018- 11), which provides relief of implementing certain components of the new lease guidance. Through adopt ion of this guidance, effective January 1, 2019, Sanford elected the practical expedient package under ASC 842 which allows Sanford to dismiss reassessment of pre -existing contracts entered into prior to January 1, 2019 for determination if those contracts contain lease arrangements defined under the new guidance . Sanford also elected the practical expedient for combining lease and fixed non -lease components in lease measurement . As such, Sanford has measured all existing operating leases as of January 1, 2 019 and applied the new guidance to any new contracts entered into after January 1, 2019, resulting in initial recognition of $93,404 right of use asset (net of deferred lease expense) and corresponding operating lease liabilities. Sanford did not restate prior year to incorporate the new lease guidance as allowed under ASU 2018- 11. Accordingly, the lease guidance was only applied to the presentation of the balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 and Note 11 has been added to comply with this standard. In November 2016, the FASB issued Restricted Cash (ASU No. 2016- 18), which requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cas h equivalents. This guidance was effective for Sanford on January 1, 2019. As a result of the standard, Sanford has included cash equivalents within other current assets and assets whose use is limited with cash when reconciling the beginning of year and end of year amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. In January 2017, the FASB issued Business Combinations (ASU No. 2017- 01) effective January 1, 2019 for Sanford, which clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted f or as acquisitions or disposals of businesses. Sanford has evaluated and concluded that this standard does not signif icantly impact how Sanford reflects business combinations within its financial statements. - 15 - RECLASSIFICATIONS Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations and are immaterial in nature. SUBSEQUEN T EVENTS In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID -19) as a pandemic . Sanford expect s operations to be affected as the virus continues to proliferate and continue s to monitor the situation close ly. In light of the uncertainty as to the severity and duration of the pandemic, the impact on Sanford's future operating performance and balance sheet is uncertain at this time. Sanford has evaluated subsequent events through April 16, 2020, the date this report was issued, and no additional significant events have been identified . 3. NET PATIENT REVENUE, NET RESIDENT REVEN UE, AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE Net patient revenue and net resident revenue is reported at estimated net realizable amounts from patient s, residents, third -party pay ors, and others that Sanford expects to receive in exchange for providing patient and resident care. Sanford determines performance obligations based on the nature of the services provided. Revenue is recognized when those ser vices are rendered and the patient , resident, or third -party payor is billed , usually in advance or within several days of service or discharge . For s ervices provided over a period of time , such as inpatients receiving acute care services or residents receiving post-acute care services , revenue recognition begins when the patient or resident is admitted and concludes at the time of discharge. Remaining performance obligations relating to inpatient acute care services or resident post -acute care services as of December 31, 201 9 will be satisfied in full in 20 20. As a result , Sanford has applied the optional exemption provided in ASC 606- 10-50-14(a) and is not required to disclose these amounts. The initial estimate of net patient and resident revenue is determined by reducing the gross charge by contractual adjustments arising from various reimbursement arrangements with third -party payors and implicit price concessions (bad debts) provided to self -pay patients or residents for their respective responsibility . As a practical expedient, Sanford has elected to account for third -party payor , patient , and resident contracts as collective groups rather than individual contracts. The financial statement effects of using this practical expedient are not materially di fferent from an individual contract approach. Sanford grants credit without collateral to its patients and residents , most of who m are insured under third -party payor agreements. Sanford participates in Medicare, Medicaid, Blue Cross and other third -party payor programs. Contractual adjustments are accrued on an estimated basis in the period in which the services are rendered based on the respective contractual agreements and historical experience. Certain reimbursement arrangements are subject to retroact ive audit , and as a result , there is a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates could change upon audit . Differences between amounts estimated and final settlements are included in operations in the year in which the differences become known. General ly, patients and residents who are covered by third -party payors are responsible for related deductibles and coinsurance, which Sanford estimates the corresponding ability to collect based on historical experience, c urrent market conditions , and informatio n gathered based on the patient or resident's ability to pay . Subsequent changes as a result of adverse changes in the patient or resident's ability to pay are recorded as bad debt expense within operating expenses. Subsequent changes to allowance for bad debts estimates for the year s ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were not material . As part of Sanford's self -insured health plan benefit, net patient revenue of $98,550 and $102,193 was recognized for the year s ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. - 16 - The percentage of net patient revenue , net resident revenue and net accounts receivable as of and for the year s ended December 31 was as follows: 2019 2018 2019 2018 Net revenue Medicare 33.0 % 33.3 % 15.2 % 0.2% Medicaid 10.3 10.1 45.6 59.7 Blue Cross 28.7 28.8 0.0 0.0 Other third-party payors 25.9 25.6 7.6 4.9 Self-pay and other 2.1 2.2 31.6 35.2 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Net accounts receivable Medicare 24.5 % 24.4 % 16.7 % 8.7% Medicaid 10.0 8.4 40.8 61.8 Blue Cross 21.6 22.6 0.0 Other third-party payors 28.0 28.7 25.0 15.2 Self-pay and other 15.9 14.3 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %Patient Resident 4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREME NTS In accordance with the authoritative guidance, assets and liabiliti es recorded at fair value in the financial statements are categorized, for disclosure purposes, based upon whether the inputs used to determine their fair values are observable or unobservable. The authoritative guidance establishes a three- level value hie rarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Lev el 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under the FASB ASC 820 are des cribed as follows: Level 1 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that Sanford has the ability to access. Level 2 Inputs to the valuation methodology include d irectly or indir ectly observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active or inactive markets, q uoted prices for identical instruments in inactive markets , or i nputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and are related to the instruments that are supported by little or no market activity using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar valuation techniques. - 17 - A financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest leve l of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Sanford's policy for recording transfers is at the end of the period for which the transfer happened. There were no transfers between levels duri ng the year s ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value. Financial assets include short -term investments, debt service funds and security deposits in other current assets, investments , and assets whose use is li mited and are recorded at their estimated fair value. Fair values of debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. I nformation is obtained from custodians of the financial instruments and their third -party pricing services to establish fair value, which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The information is reviewed , and for many instruments whose pricing inputs are readily observable in the market, the valuation methodology is accepted by market participants and involves little to no judgment. For instruments whose pricing inputs are less observable in the marketplace, inputs can be subjective in nature and involve uncertainties. Management uses this information to distribute the instruments among the three -level hierarchy. Changes in the reported market values and returns are compared to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported fair values of the underlying debt and equity securities. This internal review of fair value methodology has not historically resulted in adjustment in the process obtained from the custodians. Fair values of debt securities that do not trade on a regular basis in active markets but are priced using other observable inputs are classified as Level 2. Fair value estimates for Level 1 and Level 2 equity securities are based on quoted market prices for actively traded equity securities or other market data for the same or comparable instruments and transactions in establishing the prices. Generally, Level 2 fixed income securities are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments, including the assets held in the defined benefit plans as referenced in Note 1 2. There were no financial assets recorded at fair value classifie d as Level 3 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. - 18 - Financial assets measured at fair value, as of December 31 , are summarized in the following tables: Level 1 Level 2 Total Assets Money market funds $ 147,337 $ - $ 147,337 Certificates of deposit - 36,571 36,571 Equity mutual and exchange traded funds 126,847 - 126,847 Mutual funds (related to deferred compensation) 150,571 - 150,571 Fixed income mutual and exchange traded funds 413,089 - 413,089 U.S. government securities 36,256 - 36,256 Government sponsored enterprise securities - 51,395 51,395 Government sponsored enterprise mortgage backed securities - 13,757 13,757 Corporate debt securities - 625,249 625,249 Municipal bonds - 330,015 330,015 Other - 16,662 16,662 Total assets valued at fair value $ 874,100 $ 1,073,649 1,947,749 Investments recorded at fair value based on net asset value 98,400 $ 2,046,149 Assets reported as Short-term investments $ 352,564 Investments 1,528,362 Assets whose use is limited Debt service funds and security deposits in other current assets 2,240 Deferred compensation funds 150,571 Affordable housing and other reserves 8,452 Affordable housing escrowed and other trusteed funds 2,617 Resident funds 1,343 $ 2,046,149 2019 - 19 - Level 1 Level 2 Total Assets Money market funds $ 57,287 $ - $ 57,287 Certificates of deposit - 1,837 1,837 Equity mutual and exchange traded funds 84,393 - 84,393 Mutual funds (related to deferred compensation) 113,470 - 113,470 Fixed income mutual and exchange traded funds 318,839 - 318,839 U.S. government securities 16,469 - 16,469 Government sponsored enterprise securities - 15,112 15,112 Government sponsored enterprise mortgage backed securities - 14,448 14,448 Corporate debt securities - 366,204 366,204 Municipal bonds - 347,253 347,253 Other - 15,582 15,582 Total assets valued at fair value $ 590,458 $ 760,436 1,350,894 Investments recorded at fair value based on net asset value 77,645 $ 1,428,539 Assets reported as Short-term investments $ 85,028 Investments 1,227,667 Assets whose use is limited Debt service funds in other current assets 1,332 Deferred compensation funds 113,470 Affordable housing escrowed and other trusteed funds 1,042 $ 1,428,539 2018 The carrying value of contributions receivable and not es receivable approximates fair value. Fixed rate long -term debt is carried at historical cost, and the fair value is determined by discounting future cash flows at current rates for the debt with similar risks and maturities, a Level 2 measurement. See fair value disclosed in Note 1 4. A portion of Sanford's investment portfolio is in alternative investments, which are not readily marketable and are valued at net asset value ( NAV) . Unless it is probable that all or a portion of the investment will be sold for an amount other than NAV, Sanford has concluded that the NAV approximates fair value. The calculation of NAV for certain alternative investment holdings use market valuation technique s that include operating performance, market, and cost approaches relying heavily on management assumpti ons and qualitative observations . These alternative investments include domestic and global equities and real estate private equity funds . Domestic and global equities includes investments in certain domestic and global healthcare technologies and companies. Real estate investments include a diversified portfolio primarily focused on opportunities in the acquisition, development, redevelopment, operation, and management of real estate properties , primarily in the hospita lity industry. As of December 31, alternative inves tments recorded at NAV consisted of the following : 2019 2018 2019 2018 Domestic and global equities $ 73,755 $ 55,341 $ 9,308 $ 3,735 Real estate private equities 24,645 22,304 - $ 98,400 $ 77,645 $ 9,308 $ 3,735 NAV Unfunded Commitments - 20 - There are limited provisions for Sanford to liquidate these alternative investments. In addition, there are additional unfunde d commitments not disclosed above that are contingent upon the respective entity's successful completion of certain progress activities. 5. LIQUIDITY AND AVAILA BILITY As part of Sanford's cash management policy , cash and investments feature a high degree of safety and liquidity to support general expenditures and debt service within one year in the normal course of operations . Financial assets available within one year as of December 31 consisted of the following: 2019 2018 Cash $ 191,994 $ 109,306 Short-term investments 352,564 85,028 Accounts receivable, less allowances 684,307 557,208 Debt service funds in other current assets 1,742 1,332 Notes and contributions receivable in other current assets 22,693 23,697 Investments, less alternative investments 1,429,962 1,150,022 $ 2,683,262 $ 1,926,593 Although Sanford h as net assets with donor restrictions that are generally supported by liquid financial assets , the respective financial assets are also available for general expenditure within one year in the normal course of operations and accordingly have been included in the summary above. Financial assets such as assets whose use is limited and non -current notes and contributions receivable are not available for general expenditure and debt service within the next year and are not reflected in the amounts above. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, Sanford is in compliance with bond covenants as disclosed in Note 1 4. 6.

PENSION PLANS DEFINED CONTRIBUTION RETIREMENT PLANS Sanford has defined contribution retirement plans that are available to all eligible employees who do not participate in a defined benef it pension plan. Employer contributions are based on a percentage of annual compensation and employee level of contributions. Employee and employer contributions are deposited with the plan trustee who invests the plan assets. D efine d contribution retireme nt costs of $95,030 and $77,824 were recognized as part of sal aries and benefits for the year s ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 . DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS Sanford has defined benefit pension plans that provide benefits based on years of service and co mpensation (the \"Master Plan and the \"Bismarck Plan\"). The plans are closed to new participants; however, e ach plan has active employees accruing benefits . - 24 - OBLIGATION AND FUNDED STATUS Defined benefit pension obligations a nd funded status are measured as of December 31, and changes for the year s then ended are as follows: 2019 2018 2019 2018 Change in benefit obligation Benefit obligation, beginning of year $ 203,627 $ 218,699 $ 121,628 $ year $ 227,031 $ 203,627 $ 139,649 $ 121,628 Change in plan assets Fair value of plan assets, beginning of year $ 163,804 $ 170,393 $ 99,757 $ 107,569 Actual gain (loss) 17,776 (10,250) (5,961) (6,015) Fair value of plan assets, end of year $ 188,266 $ 163,804 $ 115,472 $ 99,757 Funded status Benefit obligation in excess of plan assets $ 38,765 $ 39,823 $ 24,177 $ 21,871 Amounts recognized in net assets without donor restrictions consisting of net actuarial loss $ 63,732 $ 59,026 $ 16,574 $ 10,771 Accumulated benefit obligation $ 223,465 $ 200,535 $ 133,507 $ 116,627 Weighted average of assumptions used to determine end of year obligations Discount rate 3.30 % 4.30 % 3.35 % 4.30 % Rate of compensation increase 3.00 % 3.00 % 3.00 % 3.00 % Master Plan Bismarck Plan COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC PENSION COST 2019 2018 2019 2018 Service cost $ 1,189 $ 1,385 $ 1,167 $ 1,375 Interest cost (6,167) Amortization of actuarial loss 4,167 5,110 - - Net periodic pension cost $ 3,476 $ 4,697 $ 403 $ 151 Weighted average of assumptions used to determine net periodic cost Discount rate 4.30 % 4.20 % 4.30 % 4.20 % Plan assets expected long-term rate of return 6.00 % 6.00 % 6.00 % 6.00 % Rate of compensation increase 3.00 % 3.00 % 3.00 % 3.00 % Master Plan Bismarck Plan The above assumptions were established by working with an independent actuary. - 25 - PLAN ASSETS The pension plan weigh ted-average asset allocations by asset category as of December 3 1, was as follows: 2019 2018 2019 2018 Equity investments 34% 30% 33% 30% Debt investments 63 66 67 70 Cash equivalents 3 4 - - 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Master Plan Bismarck Plan Sanford's policy is to maintain a balanced mix between debt and equity investments in order to maximize its long - term rate of return while producing cash flows required for benefit payments. The expected long- term rate of return for all plans is based on historical experience and management believes this will be an appropriate rate of return going forward. Financial assets of the qualified plans were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31 and are summarized in the following tables by type of inputs (see Note 4) applicable to the fair value measurement s: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Money market funds $ 4,830 $ - $ - $ 4,830 Certificates of deposit - 807 - 807 Equity mutual and exchange traded funds 63,225 - - 63,225 Fixed income mutual and exchange traded funds 27,846 - - 27,846 U.S. government securities 9,555 - - 9,555 Government sponsored enterprise securities - 11,029 - 11,029 Government sponsored enterprise mortgage backed securities - 4,716 - 4,716 Corporate debt securities - 38,246 - 38,246 Municipal bonds - 27,103 - 27,103 Accrued earnings - 909 - 909 $ 105,456 $ 82,810 $ - $ 188,266 2019 - Master Plan Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Money market funds $ 382 $ - $ - $ 382 Equity mutual and exchange traded funds 37,907 - - 37,907 Fixed income mutual and exchange traded funds 77,183 - - 77,183 $ 115,472 $ - $ - $ 115,472 2019 - Bismarck Plan - 26 - Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Money market funds $ 6,239 $ - $ - $ 6,239 Certificates of deposit - 759 - 759 Equity mutual and exchange traded funds 49,200 - - 49,200 Fixed income mutual and exchange traded funds 23,922 - - 23,922 U.S. government securities 8,011 - - 8,011 Government sponsored enterprise securities - 8,702 - 8,702 Government sponsored enterprise mortgage backed securities - 4,027 - 4,027 Corporate debt securities - 33,100 - 33,100 Municipal bonds - 28,930 - 28,930 Accrued earnings - 914 - 914 $ 87,372 $ 76,432 $ - $ 163,804 2018 - Master Plan Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Money market funds $ 486 $ - $ - $ 486 Equity mutual and exchange traded funds 29,537 - - 29,537 Fixed income mutual and exchange traded funds 69,734 - - 69,734 $ 99,757 $ - $ - $ 99,757 2018 - Bismarck Plan Sanford expects to recognize $7,039 of amortization of net actuarial loss during 2020.

As disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, Sanford's consolidated financial statements include the operations of the Sanford foundations, the Sanford health plans, and other less significant Sanford subsidiaries and affiliates. Thes e entities were not audited in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and accordingly, this report does not include reporting on internal control over financial reporting or instances of noncompliance associated with such subsidiaries. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered Sanford's internal control over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Sanford's internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of Sanford's internal control. A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity's financial st atements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified . Deloitte & Touche LLP Suite 2800 50 South Sixth Street Minneapolis, MN - 34 -Compliance and Other Matters As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether Sanford's consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of consolidated financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was no t an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of ou r tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards . Purpose of this Report The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control or on compliance. This repo rt is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity's internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose. April 16, 2020 - 35 -INDE PENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR FEDERAL PROGRAM AND REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE To the Board of Trustees of Sanford Sioux Falls, South Dakota Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program We have audited Sanford and its subsidiaries (\"Sa nford\") compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of Sanford's major federal programs for the year ended December 31, 2019. Sanford's major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor's results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, Sanford's consolidated financial statements include the operations of the Sanford foundations, the Sanford health plans, and certain other less significant Sanford subsidiaries and affiliates. These entities were not audited in compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement because the entities did not receive any federal awards. Management's Responsibility Management is responsible for compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of its federal awards applicable to its federal programs. Auditor's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of Sanford's major federal programs based on our audit of the types of compliance requir ements referred to above. We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standa rds generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards , issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Those standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirem ents referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program occurre d. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about Sanford's compliance with those requ irements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal program. However, our audit does not prov ide a legal determination of Sanford's compliance. Opinion on Each Major Federal Program In our opinion, based on our audit, Sanford complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could ha ve a direct and material effect on each of its major federal programs for the year ended December 31, 2019. Deloitte & Touche LLP Suite 2800 50 South Sixth Street Minneapolis, MN - 36 -Report on Internal Control Over Compliance Management of Sanford is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over compliance with the types of compliance requiremen ts referred to above. In planning and performing our audit of compliance, we considered Sanford's in ternal control over compliance with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each major federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over complianc e. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of Sanford's internal control over compliance. A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and co rrect, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevente d, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance wi th a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. We did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over compliance and the re sults of that testing based on the requirements of the Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose .
