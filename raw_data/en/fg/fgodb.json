Would you like to see if your child's motor, communication, social/emotional or cognitive development is on track? Please go to the link below and fill out the appropriate form for your child before your scheduled visit. One of our doctors will help you review the form during your appointment. At SFM, we strive to provide a thoughtful approach to childhood vaccination. We understand that the current CDC vaccination recommendations may not be appropriate for every child. One of our trained physicians will be able to work with your family to create a vaccine schedule fitted to suit your child's individual risk factors. We provide all routine childhood vaccinations to our patients. We vaccinate using a schedule designed to minimize the chance of adverse effects and comprehensive enough to provide protection from infectious disease. We can take your family's health history, current health status and risk factors into account when vaccinating your child. With this vaccination service comes a great responsibilty on behalf of the parent to educate themselves on the risks and benefits of the individual vaccines vs. the childhood disease in question. Keep in mind that a modified schedule limits the amount of vaccinations received in a single visit. This schedule requires more frequent visits to the doctor's office and more of a financial burden on the family.
