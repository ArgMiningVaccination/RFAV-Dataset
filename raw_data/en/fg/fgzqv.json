As a former critical care nurse turned health care consultant, spending over 18 years setting strategies and transforming clinical, business and information systems has well prepared me for my new position. I'm thankful to follow in the footsteps of Dr. Terry Dwelle, one of the longest serving state health officers. Dr. Dwelle and Arvy Smith, deputy state health officer, assembled a great team of professionals at the North Dakota Department of Health (NDDoH) to achieve the mission of protecting and enhancing the health and safety of all North Dakotans. Structure The NDDoH is divided into six sections: Administrative Support, Community Health, Environmental Health, Emergency Preparedness & Response, Health Resources and Medical Services. These sections encompass divisions that support evidence-based programs and work that's critical to the health of North Dakota. In the following pages of the Biennial Report, you'll be able to read about the NDDoH, each division, section and program, along with accomplishments of the last biennium and goals for the next biennium. Culture Our culture of excellence was recognized by the Public Health Accreditation Board (PHAB) when they awarded accreditation to the NDDoH in March 2017. Using the PHAB set of nationally recognized standards to measure performance has laid the foundation for data-driven methods to increase efficiency, improve service and deliver positive outcomes for the citizens of North Dakota. We will continue to support high quality, evidence-based programs as it's vital to our success moving forward. Population health The department has a strong history of collaboration while focused on primary prevention. NDDoH is uniquely positioned to improve health outcomes for North Dakota through successful public and private partnerships. One example of this is the Baby & Me - Tobacco Free program, which has resulted in an 11 percent tobacco usage rate among pregnant women. Due to the work of many partners, his number has dropped nearly 7 percent in the last 10 years and has improved health outcomes for both the mother and baby. Just like this example, I could provide you 100 more. We cannot do this alone. It takes a dedicated team, successful partnerships, good leadership, financial resources, and an engaged public to create the kind of healthy North Dakota that we know is possible when we all work together. We hope you enjoy what you read.

Educate the public, solid waste facility operators and stakeholders about timely solid waste issues through training, workshops and educational materials. Promote the use of Abandoned Motor Vehicle Program funds to clean up unwanted scrap and evaluate alternative uses and management of scrap tires. Underground Storage Tank The Underground Storage Tank Program (UST) regulates petroleum and hazardous-substance storage tanks, establishes technical standards for installing and operating underground tanks, maintains a tank notification program, establishes financial responsibility requirements for tank owners, and provides state inspection and enforcement. The program also works with retailers and manufacturers to ensure specifications and standards are met for petroleum and antifreeze. Accomplishments Regulated more than 830 active tank facilities with a total of 2,239 tanks. Monitored compliance by on-site visits at least once every three years (compliance rate of 88.9 percent), as well as mail-in self-certification. Observed 95 tank closures, conducted more than 504 on-site inspections, and investigated and monitored cleanup of more than 44 leaking UST sites. 54Waste Management REGULATED2,239 TANKS Conducted routine collection and analysis of 492 petroleum samples. Registered all antifreeze manufacturers and retailers in the state. Used Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Trust Fund to investigate suspected UST releases and conduct corrective actions. LUST Trust Fund provided financing for cleanup and/or removal of leaking/potentially leaking USTs throughout the state. Initiated the updating of the UST rules and regulations as mandated by the EPA. Goals Assist tank owners with contamination assessment/ cleanup activities following upgrade and/or replacement of USTs or when leaks occur. Provide compliance monitoring, inspections and public outreach to inform tank owners about the proper operation of USTs. Enforce guidelines regarding delivery prohibition, secondary containment and owner/operator training. Provide online owner/operator training to tank owners to comply with the EPA guidelines. Use the LUST Trust Fund to investigate and properly close abandoned UST sites throughout the state. Collect petroleum samples from retailers and respond to product and labeling deficiencies. Review antifreeze registration requests and respond to formulation/labeling deficiencies. Complete the update of the UST rules and regulations as mandated by EPA. 55The Division of Water Quality monitors lakes, reservoirs, rivers, streams and wetlands, to ensure water stays clean for people today and in the future. The division works to maintain water quality to ensure continued beneficial use for municipalities, agriculture, industry and ecosystem health. Programs include: Groundwater Protection North Dakota Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NDPDES) Permit Special Projects, Certification and Standards Spill Reporting/Emergency Response/ Environmental Investigation and Cleanup Surface Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Watershed Management Ground Water Protection The Ground Water Protection Program is designed to control potential sources of contamination and to restore ground water impacted by contaminants. The Ground Water Protection Program consists of several subprograms, including the Source Water Protection Program, the Underground Injection Control Program and the Ambient Ground Water Monitoring Program. Accomplishments 1. Source Water Protection Completed the first cycle of a five-year rotation of updating wellhead protection reports for every active community water system. Educated community water systems about zoning Waste Management Water Qualityissues and the impacts of new facilities within source water protection areas. Provided new delineations and updated reports for water systems that installed new wells or plugged existing wells. 2. Underground Injection Control (UIC) Reviewed permit applications for one new Class I injection well and one application for a Class I to Class II well conversion. Increased focus on expanding UIC registration by working with the Division of Municipal Facilities to ensure that septic system registration is part of the approval process. Facilitated closure of several high-risk wells located in source water protection areas or other sensitive ground water areas. 3. Ambient Ground Water Monitoring As part of the Agricultural Ground Water Sampling Program, sampled approximately 344 wells in 31 aquifers for trace metals, general water chemistry parameters, nitrates and pesticides. As part of the Western Ground Water Sampling Program, sampled 184 wells in 21 aquifers for trace metals, bromide, general water chemistry parameters, nitrates, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX), diesel range organics (DRO) and gasoline range organics (GRO). Through the Western Program, more impacts to ground water from the Blacktail Creek spills were discovered and delineated. North Dakota Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NDPDES) Permit The North Dakota Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Program (NDPDES) issues point source wastewater discharge permits. Point source pollution comes from a specific source, such as the end of a pipe. Accomplishments Worked closely with cities of Williston and Watford City on development and construction of a new Water Resource Recovery Facility (WRRF) to treat wastewater for each city. Both systems use oxidation ditches and are nearly identical, except that the Williston facility is the first in the state to produce biosolids. Began expanding Electronic Reporting Information System (ERIS) in response to EPA 's 2015 Electronic Reporting Rule (eRule). Increased efficiency of electronic reporting has enabled staff to concentrate less on data entry and more on core program elements and permittee assistance. Worked to update steam electric generating facility permits to implement requirements of the federal 2015 Effluent Limitation Guideline Rule. State implementation has resulted in reasonable restrictions to reduce pollutants discharged while still allowing coal-fired power plants to operate. Special Projects, Certification and Standards The NDDoH is the lead agency for monitoring water quality, providing technical review, and ensuring water quality standards are met. The NDDoH takes a proactive approach to this duty by participating on multiple local, state and international water-related boards and committees. Accomplishments Conducted the triennial review of the water quality standards and drafted recommended changes necessary to protect the state's water resources and maintain compliance with the federal Clean Water Act. Reviewed and provided clean water certification or conditional certification on approximately 75 federal actions. Coordinated with various agencies and private entities on projects such as pipelines, local surface water drains, the Fargo diversion and the Mouse River Flood Enhancement. Spill Reporting/Emergency Response/ Environmental Investigation and Cleanup Any spill or discharge of waste that may pollute the state's waters must be reported to the NDDoH within 24 hours of the release. Reports are submitted through an on-line reporting system located on the NDDoH website. When the program receives report of a spill, an investigator or team is sent to evaluate the site. Some releases may require immediate response by 56Water Qualitytrained personnel; others may require investigation beyond initial cleanup to determine the full environmental impact. The program follows the spill remediation until cleanup is accomplished. Accomplishments More than 3,235 general and oilfield environmental incidents occurred in the state during the biennium (e.g., pipeline breaks, vehicle accidents, tank overflows, materials handling mishaps); of those, program staff investigated and followed up on 1,272 incidents, and the remaining incidents were determined to have no environmental impact or to be the responsibility of other agencies. Evaluated impacts to Ash Coulee Creek during the Belle Fourche pipeline incident; provided oversight of cleanup of the creek while protecting the Little Missouri River from impacts; continued oversight of soil cleanup at the pipeline break. Worked with landowners, other state agencies and industry to implement guidelines for the cleanup of saltwater impacts due to oilfield spills. Watershed Management The Watershed Management Program includes programs, projects and activities which can be grouped into three categories. These include (1) monitoring and assessment; (2) total maximum daily loads (TMDL); and (3) nonpoint source (NPS) pollution management. Monitoring and Assessment Initiated a Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) Surveillance Program in 2015 in response to blue-green algae bloom on Homme Dam in the northeastern North Dakota. Responded to 19 reports of blue-green algae blooms on lakes/reservoirs in 2016; of these, investigations resulted in NDDoH advisories or warnings for 15 lakes and reservoirs. NPS Pollution Management Approximately $3.5 million was allocated to NPS Program through Section 319 grants. Awarded Section 319 funding to 56 NPS projects, including 26 watershed projects, 14 educational projects and 12 development phase projects. Another four support projects were also provided grant funding to address specific priority issues (e.g., manure management and soil salinity) or to provide engineering assistance to watershed restoration projects. Watershed Management and TMDL Developed and began implementing the Basin Water Quality Management Framework, which will serve as a guide for water quality management planning and implementation through a targeted basin management approach. This should promote coordination of the collection and sharing of information, increase availability of technical and financial resources, and focus on more effective water quality management activities. Goals Maintain delegation and responsibility for federally mandated programs. Continue education and outreach activities to keep the public informed about environmental issues specific to water quality. Become more proactive in communicating about the quality of the state's water resources and the work conducted by the division. Adoption of proposed amendments to the Standards of Quality for Waters of the State. Provide necessary and increasing oversight on pipeline breaks, tanker truck rollovers, and numerous oil and saltwater spills in the oil patch of western North Dakota. Maintain state funding for nonpoint source pollution projects. Develop a comprehensive nutrient reduction strategy for lakes, reservoirs, rivers and streams that, when implemented, will help the state target and prioritize watersheds and BMPs to achieve cost-effective water quality improvements. Develop and adopt Crude Oil Release Cleanup Guidelines. 57INVESTIGATED 1,272 ENVIRONMENTAL INCIDENTS Water QualityPublications The following publications can be accessed on the North Dakota Department of Health website at ndhealth.gov, or by calling 701.328.2372. 58Administrative Support Section Reports 2016 North Dakota State Health Assessment 2016 North Dakota State Health Improvement Plan Annual C-Section Reports Annual Fast Facts Reports Annual Induced Termination of Pregnancy Report NDDoH Biennial Report Vital Events Summary Community Health Section Booklets Autism Spectrum Disorders Resource Booklet (revised) Cardiac Resource Booklet (revised) North Dakota Health Snapshot Pocket Guide Y our Own Special Goodbye Brochures 10 Things Breastfeeding Moms Should Know Before Leaving the Hospital Are you at Risk of a Heart Attack?
