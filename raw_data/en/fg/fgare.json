Everyone 6 months and older should receive a yearly flu vaccine, with rare exceptions. The flu vaccine causes your body to make antibodies that fight the flu, decreasing your risk of becoming sick with the flu. Since the viruses in the vaccine are not live, they cannot cause the flu. The flu vaccine is recommended annually, as immunity decreases over time. It takes about two weeks for the vaccine to be effective, so it is important to get the vaccine before the flu starts spreading in your area. There are several different types of flu vaccines available.

Common side effects of the flu vaccine include: soreness, redness or swelling at the injection site, fever, headache, nausea, and muscle aches. Less common side effects may include: fainting, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and allergic reactions (e.g., Egg allergy). Egg Allergy: Since eggs are used in the production of some flu vaccines, those with a life-threatening egg allergy should only receive a flu shot in a medical facility that is prepared to handle a severe allergic reaction (difficulty breathing, swelling of the eyes or lips, wheezing).

The good news is, those who have been vaccinated generally have a milder case of flu than those who are unvaccinated.
