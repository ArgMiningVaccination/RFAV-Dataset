SESSIONS INCLUDE: Clients are fully clothed and the healer's hands are placed lightly on or above the client, depending on the client's wishes. The healer scans the client for blockages and stress, then connects with high healing energy using a wide range of advanced ONE LIGHT HEALING TOUCH healing techniques, and then transmits the restorative healing energy through their hands into the client. After the session, the healer shares insights from the session. Clients don't have to believe in energy healing for it to be effective. "}
