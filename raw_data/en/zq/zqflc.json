He studied Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine at Maryland University Integrative Health and he is a Licensed Acupuncturist in Virginia. Asim studied Homeopathy with his father Asad Safdar, who brings with him two generations of experience. Asim saw hundreds of people with his father for two years, learning and observing the art of Homeopathy. He brings a unique perspective to the practice of healing by promoting body's inner vitality through the help of homeopathic remedies and creating a flow of healing with Acupuncture. His observation as a Homeopath has given him the ability to judge and treat disease at a particular stage without sending it deeper in to the body. Asim focuses on treating the depth of disease and creating a balance rather than simply treating the symptoms. Addressing a symptom without addressing the constitution causes the disease to shift its location and move towards more important locations such as the vital organs. This aspect of treatment is a significant part of Asim's practice. "}
