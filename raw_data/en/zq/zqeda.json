This book builds on current psychedelic research by providing an in-depth articulation of the practice of psychedelic therapy, weaving together a variety of complementary therapeutic frameworks, case examples, and practical guidance for cultivating a highly effective, ethically grounded, integral approach. Chapters by a diverse set of practicing psychotherapists and leading researchers aim to provide practitioners with a method that centers liberation of all dimensions of being through intersectional, client-centered, trauma-informed, and attachment-focused practices, alongside thoughtful attunement to the relational, somatic, imaginal, cultural, and transpersonal dimensions of healing. Integral Psychedelic Therapy will be essential reading for psychotherapists in practice and in training as well as those seeking personal healing and holistic transformation.

The Upside of Coming Down: The Opportunities and Challenges of Psychedelic Integration, Jessica Katzman and Harvey Schwartz \"The wild and wooly field of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy is in need of expert guidance and this edited book offers a lot of it from a diverse group of experienced practitioners and researchers, who cover everything from the somatic to the spiritual and social activist sides of this important movement. I am honored that Bob Grant contributed a clear and practical chapter on integrating ketamine with my Internal Family Systems (IFS) approach. My personal and clinical experience with this combination has been amazing and Bob's guidelines are extremely valuable. His personal journey is also inspiring.\" - Richard C. Schwartz, Ph.D. developer of the Internal Family Systems model and adjunct faculty, Harvard Medical School. \"Integral Psychedelic Therapy is a cutting-edge exploration of psychedelic-assisted therapy by some of the top therapists and researchers in the field, providing an abundance of essential insights that are foundational to this work. This is a core text for practitioners looking to develop their skills as well as anyone interested in psychedelic healing.\" - Rick Doblin, PhD, Founder & Executive Director, Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies \"This is a multi-faceted gem of a book! Integral Psychedelic Therapy is practical, necessary reading for anyone looking to understand the psychedelic revolution underway in psychotherapy and psychiatry.\" - Julie Holland, MD \"Psychedelics occasion a state of consciousness of immense therapeutic power and at the same time extraordinary vulnerability. Guidebooks are important, and this one, written by thoughtful and skillful practitioners, is a must-read for therapists who wish for these medicines to serve both personal healing and the greater good of society.\" - David E. Presti, University of California, Berkeley \"Within this wondrously evolving field of psychedelic medicine, we are discovering that the therapeutic envelope is more important, and potentially more meaningful, than the molecule. This book provides an elegant compendium of innovations, and deepens our shared understanding of expanded states. For clinicians and explorers alike.\" - Brian Richards, Psy.D., Sunstone Therapies, The Johns Hopkins Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research \"This timely collection, produced by clinicians and researchers at the forefront of the psychedelic movement, is a must-read for both newcomers and experts. It combines clinical inquiry and a humanistic approach, weaving in social justice and respect for Indigenous traditions. As regulation by the FDA, decriminalization, and mainstreaming advance globally, it's urgent to cultivate a thoughtful understanding and culture around these powerful substances. This book goes beyond mere glorification, alarmist calls for \"ethics\" and \"safety,\" or empty tokenization to dive deep into nuanced and complex discussions around psychedelic-assisted therapies.\" - Bia Labate, PhD, Executive Director, Chacruna Institute \"The prevalence of mental health conditions and the speed at which psychedelics look set to be incorporated into mainstream medicine means there will need to be many more specially-trained therapists in the very near future. This will be a steep learning curve and we will need to carefully combine elements from conventional psychiatry with knowledge learned from Indigenous and underground practitioners. This book does just that - providing an excellent, multidisciplinary education covering the techniques used.\" - Amanda Feilding, Founder & Executive Director of the Beckley Foundation, Oxford, UK. \"This book is a treasure trove of ideas and practical tips, refreshingly and importantly foregrounded in acknowledgement of the debt owed to indigenous plant medicine using traditions, and the impact of colonization, patriarchy, white supremacy, and corporate greed on the trajectory of psychedelic healing traditions. The subsequent chapters offer many different types of gifts; particular key issues, such as consensual touch, are considered from different viewpoints, as well as so many other important topics for anyone working with these healing modalities. For those who feel familiar with the 'basics' of 'prep-session-integration', this book delves deeper into some of the complexities, mysteries, nuanced applications, and ethical questions. The chapter on 'Decolonizing Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy' by Danielle Herrera, MFT was a wake up call for me, and is, I feel, a must-read for our community.\" - Rosalind Watts, PhD Founder and co-director of Acer Integration \"Integral Psychedelic Therapy brings needed attention and wisdom to a range of the most important aspects of working with psychedelics. At a time of rapid progress in clinical research, this book is a welcome reminder of the cultural context surrounding these medicines, including the history of psychedelics, the debt owed to indigenous wisdom and the tragic damage the \"War on Drugs\" has done to marginalized communities and to the advancement of health care and individual freedom. The more clinically oriented chapters remind us not to lose sight of the \"core, human elements of the work\" and the richness and depth of the human healing process. The authors draw on their own clinical experience to offer informed and insightful discussions of ethics and consent, therapeutic relationship, safe and mindful physical touch, music, the multiplicity of the psyche, numinous mystical experience, psychedelic group therapy and the immense importance of integration following psychedelic experiences. Case examples bring these discussions to life. This is a valuable resource for therapists and anyone else interested in psychedelics.\" - Michael Mithoefer, MD, Senior Medical Director for Medical Affairs, Training and Supervision, MAPS Public Benefit Corp. \"This book arrives at a critical time in the evolution of psychedelic therapy as it articulates the challenges, mystery, and beauty of the psychedelic renaissance. The authors include diverse voices, each with their own sensitivities and refreshing perspectives, blending science, theory, ethics, and heart within broader societal forces. Being of service in partnership with compassion and ethical care are at the heart of each chapter. This book offers a wealth of information from practitioners with extensive clinical and research experience, that is fresh, relevant, and culturally responsive.\" - Marcela Ot'alora G.
