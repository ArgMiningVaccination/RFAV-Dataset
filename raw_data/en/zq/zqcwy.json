You've probably heard that frankincense and myrrh were two of the gifts brought to the Baby Jesus by the Three Wise Men, along with gold. But what are they? Are they used today? We have the answers. If you've ever heard of frankincense and myrrh, it's most likely because they are known historically as the precious gifts presented to the Baby Jesus by the Three Wise Men, along with gold. According to Matthew, 2:11: And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh. But have you ever wondered why the Wise Men chose these items as gifts? What are they, and are they really that valuable? What Are Frankincense and Myrrh?
