The term of execution of the contract extends from last December 26 until the end of the administration of this first consignment of vaccines for the prioritized groups in the first phases of vaccination. The contract is carried out at the request of the General Directorate of Public Health of the Community of Madrid, within the framework of the Regional Government's Vaccination Plan against COVID-19, which began last Sunday in Spain with the administration of the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 (Comirnaty) developed by the Pfizer-BioNTech laboratory. The company that has been used has proven and extensive experience in the distribution of vaccines and with extensive facilities in the region, with high capacity and technology to cover the service. The logistics service for the conservation and distribution of vaccines is required to facilitate the correct development of the vaccination process, so as to ensure its storage and distribution in optimal conditions that guarantee the quality of these products throughout the process. The vaccination program against the coronavirus involves several critical points that differ from the administration of other vaccines, among which the requirement of extraordinary cold conditions during transport and storage stands out. This vaccine needs -70\u00baC for long-term storage. If it is going to be used in a period of five days or less, it can be transported between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C. In addition, it is presented in multidose vials (5 doses per vial) that require appointment planning to avoid loss of units. For the administration of the vaccine, reconstitution with a diluent with serum and intramuscular needles (five needles and five syringes per vial) are required beforehand. To complete the process, two doses must be administered, with a minimum separation interval of 21 days between them, the vaccination being effective seven days after receiving the second dose. "}
