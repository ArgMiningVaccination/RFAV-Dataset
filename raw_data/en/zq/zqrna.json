About Our Drug Formulary Our drug formulary is a list of drugs that our Regional Formulary and Therapeutics Committee has reviewed and approved for our Members and includes drugs covered under this EOC . Drugs on the formulary have been approved by the FDA. Our Regional Formulary and Therapeutics Committee is made up of Participating Physicians, other Participating Providers, pharmacists, and administrative staff.

They may not approve a drug if there is not enough scientific evidence that it is clinically effective. They may also exclude a drug if it does not have a clinical or cost advantage over comparable formulary drugs. The Regional Formula ry and Therapeutics Committee meets to review new drugs and reconsider drugs currently on the market. After this review, they may add drugs to the formulary or remove drugs from it. If a drug is removed from the formulary, you will need to switch to another comparable drug that is on the drug formulary, unless your old drug meets exception criteria. Refer to the \"Drug Formulary Exception Process\" in this \"Outpatient Prescription Drugs and Supplies\" section for more information.

Drugs on our formulary may move to a different drug tier during the Year. For example, a drug could move from the Non -Preferred Brand -Name Drug list to the Preferred Brand -Name Dru g list.

REDUCTIONS Coordination of Benefits This Coordination of Benefits (COB) provision applies when you have health care coverage under more than one Plan . To avoid delays in claim processing, you and your provider should file all your claims with each Plan at the same time. If Medicare is your Primary Plan, Medicare may submit your claims to your Secondary Plan for you. This Plan is your Primary Plan for covered Services as described in the \"Pediatric Dental Services\" section of this EOC . Plan, and other important terms that apply only to this provision, are defined below. The order of benefit determination rules described under this \"Coordination of Benefits\" section determines the order in which each Plan will pay a claim for benefits. The Plan that pays first is called the Primary Plan . The Primary Plan must pay benefits in accordance with its contract terms without regard to the possibility EWIDDEDDNT0123 62 that another Plan may cover some expenses. The Plan that pays after the Primary Plan is the Secondary Plan . The Secondary Plan may reduce the benefits it pays so that payments from all Plans do not exceed 100 percent of the total Allowable Expense. If the Secondary Plan receives a claim without the Primary Plan's payment details, the Secondary Plan will notify the submitting provider and/or you as soon as possible and within 30 days of receipt of the claim that the claim is incomplete. After receiving the missing information, the Secondary Plan will promptly process the claim. If the Primary Plan has not processed the claim within 60 days and is not waiting for additional information, the provider and/or you may submit the claim to the Secondary Plan with a notice that the Primary Plan has failed to pay the claim. The Secondary Plan must pay the claim as the Primary Plan within 30 calendar days. After payment information is received from the Primary Plan, the Secondary Plan may recover any excess amount paid under the \"Right of Recovery\" provision. Notice to Covered Persons If you are covered by more than one health benefit Plan, and you do not know which is your primary Plan, you or your provider should contact any one of the health Plans to verify which Plan is primary. The health Plan you contact is responsible for working with the other Plan to determine which is primary and will let you know within thirty calendar days. CAUTION: All health Plans have timely claim filing requirements. If you or your provider fail to submit your claim to a secondary health Plan within that Plan's claim filing time limit, the Plan can deny the claim. If you experience delays in the processing of your claim by the primary health Plan, you or your provider will need to submit your claim to the secondary health Plan within its claim filing time limit to prevent a denial of the claim. To avoid delays in c laims processing, if you are covered by more than one Plan you should promptly report to your providers and P lans any changes in your coverage. Definitions for this \"Coordination of Benefits\" section Plan. A Plan is any of the following that provides benef its or Services for medical or dental care or treatment. If separate contracts are used to provide coordinated coverage for members of a group, the separate contracts are considered parts of the same Plan and there is no COB among those separate contracts. However, if COB rules do not apply to all contracts, or to all benefits in the same contract, the contract or benefit to which COB does not apply is treated as a separate Plan. Plan includes: Group, individual, or blanket disability insurance contracts, and group or individual insurance contracts issued by health care service contractors or health maintenance organizations (HMO), Closed Panel Plans or other forms of group coverage; medical care components of long- term care contracts, such as skilled nursing care; and Medicare or any other federal governmental Plan, as permitted by law. Plan does not include: Hospital indemnity or fixed payment coverage or other fixed indemnity or fixed payment coverage; accident only coverage; specified disease or specified accident coverage; limited benefit health coverage, as defined by state law; school accident type coverage; benefits for non -medical components of long-term care policies; automobile insurance policies required by statute to provide medical benefits; Medicare supplement policies; Medicaid coverage; or coverage under other federal governmental Plans, unless permitted by law. Each contract for coverage is a separate Plan. If a Plan has two parts and COB rules apply only to one of the two, each of the parts is treated as a separate Plan. This Plan. This Plan means the part of the contract providing the health care benefits to which the COB provision applies and which may be reduced because of the benefits of other Plans. Any other part of the contract providing health care benefits is separate from This Plan. A contract may apply one COB provision EWIDDEDDNT0123 63 to certain benefits, such as dental benefits, coordinating only with similar benefits, and may apply another COB provision to coordinate other benefits. Primary Plan/ Secondary Plan. The order of benefit determination rules determines whether This Plan is a Primary Plan or Secondary Plan when the person has health care coverage under more than one Plan. When This Plan is primary, we determine payment for the benefits fi rst before those of any other Plan without considering any other Plan's benefits. We will not reduce your benefits under This Plan. When This Plan is secondary, we determine the benefits after those of another Plan and must make payment in an amount so that when combined with the amount paid by the Primary Plan, the total benefits paid or provided by all Plans for the claim equal 100 percent of the total Allowable Expense for that claim. This means that when This Plan is secondary, we must pay the amount wh ich, when combined with what the Primary Plan paid, cannot be less than the same Allowable Expense the Secondary Plan would have paid if it had been the Primary Plan . In addition, if This Plan is secondary, we must calculate the savings (the amount paid subtracted from the amount we would have paid had we been the Primary Plan) and record these savings as a medical benefit reserve for the covered person. This reserve must be used to pay any medical expenses during that c alendar y ear, whether or not they are an Allowable Expense under This Plan. If This Plan is Secondary, it will not be required to pay an amount in excess of its maximum benefit plus any accrued savings. Allowable Expense. Allowable Expense is a health care expense, including deductible, coinsurance, and copayments, that is covered at least in part by any Plan covering the person. When a Plan provides benefits in the form of Services, the Charges of each Service will be considered an Allowable Expense and a benefit paid. An expense that is not covered by any Plan covering the person is not an Allowable Expense. The following are examples of expenses that are not Allowable Expenses: The difference between the cost of a semi -private hospital room and a private hospital room is not an allowable exp ense unless one of the Plans provides coverage for private hospital room expenses. If a person is covered by two or more Plans that compute their benefit payments on the basis of usual and customary fees or relative value schedule reimbursement method or o ther similar reimbursement method, any amount in excess of the highest reimbursement amount for a specific benefit. If a person is covered by two or more Plans that provide benefits or Services on the basis of negotiated fees, an amount in excess of the hi ghest of the negotiated fees. Closed Panel Plan. Closed Panel Plan is a Plan that provides health care benefits to covered persons in the form of Services through a panel of providers who are primarily contracted by the Plan, and that excludes coverage for Services provided by other providers, except in cases of emergency or referral by a panel provider. Custodial Parent. Custodial parent is the parent awarded custody by a court decree or, in the absence of a court decree, is the parent with whom the child resides more than one half of the c alendar y ear excluding any temporary visitation. Order of Benefit Determination Rul es When a Member is covered by two or more Plans, the rules for determining the order of benefit payments are as follows: The Primary Plan pays or provides its benefits according to its terms of coverage and without regard to the benefits under any other Plan. A Plan that does not contain a COB provision that is consistent with state regulations is always primary unless the provisions of both Plans state that the complying Plan is primary. Coverage that is obtained by virtue of membership in a group that is designed to supplement a part of a basic package of benefits and provides that this supplementary coverage is excess to any other parts of the Plan provided by the contract holder. Examples include major medical coverages that are superimposed EWIDDEDDNT0123 64 over hospital and surgical benefits, and insurance type coverages that are written in connection with a Closed Panel Plan to provide out-of-network benefits. A Plan may consider the benefits paid or provided by another Plan in calculating payment of its benefi ts only when it is secondary to that other Plan. Each Plan determines its order of benefits using the first of the following rules that apply: Subscriber or Dependent. The Plan that covers the person as a Subscriber is the Primary Plan and the Plan that co vers the person as a Dependent is the Secondary Plan. However, if the person is a Medicare beneficiary and, as a result of federal law, Medicare is secondary to the Plan covering the person as a Dependent, and primary to the Plan covering the person as a S ubscriber (e.g., a retired employee), then the order of benefits between the two Plans is reversed so that the Plan covering the person as Subscriber is the Secondary Plan and the other Plan is the Primary Plan. Dependent Child Covered Under More Than One Plan. Unless there is a court decree stating otherwise, when a Dependent child is covered by more than one Plan the order of benefits is determined as follows: For a Dependent child whose parents are married or are living together, whether or not they have ever been married: The Plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the c alendar y ear is the Primary Plan; or If both parents have the same birthday, the Plan that has covered the parent the longest is the Primary Plan. For a Dependent child whose parents are divorced or separated or not living together, whether or not they have ever been married: If a court decree states that one of the parents is responsible for the Dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage and the Plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, that Plan is primary. This rule applies to claim determination periods commencing after the Plan is given notice of the court decree; If a court decree states one parent is to assume primary financial responsibi lity for the Dependent child but does not mention responsibility for health care expenses, the Plan of the parent assuming financial responsibility is primary; If a court decree states that both parents are responsible for the Dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage, the Plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the c alendar year is the Primary Plan or if both parents have the same birthday, the Plan that has covered the parent the longest is the Primary Plan ; If a court decr ee states that the parents have joint custody without specifying that one parent has responsibility for the health care expenses or health care coverage of the Dependent child, the Plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the calendar y ear is the Primary Plan or if both parents have the same birthday, the Plan that has covered the parent the longest is the Primary Plan; or If there is no court decree allocating responsibility for the D ependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage, the order of benefits for the child are as follows: 1) The Plan covering the Custodial Parent 2) The Plan covering the spouse of the Custodial Parent 3) The Plan covering the non-Custodial Parent 4) The Plan covering the spouse of the non- Custodial Parent EWIDDEDDNT0123 65 For a Dependent child covered under more than one Plan of individuals who are not the parents of the child, the above provisions determine the order of benefits as if those individuals were the parents of the child. Active Employee or Retired or Laid -off Employee. The Plan that covers a person as an active employee, that is, an employee who is neither laid off nor retired, is the Primary Plan. The Plan covering that same person as a retired or laid -off employee is the Secondary Plan. The same would hold true if a perso n is a Dependent of an active employee and that same person is a Dependent of a retired or laid -off employee. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. This rule does not apply if the \"Order of Benefit Determination Rules\" section can determine the order of benefits. COBRA or State Continuation Coverage. If a person whose coverage is provided under COBRA or under a right of continuation provided by state or other federa l law is covered under another Plan, the Plan covering the person as an employee, member, subscriber, or retiree or covering the person as a dependent of an employee, member, subscriber, or retiree is the Primary Plan and the COBRA or state or other federal continuation coverage is the Secondary Plan. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. This rule does not apply if the \"Order of Benefit Determination Rules\" section can determine the order of benefits. Longer or Shorter Length of Coverage. The Plan that covered the person as an employee, member, policyholder, subscriber, or retiree longer is the Primary Plan and the Plan that covered the person the shorter period of time is the Secondary Plan. If the preceding rules do not determine the order of benefits, the Allowable Expenses must be shared equally between the Plans meeting the definition of Plan. In addition, This Plan will not pay more than we would have paid had we been the Primary Plan. Effect on the Benefits of This Plan. When This Pl an is secondary, we may reduce the benefits so that the total benefits paid or provided by all Plans during a claim determination period are not more than the total Allowable Expenses. In determining the amount to be paid for any claim, the Secondary Plan must make payment in an amount so that, when combined with the amount paid by the Primary Plan, the total benefits paid or provided by all Plans for the claim equal 100 percent of the total Allowable Expense for that claim. Total Allowable Expense cannot b e less than the same Allowable Expense the Secondary Plan would have paid if it had been the Primary Plan. In addition, the Secondary Plan must credit to its Plan deductible any amounts it would have credited to its deductible in the absence of other healt h care coverage. Right to Receive and Release Needed Information. Certain facts about health care coverage and Services are needed to apply these COB rules and to determine benefits payable under This Plan and other Plans. We may get the facts we need from or give them to other organizations or persons for the purpose of applying these rules and determining benefits payable under This Plan and other Plans covering the person claiming benefits. We are not required to tell, or obtain the consent of, any person to do this. Each person claiming benefits under This Plan must give us any facts we need to apply those rules and determine benefits payable. Facility of Payment. If payments that should have been made under This Plan are made by another Plan, we have the right, at our discretion, to remit to the other Plan the amount we determine appropriate to satisfy the intent of this provision. The amounts paid to the other Plan are considered benefits paid under This Plan. To the extent of these payments, we are fully discharged from liability under This Plan. Right of Recovery. We have the right to recover excess payment whenever we pay Allowable Expenses in excess of the maximum amount of payment necessary to satisfy the intent of this provision. We may recover excess payment from any person to whom or for whom payment was made or any other issuers or Plans. Questions About Coordination of Benefits?

Subject to applicable law, i f you obtain a settlement , award, or judgment from or on behalf of another party or insurer, or a payment under a no-fault insurance provision, you must ensur e we are reimbursed for covered Services that you receive for the injury or illness , except that we will not collect to the extent that the payment would leave you less than fully compensated for your injury or illness . This \"Injuries or Illnesses Alleged to be Caused by Other Parties or Covered by No -fault Insurance\" section does not affect your obligation to pay any applicable Cost Share for these covered Services. The amount of reimbursement due to the Plan is not limited by or subject to the Out-of- Pocket Maximum. If you do not recover anything from or on behalf of the other party or no- fault insurance, then you are responsible only for any applicable Cost Share . To the extent permitted by law, we have the option of becoming subrogated to all claims, causes of action, and other rights you may have against another party or an insurer, government program, or other source of coverage for monetary damages, compensation, or indemnification on account of the injury or illness allegedly caused by another party. We will be so subrogated as of the time we mail or deliver a written notice of our exercise of this option to you or your attorney, but we will be subrogated only to the extent of the total Charges for the relevant covered Services. To secure our rights, we will have a lien on the proceeds of any judgment, award, or settlement you or we (when we subrogate) obtain against another party or any other insurer, regardless of how those proceeds may be characterized or designated. The proceeds that are subject to our lien include any judgment, award, or settlement that you obtain. Within 30 days after submitting or filing a claim or legal action against a nother party or any insurer, you must send written notice of the claim or legal action to us at: Equian, LLC Attn: Fax: 502- 214-1291 In order for us to determine the existence of any rights we may have and to satisfy those rights, you must complete and send to us all consents, releases, trust agreements, authorizations, assignments, and other documents, including lien forms directing your attorney, the responsible party, and the responsible party's insurer to pay us directly. You must not take any action prejudicial to our rights. You must provide us written notice before you settle a claim or obtain a judgment or award , or if it appears you will make a recovery of any kind.

Sufficient funds to satisfy our claims must be held in a specifically identifiable account until our claims are resolved . Pending final resolution of our claims, you must retain control over the recovered amounts to which we may assert a right. If reasonable collectio ns costs have been incurred by your attorney in connection with obtaining recovery, we will reduce the amount of our claim by the amount of an equitable apportionment of the collection costs between us and you. This reduction will be made only if: We receive a list of the fees and associated costs before settlement, and Your attorney's actions were directly related to securing a recovery for you. If your estate, parent, guardian, or conservator asserts a claim against another party or any insurer based on your injury or illness, any settlement or judgment recovered shall be subject to our liens and other rights to the same extent as if you had asserted the claim against the other party. We may assign our rights to enforce our liens and other rights. Surrogac y Arrangements If you enter into a Surrogacy Arrangement, whether traditional or gestational, you must ensure we are reimbursed for covered Services you receive related to conception, pregnancy, delivery, or postpartum care in connection with that arrangement (\"Surrogacy Health Services\"), except that the amount we collect will not exceed the payments or other compensation you and any other payee are entitled to receive under the Surrogacy Arrangement. A \"Surrogacy Arrangement\" is one in which a woman agrees to become pregnant and to surrender the baby (or babies) to another person or persons who intend to raise the child (or children), whether or not the woman receives payment for being a surrogate. This includes any person who is impregnated by artificial insemination, intrauterine insemination, in vitro fertilization or through the surgical implantation of a fertilized egg of another person and includes both traditional surrogacy and gestational carriers. Note: This \"Surrogacy Arrangements\" section does not affect your obligation to pay any applicable Cost Share, or other amounts you are required to pay for these Services. After you surrender a baby to the legal parents, you are not obligated to pay Charges for any Services that the baby receives (the legal parents are financially responsible for any Services that the baby receives). By accepting Surrogacy Health Services, you automatically assign to us your right to receive payments that are payable to you or any other payee under the Surrogacy Arrangement, regardless of whether those payments are characterized as being for medical expenses. To secure our rights, we will also have a lien on those payments and on any escrow account, trust, or any other account that holds those payments. Those payments (and amounts in any escrow account, trust, or other account that holds those payments) shall first be applied to satisfy our lien. The assignment and our lien will not exceed the total amount of your obligation to us under the preceding paragraph. Within 30 days after entering into a Surrogacy Arrangement, you must send written notice of the arrangement, including all of the following information: Names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the other parties to the arrangement Names, addresses, and telephone numbers of any escrow agent or trustee Names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the intended parents and any other parties who are financially responsible for Services the baby (or babies) receive, including names, addresses, and telephone numbers for any health insurance that will cover Services that the baby (or babies) receive A signed copy of any contracts and other documents explaining the arrangement Any other information we request in order to satisfy our rights EWIDDEDDNT0123 68 You must send this information to: Surrogacy Other Party Liability Supervisor Equian Phone: 1- 800-552-8314 You must complete and send us all consents, releases, authorizations, lien forms, and other documents that are reasonably necessary for us to determine the existence of any rights we may have under this \"Surrogacy Arrangements\" section and t o satisfy those rights. You may not agree to waive, release, or reduce our rights under this \"Surrogacy Arrangements\" section without our prior, written consent. If your estate, parent, guardian, or conservator asserts a claim against another party based o n the surrogacy arrangement, your estate, parent, guardian, or conservator and any settlement, award, or judgment recovered by the estate, parent, guardian, or conservator shall be subject to our liens and other rights to the same extent as if you had asse rted the claim against that party. We may assign our rights to enforce our liens and other rights. Workers' Compensation or Employer's Liability If you suffer from an injury or illness that is compensable under a workers' compensation or employer's liability law, we will provide Services subject to your obligation to reimburse us to the extent of a payment or any other benefit, including any amount received as a settlement that you receive under the law.

If you are dissatisfied with our final adverse benefit determination, you may have a right to request an external review. An external review is a request for an independent review organization (IRO) to determine whether our internal appeal decision is correct. For example, you have the right to request external review of an adverse benefit determination that: Relies on medical judgment, including but not limited to, me dical necessity, appropriateness, health care setting, level of care, or that the requested Service is not efficacious or otherwise unjustified under evidence- based medical criteria. Concludes that a treatment is experimental or investigational. Concludes that parity exists in the non-quantitative treatment limitations applied to behavioral health care (mental health and/or s ubstance u se disorder ) benefits . Involves consideration of whether w e are complying with federal law requirements regarding balance (surprise) billing and/or cost sharing protections pursuant to the No Surprises Act (Public Health Service Act sections 2799A -1 and 2799A -2 and 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7149.110 --149.130). Involves a decision related to rescission of your coverage. Within 180 c alendar days after the date of our appeal denial letter, you must mail, call, or fax your request for external review to Member Relations at: Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of the Northwest Member Relations Department 500 NE Multnomah St., Suite 100 Portlan d, OR 97232- 2099 Phone: 1- 800-813-2000 Fax: 1- 855-347-7239 Member Relations will forward your request to the IRO no later than the third business day after the date they receive your request for review. They will include written information received in sup port of the appeal along with medical records and other documents relevant in making the determination. Within one day of selecting the IRO, we will notify the appellant of the name of the IRO and its contact information. EWIDDEDDNT0123 79 You will have five business days to submit to the IRO, in writing, additional information that the IRO must consider when conducting the external review. The IRO will forward to us any additional information you submit within one business day of receipt. You must exhaust our internal claim s and appeals procedure for your claim before you may request external review unless one of the following is true: External review is permitted to occur simultaneously with your urgent pre -service appeal or urgent concurrent care appeal; Your request quali fies for expedited external review; We have failed to comply with federal requirements regarding our claims and appeals procedures ; or We have failed to comply with the Washington requirement to make a decision regarding the appeal within 30 calendar days for non -urgent appeals and 72 hours for urgent appeals. Your request for external review will be expedited if your request concerns an admission, availability of care, continued stay, or health care S ervice for which you received E mergency Services but have not been discharged from a facility, or the ordinary time period for external review would seriously jeopardize your life or health, the life or health of a fetus, or your ability to regain maximum function. If an adverse benefit determination involves our decision to modify, reduce, or terminate an otherwise covered Service that you are receiving at the time the request for review is submitted and our decision is based upon a finding that the Service or level of care is no longer Medically Necessary, we will continue to provide the Service if requested by you until a determination is made by the IRO. If the IRO affirms our adverse benefit determination, you may be responsible for the cost of the continued Serv ice. You are not responsible for the costs of the external review, and you may name someone else to file the request for external review for you if you give permission in writing and include that with your request for external review. Company will be bound by and act in accordance with the decision of the IRO notwithstanding the definition of Medically Necessary care. If we do not follow a decision of an IRO, you have the right to sue us . Experimental or Investigational Determination and Appeal Decisio ns on appeals about experimental or investigational S ervices will be communicated in writing within 20 days of receipt of a fully documented request, unless you consent in writing to an extension of time. Appeals that meet the criteria for an urgent appeal , as described in the \" Urgent Pre -service Appeal \" section, will be expedited to meet the clinical urgency of the situation, not to exceed 72 hours. If, on appeal, the decision to deny S ervices is upheld, the final decision will specify (i) the title, speci alty, and professional qualifications of the individual(s) who made the final decision and (ii) the basis for the final decision.
