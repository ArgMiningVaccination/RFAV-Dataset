GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 3 27 - (1) Section 327.1 Purpose and Introduction The DCFS Guardian (also referred to as the \"G uardianship Administrator\" for the Department) serves as: acting custodian for children in DCFS protective custody ; temporary custodian of each child or youth placed in the care of the Department through an order of temporary custody by a juvenile court ; legal guardian of the person of each child or youth adjudicated to be an abused, neglected or dependent minor and placed in the guardianship of the Department by a juvenile court; legal guardian and custodian with power to consent to adoption of a child for whom one or both parents have executed a written surrender for adoption; and legal guardian of wards of the court over 18 years of age who are unable to consent on behalf of themselves . The DCFS Guardi an is appointed by the Director of the Department. The DCFS Guardian must register his/her name with the Illinois Secretary of State. Within the Office of the DCFS Guardian, designated DCFS staff shall be appointed as \"Authorized Agent s\" of the DCFS Guardian. Each Authorized Agent shall undergo training regarding the duties of the DCFS Guardian, and the role and responsibilities of an Authorized Agent. The names of Authorized Agents of the DCFS Guardian are also re gistered with the Illinois Secretary of State. The DCFS Guardian may limit the type of consent that an Authorized Agent may provide. Child Protection Specialists and Permanency Workers shall direct medical personnel to call the DCFS Consent Unit (or, aft erhours, the Child Intake and Recovery Unit) to obtain consent for medical treatment. Medical consents shall be requested by calling: During regular work hours (Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.): DCFS Consent Line, 800-828-2179; and After h ours, weekends and holidays: Child Intake and Recovery Unit, 866-503-0184. More detailed information about medical consents is contained in Procedures 327.5, Medical Consents . GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 3 27 - (2) Section 327.2 Definitions \"Authorized Agent \" means \"Designee\" as defined in Rule 327.2, Definitions , which states , \"Designee\" means those Department staff who have been appointed by the Director and authorized by the Guardianship Administrator and have been given formal authority to authorize and consent to matters concerning children for whom the Department has legal responsibility . The consent authority of an Authorized Agent may be broad or limited in scope depending on the individual agent's job functions as set out in Department Rules and Procedures. \"DCFS Guardian \" means the \"G uardianship Administrator\" as that term is defined in Rule 327.2, which states , \"Guardianship Administrator\" means that person designated by the Director of the Department of Children and Family Services to serve as guardian or custodian of children accepted by the Department pursuant to the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, the Children and Family Services Act, the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act, and the Adoption Act . Section 327.3 Acceptance of Children The procedures contained in this secti on describe the methods by which the Department assumes legal responsibility for children and how the DCFS Guardian is to be informed when children are accepted for care. Children are accepted for care through court -ordered custody or guardianship, throug h adoptive surrender signed by the parent(s), through voluntary placement agreements and through temporary protective custody. a) Juvenile Court Orders Under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, the circuit court of each Illinois county has the authority to commit abused, neglected and dependent children under 18 years of age and delinquent children under 16 years of age to the Department. T he Department is responsible for accepting and providing appropriate care and treatment for these children. It is the D epartment's discretion to accept a delinquent youth or a minor in need of supervision age 16 or older . The juvenile court has continuing jurisdiction and authority for the children and youth it commits to the Department. Child Protection Specialists and Permanency Workers from each Department office and purchase of service (POS) agency must be familiar with the Juvenile Court Act and local court requirements for filing important documents (e.g., Family Service Plans and Visitation and Contact Plans) with the juvenile court and the attorneys/parties in each child's case. The Department may request the local State's Attorney Office to initiate juvenile court proceedings on behalf of an \"abused child\", \"neglected child \", or \"dependent child\" (as defined in the Juvenile Court Act ). The Department may also request the State's Attorney to file a petition or motion for termination of parental rights and power to consent to adoption when a case has passed legal screening and adoption or legal guardianship is determined to be appropriate. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 3 27 - (3) b) Adoptive Surrenders 1) Obtaining Surrenders for Adoption The DCFS Guardian has designated certain Department adoption staff to accept surrenders for purposes of adoption. The designated Adoption Workers are available in each DCFS Region. To become designated to take a surrender, these Adoption Workers have attended training and pass ed an examination. The training and examination have been prepared and approved by the DCFS Office of Legal Services and DCFS Training Office. A surrender may be taken by a judge in any Illinois Circuit Court. On a case-by- case basis, a judge may authorize a specific individual to take a surrender when the parent is unable to be present in court . (E.g., the warden at a penitentiary may be authorized to accept a surrender of an inmate.) A surrender for adoption executed in accordance with the law of another state is valid in Illinois . When a parent of a DCFS ward resides in another state and wishes to surrender his/her child for adoption, the Permanency Worker can arrange for the parent to appear before a judge in that state, or another individual who is authorized in that state to take a surrender . When discussing surrenders for adoption with the parents, the Permanency Worker should ask ques tions to determine that it is each parent's intention to voluntarily terminate their parental rights and that is in the best interest of the child to be adopted. When the parents are not married, the mother shall be asked to identify the father. The Perm anency Worker must locate the father and determine if he intends to acknowledge paternity and establish a relationship with the child. If not, the Permanency Worker shall ask the father if he will execute a surrender for adoption. The Adoption Act permit s a father to execute a surrender prior to the birth of the child . However, the Department discourages accepting a surrender before the child is born. The surrender of an unborn child can be revoked at any time before the birth of the child and during the first 72 hours after the birth of the child. The preferred practice is to have the parents execute surrenders before a judge more than 72 hours after the child's birth. All surrenders of children in DCFS custody or guardianship shall be taken on a CFS 435, Final and Irrevocable Surrender to an Agency for Purposes of Adoption of a Born Child . The Permanency Worker shall prepare the CFS 435, in duplicate, for each parent who will be executing the surrender. If the legal father ( e.g., spouse) is not the child's biological father, his surrender, in addition to the surrender of the biological father, is necessary to completely free the child for adoption. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 3 27 - (4) A putative father is a man whose paternity has not been established or is not presumed under Illinois law. The Permanency Worker shall make every effort to locate and contact the putative father , explain his rights, and if he wants, help him establish paternity. When a putative father is not willing to be come involved, or hesitates to acknowledge paterni ty, and it is the mother's intention to surrender her child for adoption, the Permanency Worker shall request a legal s creening with the DCFS Regional Counsel to determine if grounds exist to terminate the putative father's parental rights and if a legal r isk placement is appropriate . Grounds for termination of parental rights are set out in Section (1)(D) of the Adoption Act [750 ILCS 50(1)(D)]. Legal risk placements are explained in Rule 309.50, Identification of Children for Potential Adoption Planning .) If there is reason to believe the father is interested in establishing paternity , the Permanency Worker shall speak with the father to determine his interest in doing so. Paternity must be established in accordance with the Illinois Parentage Act [750 ILCS 40]. The Permanency Worker should contact the State's Attorney's Office for assistance. 2) Authority to Accept a Surrender Authority to accept a surrender for adoption is limited to the provisions listed in this subsection. DCFS Regional Counsel should be contacted as soon as possible if there are questions about specific surrender procedures in any particular county. The Permanency Worker shall verify that: the individuals who wish to execute surrenders for adoption are the child's legal parents and that they have the legal right to relinquish the child ; each parent executing a surrender is mentally competent; the surrender is for the purpose of adoptive placement and such placement can reasonably be anticipated; no surrender (from either mother or father) shall be taken prior to the birth of the child or within the first 72 hour s after the birth of the child; in situations where there is both a legal father (spouse) and a putative (biological) father , all three parties must be available and willing to sign surrenders ; and a diligent search is conducted for any parent ( legal, putative or biological) whose identity is known, but whose whereabouts are unknown. When the identity or the whereabouts of a parent is unknown, a surrender may be take n from the available parent. The State's Attorney shall be asked to provide notice by publication for the unavailable parent . GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 3 27 - (5) Note : Before making an out-of-state placement , the Permanency Worker should determine whether the receiving state require s that all parental rights ( legal, putative and biological) be terminated prior to placement in an adoptive home in that s tate. 3) Refusal to Take a Surrender Surrenders shall not be taken in the following situations: all cases where a parent's whereabouts are known but he/she is uncooperative (e.g., refusing to answer letters, phone calls, etc. ); all cases where a parent is by reason of age, mental or emotional capacity presumed to be unable to give a valid surrender for adoption of his/her child; all cases where parents disagree as to whether surrender for adoption is the best plan for their child; all cases where one or both parents vacillate regarding whether or not to sign a surrender ; and all cases where coercion , duress or lack of understanding is indicated on the CFS 424, Parental Affidavit . In the situations cited above, the Permanency Worker shall present all information necessary to enable the Court to determine the parent's capacity or to accept the surrend er from the parent. 4) Additional Requirements to Execute Surrenders for Adoption When a surrender is to be taken the following is applicable: The parents should be given a copy of the surrender to read prior to signing. When any doubt exists regarding the parent's ability to read, the form must be read to him/her. When a parent speaks a foreign language or is hearing impaired, an interpreter must be present. After the surrender form has been read and prior to signing it, the questions contained on form CFS 424 must be asked of the parent. When response to the questions raise s doubts regarding the parent's understanding of, and/or free execution of a surrender, a surrender shall not be taken. When the gravity of signing is clearly understood, the parent(s) and all witnesses should sign the required copies of the surrender and CFS 424 and the documents sh ould be notarized. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 3 27 - (6) c) Temporary Protective Custody Within the Department, only Child Protection Specialists (or Permanency Workers serving afterhours as Child Protection Specialists ) have authority to take a child into temporary protective custody. The factors for taking temporary protective custody are set out in Rule and Procedures 300.120, Temporary Protective Custody. A child taken into temporary protective custody must be brought be fore a judicial officer for a shelter care hearing within 48 hours, unless the custody has been terminated earlier, in accordance with the Juvenile Court Act. During the period of temporary protective custody (prior to the commencement of court proceeding s, or returning the child home ), the Child Protection Specialist or Permanency Worker shall contact the DCFS Consent Unit to obtain consent to ordinary medical treatment , if such treatment is necessary. Section 327.4 Duties of the DCFS Guardian Note: The Guardianship Administrator is referred to throughout these procedures as the \"DCFS Guardian.\" The responsibilities and duties of a guardian of the person of a minor are specified in the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. In varying degrees a guardian is an a gent of, and accountable to, the court of jurisdiction, and the guardian may be cited in court and required to make a full report on his/her actions on behalf of the ward at any time. The guardian may be required to file annual reports with the court and the court may require additional reports. Unless terminated earlier by court order, or the ward's legal adoption, private guardianship, marriage, or death, the DCFS Guardian's appointment may continue until the ward reaches age 21. Consents With few exceptions, when the DCFS Guardian is appointed by a court as a child or youth's legal guardian, the DCFS Guardian is authorized to consent to important decisions affecting the child or youth while the child/youth is under 18 years of age and in the Department's care. Youth age 18 and older are presumed under law to be mature enough to understand and consent to matters affecting themselves. The Guardian will not consent on behalf of a youth 18 or older unless a court determines that the youth is not competent to make his/her own decisions. If a court makes that determination, it will also specify in the court order whether the lack of competence extends to all decision -making, or just to certain decisions (e.g., financial decisions, medical care). Permanency and adoption workers and their supervisors are expected to prepare necessary consent forms and other documentation for the Guardian's approval and signature together with a summary of the information needed by the Guardian to make an informed decision concerning matters requiring consent. Individual case files maintained in the DCFS/POS field office shall be made available to the DCFS Guardian (or Authorized Agents) and other Department staff upon request. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 3 27 - (7) The DCFS Guardian has authority to deny consent when appropriate. The Guardian will rely heavily on information and recommendations from the child's permanency or adoption worker and supervisor in this decision making process. a) Consent to Adoption 1) Who May Give Consent for Adoption of a DCFS Ward The DCFS Guardian shall designate certain Adoption Supervisors in each DCFS Region to serve as Authorized Agents of the DCFS Guardian for the limited purpose of consenting to the adoption of children in DCFS guardianship. This appointment as Authorized Agents shall be in writing, and t he name of each designated Adoption Supervisor shall be registered with the Illinois Secretary of State. An Adoption Supervisor appointed as an Authorized Agent may accept summons and petitions for adoption of Department wards. When the DCFS Guardian is guardian of a child \"with power to consent to adoption\", an Adoption Supervisor appointed as an Authorized Agent may sign an entry of appearance and consent to adoption of that child when adoption by the petitioners is in the child's best interests. The Adoption Supervisor shall comply with the requirements in Rules and Procedures 309, Adoption Services for DCFS Wards when assessing placement considerations and the best interests of the child. 2) Notifying the Court Follo wing Completion of the Adoption The Permanency Worker shall promptly notify the juvenile court of the date when an Order of Adoption for a DCFS ward is entered, and should provide the court with a certified copy of the Order of Adoption. The Permanency W orker shall send a completed CFS 440 A, Request for Guardian's Petition for Release of Guardianship , to an Adoption Supervisor who has been designated an Authorized Agent of the DCFS Guardian for this purpose. If determined appropriate, the Adoption Super visor will complete form CFS 440, Petition for Discharge f rom Guardianship and CFS 440- 1 Order of Discharge, and forward these forms to the Juvenile Court or to the Permanency Worker for presentation to the court. When the Permanency Worker receives a copy of the Order of Discharge signed by the judge, the child's case can then be closed. b) Consent for Behavioral Health Services Behavioral health services may be provided to children and youth for whom the Department is legally responsible by agencies th at have specifically contracted with the Department of Children and Family Services or the Department of Human Services. These agencies are certified in accordance with 59 Ill Adm. Code 132, Medicaid Community Mental Health Services Program . GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 3 27 - (8) Medicaid Co mmunity Mental Health services require the consent of the DCFS Guardian or an Authorized Agent from the Consent Unit. These services include but are not limited to: Pre-hospitalization screening; Rehabilitative or Mental Health development; Psychiatric Evaluation; Psychological testing; and Treatment with psychotropic medication. Consent by the DCFS Guardian or an Authorized Agent from the Consent Unit is required before any of these services can be provided to a DCFS ward less than 18 years of age. However, the Guardian's consent is not required prior to a screening requested after a referral to a Screening, Assessment and Supportive Services (SASS) agency that is limited to an interview with the child and/or a caregiver to obtain information to determine whether: the referred child is a client as defined in the SASS program plan; the behavior and emotional status of the child is such that the child is a threat to him/herself or others; the caregiver is incapable of effectively responding to the child's behavioral or emotional condition without assistance; and the referred child has been hospitalized for psychiatric problems or presented to a hospital for psychiatric admission at the time of the referral. Additionally, the consent of the DCFS Guardian or an Authorized Agent from the Consent Unit is not required to provide crisis intervention services (in accordance with 59 Ill. Adm. Code 132) or when a mental health assessment is court -ordered. T he Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code provides: A youth 12 years of age or older may request and receive counseling services or psychotherapy on an outpatient basis. The consent of his parent, guardian or person in loco parentis shall not be necessar y to authorize outpatient counseling or psychotherapy. The minor's parent, guardian or person in loco parentis shall not be informed of such counseling or psychotherapy without the consent of the minor unless the facility director believes such disclosure is necessary. If the facility director intends to disclose the fact of counseling or psychotherapy, the minor shall be so informed. However, until the consent of the minor's parent, guardian or person in loco parentis has been obtained, outpatient counseling or psychotherapy provided to a minor under the age of 17 shall be limited to not more than 5 sessions, a session lasting not more than 45 minutes. The minor's GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 3 27 - (9) parent, guardian or person in loco parentis shall not be liable for the costs of outpatient counseling or psychotherapy which is received by the minor without the consent of the minor's parent, guardian or person in loco parentis. [405 ILCS 5/3-501] Any minor 16 years of age or older may be admitted to a mental health facility as a voluntary re cipient pursuant to the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code: Admission, Transfer and Discharge Procedures for the Mentally Ill, if the minor himself executes the application . A minor so admitted shall be treated as an adult under Article IV of that Code and shall be subject to all of the provisions of that Article. The minor's parent, guardian or person in loco parentis shall be immediately informed of the admission. [405 ILCS 5/3-502] c) Rehabilitative or Mental Health Assessment A separat e, informed consent is required for all DCFS wards under 18 years of age prior to the beginning of an assessment to determine whether the ward is in need of Medicaid Community Mental Health services. The CFS 431- 1, Consent of Guardian to Mental Health Treatment shall be signed by the DCFS Guardian or an Authorized Agent from the Consent Unit when a contracted Medicaid Community Mental Health service provider requests written consent to perform an assessment of a child/youth. The original copy of the signe d CFS 431-1 shall be provided to the Medicaid Community Mental Health service provider, and a copy shall be forwarded to the child's Permanency Worker for placement in the case record. If the assessment is performed on an in- patient basis for a child for whom the Department has guardianship through the Juvenile Court of Cook County, the DCFS Guardian or Authorized Agent from the Consent Unit must also comply with the requirements of In re Lee-Wesley. ( See Procedures 301.110, Psychiatric Hospitalization ) Note: The Consent Decree in In re Lee- Wesley requires the DCFS Guardian to notify the Guardianship and Advocacy Commission within 24 hours of admission of a Cook County ward to a mental health or drug dependency facility, in order to ensure that these ward s are not placed inappropriately in psychiatric facilities, nor held longer than medically necessary. This consent decree applies to Cook County children who are placed in a psychiatric facility , regardless of whether the facility is located inside or outside of Cook County. The DCFS Guardian and Authorized Agents will not sign \"blanket\" or incomplete consent forms under any circumstances. All consent forms must be specific, time limited and given without duress or coercion. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 3 27 - (10) Once the assessment has been completed, separate, specific informed consents are required for the treatment plan, administration of psychotropic medication, and/or psychiatric hospitalization. (For more information, see Rules 325, Administration of Psychotropic Medications to DCFS W ards , and Procedures 301.110, Psychiatric Hospitalization .) Consent for other mental health services described in the treatment plan is indicated by the Authorized Agent's signature on the Individual Treatment Plan (ITP) or the Rehabilitative Services Pla n (RSP). 1) Individual Treatment or Rehabilitative Services Plan Development/Modification An Individual Treatment Plan (ITP) is developed on the basis of a mental health assessment. A Rehabilitative Services Plan (RSP) is developed on the basis of a rehabilitative assessment. The ITP and RSP are prepared on forms supplied by the mental health provider and must be signed by the DCFS Guardian or Authorized Agent from the Consent Unit before any other mental health services (other than crisis intervention) can be provided to the child/youth. If the child/youth is 12 years of age or older, he/she must also sign the ITP/RSP in order to receive services. Any modification of the ITP/RSP also requires the consent of the DCFS Guardian or Authorized Agent from the Consent Unit (and child/youth 12 years of age or older). If services listed in the ITP/RSP will be provided by an agency that did not participate in the development of the Treatment/Rehabilitative Services Plan, a separate consent is required for each agency to provide its particular services. Note: Administration of psychotropic medication is a medical procedure that requires the consent of the DCFS Guardian or an Authorized Agent from the Consent Unit in accordance with Rules 325, Administration of Psychotropic Medications to DCFS Wards. 2) Behavior Management Techniques The DCFS Guardian is responsible for protecting the rights of children in care. This includes responsibility for ensuring that DCFS wards are not subjected to excessive or inappropriate use of behavior management techniques. The child's Permanency Worker shall instruct the facility, in writing, that in accordance with Rule 384.5, Discipline and Behavior Management in Child Care Facilities , residential child care facilities must notify the Permanency Worker within 24 hours of the physical restraint or confinement of a DCFS ward . The Permanency Worker shall also advise the facility that, in accordance with Rule 325, there must be a separate written consent for administration to a DCF S ward of each psychotropic or psychoactive drug. Changes in dosage or frequency require additional written approval. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 3 27 - (11) d) Other Consents This section deals with procedures for obtaining required consents for other important decisions that may need to be made on behalf of children. When seeking the consent of the DCFS Guardian, the ward has the right to be informed that he/she may request a service appeal to review any service decision made by the DCFS Guardian or an Authorized Agent. The Permanency Worker is responsible to give the child/youth timely written notice of the decision. 1) Consent to Marriage Consent of the DCFS Guardian or an Authorized Agent from the Consent Unit is required for issuance of a marriage license to any DCFS ward between the ages of 16 and 18. To obtain consent, the youth's Permanency Worker shall send a memorandum to the Office of the DCFS Guardian with the following information about the ward: Name Date of birth Place of birth (city, county, state) Current residence (city, county, state) Concerning the person the ward is to marry: Name Date of birth Current residence (city, county, state) If not of the age of majority, legal status; name and relationship of person who will consent The Permanency Worker shall include information to support why consent should or should not be given. The Permanency Worker may contact the DCFS Consent Unit at 800-828-2179 for more information about preparing this memorandum. The DCFS Guardian or Authorized Agent from the Consent Unit may pe rsonally interview the ward, caregivers and Permanency Worker. If the request for consent is approved, the DCFS Guardian or Authorized Agent will complete, sign and notarize the Affidavit of Consent of Parent or Guardian for Marriage of a Mino r (printed o n the reverse side of the marriage application form), and forward it to the Permanency Worker who initiated the request. The Permanency Worker shall give the Affidavit to the ward to be used to obtain a marriage license. In some counties, the Permanency Worker may also need to provide a certified copy of the court order awarding guardianship to DCFS as proof of the guardian's authority. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 3 27 - (12) If the marriage will take place in a state other than Illinois, the Permanency Worker shall secure and complete the pr oper consent forms from that state and provide the forms to the Office of the DCFS Guardian. The laws in some states permit marriage, with or without parent/guardian consent, at an earlier age than permitted in Illinois. If a ward travels to another state for the sole purpose of marriage when he/she would not be permitted to marry under Illinois law, that marriage could be voidable. If the Permanency Worker suspects or learns that a teenage ward intends to go to another state to get married without conse nt of the guardian, the Permanency Worker should share this information with the ward. If the Permanency Worker learns that one or both parents have consented to the marriage of a DCFS ward, the Permanency Worker shall immediately contact the DCFS Guardia n and DCFS Regional Counsel. 2) Enlistment in the Armed Forces When a ward age 17 wishes to enlist in a branch of the armed forces, the Permanency Worker should consult with the local recruiting officer about enlistment procedures, and make arrangements to obtain a consent form for the DCFS Guardian. The consent form for enlistment must be completed by the recruiter and forwarded by the Permanency Worker to the Office of the DCFS Guardian. The DCFS Guardian or Authorized Agent from the Consent Unit may wish to interview the ward before acting upon the consent request. When the consent request has been approved and signed by the DCFS Guardian or Authorized Agent from the Consent Unit, it will be returned to the Permanency Worker. 3) Enlistment in Job C orps The Office of Economic Opportunity establishes policy and procedure regarding the Job Corps. In Illinois, the agency designated by the Office of Economic Opportunity to screen and recruit applicants is the Illinois Job Service.

The U.S. Department of State provides detailed guidelines for preparing a passport application and supporting documents. These guidelines and application forms are available on the websites for the U.S. Depa rtment of State (travel.state.gov) and the U.S. Postal Service (www.usps.com/shop/apply- for-a- passport.htm), as well as at the Passport Office in Chicago, the Office of the Clerk of the United States District Court serving the locale in which the DCFS area office is located and many post offices. Fees for passports are posted on the website. Checks should be made payable to \"Department of State.\" It may take at least 4 weeks, (longer during the months from May to September when vacation travel is at its peak) to obtain a passport.

Instructions and additional fee information for obtaining an expedited passport are available on the U. S. Department of State Travel website (travel.state.gov). 5) Release of Information Consents When a request for release of information requires the consent of the guardian (See Rule 431, Confidentiality of Personal Information of Persons Served by the Department ), the signature of the DCFS Guardian or an Authorized Agent from the Consent Unit shall be obtained on the consent form. 6) School Matters Since the school plays a major role in the life and development of the school age child, there are many ev ents that require the participation and decisions of the child's parent. For children who are the legal responsibility of the Department, those providing substitute care (depending on what type of placement setting the child is in) must make these decisio ns. For most routine school activities, only the involve ment of the child's Permanency Worker or foster parent (in group settings, residential administrator or designee) is required.

Sheldon, Director EFFECTIVE: Immediately I. PURPOSE The purpose of this Policy Guide is to implement Public Act 99 -839 (amending Section 7.3a of the Children and Family Services Act [20 ILCS 505/7.3a]) and Title IV -E of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 670 et seq.], both of which authorize all caregivers of children/youth in substitute care to use \"normalcy parenting \" and apply the Reasonable and Prudent Parenting Standard when making parenting decisions in the children's best interests . \"Normalcy parenting \" and the Reasonable and Prudent Parenting Standard are defined in Section III, below . Procedures 315.135(d), Reasonable and Prudent Parent Standard, address much of the information contained below. To the extent that Procedures 315.135(d) may differ from this Policy Guide, the Policy Guide shall control. Procedures 327.4(d), Duties of the Guardian, Other Consents address much of the information contained in Appendix A. To the extent that Procedures 327.4(d) may differ from this Policy Guide, the Policy Guide shall control. This Policy Guide replaces Policy Guide 2015.16, The Reasonable and Prudent Parent Standard. II. PRIMARY USERS The primary users of this Policy Guide are DCFS and POS Permanency Supervisors and Caseworkers; DCFS a nd POS Foster Care Licensing Representatives and S upervisors, A&I Licensing Representatives and Supervisors , Child Welfare Agency, Child Care Institution and Group Home Administrators, Supervisors and S taff. This Policy Guide may impact Child Protection S pecialists and Supervisors when there is any delay in assignment of a Permanency Worker for a child or youth in Protective or Temporary Custody. 2 III. DEFINITIONS \"Normalcy parenting \" means empowering a caregiver to approve or not approve a child's or yo uth's participation in appropriate extracurricular activities based on the caregiver's own assessment using the Reasonable and Prudent Parent Standard, without prior approval of the Department, the Permanency Worker or the court. The goal of Normalcy Parenting and the Reasonable and Prudent Parent Standard is to allow children and youth in care the opportunity for normal growth and development through participation in age, physical, culturally and mentally appropriate activities, responsibilities and life skills. \"Reasonable and Prudent Parent Standard\" means the standard characterized by careful and sensible parental decisions that maintain the health, safety, and best interests of a child while at the same time encouraging the emotional and developmental growth of the child, that a caregiver shall use when determining whether to allow a child in foster care under the responsibility of the State to participate in extracurricular, enrichment, cultural, and social activities. [42 U.S.C. 675(10)] The caregiver must use the Reasonable and Prudent Parent Standard when determining whether to allow a child in care to participate in extracurricular, enrichment, cultural, and social activities. \"Caregiver\" means a licensed foster parent or unlicensed relative caregiver who provides care for a child in DCFS custody or guardianship, or a designated official employed by and present at the licensed child care facility in which a child in DCFS custody or guardianship is placed. For purposes of this Policy Guide, the \"c aregiver\" for a youth under 18 years of age in an independent living (ILO) or transitional living (TLP) arrangement is assigned or designated staff of the ILO or TLP provider/child care facility. \"Appropriate activities\" means activities or items that are generally accepted as suitable for children of the same chronological age or developmental level of maturity. Appropriateness is based on the development of cognitive, emotional, physical, and behavioral capacity that is typical for an age or age group, taking into account the individual child's cognitive, emotional, physical, and behavioral development. [20 ILCS 505/7.3a] IV. GENERAL PRINCIPLES Effective immediately, ALL caregivers for all children/youth in out of home placements licensed by the Depar tment should us e Normalcy Par enting and the Reasonable and Prudent Parent Standard for decision-making regarding the children/youth's participation in: extracurricular activities; enrichment opportunities; social activities; and cultural activities, religious, and other significant activities. Normalcy parenting empowers caregivers to make these decisions without seeking approval or consent from the Permanency Worker or other child welfare staff . 3 The caregiver must still seek consent in other areas wher e specific State or federal laws limit consent authorization. Some examples where Normalcy Parenting does not apply include to consent to medical and dental care, and disclosure of mental health information. Appendix A lists frequent events affect ing the lives of children and youth in care, and the persons authorize to give consent for those event s. Appendix A includes the categories of events w here, under normalcy parenting, the caregiver is authorized to consent. Appendix A is not intended to be exhaustive , since it is impossible to predict every potential event that may arise in a child 's lives. If an event is not listed in Appendix A, the caregiver should consult with the Permanency Worker. If necessary, the Permanency Worker or Supervisor can consult with the Office of the DCFS Guardian. Section 7.3a of the Child and Family Services Act lists 5 factors (a through e, below) that caregivers should consider as they apply the Reasonable and Prudent Parent Standard. Under each factor are a few questions that may help the caregiver in this process. a) The child's age, maturity, and developmental level to promote the overall health, safety, and best interests of the child. Is my decision based on my child's individual needs and abilities? (Remember: every child is different.) Does this activity conflict with my child's Service Plan? Does my child /youth demonstrate sufficient maturity in decision -making as appropriate for his/her age/ability and participation in this activity? Does my child /youth understands his/her medical needs and is he/she able to tell others how to help him/her if necessary? If on medication, can my child/youth carry and self -administer medication? If needed, is my child/youth able to use public transportation or self - transportation? b) The best interest of the child based on information known by the caregiver. Do I know my child/youth well enough to approve participation in this activity? Will the timing of this activity interfere with sibling or parent -child visitation, counseling appointments or doctor's appointments? Scheduling conflicts should be discussed with my child/youth's Permanency Worker to explore options that may enable the child/youth to participate in the activity. 4 c) T he importance and fundamental value of encouraging the child's emotional and developmental growth gained through participation in activities in his or her community; Does this activity promote my child /youth's social development? Have I shared information with the Child and Family Team about my child's participation in this activity? Does this activity support my child/youth's connection to his/her roots? Is this activity an important milestone in my child/youth's culture? d) T he importance and fundamental value of providing the child with the most family - like living experience possible; and Do I know who will be attending the activity? Does my child understand our parental expectations regarding curfew, approval for last minute changes to the plan and the consequences for not complying wi th the expectations? Does my child know who to call in case of an emergency? e) The behavioral history of the child and the child's ability to safely participate in the proposed activity. Can my child /youth take care of himself/herself, make a decision and make good choices? A caregiver is not liable for harm caused to a child in care who participates in an activity approved by the caregiver, provided that the caregiver has acted as a reasonable and prudent parent in permitting the child to engage in the activity. V.

MEDICAL CONSENTS -- IMPORTANT PHONE NUMBERS: Monday - Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., call the DCFS Consent Unit at 800- 828-2179 After hours, holidays and weekends, call the Child Intake and Recovery Unit at 866-503-0184 GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 3 27 - (36) B) Abortion. Because a pregnant minor has a legal right to consent to her own medical/surgical treatment, the pregnant minor has the legal right to arrange and accomplish an abortion without her parent's or guardian's consent. The Permanency Worker shall ensure that a pregnant minor who is contemplating an abortion is fully informed about all options for resolution of her pregnancy and has received counseling regarding abortion. (See Procedures 302.360(m), Family Planning Services, Pregnancy Testing and Abortion Notification .) The Illinois Parental Notice of Abortion Act of 1995 [750 ILCS 70]. This Act requires a physician who intends to perform an abortion on a pregnant minor, or a physician referring the minor for an abortion, to give 48 hours actual notice directly, in person or by phone, to an adult family member of the pregna nt minor of the intent to perform an abortion on that minor. The Act defines \"adult family member\" as a parent, grandparent, step-parent living in the household or legal guardian. The Act requires that a physician give notice to the adult family member. The adult family member does not provide consent to the abortion. The Act provides the physician with alternative notice options when an adult family member cannot be directly contacted, and provides a number of exceptions, including one involving court intervention. If a physician contacts a DCFS or POS Permanency Worker, supervisor, or foster parent to provide an \"abortion notification\" for a pregnant minor under DCFS custody, the worker, supervisor or foster parent shall immediately instruct the physician to contact the DCFS Guardian, and shall give the physician the phone numbers shown below. An Authorized Agent from the Consent Unit or the Child Intake and Recovery Unit shall accept notification calls for pregnant minors for whom DCFS has guardianship. The Authorized Agent will advise the physician if DCFS does not have guardianship of the pregnant minor and will not accept notification when DCFS has protective or temporary custody. Abortion Notification phone numbers : Monday - Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., call the DCFS Consent Unit at 800-828-2179 After hours, holidays and weekends, call the Child Intake and Recovery Unit at 866-503-0184 GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 3 27 - (37) C) Victim of Sexual Assault or Abuse. Section 3(b) of the Consent by Minors to Medical Procedures Act [410 ILCS 210] provides: Where a minor is the victim of a predatory criminal sexual assault of a child, aggravated criminal sexual assault, criminal sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual abuse or criminal sexual abuse, as provided in Sections 11- 1.20 through 11- 1.60 of the Criminal Code of 2012, the consent of the minor's parent or legal guardian need not be obtained to authorize a hospital, physician, advanced practice nurse, physician assistant, or ot her medical personnel to furnish medical care or counseling related to the diagnosis or treatment of any disease or injury arising from such offense. The minor may consent to such counseling, diagnosis or treatment as if the minor had reached his or her age of majority. D) Sexually Transmissible Infections, Drug or Alcohol Abuse. Section 4 of the Consent by Minors to Medical Procedures Act [410 ILCS 210] provides: ...a minor 12 years of age or older who may have come into contact with any [sexually transmitted infection or \"STI\"] or who may be determined to be an addict, an alcoholic or an intoxicated person...or who may have a family member who abuses drugs or alcohol may give consent to the furnishing of medical care or counseling related to the diagnosis or treatment of [the STI or drug or alcohol abuse] ... The consent of the parent, parents, or legal guardian of a minor shall not be necessary to authorize medical care or counseling related to the diagnosis or treatment of [an STI] or drug use or alcohol cons umption by the minor or the effects on the minor of drug or alcohol abuse by a member of the minor's family.... Anyone involved in the furnishing of medical care to the minor or counseling related to the diagnosis of the minor's [STI] , or drug or alcohol us e by the minor or a member of the minor's family shall, upon the minor's consent, make reasonable efforts, to involve the family of the minor in his/her treatment, if the person furnishing treatment believes that the involvement of the family will not be detrimental to the progress and care of the minor. Reasonable efforts shall be extended to assist the minor in accepting the involvement of his or her family in the care and treatment being given. [410 ILCS 210/4] GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 3 27 - (38) Section 5 of the Act provides: ...[the p erson] who provides counseling to a minor patient who has come into contact with any [STI] may, but shall not be obligated to, inform the parent, parents, or guardian of the minor as to the treatment given or needed. Any person described in [Section 5 of this Act] who provides counseling to a minor who abuses drugs or alcohol or has a family member who abuses drugs or alcohol shall not inform the parent, parents or guardian, or other responsible adult of the minor's condition or treatment without the minor' s consent unless that action is, in the person's judgment, necessary to protect the safety of the minor, a family member, or another individual. E) Birth Control Services and Information. Birth control services and information may be provided to a minor (male or female) over age 12 by a doctor without parental or guardian consent if the child is pregnant or if the failure to provide such services would create a serious health hazard or the child has been referred for such services by a physician, clergyman or a planned parenthood agency. = 2) 3) Who May Provide Medical Consents When a medical consent is required for children under 18 years of age in the custody or guardianship of the Department, that consent shall be given only by the DCFS Guardian or an Authorized Agent. For medical consents, \"Authorized Agent\" means staff of the DCFS Consent Unit or Child Intake and Recovery Unit who have received training on the duties and responsibilities of an Authorized Agent and who have been registered as Author ized Agents by the Department with the Illinois Secretary of State - Index Department. During regular working hours , medical providers requesting a medical consent (other than consent for ordinary or routine medical or dental care) should be instructed to call the DCFS Consent Unit at 800-828-2179. After hours, and on weekends and holidays , medical providers should call the Child Intake and Recovery Unit at 866- 503-0184. Providers and substitute caregivers cannot provide medical consents for children in DCFS custody or guardianship. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 3 27 - (39) A parent of a child in the custody or guardianship of DCFS cannot provide medical consent for the child except in very limited and specific circumstances. (See subsection (b), Specific Circumstances.) A) Responsibilitie s of Authorized Agents Providing Medical Consent. The first responsibility of the Authorized Agent receiving a request for medical consent is to determine the legal status of the child who requires the service, as the DCFS Guardian's authority varies depending upon whether the Department has temporary or protective custody, a surrender, voluntary placement agreement or full guardianship. (See subsection (b), Specific Circumstances). The Authorized Agent shall ask whatever questions are necessary to secur e a clear picture of the child's circumstances. The ultimate decision of whether to grant or withhold the requested consent shall be based upon an understanding of the facts and how these relate to good care of children. The Department provides several p rofessional consultation resources for the Department's Authorized Agents. (See subsection (a)(4), Consultation for Major/Elective Procedures.) B) Consents for Emergency Care. The Consent by Minors to Medical Procedures Act states that the consent of a parent or guardian is not necessary for emergency treatment or first aid of a minor if in the sole opinion of the licensed physician, advanced practice nurse, physician assistant, dentist or hospital, the obtaining of consent is not reasonably feasible und er the circumstances without adversely affecting the condition of the minor's health. While this Act does not preclude the request for consent, the provision of treatment and care is not entirely dependent upon the Guardian granting consent. The Act provides: 3)a) Where a hospital, a physician, licensed to practice medicine or surgery, an advanced practice nurse...or a physician assistant... renders emergency treatment or first aid or a licensed dentist renders emergency dental treatment to a minor, consent of the minor's parent or legal guardian need not be obtained if, in the sole opinion of the physician, advanced practice nurse, physician assistant, dentist or hospital, the obtaining of consent is not reasonably feasible under the circumstances without adversely affecting the condition of such minor's health. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 3 27 - (40) b) Where a minor is the victim of a predatory criminal sexual assault of a child, aggravated criminal sexual assault, criminal sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual abuse or criminal sexual abuse..., the consent of the minor's parent or legal guardian need not be obtained to authorize a hospital, physician, advanced practice nurse, physician assistant, or other medical personnel to furnish medical care or counseling related to the diagnosis or tr eatment of any disease or injury arising from such offense. The minor may consent to such counseling, diagnosis or treatment as if the minor had reached his or her age of majority. Such consent shall not be voidable, nor subject to later disaffirmance, because of minority. [410 ILCS 210] C) Ordinary and Routine Treatment Consents. Ordinary medical and dental procedures are those procedures administered or performed on a routine basis that do not include hospitalization, surgery, or the use of anesthesi a. Ordinary medical and dental procedures include, but are not limited to, inoculations, physical examinations, remedial treatment for minor illnesses and injuries, psychological or psychiatric counseling, therapy or treatment and HIV testing for wards. D) Major Medical/Surgical Consents. Major medical and surgical procedures are those procedures that are not administered or performed on a routine basis and that involve hospitalization, surgery, or use of anesthesia. These medical treatments and/or surgical procedures are intended to alleviate, ameliorate, prevent or correct physical illness, injury, disability, or disfigurement. These procedures include, but are not limited to, tonsillectomies, provisions of blood transfusions, psychiatric hospitalizations, the use of life support systems, organ transplants, sensitive procedures involving the sexual or reproductive organs and the use of experimental drugs. During regular working hours, medical providers requesting consent for a major medical or surgica l procedure should be instructed to call the DCFS Consent Unit at 800-828-2179. After hours, and on weekends and holidays, medical providers should speak with an Authorized Agent at the Child Intake and Recovery Unit at 866- 503-0184. E) Notification to R egion of After -Hours Consents. All after hours consents by Authorized Agents in the Child Intake and Recovery Unit shall be documented on the CFS 431, Consent of Guardian to Medical/Surgical Treatment. The Authorized Agent shall fax the completed CFS 431 to the hospital or physician requesting the consent and to the child's Permanency Worker. Any supplementary information should be forwarded to the appropriate Area Administrator. 1 DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES POLICY GUIDE 2015.14 CONSENTS FOR ORDINARY MEDICAL AND DENTAL CARE AND ATHLETIC PARTICIPATION DATE: September 4, 2015 TO: All Department and Purchase of Service Agency Staff FROM: George H. Sheldon, Acting Director EFFECTIVE: Immediately I. PURPOSE The purpose of this Policy Guide is to inform Department and POS staff that that: until further notice, staff should continue to request consents for ordinary and routine medical and dental care from Authorized Agents of the DCFS Guardian , located in the DCFS Regions; and substitute caregivers (including residential administrators and their designees) may consent to a child's participation in athletic activities. Substitute c aregivers are required to use Reasonable Parenting Standards when making such decisions. II. PRIMARY USERS Primary users include all DCFS and private child welfare agency staff. III. INSTRUCTIONS 1. Consent for O rdinary and Routine Medical/Dental Care. Department and POS staff sh all continue to request consents for ordinary and routine medical and dental care from Authorized Agents of the DCFS Guardian in the DCFS Regions. Consents for ordinary and routine medical and dental treatment may be centralized in the future, but have not been centralized at this time. Consent for major medical and surgical treatment shall be given only by the DCFS Guardian or an Authorized Agent at the DCFS Consent Unit or Child Intake and Recovery Unit. 2 2. Consent to Participate in School Athletic Activities . Effective immediately, foster parents, relative caregivers, and residential adm inistrators and their designees (substitute caregivers) may approve a child's participation in school athletic activities. The substitute caregiver must use \"reas onable parenting standards\" when making decisions for children to participate in athletic activities. \"Reasonable parenting standards\" includes consideration of the child's age, and whether the activity is developmentally appropriate for that child . Whe n considering whether an athletic activity is \" age-\" or \"developmentally appropriate\" , the substitute caregiver shall consider whether the activity is accepted as suitable for children of the same chronological age or level of maturity as that child, or is determined to be developmentally appropriate for a child based on development of cognitive, emotional, physical and behavioral capacities that are typical for that child's age or age group. The decisions m ade for the child must keep that specific child's capabilities and attainment of developmental stages in mind. V. QUESTIONS Questions regarding these revised procedures should be directed to the Office of Child and Family Policy at 217 -524-1983 or by e -mail through Outlook at OCFP -Mailbox. Non-Outlook users may send questions to cfpolicy@idcfs.state.il.us or the phone number provided. VI. FILING INSTRUCTIONS This Policy Guide is to be filed immediately following Procedures 314.30 c), Consents for School Activities and immediately following Procedures 327.4 d), School Matters and immediately following Procedures 32 7.5 a) 3) C), Ordinary and Routine Treatment Consents. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 3 27 - (41) 4) Consultation for Major/Elective Procedures All major medical consent r equests for wards should be directed to the DCFS Consent Unit during working hours. After -hours, holiday and weekend consent requests should be directed to the Child Intake and Recovery Unit. When handling such requests, the Child Intake and Recovery Uni t shall verify the child's legal status and notify the requesting region of the decision made on the CFS 431, Consent of Guardian to Medical/ Surgical Treatment . The reverse side of the CFS 431 is designed for completion by the physician in order to supply the facts and information needed for the DCFS Guardian or Authorized Agent to make a decision. More information may be needed, however, regarding major or elective medical/surgical procedures or the use of psychotropic medications, since prior to making a decision the DCFS Guardian or Authorized Agent must often seek the advice of a Department medical consultant. The medical consultants do not make the decisions to give or withhold consent for a particular medical procedure. Consent decisions must be m ade by the DCFS Guardian or an Authorized Agent. A consultant will explain the child's medical situation and the proposed treatment to the Guardian/ Authorized Agent to enable the Guardian/ Agent to make an informed decision on behalf of a child. Medical consultants also help by explaining medical protocol and strategies for handling difficult situations with providers. The medical consultants often need more information about a particular procedure than what is provided for on the back of the CFS 431. In general, the type of information the worker should attempt to obtain from a physician recommending the major medical or elective procedure includes the following: The exact nature of the condition; Diagnosis; History of the condition, what kinds of treatment have been given, and the child's response to that treatment; Current medication child is receiving; Child's general medical history; Allergies to medication, food, etc.; Special medical conditions (e.g. sickle cell anemia); Risk concerning anesthetics ; Effects of not having the proposed treatment; Side effects of proposed treatment; Credentials of the doctor performing the surgery (What is the physician's area of specialty, e.g., Cardiologist); and The name of the hospital where the surgery will be per formed. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 3 27 - (42) An Authorized Agent may need to obtain additional facts and details specific to the procedure. The medical consultant will advise the Authorized Agent about the additional information that must be obtained and assessed in order to make an informe d decision. In highly technical situations, medical consultants will communicate directly with the child's physician. In emergency situations, consent should be requested without delay and any consultation involved will be expedited. In emergency situat ions, with the parent or guardian unavailable or unwilling, the doctor or hospital should be asked to proceed by the authority granted to them under the Consent by Minors to Medical Procedures Act 5) Consent for Administration of Psychotropic Medications Rule 325 and Policy Guide 2012.04, Administration of Psychotropic Medication to Children for Whom DCFS Is Legally Responsible provide in- depth information about appropriate use of psychotropic medications and the process for physicians and other licensed prescribers of psychotropic medications to obtain consent from the DCFS Guardian. Except in a medical emergency or as a one- time non -emergency treatment (defined in Rule 325), a licensed prescriber must obtain consent from the DCFS Guardian prior to admin istering a psychotropic medication to a DCFS ward under 18 years of age or a DCFS ward age 18 or older for whom a court order authorizes the DCFS Guardian to consent on behalf of the ward. Only the DCFS Guardian and designated staff of the DCFS Consent Unit and Child Intake and Recovery Unit may consent to administration of psychotropic medication. These are the only Department staff that may consent to administration of psychotropic medications to DCFS wards. Licensed prescribers must complete the CFS 4 31-A, Psychotropic Medication Request Form and CFS 431- A Cover, Psychotropic Medication Request Fax Cover Sheet . The completed forms shall be sent via fax to the DCFS Psychiatric Consultants at the fax number provided on the CFS 431- A Cover . The DCFS Psy chiatric Consultants shall review all requests for their appropriateness. In accordance with Rule 325 and Policy Guide 2012.04, Authorized Agents shall consult with the DCFS Psychiatric Consultants' research team at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC ) before giving approval for the use of psychotropic medications. When consenting to the administration of a psychotropic medication, Authorized Agents shall complete the CFS 431- B, Psychotropic Medication Consent Form . Standing medication (PRN) orders f or administration of psychotropic medication to DCFS wards are prohibited. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 3 27 - (43) Rule 325 and Policy Guide 2012.04 also address the rights of youth age 18 and older to consent to their own medication requests, and the circumstances in which youth may refuse med ication. Rule 325 and Policy Guide 2012.04 provide instructions for staff in the Office of the DCFS Guardian to address a licensed prescriber, DCFS -licensed residential facility, hospital or other non- DCFS licensed facility that fails to obtain consent prior to administering a psychotropic medication to a child or youth in DCFS custody or guardianship. 6) Complex / High Risk Procedures Complex/high risk procedures require consultation with the child's parents (if whereabouts are known and parental rights have not been terminated in a court of law), the opinion of the child's primary/treating licensed physician and consideration of opinions from at least two other licensed medical physicians with specialized training, knowledge, or experience in the field who are not professionally associated with the primary/treating licensed physician. After the opinions have been received by the Office of the DCFS Guardian, the Guardian or Assistant Guardian shall review them. If approved, the Guardian or Assistant Guardian shall request a consultation with the medical specialist performing the procedure. Consent for the procedure shall not be given until after that consultation occurs. If the issue is whether to administer experimental medications, the opinions of medical experts in the experimental area who are not licensed physicians may be substituted. For sensitive procedures involving the LGBTQ population, i f a child/youth in substitute care makes a request to begin puberty bl ocking/hormone therapy, the Permanen cy Worker shall refer the child/youth to medical professionals who are recognized as culturally competent in the care of transgender youth. The Permanency Worker shall contact both the Statewide LGBTQ Coordinator and DCFS Guardian's office when transgende r medical care is being considered. For the new initiation of puberty blocking/hormone therapy, if the child/youth's Permanency Goal is Return Home, and if the parents ' whereabouts are known, the Permanency Worker should inform the parents of the initiatio n of puberty blocking/hormone therapy. Two physicians or a physician and another licensed health care provider such as a Psychologist, LCPC, LCSW who is culturally competent in transgender health care, must agree that the child/youth is appropriate for the initiation of puberty blocking/hormone therapy. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 3 27 - (44) Complex/high risk procedures include: use of puberty blocking drugs/hormone therapy for LGBTQ population. elective surgical or medical procedures involving the sexual or reproductive organs of a minor and the procedure may affect the ability to sire, conceive, or bear children; transplant of any organ (see subsection (e), Organ Transplants and Donations); administration of experimental medications; or administration of medications in an experimental fashion. 7) Experimental Medications The use of experimental medications or the use of a medication experimentally is a complex/high risk procedure that requires consultation with the child's parents, if their whereabouts are known, and with at least two physicians other than the recommending physician. (See subsection (g), Health Integration Committee.) The Department's psychiatric consultant must be contacted if the experimental medication is prescribed for psychiatric/psychological purposes. b) Specific Circumstances This section describes how consent to medical treatment is obtained depending on the various conditions under which the Department has responsibility for a child. 1) Temporary Custody, Guardianship, or Surrender With Major Medical Consent Rights When the Department has temporary custody with the right to consent to major medical, or guardianship of a child through court order or through parental surrenders, consent for medical treatment should be requested by sending the CFS 431, Cons ent of Guardian to Medical/Surgical Treatment , to the DCFS Consent Unit. (See subsection (a)(4), Consultation for Major/Elective Procedures for additional information about consents for major and elective medical/surgical treatment, administration of psyc hotropic medications, and sensitive procedures.) In emergency situations, consent requests should be called into the DCFS Consent Unit during normal business hours or the Child Intake Recovery Unit after hours, weekends, and holidays. In an emergency, the Authorized Agent will give verbal consent and forward written consent, on a CFS 431, to the doctor/hospital and Permanency Worker. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 3 27 - (45) When the Department obtains temporary custody by court order, the Department's representative in court should always seek to obtain authority to consent to major medical procedures. If the court has indicated that it is unwilling to grant the right to consent to major medical treatment on a routine basis, the Department's representative in court shall request the right to consent to major medical when: the child is currently hospitalized, has a medical condition which will require major treatment procedures or blood transfusions, has recently been released from the hospital and may need additional treatment (this includes psychiatric hospitalization), or the guardian's consent to screen a child for exposure to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) which causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) has been requested, or the child has been abandoned; the family has a h istory of chronic inaccessibility to the Department; , or the family is threatening to staff or extremely hostile to the Department. If the Department did not seek the right to consent to major medical care at the temporary custody hearing but the family' s circumstances have changed so that such consent rights are necessary now, the Department's representative shall return to court to seek such consent rights. A) The parents or responsible relative should be advised and consulted in all cases involving ma jor or elective procedures. == B) == C) 2) Temporary Custody Without Major Medical Consent Rights When the Department holds temporary custody of a child through: Court order without major medical consent rights; Abandonment or police intervention; or Temporary protective custody; then the following rules for consents apply: A) Consent to ordinary medical treatment should be obtained from the DCFS Guardian or Authorized Agent from the Consent Unit. B) Consent to major medical or surgical procedures should be obtained from the child's parent or guardian (guardian in this context does not refer to the Department). GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 3 27 - (46) C) In emergency situations, with the parent or guardian unavailable or unwilling, the doctor or hospital should be asked to proceed by the authority granted to them under the Consent by Minors to Medical Procedures Act. D) For elective procedures, with the parent or guardian unavailable or unwilling, a request should be made to the court for authority to consent to major medical treatment. == E) == c) d) e) Organ Transplants and Donations 1) Organ Transplants Organ transplants are a sensitive procedure. The Permanency Worker shall obtain a written consultation from at least two physicians with specialized training, knowledge, or exper ience in the medical discipline of the ward's disease or disability who are not professionally associated with the physician recommending the transplant. This information shall be provided to the authorized agent who will seek the opinion of the child's parents, if their whereabouts are known, and the appropriate Department medical consultant. The Department medical consultant may contact the involved physicians for further information and clarification before making a recommendation. Experimental organ transplants are prohibited unless specifically requested by the parents, other methods of treatment are deemed futile, and death is imminent if a transplant is not obtained. 2) Organ Donations/Anatomical Gifts Consent for these procedures is a residual parental right. The Department may consent to organ donations/anatomical gifts only when the child's parents are dead or parental rights have been terminated in a court of law. Unless organ donation is against the express preference or religious beliefs of the child or family, consent may be given once the Department's consent authority has been established. Note: Most major religious denominations do not oppose organ donations/ anatomical gifts. Organ donations/anatomical gifts shall not be approved for any child who subscribes to the beliefs and practices of the Jehovah's Witnesses or the Christian Science faiths. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 3 27 - (47) f) Foregoing Life Sustaining Medical Treatment 1) Introduction Under Illinois law, \"legal death\" may be established by either: the more t raditional standard of irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions, according to usual and customary standards of medical practice, or the standard of irreversible cessation of total brain function, according to usual and customary sta ndards of medical practice. The determination of whether there has been an irreversible cessation of total brain function is solely a medical determination. // The Health Care Surrogate Act [755 ILCS 40] allows private decision making without court involvement on behalf of a minor or incompetent adult person with respect to forego life sustaining treatments. The decisions made by \"surrogates\" who act on behalf of the patient are based upon the medical determinations that certain conditions exist that cannot be remedied by life sustaining treatment or that treatment will serve only to prolong the dying process. The DCFS Guardian or an Authorized Agent shall will contact the child's physician to discuss the child's condition prior to any decision to forego life sustaining medical treatment . 2) Defining \"Life Sustaining Treatment\" A \"life sustaining treatment\" is any medical treatment procedure or intervention that, in the judgment of the attending physician, would not be effective to remove the qualifying condition or would serve only to prolong the dying process. It can include, but is not limited to, assisted ventilation, renal dialysis, surgical procedures, blood transfusions, the administration of drugs, antibiotics, and artificial nutrition and hydra tion. When the DCFS Guardian is the surrogate decision maker, the Guardian shall consult with the provider's ethics committee, if there is one, and/or obtain an independent medical opinion. In determining whether to forego life sustaining treatment, the surrogate decision maker shall consider the burdens on the patient from instituting or continuing life sustaining treatment against the benefits of that treatment, and shall make his or her decision guided by the best interests of the patient. The surrogat e decision maker shall take into account all available information, including the views of the patient's family and friends. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 3 27 - (48) The Health Care Surrogate Act does not authorize the Department to act as the surrogate decision maker on behalf of an 18 year old, for whom the Department has guardianship. (See Procedures 302.Appendix M, Transition Planning for Adolescents and CFS 2032- 2, Your Future, Your Health . The CFS 2032-2 contains the Illinois statutory form for Power of Attorney for Health Care.) In accordance with the provisions of the Health Care Surrogate Act, the Department should never take temporary protective custody of a child for the purpose of consenting to the removal of life support systems. The Department, as temporary custodian, is not authorized to consent to foregoing life sustaining treatment. 3) Requests for Removal of Life Support All requests for consent to the removal of life support, limiting medical treatment, foregoing life sustaining treatments and/or the entry of a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order must immediately be referred to the Office of the DCFS Guardian at 312- 814- 8600. Step -by-step instructions are set out below. Prior to providing consent, the DCFS Guardian shall consult with the Department's Medical Director about the request. Any action concerning the removal of life support, foregoing life sustaining treatment, limiting medical treatments, and/or the entry of a DNR order must comply with the Health Care Surrogate Act. A DNR order is a doctor's order entered in a patient's medical chart that instructs hospital staff not to revive a patient if the patient suffers a cardiopulmonary arrest (a cardiac or respiratory arrest). The Health Care Surrogate Act defines the circumstances under which private decisions to termina te life -sustaining treatment may be made by surrogate decision -makers on behalf of patients lacking decision -making capacity without judicial involvement. The Health Care Surrogate Act provides, in part, that a patient's attending physician must certify that a patient is suffering from a \"qualifying condition\" within the meaning of the Act. The Health Care Surrogate Act identifies three conditions for which a surrogate decision- maker may be called upon to render a decision regarding foregoing life sustaining treatment on behalf of a patient: terminal condition; permanent unconsciousness; or incurable or irreversible condition. The attending physician must make one of these medical determinations before the surrogate decision -maker may consider whether to forgo life sustaining treatment. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 3 27 - (49) THE DEPARTMENT MUST HAVE GUARDIANSHIP OF A CHILD OR YOUTH IN ORDER TO CONSIDER A DNR REQUEST. ONLY THE DCFS GUARDIAN OR ASSISTANT DCFS GUARDIAN MAY PROVIDE CONSENT ON BEHALF OF A WARD FOR A DNR REQUEST. ALL OTHER AUTHORIZED AGENTS ARE PROHIBITED FROM PROVIDING CONSENT TO THE REMOVAL OF LIFE SUPPORT, ENTRY OF A DNR ORDER OR SIMILARLY LIMITING MEDICAL TREATMENT ON BEHALF OF A WARD. 4) Consent Procedure If a Permanency Worker receives a request for removal of life suppor t, DNR order, or foregoing life sustaining treatment, the following procedure must be followed: Step 1: Immediately telephone the Office of the DCFS Guardian. Phone number: 312 -814-8600. Step 2: Fax the following documents to the Office of the DCFS Guardian. Fax number: 312-793-3546: a copy of the Disposition Order awarding DCFS guardianship of the minor; names, addresses and telephone numbers of the child's birth or adoptive parents (and if applicable, other interested relatives and substitute care givers). If parental rights were terminated, the birth parents' information is not required ; a letter from the minor's attending physician recommending the advanced directive, including a statement identifying the qualifying condition, a brief medical history and diagnosis, and the basis for the physician's treatment recommendation; letters from two physicians (with specialized training, knowledge or experience in the medical discipline of the minor's disease and/or disability who are not professionally associated with the child's attending physician) stating their reasons for recommending the treatment ( e.g., the entry of a DNR order); and a written statement from the medical provider's ethics committee stating the committee's reasons for recommending the treatment. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 3 27 - (50) Although the DCFS Guardian has the legal authority to consent to these types of requests on behalf of a ward under guardianship, the wishes of the birth parents, interested relatives, family members and substitute caregivers are considered i n the decision making process.

GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES June 15, 2017 - PT 2017. 05 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 327.Appendix F - (12) This page intentionally left blank. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES June 15, 2017 - PT 2017. 05 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 327.Appendix F Attachment 1 - (1) Appendix F , Attachment 1 - Immigration Services Alert It is critical for DCFS and POS Permanency Workers to correctly determine a foreign -born child's legal status in the United States. Failure to do so may result in the loss of benefits and services that the child is otherwise eligible to receive. If you have a child on your caseload that was not born in the United States, or its commonwealth or territories, please answer the following three questions: Do you have verification/documentation of the child' s legal status in the United States , such as a permanent resident card, paroled indefinitely, visa? Does the child have a Social Security card or a verified Social Security number? Does the child have a parent who is a U.S. citizen? (Such a child may be eligible for derivative citizenship through birth to a parent who is a U.S. citizen.) If the answer to all of the above questions is no, this child may be an undocumented resident of the United States. If DCFS has legal guardianship, the child may be eli gible for Status Adjustment to become a Legal Permanent Resident of the United States. Please refer this child to the DCFS Immigration Services Unit (ISU) using the CFS 1016, Immigration Services Referral Form which can be found on the templates. If DCFS d oes not have Guardianship, the case must be referred to the ISU when the legal status changes to Guardianship. An assessment of the child's legal status and subsequent status adjustment for an eligible child is crucial for the following reasons: Permanency planning may be disrupted or not compl eted when the child does not have a Social Security number. Adoption Assistance subsidy applications may be delayed or denied without a Social Security number. Independence cannot be established as a viable goal because the youth is ineligible for employment or work -study programs without a Social Security number. Federal Reimbursement cannot be fully claimed by the Department because certain federal services are not reimbursable for a child who does not have a Social Security number. A child without documented legal status in the United States cannot obtain a Social Security number. It is in the child's best interest for DCFS and POS Permanency Workers and supervisors to ensure that the child's \"undocumented status\" is changed to that of a legal, permanent resident when the child qualifies under the federal provisions. If the child or youth is residing in the United Sates under special provisions or with special permission of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (visa, passport, refugee), he or she may also be eligible to become a Legal Permanent Resident.

Almost one -fourth of all children and youth in t he United States are either immigrants or children of immigrants. As the immigrant population is growing, the numbers in child welfare have also increased slightly. In serving these families, DCFS and POS caseworkers may encounter another dynamic regardin g the legal status of immigrant adult caregivers in living in the United States. PURPOSE This Section of Appendix F provides guidance for DCFS and POS workers and supervisors working with families who may have the potential to becoming involved in deport ation proceedings. It is not the intent of the Department to provide legal advice for these families but rather to provide guidance to assist families (traditional foster care, Home of Relative and biological) in making a care plan for the children in the ir homes in the event that the caretaker is detained due to his or her undocumented legal status in the United States. Additionally, a list of resources is included at the end of this attachment, which may be given to families when they are developing the ir care plans. DEVELOPING A PLAN OF ACTION IF AN EMERGE NCY PLACEMENT BECOME S NECESSARY When assisting families in developing their care plan, caseworkers should review existing policy, which provides the guidelines for developing a plan of action if an e mergency placement becomes necessary. DCFS and POS workers with intact or placement cases will ensure families have appropriate child care plans in case of an emergency. WHAT IS AN EMERGENCY ? For the purpose of this transmittal, an emergency is define d as the death or absence of a parent or foster parent (i.e. car or medical accident, parent detained by law enforcement, victim of a serious crime, etc.). See Procedures 302.387 (b) for additional information.

GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 327.Appendix G - (1) Appendix G - Application for Social Security Number To be eligible for f inancial reimbursement for Medicaid services, the Department must obtain the Social Security number (SSN) for each child in substitute care or any former ward who returns to DCFS cust ody or guardianship after a failed adoption. When a child does not have a Social Security card, or DCFS has not received verification of the child's SSN from the Social Security Administration , the child is ineligible for Medicaid services and the cost for medical services must be paid from State funding without any Federal reimbursement. a) Verifying an Existing Social Security Number Monthly, the Department generates a report listing children in DCFS custody or guardianship currently without an SSN. U sing this list, the Federal Financial Participation Division (FFP) contacts Permanency Workers for each listed child and requests that they obtain a Social Security card for the child. When the Permanency Worker is able to obtain the Social Security card from the child's parents, the Permanency Worker shall scan the card and send it to FFP by Outlook e- mail at \"SSNCard Request\" or by fax to 217-785-8067. When the Permanency Worker cannot obtain the S ocial Security card or number for a child , the Permanency Worker shall request FFP to obtain one. The Permanency Worker shall email or fax the request to FFP and shall scan and send FFP a copy of the child's birth certificate for this purpose. FFP will prepare and send an SS-5, along with the copy of the chil d's birth certificate , to the Social Security Administration . The Social Security Administration will verify whether the child has been issued an SSN and provide a replacement card if necessary. b) Applying for an Initial or Replacement Social Security Card The FFP shall also submit the SS-5 for any child in DCFS guardianship who does not have an SSN. The FFP will file the original Social Security Card in the child's Eligibility Determination file and send a copy to the Permanency Worker to be filed in the Financial Section of the child's case record. The Permanency Worker should contact FFP when the ward needs the original Social Security card (e.g., job applications, emancipation, etc.). Since the Social Security Administration sets a lifetime limit on the number of replacement cards a person can obtain, Permanency Workers shall not give Social Security cards to foster parents /relative caregivers or other caregivers or providers . Original c ards obtained by FFP will remain in the child's Eligibility D etermination file unless requested by the Permanency Worker . In the event that a child's Social Security c ard is lost and cannot be located, the child's Permanency Worker must contact FFP to request a new card . (Receipt of a replacement card from the Soc ial Security Administration can take up to 7 weeks.) Please note: Wards age 18 and over must apply in person at the local Social Security Administration Office unless they are disabled. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 327.Appendix G - (2) Wards age 12 or older who have never been issued a S ocial Security number must apply in person at the local Social Security Administration office. Additional information is available on the website for the Social Security Administration (www.ssa.gov ). c) Foster Parent Requests for a Fo ster Child's S ocial S ecurity N umber Foster parent s/relative caregivers may request a foster child's SSN in order to claim child ren as deductions on their federal income tax return s or for enrollment in camp and/or school. All requests shall be submitted to FFP on the CFS 452-6, Request for Access to Social Security Number Foster Child(ren) . The address for FFP is provided on the form. Caregivers may obtain the CFS 452-6 on the DCFS website ( www.dcfs.illinois.gov) or from the caseworker . Note: Permanency Workers should never give a child's SSN to the child's caregivers . All of the following must be met for FFP to provide the foster parent s with a child's SSN. The caregivers' names and address on CYCIS must match the names and address on the request form; The child must be placed in the caregivers' home more than 6 months in a calendar year; The SSN must be verified by Soci al Security Administration ; and The caregivers must sign the CFS 452-6, certifying that they understand the limits of Social Security number access and the confidentiality of such information. When a request is approved, FFP will send a letter to the caregivers , by U.S. Mail, containing the requested SSN ; FFP will not mail the actual Social Security card. When any of the criteria above are not met, FFP will contact the Permanency Worker , by em ail, to request additional information . If FFP determines that the request should be denied, FFP will notify the Permanency Worker . The Permanency Worker shall be responsible for notifying the caregivers and explaining why t he SSN cannot be given to them. d) Illinois Identity Protection Act Administrative Procedures #27 contain the Department's policy for complying with the Illinois Identity Protection Act [ 5 ILCS 179]. This Act requires implementation of an identity protection policy to ensure the confidentiality of SSNs collected by the Department , stored in hard-copy records and in electronic systems, and used in carrying out its routine services. The intent is to ensure the confidentiality of the private identities of persons served by the Department against identity theft and fraud by limiting the collection, storage, access and distribution of SSNs . Any person who intentionally violates the prohibitions of this Act is guilty of a Class B misdemeanor.

Primary Casework Task Permanency Workers should review client health care records and obtain information from the client, family history and caregivers to identify any HIV risk factors the client may exhibit. The Permanency Worker should consult with the supervisor, a health care professional or the Department's HIV/AIDS Specialists to determine if a client that is exhibiting any of the risk factors should be referred for HIV testing. DCFS HIV/AIDS Specialists are part of the Division of Clinical Practice and Development 's Specialty Services Programs . Permanency Workers can request a clinical consultation with Specialty Services staff by emailing a CFS 399-1, Clinical Referral Form to \"ClinicalRef\" (via Outlook) or calling 312-328- 2150 or -free). b. What Human Immunodeficiency Virus is the communicable blood- born dis ease that may also cause Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. HIV damages the immune system leaving a person vulnerable to infection by viruses, fungi, bacteria, and other opportunistic diseases. An infected person may remain asymptomatic for years, but is still able to transmit the virus to others. Though there is no cure at this time, HIV is considered a manageable chronic illness. c. How common is HIV/AIDS? The percentage of people reaching an AIDS diagnosis has declined because of the effectiveness of combination anti -retroviral treatment available. However, the number of people with HIV disease continues to increase. Recent trends show that women, adolescents and people of color are being infected with HIV in disproportionate numbers. These stat istics strongly indicate that the child welfare client population is at highest risk for contracting the HIV disease. d. What causes HIV/AIDS? HIV is caused by the transmission of infected blood products into the bloodstream of another individual through sexual intercourse, subcutaneous exposure or perinatal exposure from mother to infant. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 327.Appendix H - (2) e. What body fluids and activities do not cause HIV/AIDS? Saliva, tears, perspiration, urine, feces, sputum, nasal secretions, and vomit do not contain blood products in sufficient amounts and are not likely to enter the blood stream of another person to cause transmission of HIV. Similarly, casual contact, coughing, sneezing, sharing food, shaking hands, kissing, bathing, sharing toilets and towels, donating blood and insect bites do not transmit HIV. f. What are the risk factors for HIV/AIDS and who should be tested? Risk factors for transmission of HIV include unprotected anal, vaginal, or oral sexual intercourse; the sharing of needles for intravenous drug use, piercing, or tattoos; and perinatal transmission from a mother with HIV disease to her infant during pregnancy and delivery or postpartum via breast -feeding. The Perinatal HIV Transmission Act now requires the offer of HIV testing to every pregnant woman. Risk factors for testing children and youth include any history of parental drug abuse or multiple sexual partners; being a child of a parent with HIV; being a substance exposed infant or the sibling of an HIV exposed infant; a history of blood transfusions or needle use for drugs, piercing, or tattoos; any unprotected sexual intercourse, including sexual abuse or rape, sexually transmitted disease, or pregnancy; accidental exposure to blood; and presentation of any symptoms suggesting the need for HIV te sting. If a child is in a pre -adoptive home and has not been tested for HIV, the law permits the foster parent to request an HIV test for any child to be screened for HIV disease prior to adoption. A child or youth having one or more of the above risk factors should be referred for HIV testing. g. Indicators for HIV Testing. In addition to considering the risk factors in subsection (f), above, the Permanency Worker should refer the following youth for HIV testing: Sexually active youth should be tested annually at a minimum or more frequently if a medical professional considers it to be necessary. A child or youth for whom a completed medical history cannot be obtained. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 327.Appendix H - (3) h. Is it possible to prevent HIV/AIDS? Yes. Transmission of HIV is caused by behaviors that can be modified to mitigate the chance of transmission. Risk reduction strategies include abstinence; outercourse; sexual intercourse with one mutual life- time partner; intercourse with condoms; and not sharing needles for drug use and cleaning them each time. Perinatal transmission may be reduced to just 3% through early intervention with HIV infected pregnant women, medication and prenatal care with an HIV specialist. Universal Precautions around body fluids, including blood, should be implemented with all clients, regardless of their known HIV status. The DCFS HIV/AIDS Specialists or other health care provider can provide training to foster parents and staff in shelters, group homes, and residential treatment programs for a better unders tanding about the routes of transmission and how to prevent HIV. Staff may contact the DCFS HIV/AIDS Specialists at 312-328-2150 or 855-814- 8421 (toll- free) for assistance. i. What are the symptoms of HIV/AIDS? HIV is a multi- organ illness with a wide s pectrum of clinical manifestations. The effects of HIV range from a lack of symptoms to acute illness and difficulty in physical, developmental, psychosocial realms of life. Symptoms may be mild to severe, and periodic or chronic. Early identification is critical for the purpose of early treatment interventions. Physical Symptoms include: Swollen glands, especially around the neck (lymphadenopathy) Frequent fevers Vomiting and diarrhea related to gastro- intestinal infections Slow weight gain, poor appeti te, delayed growth Developmental delays Neurological impairments Skin rashes, infections or sores Recurrent infections of the mouth, ears, lungs, brain, liver, and other organs Opportunistic infections including lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP), pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) Cancer j. Do symptoms differ in children or adolescents? Disease progression in infants and children may be more severe because their immune systems are not fully developed. They are more vulnerable to ordinary childhood i llnesses that appear more often and seriously. Sexually active youth experience more severe sexually transmitted diseases and females may experience pelvic inflammatory disease. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 327.Appendix H - (4) II. Treatment Path Stage II: Referral a. Primary Casework Task Permanency Workers should consult with the DCFS HIV/AIDS Specialists to identify the most appropriate testing site and obtain proper consents for testing. b. What kinds of health care specialists can provide HIV testing? Licensed health care professionals through Healthworks; Infectious Disease Clinics; Ob/Gyn Family Planning Clinics; Pediatricians and Family Practitioners; Adolescent Health Specialists; Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Clinics, Public Health Clinics; Emergency Rooms; and Forensic Rape Centers can provide HIV testing. c. Do I need a special consent for HIV testing? No. The CFS 415, Consent for Ordinary and Routine Medical and Dental Care is to be used for testing children in temporary custody with the Healthworks Medical Doctor (MD) or any other health care provider. Youth 12 years of age and older may consent to an HIV test on their own. Parents consent to their own testing and that of the children who remain in their care and custody. The testing site should provide pre-and post- test counseli ng to youth and caregivers. III. Treatment Path Stage III: Assessment and Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS a. Primary Casework Task Permanency Workers should ensure that clients and caregivers understand the purpose and meaning of the HIV test, and protect the confidentiality of the client in accordance with Procedures 431.90 (a), Disclosure of Information Regarding Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrom e (AIDS) . b. What are the HIV tests? Different HIV tests are used and repeated for different purposes. ELISA and Wes tern Blot tests screen blood samples for HIV antibodies. DNA PCR (polymerase chain -reaction) or viral culture tests are used for HIV exposed infants less than 18 months of age. Ora-sure or other new rapid tests that are approved by the FDA may be used for adolescents and adults at some sites. CD4 cell and viral load counts test blood for disease progression in patients who are known to have HIV. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 327.Appendix H - (5) Repeat testing is recommended for HIV exposed infants until 18 months of age because their immune system is unde veloped. Repeat testing is also recommended within six months of the last potential HIV exposure in cases such as sexual intercourse or rape. Pre- and post -test counseling by a health care provider is required by law to educate the patient or caregiver ab out HIV. Client -Centered Risk Reduction Counseling is provided by HIV specialists and is highly recommended to impact personal changes in behavior for both infected and non- infected patients. c. What are the possible results of HIV testing? In accordance with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Classification System for HIV Infection only a licensed physician can make an HIV diagnosis. The health care provider administering the test should also counsel the patient with the results. It is very important that the Permanency Worker , client, and caregiver understand the meaning of the test and the results. General HIV diagnosis definitions are as follows: Uninfected - any infant, youth or adult who tests negative for HIV antibodies since their last potential exposure to HIV. HIV Exposed - infant under 18 months of age born to a mother with HIV; an infant testing positive for HIV antibody; a newborn with a prescription for AZT or ZDV (zidovudine) administered to prevent perinatal infection. HIV Indeterminat e - infant under 18 months of age testing positive for antibody, but pending definitive diagnosis. HIV Seroreverted - child over 18 months of age who was HIV exposed but is not infected. HIV Infected - an infant testing positive for a series of PCR or one viral culture under 18 months of age; a child over 18 months of age testing positive for HIV antibodies; a youth or adult testing positive for HIV antibodies. Symptomatic HIV - the stage of infection is diagnosed through a combination of CD4 and viral load counts, along with presenting symptoms. AIDS - patient with severe clinical symptoms or a CD4 cell count of less than 200/ml. d. Who needs to know the results of an HIV test? A person's HIV/AIDS testing and diagnosis information is confidential and protected under the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) and the AIDS Confidentiality Act. The information contained in these Acts has been included in Rules and Procedures 431, Confidentiality of Personal Information of Persons Served by the Department of C hildren and Family Services . GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 327.Appendix H - (6) The individual's right to privacy must be balanced with the need to know in order to provide services. Procedures 431 lists those who have a need to know about the HIV status of children in DCFS custody including the parent, Permanency Worker , foster parent, relative caregiver, health care providers, prospective adoptive parent and other persons providing direct care who have a need to know in order to provide services to the child. Directors of child care facilities such as shelters, group homes, and residential treatment centers also have a need to know, however assistance should be sought from the DCFS HIV/AIDS Specialists to manage the information and to ensure that policies and training are in place to protect the client from discrimination. Information about the child's HIV status may be shared privately with the Juvenile Court in the judge's chamber or by approaching the bench. Notification to the child's school is given through the child's physician to the Illinois Department of Public Health who will provide confidential notice to the school principal. A mother with an HIV exposed infant or a HIV positive child perinatally infected should be counseled by her Permanency Worker to have herself and her other children tested. The Department cannot disclose the HIV status of a parent without the parent's consent. Clients with HIV should be advised against unprotected sex to prevent transmission. Notification should always be accompanied by education about the meaning of the HIV information and caution that the information may not be re -disclosed without proper consents. Documentation: HIV testing may be documented in Healthworks forms or in separate sections of the record marked CONFIDENTIAL, but not in service plans or written reports to the court. HIV may be referenced as a health care issue or chronic illness in case notes. Delete HIV/AIDS information from any records released to a third party who does not have a need to know. NOTE: Department (DCFS) and purchase of service (POS) agency staff are required to notify the DCFS HIV/AIDS Specialists under the Division of Clinical Services about all HIV exposed or infected clients for consultation on HIV testing, treatment, precautions, resources, policy and training at 312/328-2150 or 855-814-8421 (toll- free). GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 327.Appendix H - (7) IV. Treatment Path Stage IV: Treating HIV/AIDS a. Primary Casework Task Permanency Workers should facilitate the most effective treatment regimen available for their clients; ensure that the caregiver and youth understand the treatment; and work collaboratively with the treatment team to ensure compliance and support services. b. Who can provide treatment? HIV or infectious disease specialists are best trained on the most current diagnosis and treatments of HIV . An HIV specialist may consult with the general practitioner in regions of the state where no specialist is accessible to the client. c. What kinds of treatment are available? Pregnant women with HIV disease are advised to begin a course of anti -retroviral medication to reduce their viral load and prevent the transmission of HIV to their unborn infant. The newborn is also prescribed medication to be taken at delivery and for the following six weeks to reduce the chance of infection. This regimen has been s hown to reduce the chance of perinatal transmission to just 3%. Treatment goals are to keep the HIV viral load low and the immune system functioning high so that the patient may fight off any infection or disease to which s/he is exposed. Prophylactic medications are prescribed to prevent disease and nutritional supplements may be added to strengthen the immune system and to promote optimal growth in children. Anti -retroviral medications work to reduce the viral load. The HIV specialist and the patient determine when to begin treatment based on symptoms, laboratory testing of disease progression and compliance issues. Any presenting symptoms of the disease are treated as diagnosed. d. What kinds of medications are used? A combination of medications is mo st often prescribed to reduce the viral load. This combination therapy is known as highly active anti -retroviral treatments (HAART). There are three classes of compounds approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These classes include nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and the protease inhibitors (PIs). There are several choices of drugs approved in each class. Each class acts upon a different stage of viral replicat ion in the CD4 cells to prevent an increase of the viral load. It should be noted that Medicaid makes most of these medications readily available to our clients and wards. Core Center at the Cook County Hospital in Chicago accepts all patients, even those without Medicaid. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 327.Appendix H - (8) e. What other treatments are available? The FDA continues to conduct clinical trials on new drugs to determine safety, efficacy and dosage for different classes of patients that include children, women and adolescents. The DCFS Insti tutional Review Board (IRB) reviews protocols for clinical trials and the medications may be available to wards with the specific consent of the Guardian. Alternative treatments such as massage therapy are thought to reduce the stress on the immune system. f. What may interfere with my client receiving treatment? Medication regimens are complex and may require that the patient take from 10 to 30 pills per day. Each class of medication is powerful and may have unpleasant side effects. These side effects may include headaches, nausea, diarrhea, rashes, peripheral neuropathy (tingling) and anemia that may be treated with additional medications until the body adjusts. Some children, adolescents and adults cannot tolerate the medications; some parents, pati ents, and caregivers cannot maintain the medication schedule; and some patients refuse to take medications because they are afraid others may suspect they have AIDS. HIV specialists work with their patients and caregivers to find the best ways to manage t he prescribed medication regimen. There are a limited number of drugs available to treat HIV, and the virus can develop a resistance to drugs if they are not taken as directed. Treatment options become paramount if the patient develops a resistance to an y of the drugs and becomes critically ill. For this reason, the HIV specialists will evaluate and counsel the patient and caregiver to determine if the patient will adhere to the prescribed medication regimen. g. What psychosocial treatments are available? The psychosocial effects of HIV include depression, anxiety, confusion, anti - social reactions precipitated by rejection or avoidance by others, self -destructive behaviors and withdrawal. Stress can adversely affect the immune system. A parent's illne ss, the child's separation from a parent or a change in housing can cause stress on a child. Social stigma continues to exist about HIV and may lead to feelings of guilt, shame, fear, anger, denial and isolation for affected family members and their children. Continuity of care and relationships are essential for children and youth with HIV. Emphasis should be placed on active participation in normal childhood activities and quality of life. The infected client, the caregiver and the affected family memb ers should all be offered support services. Children need an opportunity to ask questions about HIV and talk about how they feel. Both the patient and his family may experience symptoms of loss at each stage of diagnosis, through critical illness and deat h. Children may express behavioral symptoms such as withdrawal, aggression, drug GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 327.Appendix H - (9) or alcohol abuse, or sexual acting out. These behavioral symptoms of loss are also risky behaviors for HIV and must be addressed to prevent disease and other problems. Other dimensions of loss include anticipatory grief, survivor guilt and anniversary reactions. Support services may include: HIV and health education Risk reduction counseling Peer support groups Gay, lesbian, bi-sexual, and trans- gender services HIV case manager Public benefits Drug treatment & recovery support Respite care Individual psychotherapy Family Counseling Personal care assistant Loss support counseling h. When should children be told of their HIV diagnosis or that of their parent? Disclosure is a clinical decision. There is no policy that defines the age to know. Consideration should be given to what the child already knows about HIV, how he handles this kind of stress and the parent's wishes. Disclosure can make some children more anxious and f earful. Other children feel relieved to know the secret and gain a sense of control. Consult with your treatment team about this issue. i. How do I collaborate with the HIV specialists to design treatment goals? A multi- disciplinary approach is most ef fective in dealing with the impact of HIV disease. The treatment team should include the child welfare case manager and nurse; the HIV clinic team; support service providers; the caregiver or foster parent; involved family members; and the patient. Worker s and caregivers are encouraged to attend clinic staffings so that they understand the care plan. In turn, invite the HIV clinic social worker to child and family meetings and include them in critical decisions such as disclosure of HIV to family members or a change in placement. Changes stress the immune system and require a well -planned transition to educate the client and caregiver on the treatments. Any member of the team may call a multi- disciplinary staffing to resolve problems. The DCFS HIV/AIDS Specialists collaborates with HIV clinics and programs to discuss clients and systemic issues and may be included in clinical staffings. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 327.Appendix H - (10) V. Treatment Path Stage V: Monitoring and Reviewing a. Primary Casework Task Permanency Workers should continue to as sess the needs of the client, family and caregivers and coordinate care with the multi -disciplinary team. b. How do I know if the treatment is working? The HIV clinic will monitor compliance, the benefits of medication and the course of disease through r egular appointments and laboratory testing. Ideally, the viral load will become undetectable and the client will not show symptoms. Psychologically, the child and family will learn to live with HIV and integrate treatment and monitoring of their disease into a normal, active lifestyle. c. What role do I play in monitoring my client's treatment goals? Clients need on- going support from their treatment team as they may experience new symptoms, increasing viral loads, try new medications, are diagnosed with AIDS, experience depression and neurological affects, or require personal assistance, home nursing, pain management or hospice care. Children will experience their disease differently as they become adolescents and may need new support and education around medication, disclosure, and risky behavior. Pay attention to the developmental stages of both the infected and affected children in relation to disease progression. Seek new interventions with changing behaviors. d. How is HIV documented in client records? HIV testing and treatment information shall be maintained in a separate section of the case record that is marked \"CONFIDENTIAL.\" HIV information may be documented in Healthworks forms. HIV client information may not be cited in service plans. HIV may be referenced as a \"health care issue\" or \"chronic illness\" in social assessments and other documents as needed in order to provide services. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 327.Appendix H - (11) VI. Caregiver Tasks What do foster parents and residential treatment providers need to know about HIV/AIDS ? Foster parents and residential treatment providers should have an understanding of universal precautions and infection control described in Administrative Procedures # 16, Staff Safety , to reduce the transmission of any kind of infection in the residence . These include regular hand washing after toileting and diaper changing, before meal preparation, and after clean up of body fluids. Latex gloves or cloth or paper barrier protection should be used around the clean up of blood, followed by hand washing. Blood contaminated items should be washed in detergent and hot water or disposed of in a sealed container. Foster parents and residential treatment providers should have an understanding of the risk factors for HIV and consult with their Permanency Work er, physician, or the DCFS HIV/AIDS Specialists about prevention of HIV and obtaining HIV tests for youth at risk. They should also gain an understanding of the meaning of those test results. Children with positive HIV tests should be reported to the DCF S HIV/AIDS Specialists for linkage with specialized medic al providers and to obtain consultation and training for the foster parents or residential treatment provider. Training and consultation for foster parents and residential treatment providers should include the meaning of HIV tests, treatment protocols, precaution and prevention methods, disclosure and confidentiality policy, psychosocial issues, and supportive resources as described in this appendix and attachments. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 327.Appendix H - (12) VII. Resources for Clients Wher e can my client, caregiver or I obtain information about HIV/AIDS? National, state and local public health departments publish many brochures about the transmission and treatment of HIV/AIDS that are simple to read. These publications can also be obtained from local community HIV program providers. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) publishes detailed surveillance reports, diagnostic classifications and treatment guides for all populations.

GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 327.Appendix H Attachment 1 - (5) Clinical Information Medical Doctor makes diagnosis according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Classification System for HIV Infection. General definitions: Uninfected - Any infant, youth or adult who tests negative for HIV antibodies since their last potential exposure to HIV. HIV Exposed - An infant less than 18 months of age born to a mother with HIV or infant testing positive for HIV antibody. HIV Indeterminate - An infant under 18 months of age testing positive for HIV antibody, but pending definitive diagnosis. HIV Seroreverted - A child over 18 months of age who was HIV exposed but is not infected. HIV Infected - An infant testing positive for a series of PCR or a v iral culture under 18 months; a child over 18 months of age testing positive for HIV antibodies; a youth or adult testing positive for HIV antibodies. Symptomatic HIV - The stage of infection is diagnosed through a combination of CD4 and viral load counts, along with presenting symptoms. AIDS - A patient with severe clinical symptoms or a CD4 cell count of less than 200/ml. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 327.Appendix H Attachment 1 - (6) Treatment Path Stage V: Treatment Casework & Administrative Tasks Casework: Monitor treatment compliance with the HIV specialist, caregiver and/or client. Attend clinic staffing. Report changes in condition to clinic. Invite HIV clinic staff to child and family meetings. Include HIV clinic staff in critical decisions such as disclosures or change of placements. Obtain the specific co nsent of the Guardian or the AIDS Coordinator if MD recommends treatment in research protocols. Coordinate care with the multi- disciplinary treatment team. Assess need for support services. Make referrals for special HIV services as well as child welfare services. Call a multi- disciplinary staffing to resolve problems. Include HIV clinic in any plans for disclosure to patient, family, or others. Consult with DCFS HIV/AIDS Specialists about clinical issues and resources. Administrative: Use the phrase \"health care issue \" or \"chronic illness\" in case documentation. Clinical Information Medical Interventions: HIV is considered a manageable chronic illness with no cure. The effects range from a lack of symptoms to acute illness and difficulty in all spheres o f life: physical, developmental, social, and psychological. MD determines when to place a patient on prophylaxis and medications based on clinical testing and symptoms. Vaccinations for children with HIV are given in the attenuated form. Use Universal Precautions including latex gloves or paper/cloth barrier with blood; wash items with blood in detergent and warm water or dispose in sealed container. Wash hands after contact with any body fluid. Combination therapy is called HAART or Highly Active Anti- Retroviral Treatment. Adherence to medication regime is critical because virus may become resistance to treatment. Nutritional supplements will strengthen immune system. Psychosocial Interventions A multidisciplinary team works best. Include child welfare case manager & nurse; the HIV clinic; support service providers; the caregiver; involved family; and the patient. Psychosocial effects include depression, anxiety when separated from caregiver, confusion, antisocial reactions precipitated by rejection or av oidance by others, withdrawal or non-responsiveness. GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Departmen t of Children and Family Services Procedures 327.Appendix H Attachment 1 - (7) Treatment Path Stage V: Treatment Continued Social stigma about HIV may lead to guilt, shame, fear, anger, denial and isolation for affected family members and their children. Disclosure of a parent or child's HIV status to any family member is a clinical decision to be made with the client and their treatment team. Stress reduces immune system functioning and must be managed. Support services may include: Health education Peer group support Individual therapy Risk reduction counseling Gay, lesbian, bi-sexual, and trans- gender services HIV case manager Respite care Family Counseling Personal care assistant Public benefits Drug Treatment & Recovery Support GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES July 13, 2015 - PT 2015.22 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 327.Appendix H Attachment 1 - (8) Treatment Path Stage VI: Monitoring & Revie w of Treatment Casework & Administrative Tasks Casework: Maintain regular contact with treatment team to monitor patient progress. Continue to assess client needs. Consult with DCFS HIV/AIDS Specialists about clinical issues and resources. Consult with the DCFS Guardian if MD recommends do not resuscitate (DNR) orders for wards Maintain contact with support service providers. Continue to assess family needs and refer for services as needed. Invite treatment team to child and family meetings for progress report. Encourage visitation with parents to help children resolve their feelings of loss. Make transitional plans for adolescents with HIV for supports and benefits in adulthood. Refer parents with HIV who have custody of their children for legal services to make a future custody plan in the event of a critical illness or death. Clinical Information Medical Interventions: Continuity of care and relationships lead to stable health & well- being. MD orders lab tests to monitor the course of disease and be nefits of medication. Clients need on-going support with new symptoms, new meds, depression, neurological affects, pain management, personal assistance, home nursing and hospice. Children experience their disease differently as they become adolescents and may need new supports and education around medication, disclosure, and risky behavior. Psychosocial Interventions: The parent or sibling's HIV disease affects children. Children need an opportunity to ask questions and talk about how they feel. Family may experience symptoms of loss at each stage of the diagnosis, through critical illness and death. Children may express behavioral symptoms such as withdrawal, aggression, drug or alcohol abuse, or sexual acting out. Behavioral symptoms of loss are also risky behaviors for HIV and must be addressed. Stages of loss include: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. "}
