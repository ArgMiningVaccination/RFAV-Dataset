CALENDAR of plant medicine retreats FOR 2023 January 20/21/22 January 27/28/29 DE MEDICINA Joshua Tree, CA 08/21/2022 The most magical weekend in the desert, the weather was perfect, we created circulos de palabra where everyone got to share a little about their background and what brought them to our space. We did yoga together, shared nutritious Ayurvedic meals, enjoyed a sound bath and got to spend one on one with Natalia so that she could give everyone an individualized experience when the time of the ceremony came. The ancestors or the land welcomed us and we felt the Joshua Trees flanking us during the night offering protection and sustaining our purpose. Saturn rose bright in the horizon exerting his power of grit and accountability. The moon rose around 1am right in front of us as we were about the sing the prayers to the water. So much magic and awe until 3am in the morning! The next day we shared a very special breakfast and some time for integration. We left with our hearts so full of love, devotion and gratitude. Until next year! THE FOREST CACAO AND PSILOCYBIN RETREAT IDYLWILD, CA 08/2022 After our special journey in the desert, we headed to the mountain for a change of scenery and energies. This retreat proved to be just as deep and healing. Immense gratitude to all our participants who took the reins of their life and set in motion a healing process that moved a lot inside of them. The inner work is not finished after the ceremony, this is just the beginning... Joshua Tree 10/16/2021 ceremonia de ayahuasca These are images of our last journey back in the fall of 2021. Joshua Tree was the magic land that welcomed us. We shared weeks of preparation, with a specific dieta I share with all the participants. On the days of the retreat we enjoyed a sound bath, the use of the fabulous facilities, individual sound therapy sessions, the learning of icaros, Ayurvedic meals and the ceremony. We were enchanted by this group and their humble and loving energy. I can't wait to see them again! Seattle, WA 10/09/2021 This was a very special encounter in the Pacific Northwest facilitated by a very special client. A plant medicine retreat dedicated specifically for a private group. We left with our hearts full of love and gratitude for the love, generosity of spirit, and absolute surrender of these phenomenal family. IDYLLWILD, CA 11/9/2019 DIA DE LOS MUERTOs. ceremonia de ayahuasca On Saturday November 9 we gathered together in the mountains of Idyllwild for a special themed Plant Medicine retreat centered around ancestral work. The ancestors are the mighty dead, the bright ones who came before us, those who were well in spirit and woven into the long currents of energy that reach through blood and bone to our common origin. We are linked to our ancestors, consciously or not and these ties can have significant impact on our lives for better or worse. For most of our history, humans have maintained a vibrant relationship of ancestral support and have consciously embodied the strengths and blessings of our unique, diverse bloodlines. Imagine walking through life with your ancestors by your side, owning your strengths, following your true path and feeling resourced, resilient and whole. This is what we intended to manifest on the night of November 9 through the 10. A connection to who we are, our lineage, those who came before us and left profound marks, we honored and remembered their important legacy. In my country of Ecuador we have a singular offering every November 2nd or Dia de Difuntos. We honor our dearly departed by baking bread in the shape of people. On this special retreat we baked bread, we created an altar in memory of those that left the physical world and we communed in ceremony in front of the fire. "}
