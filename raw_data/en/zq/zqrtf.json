Foot Reflexology - 1 hour 15 mins - $110 [Book here](https://www.angelicatherapies.com/book) (includes pre-treatment softening foot Epsom salts and essential oils & exfoliate) Reflexologists do not claim to cure, diagnose, or prescribe. Reflexology is a complementary health therapy. It is based on the theory that the feet and hands contain a mini map of the whole body. All body systems, glands, and organs can be stimulated on the feet or hands. These are known as reflexes. It is not a \"foot massage\", although the feet are massaged in order to warm up the muscles and joints, it is a specific pressure point technique. Reflexology is the technique used by applying pressure to the reflex points, in order to bring about a response in the corresponding part of the body. By using a specific massage technique to stimulate the reflexes, the aim is to release any blockages and restore the free flow of energy and blood circulation to the whole body. Reflexology is based on ancient Chinese theory that energy is flowing around our bodies. If the energy is restricted then illness may result. If the energy can flow freely then we are healthy and balanced. A reflexologist aims to treat the whole person rather than only focusing on a set of symptoms. Emotional and spiritual wellbeing will be taken into account as well as the physical. Is Reflexology suitable for me? Reflexology is suitable for men and women. However, occasionally, there may be times when it is not suitable. It is best to ring first and ask. I do not work with children or pregnancy. Reflexology may be effective for many conditions including: - Stress and stress-related disorders - Digestive problems - Joint Pain - Breathing Difficulties - Headaches/Migraines - Fertility Problems - Hormonal Imbalances - Sleep Disorders Contraindications - Any contagious skin disease ie. impetigo, scabies, chicken pox, mumps etc. - Severe psoriasis or eczema on foot (foot will be too sore to work) - Any untreated severe medical condition, or acute pain (Reflexology may hide a condition which needs medical attention) - Anyone under influence of alcohol or recreational drugs - Internal bleeding - Severe varicose veins i.e. phlebitis (Reflexology may increase pressure of blood to veins) - Any form of infection, disease or fever (can make client feel worse and spread infection to the therapist) - Diarrhoea and vomiting - cross infection - Bruising on feet - Cuts, grazes, open skin, rashes, bites, burns, fractures - Days of menstruation (Reflexology may make period heavier) - Immediately after a heavy meal - leave 2 hours - Athletes foot or verruca - Localised swelling/inflammation - Scar tissue (2 years for major operation, and 6 months small scar) - Sunburn - Hormonal implants - Recent fractures (minimum 3 months) - Cervical spondylitis - Haematoma Will Reflexology help me? Reflexology is a holistic treatment which works with you individually. It aims to encourage the body to work naturally to restore its own healthy balance. How will I feel after a treatment? Usually after a treatment you may feel relaxed and your tension might be reduced. You may also notice that your sense of well -being is improved. Some other conditions may improve too. However this happens on a very individual basis. Sometimes people report feeling nauseous, lethargic, or tearful but this is usually temporary, and is part of the healing process. After one or two treatments you may find your body responds in a very noticeable way. It is useful to give feedback as this in turn will help to tailor a course of treatments to your individual needs.
