Though they may be overlooked as \"something that's in your mind\", but these disorders can have serious implications on your health and the quality of your life. Homeopathy is an effective way of treating disorders like anxiety, stress, and depression with negligible side effects. Anxiety can be defined as the general feeling of [fear](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/fear) or apprehension. Anxiety disorders may be seen in the form of general anxiety, phobias, and obsessive-compulsive disorders. Anxiety symptoms are generally sporadic and follow no set pattern. Homeopathy can be used to treat anxiety once the cause of the disorder can be identified. Homeopathic Treatment For Anxiety Two of the most common homeopathic medicines used for the treatment for anxiety are: - Aconitum napellus: Waves of anxiety or outright [panic](https://www.lybrate.com/treatment-for-panic)attacks can be treated with homeopathic remedy aconite. This is also beneficial if the person is fearful, restless, agitated, or if he has recently experienced an accident or natural disaster. - Argentum nitricum: Anxiety often takes the form of apprehension and nervousness about the future. In such a case, homeopathy remedy Argentum nitricum (Arg-n.) can be an effective form of treatment. Such cases of anxiety can worsen with heat and in crowded spaces. Homeopathic Treatment for Stress Problem The terms stress and anxiety are often used interchangeably, but they have different medical definitions. The response to situations and events that make us frustrated, anxious, or angry are known as stress factors. Each person has a different response to stress. While it temporarily enhances productivity in some people, it can paralyze others. Here are two common homeopathic medicines that can be used to treat stress. Homeopathic Medicine for Stress and Anxiety - Kali phosphoricum: Stress caused by overworking or illness can be treated with Kali phosphoricum. In such cases, the patient may be jumpy, over-sensitive and can find it difficult to cope with normal life. Kali phosphoricum helps relax the nervous system and can also be used to treat [insomnia](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/insomnia)caused by stress. - Lycopodium: If stress causes the person to feel inadequate and pretend to be someone they are not, a Lycopodium is a good form of homeopathic treatment. This can also treat irritability, crankiness, and social withdrawal that results from stress. Homeopathic Medicine for Depression and Anxiety Mild depression is often self-diagnosed as a simple bad mood. There are many causes for depression including changes in the biochemical makeup of the brain. Here are a few homeopathic medicines for depression. - Aurum metallicum: Failure to succeed is a primary cause of depression in people focused on work. Aurum metallicum can be used to treat such cases of depression. These symptoms may also be accompanied by feelings of humiliation and discouragement. - Causticum: Depression caused by grief or loss can be treated with causticum. This also treats accompanying frequent crying, [forgetfulness](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/forgetfulness)and mental dullness.
