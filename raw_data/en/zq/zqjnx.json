PGY2 residencies provide residents with opportunities to function independently as practitioners by conceptualizing and integrating accumulated experience and knowledge and incorporating both into the provision of patient care or other advanced practice settings. Residents who successfully complete an accredited PGY2 pharmacy residency are prepared for advanced patient care, academic, or other specialized positions, along with board certification. The PGY2 program at BIDMC provides the resident with in-depth training and practice experience in the core rotations (Medical ICU, Surgical ICU, Neurological ICU, Trauma ICU, Cardiac ICU, Cardiovascular Surgical ICU, Experiential Teaching, Emergency Medicine) as well as with elective rotations ( Toxicol ogy, Medication Safety, Antimicrobial Stewardship, Solid Organ Transplant), which are provided to align with our resident's interests and career plans. Longitudinal activities during the residency are designed to expand the resident's experiences in pharmacy and health-system leadership, the formulary and medication use process, drug policy, code response, and medication safety. Additionally, residents will develop their skills to be competent in the provision of clinical and operational services within the acute care setting. Each resident will be responsible for completing a medication use evaluation, a residency project and manuscript. A Teaching Certificate Program is offered in collaboration with MCPHS University. 3 BIDMC PGY2 Residency Program 2020- 21 ASHP Req uired Competency Areas, Goals, and Objectives For Postgraduate Year Two (PGY2) Pharmacy Residency in Critical Care & Additional BIDMC Competencies Required Competency Areas R1: Patient Care a.

The committee is comprised of preceptors and members of the Pharmacy Administrative Group. The Committee is chaired by the Residency Program Director and meets at least quarterly to review and discuss the progress of the residents. Interactive feedback within the committee is utilized to direct the resident in his/her current and upcoming residency activities and to provide mentoring and guidance in the resident's pharmacy practi ce. The committee will recommend modifications to the residents' schedule as necessary. Each member of the RAC is expected to: Act as an advocate for the resident. Provide expertise for the residency project (when possible) or identify other appropriate resources Provide feedback and suggestions on improving current rotation sites, as well as identifying future potential rotation sites Provide feedback and suggestions on the current structure of the residency program, and offer possibilities for future direction PGY 2 Resident Advisor Mentoring and advising ar e key elements of the BIDMC PGY2 Pharmacy Residency Program. The Residency Advisory Committee governs the residency program and is designed so that the resident will be afforded the opportunity to meet regularly with the committee members at large to discuss and receive feedback on thei r progress within the residency program and address any issues or concerns that may arise. To provide the resident with the opportunity for individualized mentoring and advising, the RAC will work with each incoming resident to coordinate the selection of an individual Resident Advisor for the academic year. The principle role of the Resident Advisor is to act as a personal contact for the resident in all matters dealing with the successful completion of the residency program. The Resident Advisor will work with the resident to develop their residency plan and will monitor the plan's progress. The resident and advisor will collaborate and determine the degree of contact and involvement necessary to meet these objectives. Key areas that will be focused on include: advice on projects (initiation, completion, deadlines etc.), elective rotation selection, time management, professional interpersonal relationships and conflict, career opportunities after residency and any other residency -related issues that may arise. The Resident Advisor will collaborate with the RPD (if different) to complete the resident's quarterly assessments. Determination of a Resident Advisor will be made in alignment with the determination of the resident project. In general, the projec t advisor works closely with the resident throughout the year and is the most appropriate RAC member to fulfill the mentoring and advising role that is central to the Resident Advisor position. Should circumstances during the residency year warrant reevaluation of the selection of a resident's advisor, discussion with and approval by the RPD will be required before any changes are made. 23 BIDMC PGY2 Critical Care Pharmacy Residency Program Structure 2020-2 1 Core Rotations Preceptor Orientation (4 weeks) George Abdallah , PharmD , BCCCP Medical Intensive Care Unit (4 - weeks) Adrian Wong, PharmD , ( 4-5 George Abdallah, PharmD , BCCCP ( PharmD , BCCCP Emergency Medicine ( 4-5 weeks) Holly Reed, PharmD, Eli Philips, PharmD Neurological ICU ( 4-5 weeks) Ji Liu, PharmD, BCPS AQ -Infectious Disease Infectious Diseases Consult Service , PharmD, BCID P, Nick weeks) Lori Safety/Quality ( 4 weeks) May Adra, PharmD, BCPS , Kaitlyn Zheng, Pharm.D.

Participation in Residency Orientation/Training Program: Start of Residency A formal orientation program for all residents is scheduled in July of each year. All new residents are expected to attend these sessions. This orientation period is to introduce the incoming residents to the BIDMC Department of Pharmacy, the BIDMC Medical Center at large, MCPHS University ; and to outline the expectations for the residency year. 2. Department of Pharmacy Practice -Service: July 1st - June 30th Each resident is required to complete a pharmacy service component of the residency program. Often referred to as \"staffing,\" the service component of the residency is crucial to the development of professional practice and distribution skills so as to provide safe and effective pharmaceutical care. Residents will gain insight into the operations, policies and procedures of an acute-care facility , with specific emphasis on care of critically ill patients The staffing requirement will comprise 30 shifts over the course of the residency year. These shifts may inc lude weekends. Staffing may include the completion of 1 week at the end of a 4 week learning experience in the same unit that the resident completed the rotation. Additional shifts may be worked with approval from the residency program director, and will be paid at the rate of a per diem pharmacist. 3. Rotations - Core and Elective: July 1st - June 30th Each resident is responsible to complete a defined number of core clinical and management rotations as well as a determined number of elective rotations. Rotations will be evaluated using the PharmAcademic web-based software tool . One week prior to each rotation, the resident will submit their pre-rotation goals in PharmAcademic so as to provide an opportunity for the preceptor to evaluate, and if possible, to design specific activities to meet the resident's goals. At the beginning of each rotation, the preceptor will provide residents with the rotation: goals and objectives, learning activities and method of evaluation. Residents are responsible for coordinating their evaluations with the rotation preceptor. Rotation evaluations should be scheduled during the last week of rotation and are to be completed no later than one week following the conclusion of the rotation. Copies of the evaluation will be maintained in the resident's portfolio. 4. Medication Use Evaluation: TBD Each resident is required to participate in and complete a Medication Use Evaluation (MUE).Topics may be pertaining to direct patient care, qual ity improvement; fiscal oversight or others.This MUE will be presented at the annual VIZIENT meeting prior to the Midyear Clinical Meeting, and at the relevant multidisciplinary meeting(s) at the institution. The MUE may also be presented at the Critical C are networking poster networking session at ASHP Midyear Clinical Meeting. 5. Residency Project: Longitudinal Each resident is responsible for the completion of residency project. The project typically takes the form of a research project, including IRB submission/correspondence, data collection, data analysis, and manuscript preparation. Each resident will complete a project report using an accepted manuscript style suitable for publication in the professional literature to a pharmacy or critical -care related journal . 25 6. Participation in Departmental and External Leadership Activities : Longitudinal A number of activities and opportunities for leadership development will be scheduled throughout the residency year to foster an understanding of leadership within the department of pharmacy, within the profession of pharmacy and within the field of healthcare. These include participation in the critical care executive committee and critical care practice committees. 7. Participation in Pharmacy Residency On-Call Program, Code Pager Coverage and Drug Information Services : Longitudinal The resident will participate in the department's clinical on-call program (out of hospital) approximately every 6 weeks. The pharmacy resident on-call shift covers 4:00 PM to 8:00 AM both weekdays and weekends. Responsibilities include providing answers to drug information questions and following up on pharmacokinetic issues. The resident will participate in code pager coverage approximately once every 6 weeks. The code pager shift covers 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM during on w eekdays. Responsibilities include responding to in-house code calls and providing the required assistance. Residents are required to be ACLS certified. Each resident will participate in several venues to provide drug information, which include but are not limited to Drug Information Questions, Development/update of PPGD, P & T Committee Formulary Reviews, Journal Club and other drug information activities , etc. The goal of these activities is to provide the resident with experience in the provision of pertinent drug information in a number of venues. 8. Participation in Teaching Activities: TBD per MCPHS University calendar Resident involvement in the teaching activities fosters clinical development and refinement of the resident's teaching and communication skills . The residents will serve as preceptors to MCP HS University students during their 6 week Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience. The residents will be responsible for developing the rotation goals and objectives for the students as well as coordinating all on -site activities and evaluations. The resident will actively participate as a facilitator for MCP HS University Therapeutics Seminar. The resident will participate in the longitudinal MCPHS University Teaching Certificate Program if one has not been previously completed. Additional teaching activities may be assigned at the discretion of the residency director and MCPHS University Coordinator. 9. Participation in Recruitment Efforts: November - March Each resident will assist with the new resident recruitment efforts of the department. Each resident is an important source of information and advice for potential candidates, therefore, there will be scheduled time within the interview process for i nterviewees to interact with current residents. Additionally, each resident is required to spend time providing information to interested parties during the ASHP Midyear Clinical Meeting. 10. Attendance - Society of Critical Care Medicine Meeti ng: January /February The Society of Critical Care Medicine Conference is held in the winter of the year (generally in January/February ) and is a forum where the resident can continue to develop critical care knowledge while networking with critical care pharmacy practitioners around the country . 11. Participation in Resident Advisory Council (RAC) Meetings: Longitudinal Residents will attend scheduled RAC meetings to discuss upcoming resident events, other issues pertaining to the residency program, and actions/recommendations made at residency committee meetings, etc. Meetings will be scheduled by the Director of the Residency Program. 26 12.

In the event that the candidate declines, the next candidate will be offered the position. Applicants to the BIDMC Res idency Program will complete an electronic application in Phorcas and submit by the application deadline. Materials to be included are: A one-page letter of Intent including a statement of professional goals and reasons for pursuing the PGY2 Residency Curriculum Vitae Three Letters of Recommendation Official transcript from accredited School/College of Pharmacy To determine candidates for an on-site interview, c ompleted applications will be reviewed by the residency program director and at least 1 member of the RAC to determine candidates that most closely match the BIDMC progr am goals and opportunities. The letter of intent, CV, current PGY -1 residency program, scholastic record and letters of recommendation weigh highly in the review process. We also consider work experience, career goals, leadership activities, teaching experience and involvement in professional activities as important factors in our selection process. All completed applications in PhORCAS are scored using the resident 28 screening form. Each area is scored and weighed acc ordingly. After review, no more than 6 candidates with the most points will be invited for an onsite interview. Once invited for an interview, candidates will be scored on a scale of 1-5 by all interviewing parties. Interviewing parties will include program preceptors, critical care physician, clinical director, and residency program director. The average score for each candidate will then be tabulated to create an initial rank list. The rank list is then reviewed by the residency program director in conjunction with the residency advisory committee to determine a final rank order list to be submitted to the National Matching services. The residency program director may exercise discretion with the final rank list based on the overall resident fit for the program. A rank list will be submitted to the Resident Matching Program In the event that the program does not match a candidate after the primary match, the program will enter into the second match process. Candidates for the second match will be screened in PhORCAS in a similar fashion as stated above, and the top 2-4 candidates by point total will be offered an on -line (Skype) interview with the residency director and program preceptors. Once all interviews are completed, the average score for each candidate will be tabulated in the same fashion, and an initial secondary match rank list will be created. The residency program director has the discretion to change the rank list prior to submission based on perceived resident candidate fit with the program. In the scenario where the program does not match in the secondary match process, the residency program director will accept applications for 1 week and will screen candidates using the same form/process above. The top 2-3 candidates will be invited for an on-line interview with the program director and preceptors, and the top candidate (by average interview score) will be offered the position . Acknowledgement of Residency Match: Residents matched to the BIDMC Residency pr ogram will receive an acceptance letter acknowledging the match and delineating the general terms and conditions of the residency. Acknowledgment in writing by the resident will constitute acceptance of the match and agreement to fulfill the duties of the residency position for the upcoming year. Pharmacy Licensure Verification: Participation in the BIDMC PGY2 Residency Program is contingent on securing and maintaining a license without restriction in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (MA). It is the expectation that the resident will complete these licensure requirements within 90 days of the commencement of the program. The resident will provide the Residency Program Director confirmation that: He/she has already taken or is scheduled to take the NAPLEX and the Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination (MPJE) , or He/she will take the MPJE upon successful transfer of NAPLEX scores from another state, or He/she has already has a valid MA pharmacy license. Upon notification of successful completion of the NAPLEX and/or MPJE the resident will provide documentation of licensure to the Residency Program Director. Failure to attain licensure is grounds for dismissal from the residency program. Residents should contact the Residency Program Director should any issue arise with licensure. 29 BIDMC PGY2 Pharmacy Residency Program 2020-2 1 Obligations of the Program to the Resident The PGY2 residency at BIDMC, in conjunction with the MCPHS University , provides a 12-month advanced education and training experience for the Pharmacy Resident. It is the intent of the pharmacy residency program to provide an exemplary environment conducive to resident learning. Program Competencies , Goals and Objectives for the BIDMC PGY2 program are in alignment with the ASHP PGY2 Residency required standards . Activities taught and evaluated throughout the program are intended to assu re the desired outcomes are achieved through structured learning experiences. Individualized Resident Plan Flexibility has been built into the program to allow the resident to select learning experiences to meet their interests and focus on identified areas for improvement. A customized residency plan w ill be designed and updated during the program for each resident based upon these criteria. BIDMC PGY 2 Critical Care Pharmacy Residency Evaluations An essential component of developing the skills of a resident and continuous improvement to the residency program is frequent two-way feedback between residents and preceptors. The goal of such discussion and interaction is to: Discuss the resident's achievements in terms of learning objectives established for the rotation Provide feedback that may assist the resident with future rotations or practice Provide feedback to the preceptors for continuous improvement of preceptor skills, that may strengthen mentoring during future rotations Provide feedback to the coordinator, in order to improve the residency program, and coordinator skills. The preceptors, program director, and residents will frequently provide feedback to one another during individual rotations , resident activities and in general throughout the residency program. Specific program and rotation feedback may be given via different formats depending upon the learning experience. This will include both oral and written feedback and evaluation. Evaluations will occur as described below: 1. Resident Self-Evaluation: Self-assessment and evaluation is an important component of the learning experience for the resident. For each rotation, the resident will complete pre-rotation goals in PharmAcademic prior to the start of the learning experience. It is the expectation that these goals will provide a focus for self -directed learning for the resident and will assist the preceptor in preparing an individualized plan for the resident. At th e conclusion of the rotation/ learning experience, the resident will complete a summative self-evaluation of their progress and attainment in meeting the goals and objectives of that rotation in PharmAcademic . Quarterly self-evaluations by the resident should be submitted to the Resident Advisor one week prior to the scheduled review date with the Advisor. 2. Rotation Summative Evaluations : At the end of each rotation, in addition to the resident's summative self-evaluation of his/her performance during that rotation, residents will also complete a preceptor and learning experience summative evaluation in PharmAcademic . Rotation preceptors will utilize PharmAcademic to complete an independent criteria - based, summative assessment of the resident's performance for each of the respective rotation-selected 30 educational goals and objectives assigned to the learning experience. The resident and preceptor will meet to review and discuss these evaluations together. 3. Criteria Based Assessments: Rotation preceptor s will provide periodic opportunities for the resident to practice and document criteria- based, formative self-evaluation of aspects of their routine performance and to document criteria-based, summative self-assessments (snap-shots) of achievement of the educational goals and objectives assigned to the learning experience. Feedback and evaluation of such selected activities will be conducted throughout the residency for both rotation and longitudinal activities . These will include but is not lim ited to: Case Discussion (Primary preceptor during that experience) Communication (Primary preceptor during that experience/Advisor/RPD ) Intervention Documentation ( Primary that solving (P preceptor that experience/Advisor ) Researched DI Questions ( Primary preceptor during that experience) Journal Club (Primary preceptor during that experience/pharmacy staff /students) Other project assignments (evaluation preceptor will be assigned) 4. Quarterly Evaluation: These are longitudinal evaluations providing written evaluation of the resident's progress within the residency program. The quarterly evaluation will address progress towards the resident's individual residency goals and objectives as well as the required and longitudinal activities of the program. The resident will complete a quarterly self-assessment and submit this to his/her Resident Advisor one week prior to the scheduled Quarterly Evaluation meeting time with the advisor . Following the review and discussion of the quarterly evaluation between the resident and his/her Advisor, a meeting with the RPD will be scheduled to discuss the resident's overall progress and to complete the quarterly update of the resident's customized plan. 5. Residency Advisory Committee Assessments: Immediate feedback on specific topics/issues is provided during each RAC meeting. Throughout the residency year, the resident will seek feedback on various assignments, presentations, drug information questions, projec t work and other activities. Assessment by committee members will be provided in a number of formats, each contributing to the progress of the resident in achieving his/her residency goals. 6. Custom Evaluations: Some residency experiences will be evaluated utilizing custom evaluations that are not in PharmAcademic . Resident's should maintain a copy of each evaluation and these should be filed by the resident in his/her Residency Portfolio 7. Achieved for Residency : Achieved for Residency (ACH -R) may only be designated by the program director based upon review and assessment of each individual resident's performance from summative evaluations. Typically, this will be considered when a resident has scored two or more scores of 4 for that objective. At least 75 % of a resident's monthly or quarterly evaluations should be scored at 3-5 in order to successfully complete the residency program Evaluation scale definitions to be utilized in the summative rotation and quarterly evaluations: 5- Major Strength: [Excellent]: Resident consistently demonstrates high level of performance for evaluated skill, ability, initiative, or productivity. All associated assignments/responsibilities are completed above the level of expectation 4- Solid Performance : [Very Good]: Resident demonstrates high level of performance for evaluated skill, ability, initiative, or productivity; exceeding requirements in some areas, but not consistently or not without exception. Resident is capable of independent performance the majority of the time with only minimal preceptor intervention. 31 3- Developing: [Satisfactory] Resident displays an understanding of evaluated skill, ability, initiative, or productivity, however he/she requires additional work to develop and sustain an effective lev el of performance for the evaluated skill, ability, initiative, or productivity. Resident needs occasional preceptor intervention. 2- Needs Improvement : Resident displays inconsistency in the performance of the evaluated skill, ability, initiative, or productivity review and performance frequently falls below acceptable levels. Frequent preceptor intervention is needed and development is required to meet expected performance level. 1- Unsatisfactory: Resident's performance is consistently below expectatio ns, and/or he/she has failed to make reasonable progress toward agreed upon expectations and goals. Significant improvement is needed in most aspects of their performance. (A plan to improve performance with specified timelines must be outlined and monitor ed for improvement.) 32 PGY2 Pharmacy Residency Preceptor Requirements In alignment with accreditation and practice standards set forth by ASHP, the BIDMC PGY2 residency program is committed to provide residency training precepted by qualified pharmacists. Criteria regarding the required minimum qualifications of preceptors include: Preceptors must be licensed pharmacists who have completed an ASHP -accredited PGY-2 residency followed by a minimum of one year of pharmacy practice experience. Alternatively, licensed pharmacists who have not completed an ASHP -accredited residency may be prec eptors but must demonstrate mastery of the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and abilities expected of one who has completed a PGY2 residency and have a minimum of three years of pharmacy practice experience. Preceptors must have training and experience in the area of pharmacy practice for which they serve as preceptors, must maintain continuity -of-practice in that area, and must be practicing in that area at the time residents are being trained. Preceptors must have a record of contribution and commitment to pharmacy practice . Examples of such commitment include but are not limited to: o Documented record of improvements in and contributions to the respective area of advanced pharmacy practice (e.g., implementation of a new service, active participation on a committee/task force resulting in practice improvement, development of treatment guidelines/protocols). o Appointments to appropriate drug policy and other committees of the department/organization. o Formal recognition by peers as a model practitioner (e.g., board certification, fellow status). o A sustained record of contributing to the t otal body of knowledge in pharmacy practice through publications in professional journals and/or presentations at professional meetings. o Serving regularly as a reviewer of contributed papers or manuscripts submitted for publication. o Demonstrated leadership in advancing the profession of pharmacy through active participation in professional organizations at the local, state, and national levels. o Demonstrated effectiveness in teaching (e.g., through student and/or resident evaluations, teaching awards). In addition to the aforementioned preceptor qualifications , preceptors must demonstrate a desire and an aptitude for teaching that includes mastery of the four preceptor roles fulfilled when teaching clinical problem solving (instructing, modeling, coachin g, and facilitating). Further, preceptors must demonstrate abilities to provide criteria-based feedback and evaluation of resident performance. Preceptors must continue to pursue refinement of their teaching skills. Examples of opportunities to enhance precepting and teaching skills are described under preceptor development. Select learning experiences in later stages of the residency, (when the primary role of the preceptor is to facilitate resident learning experiences), may be precepted by practitioner s who are not pharmacists (e.g., physicians, physician assistants, and certified nurse practitioners.) In these instances, a pharmacist preceptor will work closely with the non-pharmacist preceptor to select the educational goals and objectives as well as participate actively in the criteria-based evaluation of the resident's performance. Such learning experiences will be conducted only at a point in the residency when the RPD and preceptors agree that the resident is ready for independent practice. Evaluations conducted at the end of previous learning experiences will reflect such readiness to practice independently. 33 Preceptor and Program Development The RPD will provide preceptors with opportunities to enhance their teaching skills during the residency year. Select Residency Advisory Committee Meetings, the Annual Preceptor Retreat and specific educational programs will be utilized to schedule preceptor development activities. Additionally, a wide number of Preceptor Development resources are available online and examples include: Pharmacist Letter Preceptor Home: http://www.pharmacistsletter.com (on-line access through the schools of pharmacy) American Society of Health Systems Pharmacist (ASHP): www.ashp.org Precepting tools though the Colleges of Pharmacy (e.g. P receptors for NEU and have e-value access and access to the Collaborative Education Institute) To foster ongoing individual preceptor development, the RPD will review and provide feedback on the preceptor's rotation summaries as well as the preceptor evaluations. Preceptors will be committed to self- reflection and will make active use of feedback provided to them so as to promote continual improvement of their rotations and precepting skills. Issues identified by the RPD in any of these evaluations will be addressed by the RPD with the persons involved. Action steps and corrective actions will be identified and implemented on an as needed basis. At least annually, the RPD in collaboration with members of the Residency Advisory Committee will consider overall program changes based on evaluations, observations, and other information. 34 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center PGY2 Pharmacy Residency Program 2020-2 1 Expectations and Responsibilities of Residents Professional Practice: Professional Conduct: It is the responsibility and expectation of all Residents participating in the BIDMC Residency to maintain the highest degree of professional conduct at all times. The resident will display an attitude of professionalism in all aspects of his/her daily practice. Professional Dress: All residents are expected to dress in an appropriate professional manner whenever they are within the Medical Center or participating in or attending any function as a representative of the BIDMC or MCPHS University . A detailed policy is found in the BIDMC Department of Pharmacy Policies and Procedures. It is the expectation that the resident will wear a clean, pressed white lab coat at all times in patient care areas. Employee Badges: BIDMC requires all personnel (including residents) to wear his/her badge at all times when they are within the medical center. Badges will be obtai ned from the BIDMC Security office during Orientation. If the employee badge is lost the resident must report the loss immediately to Security, and render a fee for replacement. Communication: The resident is responsible for promoting good communication between the pharmacists, patients, physicians, and other health care professionals. The resident shall abide by the BIDMC hospital policies regarding the use of hospital and cellular phone within the hospital and in patient care areas. Constructive criticism is a means of learning and is not meant to embarrass. Any conflicts which may arise between the candidate and preceptor should first be handled by discussing it with one another. If resolution is not achieved, then discussing the situation with the R esidency Program Director is the next appropriate step to achieve resolution. Patient Confidentiality: Patient confidentiality will be strictly maintained by all residents. Time for completion of HIPPA training will be scheduled during pharmacy practice training. It is the expectation that r esidents will not discuss patient- specific information with other patients, family members or other person not directly involved in the care of the patient. Similarly, r esidents will not discuss patients in front of other patients or in areas where people may overhear. Residents will not leave confidential documents (profiles, charts, prescriptions, etc.) in public places. Residents should understand that inappropriate conduct (e.g., breach of confidentiality) may result in disciplinary action. Attendance: Residents are expected to attend all functions as required by the Residency Advisory Committee, the Residency Program Director and rotation preceptors. The residents are solely responsible for meeting the obligations of their assigned service commitments (staffing). Specific hours of attendance will be delineated by each preceptor in accordance to the individual rotation requirements. 35 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center PGY2 Pharmacy Residency Program 2020-2 1 Duty Hour policies: Standards have been established by the Accreditation Standard for Pharmacy Residencies regarding the time residents spend performing patient care duties and other activities related to their program. (http://www.ashp.org/DocLibrary/Accreditation/Regulations -Standards/Duty -Hours.aspx ) It is recognized that providing residents with a sound didactic and clinical education must be carefully planned and balanced with concerns for patient safety and resident well -being. The BIDMC Residency Program is structured so that the learning objecti ves of the program are not compromised by excessive reliance on residents to fulfill service obligations and that didactic and clinical education have priority in the allotment of residents' time and energy. Duty hours are defined as all scheduled clini cal and academic activities related to the pharmacy residency program. This includes inpatient and outpatient care, in-house call, administrative duties, scheduled and assigned activities, such as conferences, committee meetings, and health fairs that are required to meet the goals and objectives of the residency program. Duty hours must be addressed by a well -documented, structured process. Duty hours do not include: reading, studying, and academic preparation time for presentations, journal clubs; or travel time to and from conferences; and hours that are not scheduled by the residency program director or preceptor. Duty hours must be limited to 80 hours per week, averaged over a four -week period, inclusive of all in- house call activities and all moonligh ting. Mandatory time free of duty: residents must have a minimum of one day in seven days free of duty (when averaged over four weeks). At-home call cannot be assigned on these free days. Residents should have 10 hours free of duty between scheduled duties , and must have at a minimum 8 hours between scheduled duty periods. Continuous duty periods of residents should not exceed 16 hours. The maximum allowable duty assignment must not exceed 24 hours even with built in strategic napping or other strategies to reduce fatigue and sleep deprivation, with an additional period of up to two hours permitted for transitions of care or educational activities. External Employment Policy (Moonlighting) Successful completion of the residency program leading to certification is a function of the successful completion of all the program's requirements, which determine the primary schedule of the resident. It must be understood that he responsibilities of the resident may not correspond to a consistent day to day schedule and at times, extra hours of coverage may be necessary to complete residency requirements. Patient- care rotations, teaching, and service requirements take precedence over scheduling for external employment and thus, the residency program is considered the primary priority of each resident. External employment, if desired, may not interfere with the resident's responsibilities or requirements. All additional shifts to be picked up by the resi dent require approval by the current rotation preceptor as well as the Residency Director. There is a provision regarding employment at BIDMC to work as a pharmacist should additional staffing hours be available. Working additional hours for BIDMC is considered outside employment and as specified, must not interfere with the activities of the residency program, nor conflict with the Duty Hours Policy. 36 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center PGY2 Pharmacy Residency Program 2020-2 1 Resident Disciplinary Action: Residents are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner at all times and to follow all relevant departmental and hospital policies and procedures. Disciplinary action will be initiated if a resident: Does not follow policies and procedures of the BIDMC Department of Pharmacy Services, or Residency Program Does not present him/herself in a professional manner Does not make satisfactory progress on any of the residency goals or objectives Does not make adequate progress towards the completion of residency requirements (e.g. residency project, rotation requirements, longitudinal activities , timely licensure, service requirements, etc.) Disciplinary Action Policy and Procedure: Disciplinary Actions within the BIDMC Pharmacy Residency Program will align with the BIDMC Corrective Action Policy and the BIDMC GME Policy for Remediation and Discipline.

Time -off requests must be received in writing at least two weeks prior to the scheduled time off. All requests for time-off, vacation and schedule changes should be directed to and approved by the pharmacy supervisor responsible for scheduling , the preceptor for the rotation during which the time off will occur, and the residency program director. Approv al for vacation and time off will follow departmental policy and procedures. Attendance at the ASHP Midyear or SCCM are considered Professional Absences and do not affect PTO. Sick Days/ Extended Medical Leave/Personal Leave: Sick days must be reported to the Pharmacy Administrator on call (92429) as early as possible as outlined in the Department of Pharmacy Policy and Procedures. In addition, the resident should also notify the current rotation preceptor and Residency Program Director as early as possible of their absence. It is the responsibility of the resident to coordinate and make up any missed work associated with preceptor for that rotation. If an employee is absent for three consecutive work shifts without notifying her/his supervisor, s/he will be considered to have resigned without notice. Illnesses longer than 5 days will follow the Department of Pharmacy Policy: \" Employee Dependability (Attendance and Tardiness) Expectation.\" If an employee is absent for five consecutive shifts and has notified her/his supervisor, s/he must report to Employee/Occupational Health Services for evaluation and clearance prior to returning to work.

BIDMC Policies regarding extended illness , \"Employee Paid Time Off (PM -03)\" and \"Employee Leaves of Absence (PM -11)\" are located on the portal within the BIDMC Policy Manual. Whereas the residency program is a designed to be completed in a 12 month period, an extended leave may impact the resident's ability to successfully complete the requirements of the program during this 12 month period. Every effort will be made to work with the resident to develop a plan to accomplish making up missed days, however this may not be possible. In situations where an extended leave of absence (greater than 4 weeks) necessitates an extension beyond the 12 months of the residency in order to complete the residency requirements, the resident may petition the RPD and DOP for an extension of their residency end date. All decisions related to extensions will be made on a case-by -case basis and cannot be guaranteed. (GME Policy for Extension of Training (GME -04) The resident may receive a stipend during an approved extension of training subject to the availability of funding, however this funding cannot be guaranteed. In the event a stipend is paid, it will be at the pay rate the resident received during their residency year. (GME Policy for Extension of Training (GM E-04)) If the resident is unable to complete the formulated plan and fulfill the requirements of the program, they will not be awarded a certificate of completion. 40 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center PGY2 Pharmacy Residency Program 2020-2 1 BIDMC Department of Pharmacy The Department of Pharmacy at BI DMC employs approximately 140 FTEs including: pharmacists, technicians, students and other support personnel who provide pharmacy services to patients and healthcare professionals. In-patient pharmacy services at BIDMC are provided by decentralized clinical pharmacists in a unit-based practice model. Within this model, pharmacists are assigned to cover several patient care areas and are responsible for the pharmaceutical care of the patients on those units. The pharmacy's computer system interfaces with the hospital's Provider Order Entry (POE) computer program, allowing the pharmacists to access patient information throughout the medical center. Unit-based pharmacists screen medication orders for potential problems with dosing, drug allergies, drug interactions, and other drug-related problems and inform prescribers of potential problems and possible drug therapy modification. In addition to medication order processing, pharmacists are actively involved in providing drug information, performing pharmacokinetic evaluation and dosing for select medications, reviewing medications for renal dose adjustment, evaluating patients for potential intravenous to oral medication interchange and monitoring target medications. This spectrum of care includes provision of services to adult and geriatric patient populations as well as premature and full term infants. In addition to the unit-based pharmacy practice, the pharmacy staffs and operates several specialty areas including parenteral nutrition/metabolic support, investigational drug services, oncology, and operating room services. The Department provides 24-hour drug distribution from central pharmacy areas and automated dispensing units throughout the hospital. The department utilizes state of the art technology including Omnicell automated dispensing cabinets and Omnicell Carousel Inventory management. Medication reliability and safety are integral to the provision of optimal pharmaceutical care and the pharmacy continually reviews medication incident reports, adverse drug events and medication errors to identify potential areas for improvement of systems. Active involvement in multidisciplinary quality assurance programs, assist the pharmacy in evaluating the specific needs of its patients. The Department of Pharmacy works with the Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T) committee to review mediations for formulary status, to perform and review medication use evaluations, to develop medication use policies, and to contribute to clinical resource management activities of the medical center. The P&T Committee provides an interdisciplinary forum that facilitates consistent communication between the members of the Department of Pharmacy and physicians, nurses, and other allied health professionals. In additional to the provision of inpatient and outpatient pharmaceutical services, the pharmacy also serves as an Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience and Cooperative Education site for pharmacy students from both MCPHS University and Northeastern University College of Pharmacy.
