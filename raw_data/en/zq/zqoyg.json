Candidates and campaign organizers have swarmed Iowa with increasing frequency as they attempt to establish support and stand out from the crowded field of 23 Democratic candi- dates before the first debates on June 26-27. With more than 50 paid staffers across Iowa, Sen. Elizabeth War - ren's campaign has established an early presence in the state. The campaign has hosted a plethora of small organizing events in eastern Iowa since Warren announced her candidacy in early 2019. Warren Iowa Communications Director Jason Noble said he views grassroot-organizing efforts by staff as essential to building sup - port for the Iowa caucuses. \"Clearly, we have a really robust staff all across the state, and that in - cludes in college communities and on campuses, \" Noble said. Sen. Kamala Harris' campaign announced on June 6 it will expand the Iowa staff exponentially from five to 65 staffers by July 1. The staff growth will place the Harris cam - paign as the largest Iowa employer among the Democratic candidates. \"Our staff on the ground has been going to local events, going to [meet people] one-on-one, and working to get people involved and excited about the campaign and about Kamala Harris, \" said Mariah Gould, Harris' regional organizing director for the Iowa City area. \"We had a really good response so far, and it seems like a lot of people are really interested in Kamala Harris. \" The campaign works on the ground to engage Iowans by con - necting them with the campaign and providing information on get- ting involved, Gould said. \"I think we want to make sure we have a combination of both grassroot efforts and volunteer efforts, and I think both of those things play into each other, \" she said. The campaign of former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke also prioritizes volunteer involvement to expand its support in Iowa. O'Rourke Iowa Communication Director Geoff Burgan said the campaign held 18 canvassing events in nine cities last weekend as part of the campaign's statewide weekend of action. The O'Rourke campaign in Iowa employs 44 staff members, 37 of whom are responsible for organiz-ing, Burgan said. The staffers focus on spreading information about O'Rourke through the internet, town halls and community meet- ings, he said. Despite many students' absence from college campuses this sum-mer, Burgan said, the months will be an important time for campaign organizing. O'Rourke previously targeted student voters in Iowa by visiting the three regent universi - ties. \"Summer is when the hard work really happens, \" he said. \"Y ou get to see when campaigns are more se - rious about the organizing part of the caucuses. We certainly want to be part of that conversation. \" Cynthia Sebian-Lander, the Io- wa state director for Democrat Ju - li\u00e1n Castro, said the campaign also takes advantage of the summer to train and distribute campaign staff. She said her campaign sends organizers to meet with commu-nities by participating in local Democratic committee meetings and placing information tables at community events, among oth-er things. She said has seen mo - mentum build, she said, and has witnessed growing excitement for Castro in various communities. Despite employing significant - ly fewer staff members than such campaigns as Warren's and Har - ris' , Sebian-Lander said, the Castro campaign is focused on talking to specific voters and gathering sup - port instead of paying attention to the actions of other campaigns in Iowa. \"We know who we need to go talk to, and we are excited for the opportunity to talk with folks who are too often left out of the process and don't always feel like the cau- cus is a stage for them to partici - pate, \" she said.Summer \u2014 time to nurture grassroots Presidential campaigns gear up their organizing efforts in the crucial summer months with the Iowa caucuses on the horizon. Katie Goodale/The Daily Iowan Supporters of Sen. Elizabeth Warren gather at the Pints and Persist event in Joe's Place on April 2. 2020 CAUCUS4 | DAIL YIOWAN.COM | WEDNESDAY , JUNE 12, 2019BY RYLEE WILSON rylee-wilson@uiowa.edu For 11 years, the Stanley Muse- um of Art's 15,000 works of art \u2014 including works by Picasso and Jackson Pollock \u2014 have been without a permanent home. Soon, the works will return to the University of Iowa cam - pus, with construction on the new Stanley Museum of Art set to begin in the fall. The UI broke ground on the 63,000-square- foot site on June 8. The $50 million museum, located south of the Main Library in Gibson Square, is slated to be completed in the spring of 2022. The original museum was located on the west bank of the Iowa River and was heavily damaged in the flood of 2008. While rescue efforts saved all of the museum's collection, no location on campus was large enough to house all the artwork. There is limited display space in the museum's current IMU lo - cation, so much of the Stanley's collection resides in the Figge Museum of Art in Davenport or is on loan to other museums around the country. The Stanley is the last major construction project in the UI's flood recovery. In his remarks at the groundbreaking, UI President Bruce Harreld called the construc- tion of the new museum the \"be - ginning of the end of the recovery.\" Half of the $50 million fund- ing comes from donations \u2014 both large and small. The other $25 million comes from the UI general fund. Senior Vice President of Fi - nance Rod Lehnertz said the UI Center for Advancement was tasked with raising $25 million for the construction of the new museum after appeals to the federal government for funding proved to be unsuccessful. Lehnertz said he hopes the mu - seum's new central location near the Main Library will increase stu - dent engagement with the muse-um \u2014 calling the museum a \"gate-way feature\" for the university. \"With the museum in its for - mer location, fewer than half of the students graduating from the UI knew we had a museum \u2014 much less had visited one,\" Lehnertz said. \"We've changed a lot since then, and that's why this site is so important to us \u2014 to be in the midst.\" 2019 marks the 50th anniver - sary of the museum. Museum Director Lauren Lessing said the idea of what a university muse - um should be has changed dras-tically in the 50 years since the facility opened its doors. \"The old Art Museum was a beautiful display space for our collection, but it was not de - signed with teaching in mind. That was in the mid-20th cen - tury, when art museums were mostly intended as spaces of display,\" she said. \"Now, the function of art museums has re - ally changed \u2014 particularly on college campuses.\"The new three-story museum will feature display space, class - rooms, outdoor terraces, and a lobby that can serve as a place for performances or a study space for students. The new Stanley will sit atop a parking garage to replace the current surface lot behind Gib- son Square, which will also serve as a flood-control measure. Steve McGuire, the director of the School of Art and Art Histo - ry, said the Stanley serves as an important place for students to gain career experience in cura - torial work and to learn from the work in the collection. \"It has work that is import -ant for students to see so as to situate the work that they do in becoming an artist,\" he said. \"Anybody who produces artwork is having a conversation with all the artwork that's been created.\" While the Stanley is an im - portant space for learning on campus, in her remarks at the groundbreaking, Advancement Center President Lynette Mar - shall emphasized that the Stan- ley is an institution for all Io- wans, not just UI students. \"Today, it truly is the museum of the people of Iowa,\" she said. \"Everyone has a stake in this museum. They can all say, 'This is my museum.' \" New Stanley Museum breaks ground Construction on the new Stanley Museum of Art is officially underway. The new $50 million, 63,000-square-foot museum should be completed in 2022.

BY ANDY MITCHELL andrew-mitchell@uiowa.edu The University of Iowa has played a crucial role in recovering lost history with a brand-new course. Professor of history Leslie Schwalm, the chair of the UI Department of Gender, Women's, and Sexuality Studies, co-di - rects the Iowa satellite of the nationwide effort called Colored Conven- tions Project with Tom Keegan, the head of the Digital Scholarship and Publishing Studio at the UI Libraries. The national project documents and uncovers lost information about collective organizing among African Ameri-cans from 1830, when the first political convention in this ongoing African American movement for civil rights was doc - umented to the end of the century. The project collects sources such as printed speeches, pro - ceedings, petitions, and newspaper articles and makes them available on ColoredConventions.org to piece together a pre- viously forgotten part of American history. University of Delaware Professor Gabrielle Fore-man founded the project in April 2012 along with Princeton University Per - kins Fellow and postdoc - toral research associate Jim Casey and University of Massachusetts-Am- herst Professor Sarah Patterson. Foreman visited the UI in November 2017 to deliv- er lectures and lead work - shops at the Obermann Center for Advanced Studies. Schwalm said she was inspired by the lec- tures and workshops and, with a group of area pro - fessors from schools such as Grinnell College and Iowa State University, worked to form a satellite project in Iowa. Casey, who is now a co-director, said that when the project started, only 12 national conven-tions and 45 state-lev - el conventions were in print. After seven years, the project has uncovered at more than 200 conven- tions that took place all over North America from the 1830s to the end of the 19th century, and the staff suspect that twice that many exist. \"The most common re - action we get from both high-school students, un- dergrads, and many other historians is, 'Why didn't I know more about this his - tory?' \" Casey said. Schwalm said research- ers initially knew of three African American conven-tions in the state, but they have since discovered 10 more. \"We're interested in re - cuperating this very rich history of black local ac - tivism in the 19th century in Iowa,\" Schwalm said. \"We're interested in mak-ing that history accessible to K-12 history teachers and to provide them with the tools to incorporate this in - to their lesson plans.\" Foreman said the is- sues that African Amer- icans of that time orga- nized against \u2014 such as voter disenfranchisement and school segregation \u2014 resonate deeply in today's climate. Voter suppres- sion and access to quality public education are two examples of issues that are as important today as they were more than a century ago. \"To uncover the records that reveal this hidden history, it's extraordi- narily important for the project to partner with satellite projects that are stationed in places where these conferences took place,\" Foreman said. More than 2,500 stu - dents across North Amer - ica from a wide variety of majors have contributed to the project, Foreman said. One exciting feature of the project is that it works across disciplines, with librarians as well as scholars and students, in its use of data visualiza - tion to help tell the story of the obscured move - ment. \"It's not just for histo - ry students,\" Casey said. \"We've had students in just about every major you can think of.\" The project is about to launch on a curriculum focused on seventh-to 12th-graders to prime them on the part of history before they reach college. 6 | DAIL YIOWAN.COM | WEDNESDAY , JUNE 12, 2019BY ANDY MITCHELL andrew-mitchell@uiowa.edu In the early morning hours of April 19, University of Iowa student Nicholas Grandstaff re - ceived an unlikely, life-changing phone call. Earlier that week, he had ac - cepted an offer from a Ph.D. pro - gram at Purdue as a backup plan in case the call never came \u2014 since the odds were so slim that it would. Now, instead of spending his next few of years at Purdue, he'll spend them in the Nether - lands. To this point, advancing de - spite the odds has been the Ful-bright-award winner's modus operandi. Grandstaff comes from Em- metsburg, Iowa, a farm town with a population of around 3,000 people. Irish immigrants settled the town during the Irish potato famine in the mid-1800s. Grand- staff grew up on a farm, where he developed an affinity for the nuts and bolts of agriculture. He laments the current crisis in corn planting across the Midwest, where weather conditions have prevented thousands of acres of corn from being planted. \"It comes pretty naturally when you don't live next to a city every day, \" Grandstaff said. What he was really interest - ed in, and what he was missing, was the research and develop - ment side of agriculture. He was keyed into that aspect through high-school biology, and in his sophomore year, his class wrote for the World Food Prize, which helped him see the bigger picture and Iowa's place in global food production. Grandstaff transferred to the UI from Iowa Lakes Community College. Going into higher edu-cation, he said, he knew he want - ed to pursue a technical skill and in the long run, work in agricul - ture. He opted to study econom - ics, and graduated in 2019 with a B.B.A. in economics and a minor in mathematics. While Iowa State University is more associated with agriculture, Grandstaff opted instead for the UI because of the more diverse groups of people and back-grounds. \"There's no place in the state that's like Iowa City, \" Grandstaff said. With his Fulbright award, he will travel to the Netherlands to study under the international development master's program and the technology of the Dutch food system at Wageningen Uni - versity. Grandstaff said the Dutch food industry is quite different from Iowa's. It is also unique in that despite the country's small size, it is the second-largest value food producer in the world. \"Bottom line, Nick is an excep - tional young man, \" said Professor Anne Villamil, a professor of eco - nomics at the Tippie College of Business and one of Grandstaff 's advisers. It's an arrangement that al -most did not happen. Grand-staff made it far into the appli- cation process but fell just short of the award. He became an alternate, meaning if one of the award winners had to drop out or decline the honor, he would be the next person up. While he was an alternate for four weeks, he said, he was not optimistic about his slim chances of get - ting the prize. \"Y ou don't want to turn down a Fulbright after spending a year working on it, \" Grandstaff said. Karen Wachsmuth, the UI as - sociate director of international fellowships, said it's both an ed -ucational and cultural-exchange program. \"Nicholas going abroad is go - ing to not only receive incredible benefits of a graduate school at an excellent institution, it's that he'll also make connections with local communities and organizations, \" Wachsmuth said. Further along, Grandstaff foresees a career solving prob - lems with such organizations as the International Food Policy Research Institute and the Food and Agriculture Organization, tackling the challenges of food all around the world.Defying the odds, Fulbright scholar heads to Europe UI student Nicholas Grandstaff had an unlikely journey to earning a Fulbright, and now he will head to the Netherlands. Contributed Nicholas Grandstaff poses for a photo after receiving a Fulbright scholarship.\"I believe in the gay power. I believe in us getting our rights, or else I would not be out there fighting for our rights ... I have been thrown in jail. I have lost my job. I have lost my apartment for gay liberation.\" Those are the words of Sylvia Rivera, a gay-libera-tion activist, at a rally in 1973. Four years earlier, Rivera was at the Stonewall Inn in New York during the riots that marked the beginning of the modern gay-rights movement. Belief in a better future for queer people and the willingness to fight for that future is at the founda-tion of Pride. But that was all a long time ago. By the end of this month, it will have been 50 years since the Stonewall riots. One can be tempted to think that Pride is perhaps unnecessary or even outdated. I know that my life as a bi man is easier now than it was at the time of Stonewall. But while progress has definitely been made \u2014 more than what many at Stonewall could have imag-ined \u2014 there's still so many more areas the gay-rights movement needs to reach. At Pride, we celebrate how far we've come. Supreme Court victories such as Law- rence v. Texas and Obergefell v. Hodges are great, but there are still many states in the country in which gay people can be fired and evicted for who they are and whom they love. Gay politicians such as Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Ari- zona, and Mayor Lori Light - foot of Chicago have entered their elected offices this year, but there are still no openly gender-queer governors or members of Congress. There is still work to be done. Pride still matters. It still matters because we have made history that has made the world better for future generations of queer peo-ple. It still matters because we are still persecuted by law and governments de - signed to exclude us. It still matters because LGBTQ people are still harassed, attacked, and killed because of their identities. We still believe in the gay power. We still believe in us getting our rights. Pride still matters, and we're still proud as hell.June is LGBTQ Pride Month in commemoration of New York's Stonewall riots, which took place on June 28, 1969. In the years that followed that date, the concept of pride and how it is represented, not only in the U.S. but in the world, have changed dramatically. Large pride parades with thousands of participants occur in cities across the country, such as New York, which hosts the largest cele- bration in the world. Because of the promi- nence of Pride and Pride-re- lated events and issues, the commercialization of the month by corporations has become increasingly common. Much of this is seemingly innocuous, with clothing companies selling pins and \"Pride sections\" in stores like H&M and Nike, but other marketing seems to ignore the princi- ples behind Pride and the struggles the LGBTQ com - munity has faced. Absolut's rainbow-bottled vodka han-dles and other marketing tactics of that ilk have also been called out.The entire concept be - hind Pride is a celebration and a remembrance of a community that has faced violent oppression and mar-ginalization. Companies piggybacking on the cur- rent cultural relevance of Pride is hurtful. It serves as a reminder to LGBTQ people that our identities are a pass-ing fad on which advertisers can happily capitalize. There are many compa- nies headed by people who genuinely support LGBTQ rights and have for decades, but when this support only manifests itself for a week or two in June \u2014 never any other time of the year \u2014 it is a little dishearten- ing. After struggling for so long \u2014 and still struggling to this day in the U.S. and around the world \u2014 ally- ship demands more than a slogan or rainbow-colored merchandise. Pride is what keeps us alive, and it's what we celebrate now. It becomes especial- ly harmful when Pride is packaged over items that historically hold negative or dangerous connotations. LGBTQ people have an el - evated risk for substance abuse, yet alcohol compa - nies continue to market toward the community during Pride despite rou-tinely being asked to stop. Even if these manufactur-ers want to express their support of a community that has been harmed by them in the past, the senti - ment is lost in translation. Instead of coming across as a supportive gesture, the drinks are still marketed to - ward the community with little warning or attempts to protect them. The commercialization of Pride takes away from the focus of Pride. Allowing companies to capitalize on people's support for LGBTQ people puts the focus on the corporations for their sup- posed good deeds. Even if proceeds are being donated to LGBTQ funds, there still is a focus on the \"allies\" for supporting the community, not the community itself. It is certainly generous for companies, especially small businesses, to devote part of their sales to LGBTQ do- nations, but there comes a point where the only ques-tion left to ask is, \"Do you care about us at any other time of the year or just when it's best for business?\" The best thing companies could do for LGBTQ peo- ple is to make public their stance on the community and donate year-round to their causes. Or, even better, enfranchise actual margin- alized speakers to do the promotion and support of the community instead of straight allies running mul-timillion-dollar corporations.COLUMN Pride isn't about money Activism and support for the LGBTQ community shouldn't be made garish by greedy corporate branding focused on profiting on marginalized people.Opinions ANNA BANERJEE anna-banerjee@uiowa.edu ELIJAH HELTON elijah-helton@uiowa.edu Thomas A.

The coaches' rankings are filled up and down with warm-weather schools from Tex- as, California, and Florida. The sport is perceived to be dominated by the South and Southwest, which makes what the Hawkeyes have done this season all the more impressive, consider- ing Iowa City was home to an ever- lasting winter. The Iowa men and women did not let the notion of geographical area bother them, and reached highs in the polls of No. 10 and No. 15, respectively. The beginning of the season had Iowa traveling to these warm states while Iowa was still thawing and putting on a display of why Iowa is a program to be reckoned with. The most notable meet of Iowa's early season was the Florida Relays, where the Iowa men's 4x400-meter relay won the competition against some of the best relay programs in the nation. It was an early sign that the Hawkeyes could go toe-to-toe against any team in the nation, es- pecially in that event.The relay squad had finished near the top of the leaderboard at the Florida Relays over the past couple of years, but had not yet pulled out a win. That changed this season with a then-school-record performance. As the season progressed, so did the performances. Some of the oldest records in program history fell this season as both the Hawkeye men and wom- en put up historic numbers. Nathan Mylenek broke a 63-year-old record in the 3,000-me-ter steeplechase, the longest stand- ing record Iowa had. Deacon Jones previously held the record since 1956, and Mylenek broke it by near-ly 10 seconds. On the women's side, the 4x800-meter relay broke a 32-year-old school mark at the Drake Re- lays en route to the women win-ning their first Hy-Vee Cup. The squad crushed the record by nearly 15 seconds. Heading into the Big Ten Out- door Championships at Creztmey-er Track, an event that had been circled on the calendar since it was scheduled, the Hawkeyes had ex- pectations through the roof. And all things considered, both the men and the women met \u2014 and possibly even exceeded \u2014 those lofty expectations. The men won their first confer-ence championship since 2011 \u2014 which was also the last time Big Tens were hosted by Iowa \u2014 and the women finished third, tied for the best finish in school history. Iowa had three athletes and one relay win Big Ten championships on the way to the historic team fin - ishes. Laulauga Tausaga won the con- ference crown in the discus, her third career Big Ten champion- ship. Mar'Yea Harris took home the 400-meters title and anchored the 4x400 conference-champion relay. Harris finished his Iowa career as a six-time Big Ten champion. Rounding out the conference champions was Chris Douglas, who in his final Big Ten meet brought home his first conference title, winning the 400-meter hur-dles as an underdog. The Hawkeyes' performances throughout the season and at the Big Tens earned two of its big- gest names recognition near the end of the season. Tausaga and Director of Track and Field Joey Woody earned conference and regional honors as Field Athlete of the Year and Coach of the Year, respectively. The success Iowa enjoyed on the track in postseason competition came with a bittersweet taste. Volunteer assistant coach and Iowa City track legend John Raffensperger died in late April. The Hawkeyes wore patches reading \"Raff\" on their uniforms throughout the rest of the season as a tribute to his contributions to the program and the many athletes and coaches he meant so much to. Most notably, when Tausaga be- came Iowa's 14th national champi-on in program history after firing a personal best mark in the discus at the NCAA Outdoor Champion- ships, she took the victors' podium and quietly pointed to Raffen- sperger's name on her uniform in a beautiful moment of tribute. Tausaga becoming a national champion was the ending to one of the greatest seasons Iowa track and field has ever seen. The program is on a new level right now, and it has the attention of the track and field community. The Hawkeyes proved themselves as a program to be reckoned with over the course of this outdoor season and will return next season with even higher expectations. Sports Looking back at Iowa track's historic outdoor season With a conference championship and a national champion, Iowa track and field made a statement with one of the greatest seasons in program history.

With the 2019 season near - ing its midpoint, the top teams are still mere games apart. The Central has consistently been one of the best divisions in baseball, having been repre- sented in each of the last eight National League Champion-ship Series. More specifically, fans of the Cubs, Brewers, and Cardinals have grown accus - tomed to success over recent seasons. Nearly all of the teams have added big names to try to keep up with the escalating level of play. The Reds picked up Yasi - el Puig in a trade in December 2018, and the Cardinals traded for Paul Goldschmidt \u2014 one of the best first basemen in the majors \u2014 just a few weeks later. The Cubs followed suit, picking up a $45 million tab on former Red Sox closer Craig Kimbrel on June 7. Although the teams have made many moves in the last several months, the current NL Central standings are identical to where they ended up last year. Because of all these high-pro -file signings, fans of the big- brand franchises are anxious. Chicago spends the second most in all of Major League Baseball on payroll but is still half a game behind Milwaukee, even though the Brewers check in at the No. 17 payroll spot. Cubs' upper management repeatedly said during the off -season that it would not sign any big names \u2014 rumors of Bryce Harper wearing a Chica- go uniform, for example, never came true. The sentiment that the organization had the tools it needed lasted until last week with the signing of Kimbrel. Injuries in the Cubs' bull- pen \u2014 and obvious underper-formance \u2014 brought the Red Sox gunslinger to Chicago. As one of the best closers in the game, the right-hander posted 42 saves and a 2.74 ERA in last season's All-Star campaign. It's a move that may evoke some positive memories for Cubs fans. In late July 2016, the Yan- kees sent closer Aroldis Chap-man to the Cubs. He was Chica-go's go-to arm out of the bullpen for the remainder of the season, putting up some of the best num - bers of his career. Of course, that signing helped the team to an eventual World Series win. Cubs fans hope Kimbrel can be that X-factor in the same way. Meanwhile, festering frus - tration has not eased in St. Louis. The Cards have the sev - enth-most expensive roster in the league after that move to gain Goldschmidt, but the team has been hovering around the .500 mark for most of the season. Matt Carpenter has cooled off after a booming second half last season. With all these moves around the division, Milwaukee has re-mained steady. Last year's NL MVP Christian Yelich \u2014 along with the rest of the Brewer bats \u2014 have picked up right where they left off. Yelich currently leads the majors in both hom - ers and slugging percentage, and he's been backed up nicely by Mike Moustakas and Jesus Aguilar in the infield. The acquirement of Kimbrel \u2014 who is expected to begin ap - pearing in games in just a few weeks \u2014 may push Chicago past its foes in the NL Central. But for now, the Brewers are proving that money can't buy everything. 9 | DAIL YIOWAN.COM | WEDNESDAY , JUNE 12, 2019 Big money, big players don't change NL Central After a busy offseason and ongoing roster changes, the Milwaukee Brewers are still proving money can't buy everything in the NL Central, while the Cubs hope Craig Kimbrel can prove otherwise.

The Cubs won, 3-1.10 | DAIL YIOWAN.COM | WEDNESDAY , JUNE 12, 2019BY PETE RUDEN peter-ruden@uiowa.edu Everyone loves March Madness. After all, what's better than watching bas- ketball literally all day for a whole weekend? Answer: very few things. But unfortunately, March only comes once a year, and when the \"One Shining Moment\" montage has finished, the whole country is forced to wait another 12 months to get the same feeling. But unbeknown to ma - ny, there's another elec-tric tournament just a few months later: the NCAA Baseball Tournament. The tournament gives fans of the sport the plea - sure of watching games from sun up to sundown, and the tight games and in - credible performances re- play in the brain for hours and days to come. But those close contests and amazing stat lines are often overlooked. Many of these games aren't on standard cable TV , and ESPN3 becomes a must-need, which isn't ideal for a national tourna - ment. Because a lot of the games can't be accessed, it doesn't get enough of the credit it deserves. Fans remember Loyola-Chicago's recent run to the Final Four and the numbers Steph Cur - ry dropped while leading Davidson to the Elite Eight in 2008, but what about Fresno State making the trip to Omaha and win - ning it all in a Cinderella run? And will Vanderbilt's Kumar Rocker's 19-strike - out no-hitter on June 8 be remembered beyond this year? Memes about Virginia losing to a No. 16 seed will be created as long as the in - ternet exists, but we prob- ably won't see anything about defending national champion Oregon State \u2014 which boasted the No. 1 pick in the MLB Draft \u2014 losing the first two games of the regional it hosted to end its season. Those are some incredi - ble feats, and Rocker's per - formance to even Vandy's Super Regional with Duke rivals the best in college athletics this year. The hype around the Baseball Tournament heightens when Iowa makes an NCAA regional, which we saw in 2017 after the Hawkeyes' run to the Big Ten Tournament title. But the tournament con - tinues to be fun either way. It's thrilling to watch small- er schools such as Jackson - ville State topple historical- ly stellar programs. It's also interesting to watch battles between con-ferences, because unlike college football and college basketball (for the most part), these unknown pro- grams sometimes rack up higher seeds than Power Five schools, bringing an interesting dynamic to the forefront that isn't seen in other college tournaments. In college baseball, teams that play year-round are at an advantage, which makes it fascinating to see how far a team from the Big Ten or Big East can make it. And let's not forget Omaha during the Col - lege World Series. T.D. Ameritrade Park quick - ly becomes a hot spot for sports fans, drawing an electric atmosphere from all the visitors. One doesn't even have to be a fan of a team that's com - peting. The atmosphere is enough. It's clear that the NCAA Baseball Tournament isn't March Madness, and it never will be. But for those needing their fix of a high - ly competitive tournament full of drama, the NCAA Baseball Tournament is perfect.June deserves the Madness The NCAA Baseball Tournament has been underrated for far too long, and it deserves recognition.

BY SABRINA SHEARER sabrina-shearer@uiowa.edu How are you remember - ing Stonewall? It's a question that has grown in popularity this month in preparation for the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising, which occurred June 28, 1969. Many remember Stone- wall as the event that jump-started the national movement for LGBTQ ac- ceptance. The event that changed history began when New York City police raided the Stonewall Inn, located in a gay commu- nity in New York's Green - wich Village. The raid sparked riots between police and indi - viduals who identified as gay, lesbian, and trans - gender \u2014 specifically, trans women of color \u2014 that lasted for six days in the Stonewall and sur - rounding streets. The up- rising became a symbolic catalyst for the gay-rights movement worldwide. \"Those who were cred- ited with standing up are people of color who were trans or drag queens,\" said Christine Hawes, the com-munity outreach and pub- licity chair for Iowa City Pride. The Stonewall uprising provoked activism in Io- wa City, specifically in the lesbian community on the University of Iowa campus, according to outhistory.org. The website works to estab - lish LGBTQ chronologies. In 1969, the Iowa City Women's Liberation Front formed an organization to focus on such issues as child care, health care, gay rights, and publishing. A year later, the Liberation Front began to publish the newspaper Ain't I a Women , which dealt with lesbian themes, and distributed it nationally. News about the upris- ing spread across the na -tion and resulted in the creation of activist groups for LGBTQ rights. A year after the Stonewall upris-ing, the first Pride Fest was held in Iowa City, along with other cities. In 1970, the Gay Liber - ation Front at the UI be - came the first gay student organization in the U.S. to be officially recognized by a major university. The front had a float in the Homecoming Parade and was recorded in the school 'We're all trying to remember the history. It speaks to the concerns of not just gay, lesbian, and trans people but society's outcasts.' \u2014Christine Hawes, Iowa City Pride community outre publicity chair SEE STONEWALL, 15Katie Goodale/The Daily Iowan Rev.

Though this album was not a large success in its era, it has now found a new appreciation in 2019. The album is a delicious twist of big band jazz and soul, with many styles being found in today's music such as with artist Kamasi Washington. The album will be the perfect soundtrack for the relaxing chill vibes of summer with songs such as \"California Dreamin. \" Other songs such as \"A Change Is Going to Come\" shows a raw and untamed emotion being pounded out throughout the song all the while the electric guitar and horns smoothly fill the resonating screams of Huey. With electronic reverbs from the intro for the song \"Running\" shows that that Baby Huey and his band, The Babysitters, were on the pulse of experimentation with soul and jazz at the time. But the crown jewel of this album is the song \"Hard Times\" where a steady heartbeat of bass and horns courses through the track. Anyone who is a fan of Childish Gambino's \"Awaken, My Love!\" or Kamasi Washington's \"Heaven and most definitely pleasure in this 41-minute funky escape. Song Pick: \"Tempo\" ALBUM PICK \u2014 Austin Y erington13 | DAIL YIOWAN.COM | WEDNESDAY , JUNE 12, 2019BY AUSTIN J. YERINGTON austin-yerington@uiowa.edu With the popularity of board games rising, many businesses host game nights to bring the community together and wel-come newcomers. The setting is a dark and fog- gy forest. You and your com - panions have ventured for a long time on your quest, and finally, you all rally around an imposing, ghoulish opponent. The enemy raises its jagged weapon to strike \u2014 and sud-denly, the unmistakable chime of a marimba starts to play from an iPhone. Your time in the imaginative world of Dungeons & Dragons comes to an end, and everyday people from all walks of life are left sitting around a table with you in a local Iowa City tabletop shop. The tabletop-gaming world has helped create not just fun evenings with friends but also deep relationships that can go beyond the game. Iowa City has seen its fair share of games, with a bustling community of table - top and board gaming. Recently, this form of gam - ing has got an incredible resur- gence in today's society, with the board-game market globally predicted to reach more than $12 billion by 2023, according to Globe Newswire. Yet some are left with the question, why? There are many theories about such a rise in popularity of board gaming occurring re - cently, but Josh Karau points his finger toward media and movies. \"You can attribute it to geek culture being more accepted,\" said Karau, a co-owner of North Liberty's Geek City Games and Comics. \"Shows like 'The Big Bang The- ory' showed places like this as brightly lit things where there are awesome things going on as op - posed to dank, dark basements.\" This new public view of geek culture has helped gained a large amount of pride among the gaming community. With celebrities such as Vin Diesel and Rick and Morty creator Dan Harmon being vocal Dun-geons & Dragons players, it has helped tear away the stereo - types of pocket protectors and bowl haircuts. Another aspect of board gam - ing that may have led it back into pop culture is the way it tries to be more accessible.\"D&D is now the thing, ever since fifth edition went main- stream,\" said Josh Woolums, a co-owner of the Hobby Corner, Iowa City Marketplace. \"It's a lot more streamlined. In previous editions, you had so many op - tions to play with [that] it took forever. The streamlining is where it got more easy.\" With many people who attend gaming nights being newcom - ers, most will return regular - ly and create friendships with their game mates, he said. \"I'm surprised in how much outside time they all have to - gether, too,\" Woolums said. \"They all don't know each other at all at first, then a month later, they are all hanging out doing stuff.\"Board gaming might not seem like the most exciting way to spend an evening in a univer - sity town, but Critical Hit Games co-owner Chance Kirchhof dis-agrees. \"With it being a college town, you don't want it to just be bars and clothing,\" Kirchhof said. \"I like to think we add another di - mension to downtown for some - thing to do.\" People shouldn't feel intimi - dated if they don't know much about gaming, said Michele Maakestad, the Iowa ambas - sador for Double Exposure's board-gaming outreach pro- gram Envoy. Shops such as Crit-ical Hit and the Hobby Corner pride themselves on their teach - ing communities.Double Exposure is a conven - tion company. Maakestad goes around to local shops and con - ventions for Envoy to show off smaller brands of board games. \"We try to build that commu - nity of people who are willing to teach,\" she said. This community tries not to just be one of fun and imagina - tion but also of inclusion and welcoming. With quite a few players who come to each week's gaming nights being first time players from all ages and walks of life, this culture needs to have open arms. \"We want to appeal to all groups,\" Kirchhof said. \"We want to make sure people always feel welcome here and included. We just love to play games.\" Dragon fighting, dice, and Herky With game boards, 20-side dice, and a little bit of magic, Iowa City's tabletop community welcomes all who want to play.

This year's Iowa City Pride Fest will honor the Stonewall uprising by pay - ing tribute to all intersec - tional identities. Hawes said IC Pride has imple- mented a color panel to represent ethnic and gen - der diversity at the festival this year. \"We're all trying to re - member the history,\" Hawes said. \"It speaks to the concerns of not just gay, lesbian, and trans peo - ple but society's outcasts.\" Hawes said Stonewall consisted of marginal- ized people, including the homeless and people of color, which drives home why there seems to be an effort in LGBTQ commu-nities to be inclusive and intersectional. \"I think that the most im- portant thing that we need to work on is the inclusive - ness of everybody's various intersectional identities and take into account the different experiences that everyone has,\" UI student Shayn Walker said. Walker, who majors in gender, women's and sexuality studies, said that since the Stonewall uprising, people have be- come more accepting of members of the LGBTQ community. Although ri - ots don't need to occur for messages to be heard on UI campus, he said, there needs to be less focus on what's been done so far and more emphasis on the inclusion of different identities of people in the LGBTQ community. AJ King, the outgoing UI Trans Alliance president and UI Student Govern-ment LGBTQ constituency senator, said that over - all, he has seen a definite improvement in cultural knowledge, awareness, and sensitivity to transgender populations for students on campus, but he would like to see more training for fac - ulty and staff. There is still a ways to go for the commu - nity, King said. \"It's so imperative to recognize where our roots came from,\" he said. \"Black trans women specifically are statistically more likely to be assaulted, murdered, and have an average lifes- pan of about 30 years with all the systematic violence that comes from being who they are.\"STONEWALL CONTINUED FROM 1116 | DAIL YIOWAN.COM | WEDNESDAY , JUNE 12, 2019 207 N Linn St Iowa City 319.338.1332 Monday-Friday 10am WWW.POPSBBQIA.COM OPEN 10-8 MON-SAT 11-7 SUN 50,000 USED BOOKS NEW TOYS & GAMES RECENT AND ANCIENT MOST SUBJECTS ALL AGES BIG SQUISHY CHAIRS TWO CATS 219 N.

Iowa City is designated by UNES- CO as a World City of Literature. The University of Iowa is home to the first law school west of the Missis-sippi River. Stone for the Old Capitol was fer - ried down the Iowa River on barges. The UI was the first university in the nation to recognize an on-campus LGBTQ organization. Gene Wilder graduated from the UI in 1955 with a B.A. in communica-tion and theater. The Iowa Memorial Union used to house a bowling alley, a soda fountain, and a dry nightclub. The UI was the first college to ad- mit men and women equally. 33,564 students are enrolled at the UI, according to UI Registrar data from fall 2018. The UI boasts more than 40 Pulit- zer Prize-winning alumni and faculty members. The UI is the first university found- ed in the state of Iowa. Iowa City is ranked the fifth-best college town in the U.S. by the Amer - ican Institute for Economic Research. The Iowa Writers' Workshop is na- tionally known. Jewel Limar Prestage became the first black woman to earn a Ph.D. in political science from an American uni- versity when she graduated from the UI in 1954. The UI is one of the EPA's Green Power Partners. There are more than 500 active student organizations at the UI. More than 20 varsity athletic teams call the UI home.Facts to know about the UI, IC Iowa City was founded in 1839, and not even 10 years later the UI was established. Here are some facts students should know. Tom Brokaw, the world-renowned broadcast journalist, attended the UI, but didn't graduate. The Daily Iowan was the first daily college paper west of the Mississippi River. Actor Ashton Kutcher is a former Hawkeye. The first educational television station broadcasted programs from the basement of the Engineering Building. Iowa City became the first U.S. city with a population of more than 10,000 to elect a female mayor when it voted Emma J. Harvat into office in 1923. The median age of Iowa City res- idents is 24.8 years old, including the population of UI students. Former UI presidents have also led museums. President Emeritus Sandy Boyd was president of the Field Museum of Chi-cago, and former President David Skorton is secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. TOP: The Old Capitol is seen on April 15.

(Shivansh Ahuja/The Daily Iowan)The Daily Iowan - HAWKEYE VIEW - Iowa City, Iowa - Wednesday, June 12, 2019 - 5Mollie Tibbetts ' death shocks nation The second day of classes came with the news that the body of UI student Mollie Tibbetts was found. Tibbetts had been missing since July 18, when she disappeared from her home in Brooklyn, Iowa. Cristhian Bahena Rivera, the man charged with her murder, led investiga - tors to her body in a cornfield in Powesh - iek County. A vigil was held on campus that week in Hubbard Park, where stu - dents gathered to honor Tibbetts' memory. Free-speech issues flare on campus The UI lost a court case in February surrounding the removal of Business Leaders in Christ as a registered student group. The UI removed Business Lead - ers in Christ in late 2017 after the orga- nization denied a leadership position to then-sophomore Marcus Miller, saying he did not uphold the group's faith statement because he is gay. The court ruled that the Human Rights Policy at the UI was not applied equally across student groups. Around the same time, the Iowa Legisla - ture passed a bill that addressed freedom of speech on college campuses, including regulations around student groups. Iowa women dominate college hoops The Iowa women's basketball team had a dynamite season this year, finish - ing with a 29-7 record, the best in near -ly 25 years. The team won the Big Ten Tournament in March with a 90-76 win over Maryland. Iowa continued on to an impressive run in the NCAA Tourna - ment, finally falling in the Elite Eight game against Baylor. The powerhouse of the team was undoubtedly Megan Gustafson, who racked up the most ca - reer points for any Hawkeye basketball player, ending the season with 2,781 to - tal points. She received several national awards, including AP Player of the Year. UI brings change to greek community An investigation into greek life con - ducted during the first semester result - ed in four UI fraternities being removed from campus. Kappa Sigma, Delta Chi, Sigma Nu, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon lost their registration as student orga- nizations in December. The fraternities were found in violation of the Fraternity/Sorority Life moratorium that began in May 2017, which bans fraternities from putting on alcohol-related events, and UI alcohol policy. Several fraternities were also placed on probation. Hawkeyes selected in first round of NFL Draft The Hawkeyes made history in April when T.J. Hockenson and Noah Fant were selected in the first round of the NFL Draft. It was the first time two tight ends from the same school were drafted during the first round. Hockenson was selected by the Detroit Lions at No. 8, and Fant went to the Denver Broncos at No. 20. #DoesUIowaLoveMe? A social-media movement began in February with students from historical - ly marginalized groups saying the UI does not do enough to promote diversity and prevent discrimination. Under the hashtag #DoesUIowaLoveMe, students shared stories of discrimination and oth-er challenges they had experienced at the UI, challenging the school to better address their concerns. Modern Piping legal dispute drags on Since 2017, the UI was in a legal dis - pute with contractor Modern Piping over work done on Hancher Auditorium and the Stead Family Children's Hospi - tal. District and state courts affirmed an arbitration panel's award of more than $20 million for work done on the proj-ects. This year, the Iowa Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Modern Piping, backing the 6th District Court's ruling that the UI pay that judgment. In May, after a district-court judge lifted the stay on the execution of the judgment that was put in place pending the appellate court's ruling, the UI had paid Modern Piping in full.Historic cold causes death on campus Another tragedy struck the univer - sity in January when UI student Ger - ald Belz, a Burge resident, died after university police found Belz unrespon - sive outside Halsey Hall early Jan. 30 when windchill temperatures dipped below minus-30 degrees. Later reports confirmed Belz died of hypothermia be-cause of cold exposure. UI Health Care employee's mysterious death unresolved The community was affected by the death of UI Health Care employee Jo - Ellen Browning in April. Browning, 65, died in her home on April 5. Investiga- tors quickly ruled the death a homicide. Browning worked at UI Health Care for 42 years, and was described as a \"loving wife, mother, sister, and friend.\" Election Night brings victory for female candidates in Iowa The November 2018 election was no- tably a victory for women. Kim Reyn - olds became the first elected female governor in Iowa history. Iowa voters elected its first female U.S. Congress - women, Cindy Axne and Abby Finke - nauer. In addition, 44 women were elected to the state Legislature, com - pared to a previous total of 35.6 - The Daily Iowan - HAWKEYE VIEW - Iowa City, Iowa - Wednesday, June 12, 2019 What happened in 2018-19? Wyatt Dlouhy/The Daily Iowan A UI student speaks during a rally for the #DoesUIowaLoveMe movement on the T. Anne Cleary on Feb. 28. Stu - dents, faculty, and community members gathered to share stories about belonging to marginalized groups. The UI community responded to a number of tragedies, celebrated success, and faced changes in the 2018-19 academic year. Katie Goodale/The Daily Iowan Gov.

The division strives to ease transitions and bring awareness to oppor - tunities available. The division serves several communi- ties: African American/Black, Asian/Asian American, persons with disabilities, vet - erans, women, first generation, Hispanic/Latinx, LGBTQ, Native American, and Transgender. It also offers various programs to en - gage these groups. Programs through the center include: Advantage Iowa scholars, Iowa Edge, and TRIO student-support services. Advantage Iowa scholarships are granted to first-year students from his-torically underrepresented populations. There are requirements the scholarship maintains that may be discussed with an adviser. Iowa Edge is a transitional program to ease marginalized populations into the college experience. Participants meet faculty and campus leaders to provide support, build community with peers, and develop leadership skills. TRIO is a federal grant funded pro - gram by the Department of Education. Through individualized coaching and skill development affect 350 students who demonstrate academic need along - side identifying as first-generation, low-income, or have a verified disabil- ity. The students receive support in re - tention to graduation.

Student Wellness Student Wellness, while no longer a part of Student Health, is still located in the same place, along with a sec - ondary location in the Campus Recre - ation and Wellness Center. The new department offers ser - vices for students in the areas of fit - ness, nutrition, stress management, alcohol, drugs, tobacco and e-cig - arettes, sexual health, and sleep. Some specific programs include a 5K/10K training program, intui - tive eating workshops, and Refresh, which teaches students about get - ting a restful night of sleep. University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics UI Hospitals & Clinics started out on the East Side of the Iowa River in 1873. More services were added over the years, such as the children's hospi - tal and the psychopathic hospital in the early 1900s. The hospital moved into a new facility on the west side of the riv-er in 1928, and still stands there today. UIHC's main facility, located at 200 Hawkins Drive, is Iowa's only com - prehensive academic medical-care center. The 811-bed hospital is ran by 13,000 employees, students, and vol - unteers on any given day. Many other clinics and facilities care for patients in addition to the main facility. UI Stead Family Children's Hospital The UI Stead Family Children's Hospital, the only comprehensive children's hospital in the state, opened in 2017. The 190-bed hospi - tal served 77,068 patients last year, coming from every county in Iowa, nearly every state, and several coun - tries. High on the 12th floor, pediatric patients and their families can see the ideal view of Kinnick Stadium ev-ery home football game through the Rooftop Press Box, both settings of the iconic Hawkeye Wave, a tradition that has gained national attention. Carver College of Medicine On 375 Newton Road, the Carver Col- lege of Medicine stands as one of the nation's top medical schools, and works closely with UIHC to provide patients with the best theoretical knowledge and clinical care possible. Many special - ized centers are housed in the college, including the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Iowa Neuroscience Institute, and the Carver Family Center for Macular Degeneration. UI QuickCare UI QuickCare is available to stu- dents in need of non-emergency-based care. Located in the Old Capitol Town Center on 201 S. Clinton St., students can receive care without setting up an appointment. Conditions treated at Quick Care include respiratory illness-es, minor ear, eye, and skin conditions, minor injuries, bladder infections, sex - ually transmitted disease, vomiting, and diarrhea.

Before Harreld was select - ed, the UI chapter of the American Association of University Professors conducted a survey revealing that only 1.8 percent of faculty and 2.6 percent of other respondents consid - ered him qualified for the job. As a former IBM, Kraft Foods, and Boston Market executive, Harreld lacks the experience in higher education many members of the campus community believe is necessary to govern the university. That concern sparked several pro - tests around the time of Harreld's hir - ing, as well as a sanction from the na - tional AAUP to condemn what faculty said was a lack of shared governance in the hiring process. The AAUP voted to lift the sanction in June 2018 after fac-ulty and administrators collaborated to draft a UI presidential-search doc - ument outlining best practices to pro - mote the involvement of shared-gover - nance leaders in the process. The 21st president of the UI, Har - reld has spent the last three years de-veloping and implementing a strate- gic plan according to key institutional priorities: research and discovery, student success, and engagement.

Because Iowa City has cemented itself as a liter - ary city full of writers and think - ers, there is certainly no shortage caffeinated hotspots \u2014 whether you are studying, catching up with friends, or pumping out a nine-page research paper, there is a macchiato with your name on it. Prairie Lights, for example, fea- tures a quaint coffee shop, called the Times Club, among its pletho - ra of novels and notebooks \u2014 with an ever-rotating array of drinks, the lesser-known spot is a favorite of English professors, writers, and those looking to escape the chaos of some other well-known chains. Fa - vorites, such as the ubiquitous Star - bucks and Iowa City landmark Java House, which also has a location in the Iowa Memorial Union, offer a quick pick-me-up as opposed to a place to park yourself for hours at a time, although Java's downtown lo-cation does offer ample seating. Both Prairie Lights and Java House offer classic cups, such as Chai lattes and cappuccinos, and also feature signa - ture drinks \u2014 Java's sugar-cookie latte is the perfect marriage of the sweetness of the dessert and buzz of the caffeine. Newer ventures, such as Poindex - ter (which is attached to the Grad-uate Hotel), may be fresh in town but are equally enjoyable to explore. Regardless of your \"spot,\" Iowa City surely has beans to die for. Plus, who doesn't need an afternoon jolt of energy? Another newer coffee shop in town is Cortado, which opened in Janu-ary 2017. Alongside espresso drinks and drip coffee, Cortado also serves Mediterranean-inspired sandwich- es, salads and soups as well as fresh pasteries.No sleep?

This shop is also right next door to Record Collector, Iowa City's one-stop-shop for vinyl (and even cassette tapes.) Artifacts: With everything from midcentury modern furniture to an- tique children's' toys, Artifacts has everything you could imagine ... and then some. The store certainly lives up to its tagline of \"no boring stuff al - lowed.\" Whether you are looking for old post cards to fill the walls of your dorm room or a quirky accoutrement to adorn your desk, the store's con-stantly replenished stock of unique items will certainly warrant a second (and third) trip back. Ragstock: When Halloween rolls around, students often scramble to find the pieces of their costumes. But with Ragstock right next door to Java House in the heart of the city, your cos-tume will assemble itself right in front of your eyes. When it's not a \"spooky\" time of year, the store is known for a wide variety of pre-owned and vintage clothing. Raygun: Ubiquitous in Iowa for its array of quirky, sardonic, and political - ly charged T-shirts, Raygun is a main - stay in the Hawkeye State. In addition to special-edition shirts that chronicle events and political movements, the store also sells coffee mugs, magnets, and post cards. Prairie Lights: In addition to a quant coffee shop, Prairie Lights, which President Obama visited on his trips to the university, regularly makes the top of the \"best bookstores in the country\" list. Iowa City's reputation as a true writers' city is truly shown by the breadth of written works available at the storied location \u2014 prose , poetry, cookbooks \u2014 you name it \u2014 line the shelves of the warm and inviting book emporium.

Through - out Iowa City, a myriad of resturants \u2014 with a plethora of culinary options \u2014 will assist you in vanquishing even the most vicious hunger. Basta, for example, offers deceptive- ly simple Italian dishes. The restau - rant's name, which comes from an Italian phrase that means \"enough,\" is the perfect place for a date-night, parents' weekend, or a relaxed eve - ning with close friends. After all: is there anything better for unwinding from a long week than an oven-fired pizza and laughs with friends? A new, but highly rated spot, St. Burch, is split into two levels: a dining room (the \"tavern\") and a basement (the \"den\"), which offer a variety of appe -tizers, entrees, and libations. Then, of course, are the Iowa City favorites \u2014 Pancheros ever-pres - ent burrito (and famous late hours,) Mesa's zany pizza slices, and Melk's cereal milkshakes all come to mind. Other must-visits, such as the soups, salads, and sandwiches of Nodo and Dumpling Darling's vegan and vege-tarian bites, perpetually experience a crowd of satisfied foodies. Breakfast is also something Iowa City doesn't take lightly. Both Ham-burg Inn, which is visited by presiden - tial hopefuls during caucus season, and Bluebird Diner offer the perfect atmosphere for a date or long-await - ed breakfast with old friends. Regardless of your culinary tastes, however, a five-minute (or less) walk through Iowa City will yield countless options for your rumbling stomach.Where to eat in Iowa City Emily Wangen/The Daily Iowan Slices of pizza are seen on display at Mesa on May 13.

The Old Capitol the only National Historic Landmark in Iowa City; it used to be the Capitol of the territory, then the state of Iowa. Today, it's a museum for the humanities with a number of exhibits dedicated to art and state his - tory. You can go to a reception or event in one of the rotundas on the first or second floor, see a lecture, or visit the Hanson and Keys Humanities Galler - ies. The Old Capitol is rich in its histo - ry as well, and you can visit the Senate Chamber, where the UI was founded, or the Supreme Court Chamber. The north point of the Pentacrest is Macbride Hall, home of the Museum of Natural History. There, you can see the history of Iowa hundreds of millions of years before it was Iowa, from its time underwater 380 million years ago to the Ice Ages to the present. Visitors can al - so look at intricate exhibits of different ecosystems and biospheres from Iowa and beyond and meet the museum's mascot, Rusty the Giant Sloth. The Nat-ural History Museum has been around since 1858 and was rebuilt in the early 20th century as Macbride Hall. On occasions such as Parents Week - end, the number of activities in both museums opens up for more arts and crafts for younger visitors. Both museums are open six days a week from Tuesday to Sunday and closed for the holidays. History at the heart of campus The University of Iowa Natural History and Old Capitol Museums bring 500-million years of Hawkeye state history to stu- dents and community members alike with two museums located on the Pentacrest. FAST FACTS The architect who designed the Old Capitol also designed the Illinois State Capitol in Springfield. The Old Capitol served as the Iowa Capitol from 1846 to 1857. Before becoming a museum, the Old Capitol served as a seat of the territorial and state gov - ernments, a university building, and administrative offices. Opening in 1858, the Natural History Museum is the second oldest museum in the United States located west of the Mississippi River. The Natural History Museum has six permanent exhibits and is home to more than 1,000 species of birds and mammals from around the world. Macbride Hall, which houses the museum along with vari- ous University of Iowa depart - ments was completed in 1908 and cost $313,872 to construct.

Some ex - amples are Hillel, Muslim Students Association, Salt Company, Imam Mahdi Organization, Tau Omega Catholic Service Fraternity, among many more. At the beginning of each semester, there is a student-orga - nization fair in which students can mingle with members and hear brief descriptions about what each group is about. Areas of study Students seeking to emphasize their religious or spiritual knowl - edge through study may look into the UI Religious Studies Department and the UI Philosophy Department. There are courses in each depart - ment that offer students a closer look at an aspect of interest in a religion of choice.

The first fraternity on campus was Beta Theta Pi, and Kap - pa Kappa Gamma, the first women's chapter, was established 15 years later. Nearly 16 percent of the students at the UI are involved in greek life, which includes four different councils. The UI has 27 registered fraternities and 23 registered sororities. Panhellenic Council Panhellenic Council is made up of 15 chapters. Formal recruitment takes place over two weekends at the begin - ning of the fall semester, where poten-tial new members meet with all of the chapters on campus. Incoming freshmen interested in joining a sorority should register for formal recruitment in the summer, although students can also participate in informal recruitment for eligible chapters in the spring semester. Interfraternity Council The Interfraternity Council is made up of more than 20 fraternities. For stu - dents interested in joining, the fraterni - ty recruitment process is more informal than sorority recruitment, with most fraternities holding their own recruit - ment events for interested members. Multicultural Greek Council The Multicultural Greek Council is made up of greek organizations that represent Asian, LGBTQ, and Latinx identities. Students interested in join-ing a multicultural organization can attend the annual \"Meet the Greeks\" event, hosted in conjunction with the National Pan-Hellenic council. National Pan-Hellenic Council The National Pan-Hellenic council is made up of the six historically Afri - can-American sororities at the UI. The council hosts an annual Step Show and philanthropic events. Interested stu - dents can connect with the sororities at the \"Meet the Greeks\" event. Recruitment Students can find more information at fsl.uiowa.edu. Recruitment gener - ally begins at the beginning of the fall semester. Going greek with UI fraternities and sororities Fraternities and sororities have a long history at the UI. Students interested in the greek community have plenty organizations to choose from.

The comedy committee brings top-act comedians from all over the country to the UI, and the films committee shows newly released films at the IMU. There is also a traditions committee focused on preserving and creating traditions, a Night Hawks commit - tee focused on nightly activities, and a special-events committee that is in charge of large scale events, such as Welcome Week. The cultural committee puts on events representing different cultures around the world, and the variety com - mittee is in charge of hosting weekend trips and weekly Thursday activities of all types. The novelty committee, the most re - cent addition to CAB, hosts events two to three times per month, including trivia night. There are also committees for marketing and public relations for students seeking to promote CAB be - hind the scenes. SCOPE provides UI students with the opportunity to learn more about the music industry by offering quali-ty concerts and entertainment to the university and Iowa City communities. SCOPE is also responsible for plan - ning the UI Homecoming shows each year. It has hosted such musicians as Bil - lie Eilish, Lizzo, and Car Seat Head-rest in the past and features big names in the music industry every year. Each fall semester, SCOPE looks for student genuinely interested in the music in - dustry to join the organization, located in the IMU.Keeping Hawkeyes entertained UI Campus Activities Board and SCOPE are two student groups that work to bring comedians, activities, and music to campus for Hawkeyes to enjoy.

KRUI operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, broadcasting news, sports, and mu- sic for the Iowa City community. Students can join without previous experience as on-the-job training is provided. KRUI has nine depart - ments: on-air staff, music, online content, marketing, sports, news un - derwriting, production, operations, and IT. The University of Iowa has pro - grams for everyone on campus, pro - viding many different opportunities for involvement. One of these many programs is ROTC, which gives stu-dents the opportunity to gain the skills for graduation while simulta - neously gaining the skills to become an officer in the Army if they choose. Reserve Officer Training Corps, known as ROTC, is composed of a set of electives that students may take to gain knowledge on the history of the Army, leadership and manage-ment skills, and military instruction. Many of these skills are applica - ble to any field that students pur - sue, so there are no majors that ROTC would not benefit. With only one elective class per semester, the ROTC program does not interfere with students' field of study. While ROTC programs reward students with greater skill develop - ment as well as opportunities after college, students may also be re- warded with additional scholarship opportunities. ROTC offers many scholarships for students involved in the program, typically based on merit. While the amount of money awarded in scholarships may vary, scholarship winners are an \"allow - ance\" of up to $1,500 per year. While many students are interest - ed in the ROTC for career benefits, skills development, and scholarship opportunities as a bonus, many ask whether it requires military obliga-tion. ROTC does not require a mil-itary obligation the first two years of involvement and do not have a service obligation after college un - less the student chooses to enroll as an Army officer. This allows students the option to choose their path later while gaining additional leadership and managerial skills in college. If students are interested in ROTC or have additional questions, they may contact the UI Department of Military Science. There are many options for involvement on campus, and ROTC is an opportunity to ben- efit students for their college careers as well as their futures. For students interested in the Army, ROTC serves as a resource for education and training.

Presi - dential candidates flood the state, hopping from city to city on the campaign trail. Needless to say, University of Iowa students are politically active. The UI is home to three political organizations that are associated with major political parties: the University Democrats, the College Republicans, and the Young Democratic Socialists at Iowa. The organizations meet several times a semester, usually on a weekly basis. The political groups here give students the opportunity to be come active citizens. Though the organizations are associated with political parties, people from different political backgrounds are invited to join in the name of education. The University Democrats are dedicated to ensuring the vic - tories of Democratic candidates in Iowa and beyond. On campus, the group helps to organize candidate visits, voter-registration events, fundraisers, and educational oppor - tunities. The College Republicans is a student organization devoted to spreading Republican ideas across campus. The group works to further the party's agenda and promote student leadership. The Young Democratic Socialists at Iowa strives to promote racial, gender, eco - nomic, and environmental equity on campus. The organization hosts educational events, voter-registration events, book clubs, and candidate visits.

The UI has residence halls locat- ed on the East Side, near the heart of campus except for one), and on the West Side near the UI Hospitals & Clinics. Most first-year students opt to live in the residence halls, though they are open to returning students and transfer students as well. Currier, Stanley, Burge, Daum, Catlett, and Mayflower are located on the East Side. Hillcrest, Peters - en, Slater, and Rienow are located on the West Side.

On-campus living isn't for every - one. For students wishing to get out of the residence halls, off-campus liv-ing is available. Starting the apart-ment search early is recommended. Though the housing market is lim- ited in Iowa City, students can find just what they are looking for if they allot plenty of time to search. For students planning on living with roommates who don't have any yet, social-media sites such as Face-book and Reddit are perfect places to start. Often, apartment compa- nies also have roommate searches on their websites. The next step is the search. It is generally more expensive to live closer to campus, but often the con - venience seems invaluable. Howev-er, the farther away from campus the apartment is, the cheaper it is likely to be, and it might offer more amenities. The University of Iowa offers an off-campus housing search on which students can view listings of apartments and houses through-out the city.

The REACH program at the UI, which stands for Recognizing Edu - cation and Career Hopes, provides student with disabilities a transition certificate program. Students with autism, Down syn- drome, intellectual disabilities, or learning disabilities are encouraged through the REACH curriculum to become independent members of their communities. REACH combines academic enrich - ment, career development, student life, and transitional elements to pro - vide students with a Big Ten college experience. The two- to three-year REACH pro - gram provides inclusive classroom experiences, extensive scholarship support, employment preparation, and internships in the local commu - nity. Alums of UI REACH have gone on to work for organizations such as the Chicago Cubs, Sukup Manufacturing, and Arrow Electronics. The national employment rate for individuals with disabilities is just 20 percent. Since the program's in - ception in 2008, more than 80 percent of UI REACH students are employed. Support for REACH students doesn't end at graduation. EXTEND is a network of REACH alumni that hosts monthly and yearly social events for families and graduates.

For students looking for the opportunity to showcase their athlet-ic abilities, intramural sports are the perfect des-tination. Intramural sports pro - vide the chance for UI students who are not in - volved in college athletics to get out on the playing fields or courts. From flag football and 3-on-3 basketball to inner tube water polo and ca - noe battleship, there are activities to fit the inter - ests of many. Intramural options are available in both the fall and spring semesters. To get involved, students simply need to purchase an Intramural Sports Membership, which can be done on the Recre-ational Services website. Memberships are avail- able for $25 each semes - ter or $45 for a yearlong membership. Purchasing a membership gives stu - dents access to all of the intramural sports offered that semester. A membership is rec - ommended for students planning to play in more than one sport, play in a league sport, or partici- pate in a multi-day tour - nament. Single-play passes are also available for certain activities for $10, with an option available to upgrade to a full mem - bership at the end of that day. Valid UI IDs are nec- essary to compete in any given sport. They will be checked prior to the be - ginning of events.A quick guide to UI Intramurals The University of Iowa offers several intramural sports during both the fall and spring semesters. Campus Recreation & Wellness Center Located in proximity to the Main Li - brary, the Campus Recreation & Well - ness Center is undoubtedly the biggest fitness center on campus. It has basketball courts, a lazy river, a pool, a climbing-rock station, sauna and steam rooms, training rooms as well as a three-level gym from dumbbells to cardio machines for all fitness needs. Because of all the great amenities the center provides, it's no surprise that it can get a bit busy, especially during the mid-afternoon and weekdays. The spot is probably best for a great workout for any muscle type during the mornings or late evenings. Field House Located near Petersen, Rienow, and Slater, the Field House is the perfect fit -ness center for people who live on the West Side. It has a nice workout room with numerous bench racks and dumb-bells Additionally, it is the place to go for basketball and badminton. It has more than 12 basketball courts for all indoor sports needs. Fitness East A more basic fitness center across the street from the IMU, Fitness East is the perfect low-key spot for anyone looking to get a quick workout without waiting. Never is there a time when this fit - ness center is overly packed, allowing people to get in and out during just about any time of day. However, the only downfall is that is closes at 7 p.m. Campus Rec shutters at midnight and the Field House at 10:30 p.m.Best spots to work out on campusKatie Goodale/The Daily Iowan Students participate in flag football in the Hawkeye Tennis and Recreation Complex on April 24.

Coming off a 14-19 campaign in 2017-18, Iowa knew it had to fix its once-atrocious defense and find offensive consistency. It did just that. The Hawkeyes churned out a 23-12 record, fin- ishing sixth in the regular-season Big Ten standings and spending a good chunk of the season in the top- 25, and even went dancing in Columbus, Ohio. There, Iowa bested Cincinnati in the round of 64 before falling in overtime to Tennessee, 83-77 \u2014 just one victory short of a Sweet 16 berth. Iowa's core of Jordan Bohannon, Joe Wieskamp, and Luka Garza will return, as well as the majority of the Hawkeye bench rotation. Tyler Cook announced he would leave the program and test his luck in the NBA Draft. He has been one of the conference's top forwards during his three years with the program. Nicholas Baer's five-year Hawkeye career has come to an end, and he will definitely be missed. He finished his tenure as the on- ly Hawkeye in program history to have more than 750 points, 500 rebounds, 100 blocks, 100 assists, 100 steals, and 100 3-pointers in a career. It'll be interesting to see what Iowa's rotation looks like next season, but head coach Fran McCaffery might have one of his deepest squads yet. Not only do the Hawkeyes get Cordell Pemsl and Jack Nunge back from redshirt seasons, but C.J. Fredrick will see his first action on the court after doing the same. Meanwhile, incoming freshmen Patrick McCaffery and Joe Toussaint enter the program. McCaffery (listed as ESPN's 60th- best prospect in the nation) adds another scoring dimension along the wing, and Toussaint (four-star point guard) boasts a slashing, facilitating game.The Hawkeye women's basketball team had one of its best seasons in program history in the 2018-19 season. Iowa went further than it has ever gone in head coach Lisa Bluder's tenure, winning a Sweet 16 matchup against North Carolina State to make an Elite Eight appearance. Both Bluder and star player Megan Gustafson earned the Naismith Coach and Player of the Year tro-phies, and Gustafson earned several other Player of the Year awards as well. While Iowa will lose Gustafson \u2014 the best player in program history \u2014 along with Tania Davis and Han-nah Stewart, the Hawkeyes should see more mean-ingful action from a few of last year's juniors. Kathleen Doyle and Makenzie Meyer will play big roles. Both showed significant growth from their soph-omore seasons, and without Gustafson taking the main portion of points, both should see some significant in-creases in production. Filling out the three spots of the Hawkeye seniors will be the difficult part. Monika Czinano saw some solid playing time as a freshman and will be the prime contender to take over Gustafson's post spot. Senior Amanda Ollinger might vie for Stewart's empty spot, and redshirt freshman Kate Martin, who missed all of last season with a torn ACL, could be a top competitor for Davis' open position. Next season probably won't end in the thrilling fashion Iowa's last one did, but Bluder always seems to get the best out of her team no matter the talent level, and this upcoming season should be no different.Women turn to life after Gustafson The Daily Iowan - HAWKEYE VIEW - Iowa City, Iowa - Wednesday, June 12, 2019 - 95 Take $100 off your Slumberland purchase of $599 or more.

Iowa football finished 9-4, cranking out its fourth season in a row with at least 8 victories. Iowa capped the season with a 27-22 win over No. 18 Mississippi State in the 2019 Outback Bowl, and it also had wins over rivals Iowa State, Minnesota, and Ne - braska during the regular season. The Hawkeye defense allowed just 17.8 points per game (11th in the country) and on the offen-sive side, it scored 36 or more points on five occasions, includ - ing a season-high 63 in a shutout win over Illinois.Quarterback Nate Stanley had a breakout season, throwing for 2,852 yards and 26 touchdowns. Defensively, Iowa's Amani Hook - er earned the Tatum-Woodson Award, given to the Big Ten's best defensive back. Stanley and running back Me - khi Sargent head the offensive playmakers returning, and of-fensive linemen Tristan Wirfs and Alaric Jackson will hold the two tackle positions. On the oth - er side of the ball, defensive end A.J. Epenesa is arguably the con - ference's best lineman.Losing both tight ends in No - ah Fant and T.J. Hockenson will hurt, but Iowa boasts a reliable history of plugging in and play - ing guys at the position. Hooker, Anthony Nelson, Nick Easley, Matt Nelson, Ross Reynolds, and Keegan Render will all leave siz - able holes to fill as well. Iowa's regular-season sched- ule is tougher this season. The Hawkeyes make trips to Iowa State, Michigan, Northwestern, Wisconsin, and Nebraska while hosting Penn State, Minnesota, Rutgers, Purdue, and Illinois.

The men's team took the champion - ship medal at five meets last season, as well as a share of the regular-season Big Ten title and a Coaching Staff of the Year honor. Highlights from the season include eight athletes advancing to the final round of the NCAA Championships, three earning All-American honors, and two in the final round of the Win - ter Cup Challenge. Individually, Andrew Herrador took second place on the high bar, and Stew - art Brown took third place on vault at the Big Ten Championships. Evan Davis scored Big Ten Freshman of the Week after his performance at the Win -ter Cup. The women's team finished its in- tense season with a fourth place se-cured at the NCAA regional. Before doing that, the team finished sixth at the Big Ten Championships and took numerous individual honors. Senior Nicole Chow and junior Char - lotte Sullivan were named to the 2019 Big Ten Women's Gymnasts to Watch list. The GymHawks also topped 196 points throughout the majority of the season. Notable departures include Gym - Hawks Chow and Misty-Jade Carl - son and Jake Brodarzon on the men's squad. Bennet Huang, Herrador, and Davis will return next season. Jax Kranitz, Clair Kaji, Lauren Guerin, and Alex Greenwald will return for the women.The Iowa wrestling team went 14-1 during the regu - lar-season dual meets, unde - feated in the Big Ten, with its only loss coming at the hands Oklahoma State in Stillwater. The Hawkeyes finished third at the Big Ten Cham - pionships, crowning a lone champion in 165-pounder Alex Marinelli. He went un - defeated the whole season up until the NCAAs, where he placed seventh. At the national tourna- ment, Iowa placed fourth, and Spencer Lee successful- ly defended his 125-pound title. Lee went 23-3 and placed second at both the Midlands and Big Ten Championships, falling to Sebastian Rivera in both of those finals before bouncing back in the season's biggest tournament. Another Hawkeye to watch will be Austin De-Santo. In his first year as a Hawkeye, he earned the 133-pound Midlands title, placed fifth at NCAAs, and notched numerous upset victories throughout the season. Mitch Bowman and Sam Stoll are the only Hawkeyes in last season's starting lineup who will not ap-pear in 2019-20. Among the eight returners, six were All-Americans: Lee, DeSan-to, Pat Lugo, Kaleb Young, Marinelli, and Jacob War - ner. In addition, All-Ameri - can Michael Kemerer, who had to sit out last season because of an injury, will be back for the 2019-20 season. With seven returning All-Americans and a two-time national champion in the lineup, the Iowa wres - tling squad has the poten - tial to reach great heights next season. Wrestling continues climb to top After going undefeated in its Big Ten duals, Iowa wrestling will attempt to keep improving on the national level.

There's a lot of growing excitement in the volleyball program. Head coach Bond Shymansky has built the team to its strongest point since the 1990s, lead - ing Iowa to some of its best finishes in the 21st century. Building on the excite-ment Shymansky has constructed, the Athletics Department is in the midst of building a new $190 million home for Iowa volleyball, which is set to open in 2020. But for now, the focus is on this sea - son. It looked as though the team was about to break the postseason streak after it took down No. 10 Wisconsin at home on Oct. 6, 2018, but a flurry of injuries made for an agonizing crawl to the end of the season. It doesn't help that the team lost some of its highest producers to grad - uation last season; hitter Taylor Louis and Molly Kelly \u2014 both of whom paced the conference in various stats - have departed the team. But there are some bright spots that could help the program reach a postsea - son berth. Despite injuries, now-senior Cali Hoye proved to be a dominant hitter on the court. The middle section of the net was young for the team last sea - son, with freshmen Hannah Clayton and Amiya Jones starting. Youth is turning into experience for the block - ers and several hitting positions, so this could be the year the team gets it done. Iowa soccer posted an av- erage season in 2018, going 8-7-3, but it could be in for a big year in 2019. The Hawkeyes return six of their top seven scorers from last season, including Natalie Winters and Devin Burns. Winters led the team with 5 goals in 2018, adding 3 as- sists to that total, which was also tied for the team lead. Burns will also play a big role moving forward. She led the team with 9 goals in 5 assists in 2017, but in - juries forced her to miss a good chunk of the 2018 sea - son. Burns only played in 13 games with six starts last season. Still, she managed to net 2 goals and an assist in her limited playing time. Kaleigh Haus \u2014 who scored 4 goals last season \u2014 returns as well, but the losses of forward Rose Rips - linger and defender Morgan Kemrling won't help. Iowa found plenty of suc - cess playing at the Iowa Soc - cer Complex, sporting a 7-0-3 record in games at home, but it will need to improve its performance on the road. In games away from Iowa City, the Hawkeyes went 1-7. Iowa opened its schedule with a 4-0-1 record, show-casing what it can do early in the season. It did some - thing similar in the spring as well. Loaded with talent in its spring schedule, Iowa went 7-0, showing what it is ca - pable of. The potential for success is there. Hawkeye head coach Dave DiIanni and Company could be in for a big season in 2019. Multiple Hawkeye scorers are set to return, which will help them improve on what turned out to be a decent 2018 campaign.

Volleyball sets sights on NCAA success The Hawkeyes have struggled when it comes to making the postseason, but they're looking to change that in 2019. David Harmantas/The Daily Iowan Iowa's Cali Hoye tries to spike the ball during a volleyball match against Wisconsin on Oct. 6, 2018. The Daily Iowan - HAWKEYE VIEW - Iowa City, Iowa - Wednesday, June 12, 2019 - 101 102 - The Daily Iowan - HAWKEYE VIEW - Iowa City, Iowa - Wednesday, June 12, 2019 Plenty of questions sur - rounded the Iowa base - ball squad entering the 2019 season. After all, it had lost its two best hit- ters, best starting pitcher, and best reliever from the season before. But with head coach Rick Heller at the helm, the Hawkeyes never strayed far from the top of the conference stand - ings. Southeastern Commu - nity College transfer Aus-tin Martin stepped up in an important way in his first year with the Black and Gold, and fellow newcomer Izaya Fullard posted some impressive numbers as well. Despite an injury to Saturday starting pitch - er Jack Dreyer, which sidelined him for the majority of the season, Iowa's weekend rotation of Cole McDonald, Cam Baumann, and Grant Judkins answered the questions entering the season. The Hawkeyes played their best baseball of the season when they got into the thick of the Big Ten schedule. After being swept by Indiana to open the conference slate, Iowa ripped off six-consecutive Big Ten series victories. The Hawkeyes will lose McDonald on the mound, as well as middle infield - ers Mitchell Boe and Tanner Wetrich. Chris Whelan, who has been one of Iowa's key leaders in recent years, will also graduate. While the senior loss - es will certainly leave a void, especially in the field, the Hawkeyes' new core should set them up for future success. High hopes for Hellerball next season After posting its sixth 30-win season in a row, Iowa baseball will focus on increasing that mark. Under the tutelage of coach Gayle Blevins, Hawkeye softball was nearly unbeatable in the late-1990s and early 2000s. After her retirement, Iowa suffered some turbulent seasons with under - whelming records. But last season, Iowa native Renee Gillispie took the helm of Iowa softball and rearmed the program with newly found enthusiasm last year. Only two seniors had spots on last season's roster, and some of the team's best talent will return to Pearl Field in the coming season, so more wins can be expected. Now a senior, pitcher Allison Doo - cy will continue to be one of the most commanding arms in the Big Ten. The right-hander had a coming-out party in her sophomore season, recording the fourth-lowest ERA in the conference. Along with that, she recorded some of the most innings pitched in the confer - ence in her junior season, proving her competence and dominance in the cir - cle. Rounding out the lineup card for Gillispie last season was transfer DoniRae Mayhew, who transferred from Kirkwood and started her Di-vision-1 career as a junior at Iowa. The now-senior led the team in several hitting categories for much of the season, showing prowess at the plate with both consistency and power. The road to a rebuilt program is a long one for Gillispie and her squad, but last season was a big steppingstone in the right direc - tion. This coming season, fans can expect more wins and excitement at Pearl Field.Iowa softball ready to bounce backMichael Guhin/The Daily Iowan Iowa catcher Austin Martin swings at a ball at a game between Iowa and Illinois at Duane Banks Field on March 29.

Iowa cross-country has made huge strides over the past couple of years. Both the men's and women's squads had their best finishes to the season in years. The men's team finished in sixth place at the 2018 Big Ten meet, its best finish since 2009. The women also had success at Big Tens, coming in ninth in the 6,000 meters, their highest finish since 2011. Some of the catalysts behind that success will be lost to graduation heading into next season, which will be tough for the Hawkeyes. Daniel Soto will be a key loss for the men's squad. He led the team in the first three races of the 2018 sea -son and finished strong with a ca - reer-best in the 8,000 meters at the Big Ten meet. Andrea Shine led the women in the 6,000 meters in her senior season, placing 15th overall at the Big Ten Championships. Despite losing some of its key per - formers who have paced the program for a long time, Iowa cross-country should still be in a position to suc - ceed heading into the 2019 season, with Mylenek leading the way. He finished 11th in the 8,000 me- ters at Big Ten Championships, earn-ing All-Big Ten honors. He then fin - ished third at the NCAA regional and became the first Hawkeye to advance to the NCAA finals since 2011. In 2019, Mylenek will want to im- prove on his already impressive ca - reer and finish even higher.Hawkeyes running into the new season Katie Goodale/The Daily Iowan Junior Nathan Mylenek runs in the middle of the pack during the Hawkeye Invitational at Ashton Cross Country course on Aug. 31, 2018. Mylenek will lead the cross-country pack in 2019. Iowa track and field will attempt to continue to build off its past suc - cess after an impressive 2018-19 season. The 2018-19 track and field sea - son was one to remember for Iowa. The indoor campaign ended with the men's and women's squads com - bining for 14 All-American honors and 11 Big Ten titles. The highlight of the outdoor sea - son was the Big Ten Outdoor Cham - pionships, which was hosted by the Hawkeyes at the Cretzmeyer track. Heading into next season, Iowa will lose a few key contributors to graduation but will maintain a very talented group at the same time. Mar'Yea Harris and Brianna Guillory were some of the most ac - complished sprinters in program history in their time here. Their Hawkeye careers ended at the con-clusion of the 2019 season. Leading Iowa into the new sea - son will be Laulauga Tausaga, an All-American thrower who is among the best in the country. Coming off a season in which she broke school records in all three women's throwing events and was named Regional Field Athlete of the Year, Tausaga will try to keep adding to her illustrious Hawkeye r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in her senior season. Also returning for the Hawkeyes will be Jaylan McConico and Jenny Kimbro, both of whom became Big Ten champions in the indoor 60-me - ter hurdles. With plenty of talent returning, Iowa boasts plenty of potential heading into the new season.

The three standouts were Matthew Walker, Alex Schaake, and Benton Wein - berg. All three of their best performances came in the Hawkeye Invitational in which Walker and Schaake tied as champions with overall scores of 14-under. Weinberg finished tied for third at 10-under. Schaake was by far the most impressive golfer, finishing with two other top-five finishes in addition to the Hawkeye Invi-tational. He will be back next season for what will likely be another solid campaign. Walker, however, will graduate. He also had several top-10 finishes this past season, and he will hang up his clubs af - ter an incredibly consistent Hawkeye career. Sophomore Joe Kim will try to make big -ger contributions to next season's team as will Weinberg, who will be a senior along with Schaake. The women had to start last season after losing one of their premier golfers in Jes - sica Ip. The Hawkeyes started off slowly but reached their high point at the Diane Thom - ason Invitational \u2014 they came out on top. Shawn Rennegarbe won a share of the individual title (5-over), and Manuela Liz - arazu and Kristin Glesne finished third and fourth. The future is bright for the Hawkeye women \u2014 they will return Stephanie Her - zog, Sophie Liu, Sarah Overton, and Liz - arazu, all of whom played significant roles last season. Iowa, however, will miss the leadership of Rennegarbe, who will graduate after two extremely productive years with the team.The Iowa rowing team faced numerous weath-er problems last season, ranging from canceled events to not being able to be in the boathouse from September to mid-April. Nonetheless, the team had some success, most of it coming from the 1 Varsity 8 boat. The boat comprises Contessa Harold, Hunt - er Koenigsfeld, Hannah Greenlee, Eve Stewart, Naomi Visser, Katie Elena Waiglein, Paige Schlapkohl, and cox- swain Logan Jones. The latter two \u2014 Schlaokohl and Jones \u2014 were the se - niors of the crew. But the Hawkeyes will still have two All-Americans \u2014 Har - old and Koenigsfeld \u2014 to lead the boat to victory. These two, along with Greenlee, have been in-vited to the U23 national team camp, where they will try to snag a spot on the national team and compete in the 2019 World Rowing Under 23 Championships. As the team uses the knowledge of its experi - enced and talented rowers, it will also hope for im - provement among the new - comers. The Iowa rowing squad has found ways to uti - lize homegrown athletes despite the state's high schools not offering rowing. The Hawkeyes also boast plenty of international tal-ent, however, with eight athletes coming from coun - tries outsude of the United States. After a solid performance all season, the Hawkeyes will try to improve at the Big Ten Championships in 2020. Iowa rowing the boat nationally The Hawkeyes \u2014 especially their 1 Varsity 8 boat \u2014 have become a squad to watch in the conference.

The Daily Iowan - HAWKEYE VIEW - Iowa City, Iowa - Wednesday, June 12, 2019 - 107 Iowa field hockey set to score big108 - The Daily Iowan - HAWKEYE VIEW - Iowa City, Iowa - Wednesday, June 12, 2019 The Iowa women's tennis team conclud- ed its season at 12-11, 4-7 in the Big Ten. The Hawkeyes are set to lose only its lone senior, Adorabol Huckleby. In her final season, she was in and out of the lineup, starting mostly at the lower spots in both singles and doubles. As for the returners, this past years' team was young and inexperienced with five new - comers. Junior Elise van Huevelen Tread - well led the team at Nos. 1 and 2 in singles and doubles all season. However, newcomers Ashleigh Jacobs and Sophie Clark did the most damage. Between Nos. 3 and 4, Jacobs led the team with the best record, going 12- 6, and Clark was right behind her at 11-8. Overall, this season was far from a disap- pointment because the incoming Hawkeyes showed they can be competitive against any team. Their best victory came against Indiana, 4-3, on March 31. As this team progresses, it will be more competitive as its underclassmen gain more experience. The Iowa men's tennis team conclud - ed its season 17-9, 6-5 in the Big Ten. The Hawkeyes secured its third winning season in the last five years, mainly because of its strong 14-2 home record. However, Iowa will lose one of its main contributors in lone senior Jonas Larsen. He concluded his season 9-12 in top-spot singles and 15-8 in top-two doubles play. Freshmen Oliver Okonkwo and Nikita Snezhko contributed a great deal to Iowa's success. Okonkwo put up a 15-6 doubles re - cord with sophomore Will Davies at Nos. 1 and 2 and added an 18-7 record in singles, including a victory over No. 1 Ohio State in singles. Now-senior Kareem Allaf will try to im- prove on his new program-best 14 home victories because the Hawkeyes return five starters from last season and seek to be - come one of the top teams in the Big Ten. Despite losing in its first match of the tour - nament last season, the Iowa field-hockey team qualified for the NCAA tourney for the first time since 2012. The Hawkeyes went 14-7, winning the most games they've won in a season since 2011. Io - wa notched six wins over top-25 opponents, topping No. 14 Wake Forest, No. 25 California, No. 23 Ohio State, No. 21 Stanford, No. 6/7 Penn State, and No. 7 Michigan. The Hawkeyes had suc - cess behind All-Americans Maddy Murphy and Birch. Murphy was Iowa's leading scorer (13), and Birch led the team in as - sists (10). Murphy and Birch played huge roles for the Hawkeyes offensively. Defensively, the Hawkeyes turned to Anthe Lokke Stribos, and Leslie Speight. Speight led the Big Ten in shutouts with seven. In 21 games, only 23 goals were scored on Iowa, giv - ing it the sixth-best goals- against average in the na - tion. Iowa will return nine of 11 starters \u2014 Makenna Grewe and Brown grad-uated. Goalkeeper Grace McGuire \u2014 who was Iowa's original starting keeper last season \u2014 did not play be - cause of an injury, but she will be back next season. The squad placed second at the Big Ten Tourna-ment, becoming the first ever No. 6 seed to advance to the championship game. The Hawkeyes will try to top the conference this coming season with their returning talent. With their young talent continually gaining experience, the Hawkeyes want to make a move in the Big Ten.

Every Saturday in the fall, the stands will be packed with around 69,000 fans anxiously awaiting \"Back in Black\" to come on the PA system. Kinnick served as a relatively safe space for the Iowa football squad last season. The Hawkeyes posted a 5-2 re-cord in the friendly confines of Kinn - ick, compared with a 3-2 record on the road. The stadium is also home to one of the best traditions in college foot - ball: the Kinnick Wave. Fans, players, coaches, and referees turn around at the end of the first quarter of each game to wave to the children in the UI Stead Family Children's Hospital, whose top floors overlook the stadium. In addition to the relatively new tradition, Kinnick has become a diffi - cult place for ranked teams to come in and escape with a win. The Hawkeyes are 4-1 against top-five opponents since 2008, with two of those victories occurring in the past three seasons. Kinnick will look different in 2019 as well. As part of the north end zone renovation, it will have a new con-course, Jumbotron, restrooms, conces - sion stands, and premium seats. Iowa will face Miami (Ohio), Rut - gers, Middle Tennessee State, Penn State, Purdue, Minnesota, and Illi - nois at home as it tries to keep its hot stretch at Kinnick going. Kinnick Stadium certainly deserves all the praise for being the most im - portant place on campus for Iowa fans in the fall. When the Iowa temperatures inev - itably drop, the sanctuary for Hawk - eye fans goes down the road to Carv - er-Hawkeye Arena. The facility opened in early 1983 and is now the home of men's and women's basketball, wrestling, volley - ball, and gymnastics. Last year, Carver was rocking during several home basketball games for both the men's and women's squads. It was also the home to the first two rounds of the NCAA Tournament for the Hawkeye women in which Carv - er-Hawkeye broke the record for the most attended venue in the first two rounds of the NCAA Women's Tourna - ment. Wrestling has also seen its fair share of sellouts. After all, the state of Iowa loves its wrestling. Carver-Hawkeye is more versatile than existing as just a sporting ven - ue. It has been home to famed musi - cal artists such as Whitney Houston, Metallica, Guns 'N' Roses, and Old Dominion. It has also hosted former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter and was home to World Wrestling Enter - tainment events from 2011-13. Also the site for some graduation ceremonies, Carver-Hawkeye is an in-tegral part of the UI campus.The hubs for Hawkeye sports Kinnick Stadium and Carver-Hawkeye Arena are home to a multitude of Hawkeye sports throughout the year.

Ryan Adams/The Daily Iowan Iowa's Tanner Nelson competes in the 200-meter breaststroke during finals of the Big Ten Swimming Championships on March 2. Iowa men's swimming and diving hosted the Big Ten Championships in the Campus Recreation & Wellness Center last season, but the team didn't bring home much hardware despite nu- merous accolades. This season, both the men and the women have goals set higher, and this will, they hope, bring home much-de - sired conference crowns. Many indi - vidual performances warrant a lot of excitement for the squad, including some young members of the team who should keep it strong for several years. To start, all of Iowa's divers wiggled their way into the NCAA Zone D Div-ing Championships last season. Of the nine Hawkeye divers to make the trip, only two of them were graduating se - niors; on the men's side, Anton Hoherz and Jonathan Posligua will return, along with Jayah Mathews, Thelma Strandberg, Sam Tamborski, Jolynn Harris, and Claire Park on the wom - en's side. Iowa was dominant in many events on the swimming side all season, pav - ing the way for some solid finishes. Dominance in the freestyle events oc - curred all season; the men's team had at least one swimmer with NCAA qual - ifying times in every event but the 200 individual medley and the 100 fly. Depth certainly applies to both teams, and this is what they will bank on heading into this season.Iowa making waves in the Big Ten UI men and women's swimming and diving set the bar higher going in the upcoming season.The Daily Iowan - HAWKEYE VIEW - Iowa City, Iowa - Wednesday, June 12, 2019 - 111 319-499-1041 513 WASHINGTON ST.
