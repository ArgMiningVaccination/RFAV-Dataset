Methods: Total vaccines administered to patients aged 0 through 19 years 364 days from 1/1/2006 through 12/31/2017 at a large academic health system in the Midwest United States with primary, specialty and school-based clinics, and a pediatric hospital were obtained from an electronic medical record. Vaccine administration errors over the same time period for the same patient criteria were analyzed from the health system's incident reporting system and further compared to the frequency of all incidents reported. Vaccine administration error rates were calculated. Data were analyzed by patient age, vaccine type and year administered. Results: Of the 1,431,206 vaccine doses given, 552 vaccine administration errors were identified (0.04%). The highest error rates occurred in children aged 2, 3, and 19 years. Vaccine types with the highest error rate were Td, rabies and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines. Overall vaccine doses given and errors reported increased over the study period. However, the increase was disproportionate, resulting in an increase in the error rate initially followed by a stabilization at the end of the study period. Conclusions: Vaccine administration errors are uncommon. The error rate appears to be stabilizing. Errors are more likely at ages when vaccines are not commonly given, with vaccines that have age-specific dosing and with vaccines that are given less often. This suggests more safety checks are needed for vaccines that are rarely used or given off-schedule, and manufacturers should avoid vaccines with age-specific dosing. Keywords: Errors; Vaccine.
