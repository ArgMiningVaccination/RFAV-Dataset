Two major International Covenants\u2014on Civil and Political Rights, and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights\u2014provided ongoing guide- lines for those entrusted with safeguarding the situations of vulnerable individuals and groups. Special R apporteurs of the Comm ission on Hu- man Rights and its subsidiary body, the Subcom- mission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, examined such ques- tions as contemporary forms of racism; religious speech; extra-legal exe- cutions; the im punity of perpetrators of human rights violations; independence of judges and the judiciary; torture; the right to adequate hous- ing; environmental issues; violence against women; sale of children, child pro stitution and child pornography; protection of indigenous heritage, and matters concerning indigenous populations. In addition, an expert presented a major study on the protection of children in armed conflict and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General investigated situations of internally displaced persons. During the year, working groups considered arbitrary detention, enforced or involuntary dis- appearances, including cases of missing persons in the territory of the former Y ugoslavia, as well as the right to contemporary forms of slavery. Racism and racial discrimination Third D ecade against racism The General Assembly had proclaimed in 1993 the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination (1993-2003) and adopted the Decade's Programme of Action [YUN 1993, p. 853]. The goals and objectives of the Third Decade were those adopted by the Assembly in 1973 for the first Decade [YUN 1973, p. 524]. The revised Pro- gramme of Action for the Decade was adopted by the Assembly in 1994 [YUN 1994, p. 988]. Supportwas given to the idea of convening another world conference on racism and racial discrimination. The Second Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination (1983-1993) [YUN 1983, p. 806] had been carried out in accordance with the plan of activities for 1985-1989 [YUN 1984, P. 785], and the plan, approved by the Assembly in 1987 [YUN 1987, p. 732], covering the remainder of the Decade (1990-1993). Implementation of Decade programme Reports of Secretary-General. In a January re- port [E/CN.4/1996/71] to the Commission on Hu- man Rights, the Secretary-General summarized information provided by the General Assembly, Governments and a UN programme on measures taken to combat racism and racial discrimination. In a March addendum [E/CN.4/1996/71/Add.1], the Secretary-General transmitted a report de- scribing three consultations on racism and edu- cation (Geneva, 8-10 August 1995) organized by the Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) Sub-Committee on Racism, Racial Discrimina- tion, Apartheid and Decolonization, in coopera- tion with the Centre for Human Rights and the UN Department of Public Information (DPI). The Commission on Human Rights also had before it the annual reports on racial discrimina- tion submitted by the International Labour Or- ganization (ILO) [E/CN.4/1996/73] and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Or- ganization (UNESCO) [E/CN.4/1996/74]. Commission action. On 1 1 April [E/1996/23 (res. 1996/8)], the Commission declared that all forms of racism and racial discrimination were among the most serious violations of human rights and must be combated. Comm ending States that had ratified or acceded to the international instru- ments to combat racism and racial discrimina- tion, the Commission appealed to those States that had not done so to ratify or accede to t hose instruments. It invited the Secretary-General to coordinate all the programmes being carried out by UN bodies with a view to achieving the objec- tives of the Third Decade and to establish a focal point within the Centre for Human Rights. He was also asked to continue the study on the effects of racial discrimination on the children of mi- norities and those of mi grant workers in the areas of education, training and employment and to602 Human rights submit recommendations to combat such effects; and to publish and distribute the model legisla- tion on racism and racial discrimination for the guidance of Governments in enacting further legislation against racial discrimination. Re- gretting that the r esources to implement the 1994-1995 biennial programme for the Third Decade were not provided, the Commission asked the Secretary-General to include the Third Decade's activities not implemented in that bien- nium in the future programme for the Decade and to provide the necessary resources for it. It also asked him to ensure that the necessary re- sources were provided to implement the activities for the Decade during the 1996-1997 biennium. The Commission, strongly appealing to all Gov- ernments, organizations and individuals in a po- sition to do so to contribute generously to the Trust Fund for the Programme for the Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, asked the Secretary-General to continue to un- dertake contacts and initiatives to encourage con- tributions. On 23 July, by decision 1996/255, the Council approved the Commission's requests to the Secretary-General to distribute the model legis- lation on racism and racial discrimination, in- clude the activ ities not imple- mented in the 1994-1995 biennium in future programmes for the Decade and provide the nec- essary fi nancial resources, and ensure that the necessary financial resources were provided to implement the Decade's activities during the 1996-1997 biennium. Subcommission action. On the Subcommission on Preven- tion of Discrimination and Protection of Minori- ties asked the Secretary-General to ensure the es- tablishment of a focal point on racism within the Centre for Human Rights to coordinate activities under the Third Decade. Reports of the Secretary-General. As re- quested by the Assembly in 1993 [YUN 1993, p. 853], the Secretary-General submitted to the Eco- nomic and Social Council in July his annual re- port describing activities undertaken or planned by Governments, the UN system and intergov- ernmental organizations to implement the pro- gramme of the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination [E/1996/83]. R egarding the Trust Fund for the Programme of Action for the Third Decade, the Secretary-General noted that since contributions to the Fund remained be- low the levels hoped for, it was certain that, unless a supplementary financing effort was made, very few of the activities planned for 1994-1997 would be carried out. A nnexed to the report was the statement of income and expenditure andchanges in reserves and fund balances for the Trust Fund for the 1994-1995 biennium ended 31 December 1995. On 23 July, the Economic and Social Council, by decision 1996/251, took note of the Secretary- General's July report. In response to a 1994 Assembly request [YUN 1994, p. 988], the Secretary-General, in an October report [A/51/541], supplemented information con- tained in his July report to the Council. He de- scribed activities taken by the UN system, among them a seminar (Geneva, 9-13 September) to assess the implementation of the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (see PART TWO, Chapter I) [GA res. 2106 A (XX)]. He also presented information provided by four Governments on their efforts re- garding the Convention. The Secretary-General noted that on 1 5 August a joint meeting was held of the Bureaux of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the Subcommission on Prevention of D iscrimination and Protection of Minorities. The two bodies agreed to undertake a joint study of article 7 of the Convention, which referred to m easures that States parties agreed to adopt in the areas of teaching, education, culture and information with a view to combating racial discrimination. GENERAL ASSEMBLY ACTION On 12 December, the General Assembly adopted resolution 51/81. Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination The General Assembly, Reaffirming the objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations of achieving international coop- eration in solving problems of an economic, social, cul- tural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamen- tal freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion, Reaffirming also its firm det ermination and its com- mitment to eradicate totally and unconditionally rac- ism, in all its forms, and racial discrimination, Recalling the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Convention on the Elimina- tion of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention against Discrimination in Education adopted by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization on 1 4 December 1960, Recalling also the outcome of the two World Confer- ences to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, held at Geneva in 1978 and 1983, Welcoming the outcome of the World Conference on Human Rights, held at Vienna from 1 4 to 25 June 1993, and, in particular, the attention given in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of A ction to the elimina- tion of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance, Stressing the i mportance of the activities of the Spe- cial Rapporteur of the Commission on Human RightsProtection of human rights 603 on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimina- tion, xenophobia and related intolerance, Recalling its resolutions 48/91 of 20 December 1993 and 49/146 of 23 December 1994, by which, respec- tively, it proclaimed the Third Decade to Combat Rac- ism and Racial Discrimination and adopted the revised Programme of Action for the Third Decade, Noting with grave concern that, despite the efforts of the international co mmunity, the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Rac- ism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination, Noting with great concern that, despite the efforts un- dertaken by the international community at various levels, racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related forms of intolerance, ethnic antagonism and acts of violence are showing signs of increase, Noting with concern that technological developments in the field of communications, including computer networks such as the Internet, have been used for dis- semination of racist and xenophobic propaganda throughout the world, Having considered the reports submitted by the Secretary-General within the framework of the imple- mentation of the Progr amme of Action for the Third Decade, Firmly convinced of the need to take more e ffective and sustained measures at the national and interna- tional levels for the elimination of all forms of racism and racial discrimination, Recognizing the importance of strengthening na- tional legislation and institutions for the promotion of racial har mony, Deeply concerned about the fact that the phenomenon of racism and racial discrimination against migrant workers continues to increase despite efforts under- taken by the international community to improve the protection of the human rights of migrant workers and members of their families, Recalling the adoption of the International Conven- tion on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families at its forty- fifth session, Acknowledging that indigenous people are at times victims of particular forms of racism and racial dis- crimination, 1. Declares once again that all forms of racism and ra- cial discrimination, whether in their in stitutionalized form or resulting from official doctrine of racial supe- riority or exclusivity, such as ethnic cleansing, are among the most serious violations of human rights in the contemporary w orld and must be com bated by all available means; 2.

Recommends that a seminar be organized by the Centre for Human Rights in cooperation with the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimina- tion, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the International Telecommu- nication Union and other relevant United Nations bodies, non-governmental organizations and Internet service providers, with a view to assessing the role of the Internet in the light of the provisions of the Inter- national Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; 11. Requests the Secretary-General to continue the study on the effects of racial discrimination on the chil- dren of mi norities, in particular those of m igrant work- ers, in the fields of education, training and em- ployment and to submit, inter alia, sp ecific recommen- dations for the implementation of mea sures to combat the effects of that discrimination; 12. Urges the Secretary-General, United Nations bodies, the specialized agencies, all G overnments, in- tergovernmental organizations and relevant non- governmental organizations, in implementing the Pro- gramme of Action for the Third Decade, to pay par- ticular attention to the situation of indigenous people; 13. Requests States to consider the relevant decisions of the Economic and Social Council on the integrated follow-up to previous world conferences and the need to make optimum use of all available mechanisms in the struggle against racism; 14.

Considers that all the parts of the Programme of Action for the Third Decade should be given equal at- tention in order to attain the objectives of the Decade; 16. Regrets the lack of interest, support and finan- cial resources for the Third Decade and its related Pro- gramme of Action, reflected in the fact that the Centre for Human Rights has been able to organize only one seminar since the adoption of resolution 48/91 in 1993, and notes that unless a supplementary financial effort is made very few of the activities planned for the period 1994-1997 will be carried out; 17. Considers that voluntary contributions to the Trust Fund for the Programme for the Decade for Ac- tion to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination are indispensable for the implementation of the Pro- gramme; 18.

Meeting numbers. GA 51st session: 3rd Committee 24-28, 35, 49; plenary 82. Contemporary forms of racism Reports of Special Rapporteur. Special Rap- porteur Maurice Gl\u00e9l\u00e9-Ahanhanzo (Benin) con- tinued to examine incidents of contemporary forms of racism, racial d iscrimination and any form of discrimination against blacks, Arabs and Muslims, xenophobia, negrophobia, anti-Semitism and related intolerance, as well as governmental measures to overcome them. In 1996, the Commission on Human Rights considered a report [E/CN.4/1996/72] of the Spe- cial Rapporteur, in which he discussed his 1995 activities, including m issions he had taken to Bra- zil, France, Germany and the United Kingdom (see below). He concluded that racist propaganda and incitement to ethnic and racial hatred were spreading. Racism was taking increasingly vio- lent forms, including physical aggression, mur- der, attacks on the property of immigrants or people belonging to ethnic, racial or religious mi- norities, the desecration of cemeteries and the destruction of places of worship. The Special Rapporteur noted that his missions had enabled him to begin a dialogue with the Governments of the countries he had visited. He recommended that field missions be continued in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia, Oceania and the Middle East. Annexed to his report were sum- maries of 1 5 allegations relating to racist inci- dents in Germany and observations made by the Government of Germany, and a report on anti- Semitism submitted by the Coordinating Board of Jewish Organizations, an NGO. The Special Rapporteur had visited Brazil [E/CN.4/1996/727Add.1] (6-17 June 1995) to obtain reliable information on the relations between the various ethnic and racial components of the country. It was generally stated officially that there was no racism or racial discrimination in Brazil because the Constitution explicitly prohib- ited it and because miscegenation was a funda- mental aspect of the Brazilian population and an essential component of the country's multiracial democracy. The Special Rapporteur observed that the ap- pearance of ethnic and racial cohesion in Brazil concealed inequalities between whites, Indians, people of mixed parentage and blacks, which were a legacy of earlier times. The situation was exacer- bated by the unequal distribution of wealth. He noted that the Brazilian authorities appeared toProtection of human rights 605 be resolved to tackle the ethnic and racial issue di- rectly and to usher in a society based on the equal dignity of all of its members. The political will ex- isted, and constitutional, legal and administrative steps had been taken, he stated. Racism and racial discrimination were not easy to pin down, the Special Rapporteur went on, since they were subject to the vagaries of official statements and were concealed by biological and cultural intermingling. He noted, however, that everyday racism and racial discrimination took the form of acts of harassment which accentuated the perception of the inferiority of blacks, who were frequently harassed by military and civilian police or by other law enforcement agencies. Such practices could be explained by the gener- ally negative image of blacks within Brazilian so- ciety; being black was synonymous with being poor or a criminal. Discrimination among blacks was evident in education, employment and hous- ing. The Special Rapporteur described the situa- tion of black women, who were mostly employed as domestic ser vants, nursemaids or nightclub dancers. More black women were sterilized than white women, which some people believed had contributed to the gradual whitening of Brazil's population. Violence against children, especially street children, and child labour were mostly evi- dent among children of black and mixed parent- age. Although he had been informed that there was no anti-Semitism in Brazil, the Special Rap- porteur noted that in the States of Parana and Sao Paulo, violent neo-Nazi groups had existed, which were later disbanded by the police. The Special Rapporteur noted that the 1980s had marked a genuine change in the Brazilian authorities' attitude to ethnic and racial issues. Though the singleness of the Brazilian people had not been called into question, the multiplic- ity of its component races and ethnic groups was acknowledged, the Rapporteur stated. The ap- plications of provisions in the 1988 Federal Con- stitution concerning support for a multiracial de- mocracy and a just and mutually supportive society\u2014which primarily concerned Indians, per- sons of mixed parentage and blacks, the poorest among the poor\u2014would eventually help to inte- grate them more effectively into Brazilian society, the Rapporteur declared. He also pointed out that the 1988 Constitution contained strict provisions to punish racism. However, the effectiveness of the laws had yet to be demonstrated because the police received few complaints and there were few trials for racism or racial discrimination. The Special Rapporteur recommended that in the absence of special pro- grammes for the benefit of disadvantaged ethnic and racial groups, priority should be given toeducating the poorest Brazilians; studying the situation of street children in order to reinte- grate them; taking a survey of the problem of the sterilization of black women; improving the im- age of blacks and giving them and Amerindians and people of mixed parentage an aw areness of their human dignity; and taking action to elimi- nate racial discrimination in employment. Reporting on his 1995 mission to Germany (18-27 September) [E/CN.4/1996/72/Add.2 & Corr.1], the Special Rapporteur recalled that reunifica- tion had been accompanied by violent outbursts of xenophobic sentiment and anti-Semitic acts fo- mented by extreme rightist organizations and neo-Nazi cells. He stated that reunification had exposed the formerly inward-looking inhabitants of the east of the country to things about which they had previously been ignorant. Economic and social change and unemployment had en- gendered disarray, and the inhabitants of eastern Germany perceived foreigners as competing for jobs and threatening any improvement in their economic and social situation. Other factors in the growth of xenophobia included the massive influx of asylum-seekers following political changes in Eastern Europe and the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, as well as the aggressiveness of the extreme right. The Special Rapporteur declared that Ger- man authorities had worked hard to restore the image of a peaceful, liberal, cosmopolitan and democratic Germany. Large-scale action had been taken in prevention and punishment, and also in amending the law. Firm steps had been taken by both federal authorities and the authori- ties in the Lander against extreme rightist or- ganizations and neo-Nazi cells. In addition, the society at large had rejected xenophobia, racism and rightist extremism; millions of dem onstra- tors had marched in protest against these and other forms of discrimination. Beyond steps taken to end racist and xenopho- bic violence, there remained the question of the integration of foreigners. Between 1955 and 1970, the Federal Republic of Germany used foreign labour to rebuild its economy, recruiting workers from M editerranean countries, whom it called \"guest workers\" because the intention was that they would return home. Currently, Germany had 1,850,000 people from Turkey (28.6 per cent of the foreign population); 916,000 from the former Yugoslavia (14.1 per cent); 558,000 from Italy (8.6 per cent); 346,000 from Greece (5.3 per cent); 286,000 from Poland (4.4 per cent); 168,000 from Romania (2.6 per cent); and 134,000 from Spain (2.1 per cent). Some 60 per cent of the foreigners had lived in the Federal Re- public of Germany for 1 0 years or more. The Spe-606 Human rights cial Rapporteur pointed out that while Euro- peans, particularly those from the European Union, were well integrated, the same was not true of people from Turkey, Poland and Roma- nia, who faced discrimination in housing, em- ployment, the provision of services and access to public places. The Government's policy on inte- gration was recent and suffered from ambiguity, the Rapporteur stated, since Germany did not see itself as a country of immigration despite the realities of the situation. However, the country had considerable assets in the form of its Com- missioners for Foreigners, w orking in favour of the integration of foreign population groups. In his conclusions and recommendations, the Special Rapporteur stated that the integration of foreigners in Germany remained a problem and that the rigid official policy on immigration could profitably be reviewed. He proposed that: efforts be made to change mental attitudes in fa- vour of accepting a m ulti-ethnic, mu lticultural society; consideration be given to applications for asylum; improvement be made in the living con- ditions of holding cen tres and a humane han- dling of the refoulement of supposedly illegal immigrants; a more humane solution than re- foulement be sought for the Vietnamese and Mo- zambicans who used to work under contract in the former German Democratic Republic and whose status had been made precarious by reuni- fication; and a law be passed against racism, anti- Semitism and xenophobia. Annexed to the re- port was the 9 October 1992 Declaration of Saar- br\u00fccken on tolerance and solidarity; Ham burg's policy on aliens and refugees; and measures to combat racism and animosity towards foreigners in Berlin. As to the situation in France [E/CN.4/1996/72/ Add.3], the Special Rapporteur stated that his visit to the country (29 September-9 October 1995) had been prompted by the multiplication, since 1990, of racist and xenophobic incidents target- ing immigrants and of anti-Semitic acts, which the French National Consultative Commission on Human Rights had noted in its reports for 1991, 1992, 1993 and 1994. Other information re- ceived by the UN Centre for Human Rights in- cluded allegations of ill-treatment by the police of prisoners from some countries in the Maghreb (Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia), the Middle East and Africa. Racial discrimination against persons of non- European origin was particularly evi dent in em- ployment and housing. Immigration had been suspended since 1974, and each succeeding Gov- ernment had opted for a policy composed of the control of migratory flows and limitation of so- called clandestine immigration, on the one hand,and integration of legal immigrants on the other. The French authorities were trying to strengthen anti-racist legislation. Economic and social meas- ures had also been taken to encourage the gradual integration of immigrant populations, and ap- peals by associations for tolerance were helping to bring about a change in attitudes. Judicial meas- ures to combat racism and xenophobia in France were annexed to the Special Rapporteur's report. The Special Rapporteur recommended that France be more generous in granting entry visas for people from the South; expedite procedures for examining files of those detained in holding centres and improve the living conditions in the centres; study the feasibility of devising and dis- seminating a syllabus to teach human rights based on int ernational declarations and conven- tions; and provide technical assistance and fi nan- cial support to hold an international seminar on racism and xenophobia. Annexed to the report was documentation regarding manifestations of racism and anti -Semitism. Following his visit to the United Kingdom (13-24 November 1995), the Special Rap porteur reported [E/CN.4/1996/72/Add.4] allegations of a multiplication of racist incidents due to the ac- tivities of movements of the far right and to the behaviour of the police towards certain ethnic minorities. Jewish organizations had warned of a resurgence of anti-Semitic acts, pr ompted by the propaganda of fundamentalist Islamic organiza- tions and organizations of the far right. Harass- ment and racial violence emanated from the ac- tivities of small, extreme right-wing groups and neo-Nazi organizations, individual behaviour and police treatment of black communities and their members. The Government acknowledged the existence of problems and was trying to over- come them through leg islative and administra- tive measures to eliminate economic and social disparities between the white majority and the ethnic minorities. Government action was supplemented by that of local communities, churches, trade unions and non-governmental associations and organizations. The Special R apporteur noted that remark- able progress had been achieved during the country's 30-year policy of racial equality, but in- creasingly subtle forms of discrimination had emerged. In recent years, the economic crisis and competition for increasingly scarce resources and jobs, as well as political activity by the far right and neo-Nazi movements and parties and violent police action against certain communi- ties, had polarized social relations between rich and poor on the one hand, and between whites and blacks, on the other. The country's once- open immigration policy had become increas-Protection of human rights 607 ingly restrictive for people originating from Afri- can and Asian States members of the Common- wealth. The Government was of the view that its immigration policy was devoid of any discrimina- tory criteria. As to the right to asylum, govern- ment measures were intended to discourage the arrival of asylum-seekers, the great majo rity of whom were from countries in the southern hemi- sphere. Applications had risen from 4,000 in 1988 to 40,000 in 1995; 70,000 applications were currently pending. Further, some 700 asylum- seekers and immigrants without papers were be- ing held in 37 prisons and detention centres. The Special Rapporteur recommended that the Government educate individuals to accept one another; improve training for the police force and incorporate into the police c itizens from different ethnic communities; severely con- demn police violence; be more respectful of hu- man dignity in holding centres and in cases of re- foulement or expulsion of illegal entrants and asylum-seekers; and review the law on incitement to racial hatred and create a specific offence of racist harassment and violence and an offence of defamation with respect to an ethnic group or mi- nority. By a note of 20 August [A/51/301], the Secretary- General transmitted a report of the Special Rap- porteur containing the observations of Germany on matters relating to it, as discussed in a 1994 re- port [YUN 1994, p. 992], and comments by Italy on a 1995 progress report [YUN 1995, p. 727]. The Special Rapporteur discussed contemporary forms and manifestations of racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia and measures taken by Govern- ments and judicial bodies, as well as initiatives by civil society. He concluded that at the interna- tional level the question of racism and racial dis- crimination remained alarming. Increasingly re- strictive and discriminatory regulations were undermining freedom of movement and resi- dence and the right to live as a family. He recom- mended to the General Assembly that it should convene a world conference on racism, racial dis- crimination and xenophobia (see below), and sug- gested that it should explore the possibility of es- tablishing a fund to assist ethnic or racial communities that were victims of racial discrimi- nation. Commission action. On 19 April [res. 1996/21], the Commission on Human Rights expressed its profound concern at and u nequivocal condem- nation of all forms of racism and racial discrimi- nation and all racist violence. It supported the ef- forts of Governments in taking measures aimed at eradicating such practices and called on them to enact and enforce legislation to prevent and sanction acts of racism and racial discrimination. The Commission decided to extend the mandateof the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenopho- bia and related intolerance for a three-year pe- riod and to have him report yearly beginning in 1997; and asked the Secretary-General to assist him. The Commission's decision and requests were approved by the Ec onomic and Social Coun- cil by decision 1996/259 of 23 July. World conference On 1 1 April, the Commission on Human Rights recommended [res 1996/8] that the Council request the Secretary-General to tr ansmit to the General Assembly the results of his consultations with Member States and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations on the possibil- ity of holding a world conference to combat rac- ism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and re- lated contemporary forms of intol erance. On 23 July, the Council, by decision 1996/255, requested the Secretary-General to transmit to the Assembly in 1996 the results of his consulta- tions. By resolution 51/81 of 12 December, the Gen- eral Assembly invited the Commission to con- sider the possibility of such a conference as a mat- ter of priority at its 1997 session. It also requested the Secretary-General to consult with M ember States and intergovernmental organizations re- garding a possible conference. On 23 August [res. 1996/8], the Subcommission, expressing its support for the convening of a world conference to combat racism and racial dis- crimination, called on Member S tates to respond positively to the proposal to convene the confer- ence. It invited the Secretary-General to submit a concrete proposal for the convening of a world conference before the turn of the century. GENERAL ASSEMBLY ACTION On 12 December, the General Assembly adopted resolution 51/79. Measures to combat contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance The General Assembly, Recalling its resolution 50/135 of 21 December 1995, and taking note of Commission on Human Rights reso- lution 1996/21 of 19 April 1996, Bearing in mind the outcome of the W orld Confer- ence on Human Rights, held at Vienna from 1 4 to 25 June 1993, and, in particular, the attention given in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action to the elimination of racism, racial discrimination, xenopho- bia and other forms of intolerance, Aware that racism, being one of the exclusionist phe- nomena plaguing many societies, requires resolute ac- tion and cooperation for its eradication,608 Human rights Having examined the report of the Special Rap- porteur of the Commission on Human R ights on con- temporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, including his con- clusions and recommendations, Deeply concerned that, despite continuing efforts, rac- ism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related in- tolerance, as well as acts of violence, continue to persist and even grow in magnitude, incessantly adopting new forms, including tendencies to establish policies based on racial, religious, ethnic, cultural and national supe- riority or exclusivity, Conscious of the fundamental difference between, on the one hand, racism and racial discrimination as gov- ernmental policy or resulting from official doctrines of racial superiority or exclusivity and, on the other hand, other manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance which are increas- ingly visible in segments of many societies and perpe- trated by individuals or groups, some of which are di- rected against migrant workers and members of their families, Taking note of the final report on freedom of opinion and expression submitted to the Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Mi- norities at its forty-fourth session by the Special Rap- porteurs Mr. Louis Joinet and Mr. Danilo Turk, in which the Special Rapporteurs concluded that, under international law, racism is not an opinion but an of- fence, Noting that the Comm ittee on the Elimin ation of Ra- cial Di scrimination, in its general recommendation XV (42) of 1 7 M arch 1993 on article 4 of the Intern ational Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, held that the prohibition of the dis- semination of all ideas based upon racial superiority or racial hatred was compatible with the right to freedom of opinion and expression as outlined in article 1 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in arti- cle 5 of the International Convention on the Elimina- tion of All Forms of Ra cial Discrimination, Conscious that impunity for crimes motivated by rac- ist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in weakening the rule of law and tends to encourage the recurrence of such crimes, Underlining the importance of creating conditions that foster greater harmony and tolerance within socie- ties, Regretting that the Special Rapporteur has continued to encounter difficulties in his efforts to fulfil his man- date, owing to the lack of necessary resources, 1. Takes note of the report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on contempo- rary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenopho- bia and related intolerance; 2. Requests the Special Rapporteur to continue his exchange of views with Member States, relevant mechanisms, related United Nations organs and spe- cialized agencies in order to further their effectiveness and mutual cooperation; 3.

Other questions relating to intolerance On 11 April [res. 1996/19], the Commission on Human Rights called on States to enhance toler- ance, coexistence and harmonious relations be- tween ethnic, religious, linguistic and other groups and to ensure that the values of pluralism, respect for diversity and non-discrimination wereProtection of human rights 609 promoted. It asked the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Centre for Human Rights, through its programme of advisory serv- ices and t echnical cooperation, to advise or assist countries, on request, to put in place effective safeguards to guarantee the full enjoyment of all human rights by all segments of their popula- tions, without di scrimination. The Centre was asked to include the promotion of tolerance through workshops and seminars, using mass media and NGOs, and through its programme of advisory services and technical cooperation. Follow-up to UN Year for Tolerance In 1996, the Director- General of the United Nations Educational, Scien tific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) transmitted to the Secretary-General of the United Nations a final report [A/51/201] concerning the United Nations Year for Tolerance, observed in 1995 and for which UNESCO was the lead agency. He stated that at its twenty-eighth session (October/No- vember 1995), the General Conference of UNESCO had adopted a Declaration of Principles on Tolerance and a Follow-up Plan of Action for the Year [YUN 1995, p. 1126]. The six-article Declaration covered the m ean- ing of tolerance, social dimensions, education and commitment to action, among other things. It also proclaimed 16 N ovember as the annual In- ternational Day for Tolerance. In its preamble, UNESCO member States ex- pressed alarm at the current rise in acts of intol- erance, violence, terrorism, xenophobia, clusion, margina lization and discrimination di- rected again various groups within society, and against individuals. They also stressed their re- sponsibility to develop and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction as to race, gender, language, national origin, religion or disability, and to com- bat intolerance. The 32-paragraph Plan of Action to follow up the UN Year for Tolerance, also adopted at the General Conference, included sections on objec- tives, education and networking, mobilization of the UN system, and coordination, among other subjects. The Plan stated that, as modern socie- ties become increasingly diverse and interdepen- dent, tolerance becomes ever more essential for the survival and we ll-being of both individuals and communities. The overall objective of the Plan was to educate, inform and empower indi- viduals to assume the responsibilities of dia- logue, mutual respect, toleration and non-violence, and to encourage plu ralism and toler- ance in the policies of Member States. GENERAL ASSEMBLY ACTION On 12 December, having reviewed the final re- port of the UNESCO Director-General, and re- confirming that tolerance was the sound founda- tion of any civil society and of peace, the Ge neral Assembly adopted resolution 51/95. Follow-up to the United Nations Year for Tolerance The General Assembly, Recalling its resolutions 47/124 of 18 December 1992, 48/126 of 20 December 1993 and 49/213 of 23 D ecem- ber 1994, by which it proclaimed and supported the United Nations Year for Tolerance, Recalling also that the Charter of the United Nations affirms in its preamble that to practice tolerance is one of the principles to be applied to attain the ends pur- sued by the United Nations of preventing war and maintaining peace, Stressing that one of the purposes of the United Na- tions, as set forth in the Charter, is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanita- rian character and in promoting and encouraging re- spect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without d istinction as to race, sex, language or religion, Bearing in mind the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Vienna Declaration and Progr amme of Ac- tion, adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993, and the International Cove- nants on Human R ights, Reconfirming that tolerance is the sound foundation of any civil society and of peace, Taking note of the note by the Secretary-General transmitting the final report on the United Nations Year for Tolerance, including the Decla ration of Prin- ciples on Tolerance and the Follow-up Plan of Action for the United Nations Year for Tolerance, submitted to him by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 49/213, Taking note also of resolution 5.6 adopted by the Gen- eral Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization at its twenty- eighth session, 1.

In a January re- port [E/CN.4/1996/88], the Secretary-General pre- sented information received from Governments, UN organs and bodies, human rights treaty bod- ies, special r apporteurs, special representativesand working groups and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations as to how they promoted and gave effect to the 1992 Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Li nguistic Minorities [GA res. 47/1351. The Secre tary-General concluded that in view of the few replies received, it was dif- ficult to arrive at conclusions that accurately rep- resented the measures taken to give effect to the Declaration by the international community. Commission action. On 1 1 April [res. 1996/20], the Commission on Human Rights urged States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to na- tional or ethnic, religious and linguistic minori- ties, as set out in the 1992 Declaration. It urged States to give effect to the Declaration and called on them and the Secretary-General to give due regard to the Declaration in their training pro- grammes for officials. States, interested govern- mental and non-governmental organizations, special representatives, special rapporteurs and the Commission's working groups were invited to continue to submit contributions as to how they promoted and gave effect to the Declaration. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights was called on to promote the implementation of the Declaration and to continue to engage in a dia- logue with Governments concerned to that end. The Commission also asked the Subcommission to make available the annual report of the Work- ing Group on Minorities. The Secretary-General was asked to provide assistance to the W orking Group to fulfil its mandate; to provide resources for advisory services and technical assistance of the Centre to implement the Commission's pres- ent resolution; and to report on its implementa- tion in 1997. Working Group activities. The five-member Working Group on Minorities held its second session in 1996 (Geneva, 30 April-3 May) [E/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/28], during which it dec ided that greater emphasis should be placed on arriv- ing at solutions to problems involving persons be- longing to minorities in order to promote their characteristics and thereby contribute to mutual tolerance, understanding and peace. It also de- cided to collect information on constitutions and legislation of States regarding the protection and promotion of minorities and to commission the preparation of short studies on the core princi- ples of the Declaration [YUN 1992, p. 723], including the formulation of recommendations for differ- ent countries and regions. Other decisions re- lated to establishing and strengthening mon- itoring mechanisms; focusing on themes and seminars dealing with multicultural education, language, culture, the media and the issue of mi-Protection of human rights 611 norities and territorial integrity; submission of information on national recourse and concilia- tion machineries; increasing cooperation with the High Commissioner for Human Rights; strengthening collaboration and cooperation with the specialized agencies and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and establishing cooperation with the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development, the W orld Bank and the In- ternational Monetary Fund; encouraging Gov- ernments to establish mechanisms which could facilitate dial ogue and conciliation between them and minorities; and encouraging wider partici- pation in its next session, particularly by Govern- ments and NGOs from developing countries. The Group presented a series of substantive guide- lines for working papers. Subcommission action. On 29 August [res. 1996/17], the Subcommission recommended that the Commission on Human Rights request the Economic and Social Cou ncil to authorize the ex- tension of the Working Group's mandate for a further two years, with a view to its holding one session annually until 1999. Report of Secretary-General. As requested by the General Assembly in 1995 [YUN 1995, p. 729], the Secretary-General reported [A/51/536] in Oc- tober on action to give due regard to the Declara- tion taken by Governments, UN bodies and or- gans, specialized agencies and other UN organizations, treaty bodies, special rapporteurs and representatives, and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations. GENERAL ASSEMBLY ACTION On 12 December, the General Assembly adopted resolution 51/91. Effective promotion of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities The General Assembly, Recalling its resolution 47 /135 of 18 December 1992, as well as its subsequent resolutions on the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Eth- nic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, Concerned by the growing frequency and severity of disputes and conflicts concerning minorities in many countries and their often tragic consequences, and con- cerned also that persons belonging to minorities are particularly vulnerable to displacement through, inter alia, population transfers, refugee flows and forced re- location, Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic, relig- ious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live,Noting that the Working Group on Minorities of the Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities held its second session from 30 April to 3 May 1996 and that its report will be made available to the Comm ission on Human Rights, Acknowledging that the United Nations has an in- creasingly im portant role to play regarding the protec- tion of minorities, 1.

Preventing minority discrimination As requested by the Subcommission in 1995 [YUN 1995, p. 730], S pecial Rapporteur Asbj\u00f8rn Eide (Norway) a second working paper [E/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/30] containing further sugges- tions for a comprehensive programme for the prevention of discrimination and protection of minorities, including proposals for examining thematic issues relating to racism, xenophobia, minorities and migrant workers. His first paper was submitted in 1994 [YUN 1994, p. 1008]. Subcommission action. On 29 August [res. 1996/17], the Subcommission asked the High Commissioner for Human Rights to pursue the implementation of his programme for the pro- motion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to minorities. Religious intolerance Reports of Special Rapporteur. In 1996, the Commission on Human Rights considered a re- port [E/CN.4/1996/95] of the Special Rapporteur on religious intolerance, Abdelfattah Amor (Tu- nisia). He updated the status of communications sent to Governments containing allegations of in- tolerance or discrimination based on belief and their replies thereto. Since the Commission's 1995 session, he had sent c ommunications to 46 States and had made three urgent appeals to two States. The communications concerned viola- tions of: the principle of non-discrimination in religion and belief; the principle of tolerance; freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief; freedom to manifest one's religion; free- dom of disposal of religious property; and at- tacks on the right to life, physical integrity and se- curity of person (clergy and believers). As to States' replies, the deadline had not yet expired for 29 States, and of the 18 for which the deadlinehad expired, the Special Rapporteur had re- ceived seven replies. There had been no replies to his urgent appeals. In separate addenda to his report, the Special Rapporteur described his visits in 1995 to Paki- stan (12-22 June) [E/CN.4/1996/95/Add.1] and to Iran (15-22 December) [E/CN.4/1996/95/Add.2]. Both visits were made at the invitation of the Gov- ernments concerned. Concerning Pakistan, the Special Rapporteur noted, following a review of legislation in the country, that the present State laws related to re- ligious minorities\u2014and more generally on the subject of tolerance and non-discrimination based on religion or belief\u2014were likely to favour or foster intolerance. The Special Rapporteur noted that existing legislation and the way it was applied had been inherited from the past, par- ticularly from periods of dictatorship. Asserting that applying the death penalty for blasphemy appeared disproportionate and even unaccept- able, he endorsed a government proposal to amend procedural aspects of the blasphemy law. With regard to proselytism, conversion and apos- tasy, the Special Rapporteur drew attention to the need to abide by international human rights stan- dards, and considered that no mention of reli- gion should be included on passports, on identity card application forms or any other administra- tive documents. With regard to society, the Special Rapporteur remained concerned at manifestations of intoler- ance and, more generally, at the limited expres- sion of the culture of tolerance. A limited rate of literacy, rigid social structures, authoritarian education, political militancy, media frenzy and politically inclined religious practices were not conducive to reducing tensions, nor to develop- ing a culture of tolerance. As to religious extrem- ism, the Special Rapporteur encouraged the Gov- ernment to restrain it and take measures in conformity with the law. The Special Rapporteur considered that it would be appropriate to implement the Centre for Human Rights programme of advisory serv- ices, notably for training police and adm inistra- tive staff in human rights, especially religious freedom. He stated that places of worship should be reserved for religious and not political mat- ters, and also recommended combating illiteracy and advocating values based on human rights and tolerance; duly punishing cases of abuse or rape against girls and women, especially those be- longing to minorities, and informing victims of the proceedings and guarantees provided by law; and making a special effort with regard to legisla- tion applying to places of worship, education and political parties. The Special Rapporteur askedProtection of human rights 613 that the authorities in all circumstances ensure the serene operation of justice by protecting the courts from the pressures of demonstrations and crowds. Annexed to the r eport was a list of cases concerning members of the Christian and the Ahmadi minorities. In his second report, the Special Rapporteur considered Iran's legislation in the field of toler- ance and non-discrimination based on religion or belief, and the implementation of that legisla- tion and the policy in force. In addition, he ana- lysed the situation of the non-Muslim minorities and the Sunni Muslims. Regarding legislation, the Special Rapporteur indicated that a State religion was not, in itself, in contradiction with human rights; however, it should not be exploited at the expense of the rights of minorities and the rights associated with citizenship, which implied that citizens should not be discriminated against on grounds such as religion or belief. Concerning the situation of recognized minorities, as provided for in the Constitution, the Special Rapporteur empha- sized that it should be understood that what were meant were inherent rights of minorities, not privileges that had been granted. He noted that the right to conversion\u2014the right to change one's religion\u2014was recognized in international human rights standards. The Special Rapporteur believed that the situation of recognized non-Muslim religious minorities\u2014the Zoroastrian, Jewish, Assyro- Chaldean and Ar menian minorities\u2014was satis- factory except in respect of some specific prob- lems. He recommended ensuring correct tran- scription of religious beliefs in instruction manuals; not submitting specific types of expres- sion, such as religious publications, to prior scru- tiny, but initiating action after publication, if and when required; collaboration by minorities in the development of education programmes through written contributions; eliminating the obligation of grocery store owners to indicate their religious affiliation in front of their shops; applying the Centre for Human Rights programme of advi- sory services for the training of judicial and ad- ministrative personnel in human rights; and re- specting freedom of access to places of worship. The Special Rapporteur expressed concern about the other non-Muslim (Baha'i and Protes- tant) minorities. With regard to the Baha'is, he hoped that a distinction would be drawn between questions of belief and those of a political nature. It should not be presumed, he stated, that the en- tire community had been politicized or engaged in political or espionage activities. He believed that there should not be any controls on the Ba- ha'is that might, through prohibition, restric-tions or discrimination, jeopardize the right to freedom of belief or the right to manifest one's belief. He recommended that the ban on the Baha'i organization be lifted to enable it to or- ganize itself freely. The Special Rappo rteur em- phasized that no discrimination should impede access by the Baha'is to higher educational estab- lishments or to empl oyment, and called on the authorities to review or set aside death sentences passed on Baha'is and to promulgate amnesties or other measures to prevent the enforcement of the penalties imposed. As for the Protestants, the Special Rapporteur recommended that the ban on the Bible Society of Iran and on the Garden of Evangelism be lifted, and that freedom to write, print and disseminate religious publications should be fully respected. He noted the severe traumatism caused by the murders of Protestant pastors who were defenders of tolerance and non-discrimination based on religion or belief. He advocated the lifting of all bans and restric- tions on places of w orship and access thereto and respect for the freedom to change one's religion and freedom to man ifest one's religion or belief. Commission action. On 1 9 April [res. 1996/231, the Commission on Human Rights, noting with grave concern the continuing instances of hatred and intolerance, including acts of violence based on religious intolerance, condemned all acts mo- tivated by religious intoler ance in all its forms. It urged States to: provide adequate constitutional and legal guarantees of freedom of thought, con- science, religion and belief; ensure that no one, because of religion or belief, was deprived of the right to life or the right to liberty and security of person, or was subjected to torture or arbitrary arrest or detention; combat hatred, intolerance and acts of violence; promote and enhance toler- ance relating to religion or belief; and ensure that members of law enforcement bodies, civil servants, educators and other public officials re- spected different religions and beliefs. The Com- mission called on States to recog nize, as provided in the 1981 Declaration on the Elimin ation of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief [GA res. 36/55], the right of all persons to worship or assemble in con- nection with a religion or belief and to establish and maintain places for those purposes. The Secretary-General was asked to assist the Special Rapporteur to enable him to carry out his man- date, submit an interim report to the General Assembly at its 1996 session and report to the Commission in 1997. Those requests to the Secretary-General were approved by the Eco- nomic and Social Council on 23 July by decision 1996/260.614 Human rights Interim report of Special Rapporteur. By an October note [A/51/542], the Secretary-General transmitted the Special Rapporteur's interim re- port updating the status of communications since the beginning of the Commission's 1996 session (18 M arch-26 April). He had sent com- munications to 35 States and an urgent appeal to one country. The deadline for receiving replies had not expired for 21 States, and of the 13 States for which it had expired, 5 had replied. The Special Rapporteur expressed grave con- cern at the problem of sects. During the year, an increasing number of cases involving criminal acts, including murders, directly linked to groups identified as sects came to light in many coun- tries. He felt that an international high-level gov- ernmental conference should be held to study and decide on a common approach to sects and religions that would respect human rights, and also recommended that the Subcommission authorize a study of the phenomenon of sects and religious freedom. He further recom- mended that a department on religious freedom and human rights be set up w ithin the Centre for Human Rights. The Special Rapporteur stressed that places of worship should be reserved for religious, non-political uses, and that schools should be protected from ideological, political or partisan indoctrination. By notes dated 7 and 11 November, respec- tively, the Secretary-General transmitted reports on the Special Rapporteur's visits to Greece (18-25 J une) [A/51/ 542/Add.1] and the Sudan (19-24 September) [A/51/542/Add.2]. With regard to Greece, the Special Rapp orteur focused on legislation in the area of tolerance and non-discrimination based on religion or be- lief and on its implementation, and on the laws and policies cu rrently in force. In addition, he analysed the situations of both the religious mi- norities and the dominant Ort hodox Church and their relations with the State. Alt hough freedom of conscience was guaranteed, the Special Rap- porteur noted that there were limitations on free- dom of worship which were incon sistent with in- ternationally established human rights norms. The Constitution limited freedom of worship to \"known\" religions but lacked a legal definition of the concept. He considered Constitutional provi- sions prohibiting proselytism to be incon sistent with the 1981 Declaration [YUN 1981, p. 881]. He also mentioned legislation governing places of wor- ship, and supported the abolition of the mention of religion on identity cards. The Special R apporteur stated that the Chris- tian minorities were facing a challenge to their le- gal recognition regarding their places of worship and right to conscientious objection. The statusof the Jewish minority in the religious and other spheres was entirely satisfactory. However, among the Muslim m inority in Thrace, he noted a static, unsatisfactory and prejudicial situation, especially in the religious sphere. The Special Rap porteur recommended that the Greek State involve representatives of human rights organizations and lay and religious repre- sentatives from all religious minorities and the Orthodox C hurch in its religious affairs policy on a consultative basis; adopt and apply measures to forestall and penalize acts of intolerance or discrimination on the part of the autho rities; make efforts to promote and develop a culture of tolerance and human rights; make use of the Centre for Human R ights programme of advi- sory services; establish a permanent interfaith dialogue between religious minorities and the Orthodox Church; and shield religious matters from political tensions and struggles. By a letter of 22 November [A/C.3/51/18], Greece transmitted its reply to the Special Rapporteur's report. It stated that the various aspects of relig- ious freedom had a sound legal foundation in the Greek Constitution, and Greece was deeply com- mitted to the effective respect of its international undertakings in this area. There was a distinction between religious beliefs to which everyone had access and dogmas or sects whose activities were clandestine or even dangerous. Greece main- tained that all relevant international instruments provided for the possibility of limiting religious freedoms for reasons of public policy. Greece was gratified to note the positive state- ments by the Rapporteur about Christian and Jewish minorities. In the case of the Muslim mi- nority, Greece was scrupulously respecting its in- ternational commitments deriving from the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne and was continually seeking to improve the situation of the Muslim minority in a spirit of tolerance, non-discrimination and the rule of law. During his visit to the Sudan, the Special Rap- porteur studied legislation concerning tolerance and non-discrimination based on religion or be- lief, and the implementation of that legislation and the policy in force, examining the situation of both non-Muslims and Muslims. He stressed that the State religion was not inherently incompatible with human rights; however, he stressed that the State should not take religion under its protection in order to define its content, concepts or lim its, except as was strictly necessary and provided for under the 1981 Declaration and the 1966 Interna- tional Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Concerning the concept of jihad, which had im- plications that were both offensive (holy war against infidels) and defensive (response to an at- tack), the Special R apporteur recommendedProtection of human rights 615 clarification of the defensive meaning of the term in order to make sure that it was compatible with the international norms to which the Sudan had committed itself. The Special R apporteur recom- mended that the authorities ensure the compati- bility of legislation on hudud offences (drinking al- cohol, apostasy, adultery, false accusation of unchastity, armed robbery, capital theft) with hu- man rights, and urged that hudud penalties, which included flogging and amputation, because they were exclusively of Islamic origin, should not be applied to persons who were non-Muslims. On the subject of proselytism, conversion and apostasy, the Special Rapporteur emphasized the need to respect internationally establi shed norms, in- cluding the freedom to change one's religion and the freedom to manifest one's religion or belief. He urged that dress should not be the subject of political regulation and recommended that the State, through the s chool system, promote the de- velopment of a culture of tolerance and non- discrimination. With respect to the situation of the non- Muslim communities, the Special R apporteur expressed con cern for limitations and con- straints on officials of religion, believers and places of worship and the i nfringement of belief and the freedom to manifest one's belief; conver- sion to another religion by constraint, instead of free choice; limitations on the construction of new places of worship; and threats to the physical and moral integrity of individuals, particularly on grounds of faith or belief. Concerning the situation of Muslims, the Special Rapporteur ap- pealed for the various Muslim brotherhoods to be respected, and recommended that their relig- ious activities be conducted in full freedom. In a later report [E/CN.4/1997/91/Add.1], the Spe- cial Rapporteur described the situation in India based on his visit to the country (2-14 D ecember). He studied legislation concerning tolerance and non-discrimination based on religion or belief and its implementation, as well as current poli- cies in respect of religious matters. His analysis covered the Christian, Muslim and Sikh minori- ties in the religious field and their relationships with society and the State. The Special Rap- porteur concluded that the situation in India re- garding tolerance and non-discrimination based on religion was satisfactory. Regarding Jammu and Kashmir, and Punjab, the Special Rap- porteur urged all the parties concerned to re- frain from exacerbating religious problems to en- sure that religious principles were not affected by political considerations at the expense of the re- ligious rights of the comm unities. (See also PART ONE, Chapter IV.)GENERAL ASSEMBLY ACTION On 12 December, the General Assembly adopted resolution 51/93. Elimination of all forms of religious intolerance The General Assembly, Recalling that all States have pledged themselves, un- der the Charter of the United Nations, to pr omote and encourage universal respect for and observance of hu- man rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, la nguage or religion, Reaffirming that discrimination against human be- ings on the grounds of religion or belief constitutes an affront to human dignity and a disavowal of the princi- ples of the Charter, Reaffirming its resolution 36/55 of 25 November 1981, by which it proclaimed the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Dis- crimination Based on Religion or Belief, Recalling article 1 8 of the International Covenant on Civil and P olitical Rights, Emphasizing that the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief is far-reaching and pro- found and that it encompasses freedom of thought on all matters, personal conviction and the commit ment to religion or belief, whether manifested indivi dually or in community with others, Reaffirming the call of the World C onference on Hu- man Rights for all Governments to take all appropriate measures in compliance with their international obli- gations and with due regard to their respective legal systems to counter intolerance and related violence based on re ligion or belief, including practices of dis- crimination against women and the desecration of re- ligious sites, recognizing that every individual has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, expression and religion, Calling upon all Governments to cooperate with the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the elimination of all forms of religious in- tolerance and of discrimination based on religion or belief to enable him to carry out his mandate fully, Alarmed that serious instances of intolerance and dis- crimination on the grounds of religion or belief, in- cluding acts of violence, intimidation and coercion mo- tivated by religious intolerance, occur in many parts of the world and threaten the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms, Deeply concerned that, as reported by the Special Rap- porteur, the rights violated on religious grounds in- clude the right to life, the right to physical integrity and to liberty and security of person, the right to freedom of expression, the right not to be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or pun- ishment and the right not to be arb itrarily arrested or detained, 1.

Further urges States, in conformity with interna- tional standards of human rights, to take all necessary action to prevent such instances, to take all appropriate measures to combat hatred, intolerance and acts of vio- lence, intimidation and coercion motivated by relig- ious intolerance and to encourage, through the educa- tional system and by other means, understanding, tolerance and respect in matters relating to freedom of religion or belief; 5. Recognizes that legislation alone is not enough to prevent violations of human rights, including the right to freedom of religion or belief; 6. Emphasizes that, as underlined by the Human Rights Committee, restrictions on the freedom to manifest religion or belief are permitted only if limita- tions are prescribed by law, are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals or the fundamen- tal rights and freedoms of others and are applied in a manner that does not vitiate the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; 7.

GA 51st session: 3rd Comm ittee 38-53; plen ary 82. HIV- and AIDS-related discrimination Report of Secretary-General. In a January re- port [E/CN.4/1996/44], the Secretary-General re- viewed progress in the development of a human rights component in the work plan of the Joint and Co-sponsored U nited Nations Programme on Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (UNAIDS) (see PART THREE, Chapter XIII). He summarized comments, information and materials on ways to keep under review the protection of human rights in the context of HIV/AIDS received from Governments, UN bodies, specialized agencies and NGOs; and reported on the status of the task of elaborating guidelines for States on promoting and protecting respect for human rights in the context of HIV/AIDS. Commission action. On 1 9 April [res. 1996/43], the Commission on Human Rights called on States to ensure that their laws, policies and prac- tices, including those concerning HIV/AIDS, re- spected human rights standards, prohibited HIV/AIDS discrimination and did not inhibit pro- grammes for the prevention of HIV/AIDS and for the care of persons infected with HIV. It also called on them to introduce protective legislation and appropriate education to combat discrimina- tion, prejudice and stigma, to ensure the full en- joyment of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights by people living with HIV/AIDS, their families and associates, and people pre- sumed to be at risk of infection. Relevant profes- sional bodies were called on to re-examine theirProtection of human rights 617 codes of professional practice with a view to strengthening respect for human rights and dig- nity in the context of HIV/AIDS, and rel evant authorities were called on to develop training for that purpose. The High Commissioner for Hu- man Rights was asked to continue his efforts, in cooperation with UNAIDS and NGOs, as well as with groups of people living with HIV/AIDS, to- wards the elaboration of guidelines on promot- ing and protecting respect for human rights in the context of HIV/AIDS, to ensure sufficient sup- port to the Centre for Human R ights to address such issues and to incorporate them, as appropri- ate, in all the Centre's activities. The Secretary- General was asked to report in 1997 on the devel- opment of the guidelines. Subcommission action. On 29 August [res. 1996/33], by a ro ll-call vote of 13 to 2, with 6 absten- tions, the Subcommission called on States to en- sure that their legislation, policies and practices, including those in the context of HIV/AIDS, re- spected international human rights standards, prohibited HIV/AIDS-related discrimination and did not have the effect of inhibiting HIV/AIDS prevention and care programmes, in particular with respect to women, children, indigenous people, minorities, refugees, migrants, sex work- ers, men who were homosexual, injecting drug users and prisoners. It also called on them to ad- vance the legal, economic and social status of women, children, minorities, indigenous peo- ples, m igrants and other groups suffering lack of full enjoyment of their fundamental human rights and freedoms, so as to reduce their vulner- ability to HIV infection and to the adverse socio- economic consequences of the AIDS pandemic. The High Commissioner was asked to continue his efforts to ensure sufficient resources within the Centre to address HIV/AIDS-related issues and to incorporate those issues, as appropriate, in all the Centre's activities. The Subcommission stressed the importance of organizing a second international expert consultation on human rights and HIV/AIDS, with a view to developing guidelines for States on the promotion and pro- tection of fundamental human rights and free- doms in the context of HIV/AIDS. UNAIDS was asked to continue the integration of a strong hu- man rights component in all its activities. The Commission was strongly urged to keep under re- view the issue of HIV/AIDS-related human rights violations and discrimination. Second Consultation. The Second Interna- tional Consultation on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights (Geneva, 23-25 September) [E/CN.4/1997/37] concluded that the pandemic was continuing to spread throughout the world at an alarming rate. Close in its wake was the widespread abuse of hu-man rights and fundamental freedoms associated with HIV/AIDS in all parts of the world. The first Consultation was held in 1989 [YUN 1989, p. 482]. The Consultation adopted 12 Guidelines for States to pro tect HIV-related human rights and to achieve public health goals. They dealt with an ef- fective national framework; community consulta- im- plementation and evaluation; public health laws; review and reform of criminal laws and correc- tional systems; anti-discrimination and other pro- tective laws; enactment of legislation to provide for the regulation of HIV-related goods, services and information; support for legal aid services; a supportive and enabling environment for women, children and other vulnerable groups; creative education, training and media programmes to change attitudes of discrimination and stigmati- zation; codes of conduct that translated human rights principles into codes of professional re- sponsibility and practice; monitoring and en- forcement mechanisms to g uarantee the protec- tion of HIV-related human rights; and sharing of knowledge and experience concerning HIV- related human rights issues between States and all relevant programmes of the UN system. Annexed to the report was the full text of the Guidelines. Civil and political rights The right to self-determination During the year, the Commission on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people [res. 1996/5]. Under the item, it also adopted resolutions pertaining to Western Sahara [res. 1996/6] and to the Middle East peace process [res. 1996/7], and considered in- formation provided by the Special Rapporteur on the question of the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self- determination (see below). In a September report [A/51/414], the Secretary- General summarized action taken by the Commis- sion on the right of peoples to se lf-determination. GENERAL ASSEMBLY ACTION On 12 December, the G eneral Assembly adopted resolution 51/84. Universal realization of the right of peoples to self-determination The General Assembly, Reaffirming the importance, for the effective guaran- tee and observance of human rights, of the universal realization of the right of peoples to self-determination enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and em-618 Human rights bodied in the International Covenants on Human Rights, as well as in the D eclaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples con- tained in its resolution 1514(XV) of 14 December 1960, Welcoming the progressive exercise of the right to self-determination by peoples under colonial, foreign or alien occupation and their emergence into sovereign statehood and independence, Deeply concerned at the continuation of acts or threats of foreign military intervention and occupation that are threatening to suppress, or have already sup- pressed, the right to self-determination of an increas- ing number of sovereign peoples and nations, Expressing grave concern that, as a consequence of the persistence of such actions, millions of people have been and are being uprooted from their homes as refu- gees and displaced persons, and emphasizing the ur- gent need for concerted internati onal action to allevi- ate their condition, Recalling the relevant resolutions regarding the vio- lation of the right of peoples to self-determination and other human rights as a result of f oreign military inter- vention, aggression and occupation adopted by the Commission on Human Rights at its thirty-sixth, its resolutions 35/35 B of 14 November 1980, 36/10 of 28 October 1981, 37/42 of 3 December 1982, 38/16 of 22 November 1983, 39/18 of 23 Novem- ber 1984, 40/24 of 29 November 1985, 41/100 of 4 De- cember 1986, 42/94 of 7 December 1987, 43/105 of 8 December 1988, 44/80 of 8 December 1989, 45/131 of 1 4 December 1990, 46/88 of 16 December 1991, 47/83 of 16 December 1992, 48/93 of 20 D ecember 1993, 49/148 of 23 December 1994 and 50/139 of 21 Decem- ber 1995, Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General on the right of peoples to self-determination, 1.

On 1 1 April [res. 1996/7], the Commission on Human Rights, stressing the importance of achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the M iddle East, emphasized that the achievement of such a peace was vital to the full implementation of human rights in the area. It called on the Centre for Human Rights to make available, on request, its programme of ad- visory services and technical assistance to the Pal- estinian Authority, and invited Governments to contribute to the programme. Subcommission action. On 1 9 August [res. 1996/1], the Subcommission endorsed the achieve- ments of the peace process in the Middle East and called on all parties to continue their efforts. It also expressed support for the active role that the United Nations was playing in the peace pro- cess. (For details of political developments in the Middle East, see PART ONE, Chapter VI.) Rights of Palestinians On 1 1 April [res. 1996/5], the Commission on Human Rights, by a roll-call vote of 28 to 1, with 23 abstentions, rea ffirmed the right of the Pales- tinian people to self-determination without ex- ternal interference and c alled on Israel to comply with its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of interna- tional law, and to withdraw from the Palestinian and other Arab territories, including Jerusalem, in accordance with UN resolutions. It asked the Secretary-General to transmit its resolution to Is- rael and all other Governments, to distribute it as widely as possible, and to make available to the Commission, prior to its 1997 session, informa- tion pertaining to its implementation by the Gov- ernment of Israel.

Western Sahara On 1 1 April [E/1996/23 (res. 1996/6)], the Commis- sion on Human Rights, noting with concern the insufficient progress made towards the settle- ment plan for Western Sahara, called on the two parties concerned, Morocco and the Frente Popular para la Liberaci\u00f3n de Saguia el-Hamra y de Rio de Oro (POLISARIO), to work with the Secretary-General and the United Nations Mis- sion for the R eferendum in We stern Sahara (MINURSO) to implement the settlement plan in accordance with relevant Security Council reso- lutions. It took note of a Council decision to re- view the arrangements for the completion of the identification process r equested in resolution 1017(1995) [YUN 1995, p. 255], and to consider any further measures that might need to be taken to ensure the prompt completion of the process and of all other aspects relevant to the fulfilment of the settlement plan. (See also PART ONE, Chapter II.) Mercenaries Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 50/138 [YUN 1995, p. 737], the Secretary-General, by a September note [A/51/392], transmitted a report prepared by Enrique Bernales Ballesteros (Peru), the Special Rapporteur on the question of the use of mercenaries. The Special Rapporteur de- scribed his activities and the current situation re- garding the use of mercenaries. He stated that mercenary activities were not only continuing but were reported to be evolving and acquiring char- acteristics that made them more of a threat to the enjoyment of human rights and the right of peo- ples to self-determination. Considering that mercenary activities had in- creased, had become diversified and were be- coming more of a threat, the Special Rapporteur recommended that the General Assembly: reaf- firm its condemnation of mercenary activities; suggest to States that they incorporate measures in their legislation to prohibit the use of their ter- ritory for the recruitment, training, assembly, transit, financing and use of mercenaries; appeal to States to ratify or accede to the 1989 Interna- tional Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries [YUN 1989, p. 825, GA res. 44/34]; and reaffirm its recom- mendation regarding the convening of a meeting620 Human rights of experts on the subject. He also recommended that mercenary activities should be condemned, banned and characterized as illegal. In a later report [E/CN .4/1997/24], the Special Rapporteur discussed his 1996 activities, includ- ing a visit to South Africa (20-30 October). He stated that mercenaries, whose activities were linked to apartheid, were no longer present. The South African authorities were st udying ways to legally prohibit the presence of indivi dual mer- cenaries and to regulate the provision of military assistance to foreign Governments by private service companies. In his conclusions and recom- mendations, the Special Rapporteur stated that the Commission on Human Rights and the Spe- cial Rapporteur should investigate more closely any mercenary implications of the international sale of military assistance and security, with a view to m aking proposals for a better legal classi- fication of private companies that offered those services internationally. As at 31 December, the 1989 Internati onal Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Fi- nancing and Training of Mercenaries [GA res. 44/34] had been ratified or acceded to by 11 States and had a total of 16 signatories.

Democratic processes Establishment of a democratic society Report of Secretary-General. At its 1996 ses- sion, the Commission on Human Rights consid- ered a report [A/50/332 & Corr.1] of the Secretary- General on UN system support for the efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies. It also had before it a note by the Secretary-General [E/CN.4/1996/49] describ- ing action taken by the General Assembly, the Commission and the Subcommission on the sub- ject of democracy and the establishment of a democratic society. Subcommission action. As requested by the Subcommission in 1995 [YUN 1995, p. 741], Osman El-Hajj\u00e9 (Lebanon) in May submitted a working paper on democracy and the establishment of a democratic so ciety [E/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/7]. The working paper presented possible elements for a study on the subject. On 29 August [dec. 1996/117], the Subcommis- sion decided to ask Mr. El-Hajj\u00e9 to prepare an ex- panded working paper, to be presented in 1997, on ways to pr omote democracy; ensure eco- nomic, social, cultural and political rights through democracy; and overcome obstacles to democracy. Freedom of speech Report of Special Rapporteur. In a March re- port [E/CN.4/1996/39], the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to free- dom of opinion and expression, Abid Hussain (India), described his activities and summarized the texts of communications he had sent to 43 States, pointing out that the adequacy of the pro-tection of the right was, however, of concern in 103 States and territories. The Special Rapporteur concluded that viola- tions of the right to freedom of expression oc- curred in all parts of the world. He expressed concern about the continued intimidation, har- assment and use of violence against writers, press professionals and other persons seeking to exer- cise that right. He also expressed concern over cases relating to the right to freedom of opinion and expression of women, and that private indi- viduals regularly resorted to acts of violence, threats and intimidation against other private persons to settle religious or ideological disputes. The Special Rapporteur regretted the existence of sometimes prolonged crises in which viola- tions of the right to freedom of opinion and ex- pression were justified on the basis of outmoded notions of national security, manipulation by authoritarian regimes and the view expressed by some Governments that human rights were part of an alien culture not suited to being transposed to the countries they governed. In separate addenda, the Special Rapporteur reported on his visits to the Republic of Korea (1995) [E/CN.4/1996/39/Add.1] and to Iran (1996) [E/CN.4/1996/39/Add.2]. Regarding the Republic of Korea, the Special Rapporteur stated that many measures had been taken by the Government to strengthen the pro- tection and promotion of human rights in gen- eral. Still, he had been informed of a number of controversies that had arisen over the exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression as related to the safeguarding of the national secu- rity of the country. It was brought to his attention that prisoners who allegedly held particular pol- itical convictions were asked by prison authorities to renounce t hose convictions. Issues relating to the freedom of expression of detainees were also of concern, as were a number of problems con- cerning that right in the workplace. Performing artists were required to submit the text or record- ing of their performance, prior to its publication, to the Performance Ethics Committee. The Special Rapporteur recommended that the Government repeal the National Security Law and consider other means to protect its na- tional security; cease the practice of requesting prisoners who allegedly held political opinions repugnant to the establishment to renounce their opinions; release unconditionally prisoners who were held for their exercise of the right to free- dom of opinion and expression; facilitate legiti- mate trade union activities; continue its efforts to align its national law with the pro visions relating to freedom of opinion and expression of the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and P olitical622 Human rights Rights [YUN 1966, p. 423]; enhance the systematic application of international human rights law in the national legal system; bring its prison regime into accordance with established international principles on the administration of justice; and limit administrative interference with the right to freedom of expression. As to the situation in Iran, the Special Rap- porteur expressed concern at the extent of limi- tations on the right to freedom of opinion and ex- pression, as well as on the interlinked right to freedom of assembly and association. Press pro- fessionals had been subjected to harassment and violence, prison sentences and corporal punish- ment. Among other things, the Special Rap- porteur was informed that: certain bureaucratic elements had expressed their support for the use of violence and harassment; press and media professionals, academics and others had been summoned to report in person to government or- gans in connection with their exercise of the right to freedom of expression; it was prohibited by law to import, distribute, possess or use satellite antennae; State agencies exercised elaborate di- rect and indirect control on the press, the media and publications, and prior authorization was re- quired to publish, bind and distribute books, newspapers, magazines and other forms of printed as well as audio and visual materials; and printed media regularly reported on the exist- ence of censorship and self-censorship. With re- gard to film production, he said that scenarios, funding, production and distribution all re- quired authorization by the Government. The Special Rapporteur recommended that the Government ensure the right to freedom of opinion and expression as enunciated in the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; repeal the law prohibiting the use of satel- lite antennae; limit l egal and administrative regulation of and interference with the right to freedom of opinion and expression; substitute public legal procedure for administrative action; cease the practice of summoning persons to pres- ent themselves at government offices to instruct or warn them not to continue to seek to exercise their right to freedom of opinion and expression; take measures to prevent officials from encourag- ing or supporting private persons who resorted to illegal action against persons seeking to exer- cise the right; review cases of persons who were detained on charges or accusations eman ating from their opinions or activities in seeking to ex- ercise the right; review cases of pri soners who had been tried by courts of law whose compe- tence had not been unequivocally established or who had been convicted in application of laws or regulations incompatible with the protection ofthe right to freedom of opinion and expression under the 1966 International Covenant; continue and strengthen its cooperation with the Commis- sion on Human Rights and relevant NGOs; and prevent any negative consequences for the effec- tive enjoyment by women of the right that might arise from the implementation of gender- specific legislation. The Special Rapporteur said that his report was an earnest attempt to assist Iran in its endeav- our to ensure the freedom of opinion and expres- sion of its citizens. In a later report [E/CN .4/1997/31/Add.1], the Spe- cial Rapporteur described the situation in Tur- key, based on his visit to the country in September 1996. He stated that in recent history the Govern- ment had taken steps aimed at strengthening the protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. He noted, however, from consistent and credible reports, the death or torture of press professionals while in police custody; the subjec- tion to threats and harassment of writers, jour- nalists and human rights advocates and their per- secution, in certain cases, for the expression of non-violent opinions; the use of disproportion- ate violence against journalists and protestors during demonstrations; the intimidation of hu- man rights advocates and victims of and wit- nesses to alleged human rights violations; the regular occurrence of suspension of the media and seizure of newsprint; and the lack of preci- sion of v arious national laws and rules of proof on the basis of which courts justified restrictions on the right to freedom of opinion and expres- sion. The Special Rapporteur recommended that the Government amend legisl ation and adopt measures requiring the courts to explain more explicitly the motivation for any judgement that restricted the right to freedom of opinion and ex- pression; annul convictions of persons sentenced to a fine or term of imprisonment for the peace- ful expression of their opinions; justify in court proceedings the banning of books, the seizure of newsprint, the closure of media outlets and the punishment of persons held responsible for threatening national security through the exer- cise of their right to freedom of opinion and ex- pression; demonstrate the maximum possible degree of openness in its polices aimed at pro- tecting the right; and consider promoting a na- tional debate on freedom of expression, under- lining its relevance to all people in the country. Commission a ction. On 1 9 April [res. 1996/53], the Commission on Human Rights expressed its concern at the extensive occurrence of detention of, as well as discrimination, threats and acts of violence and harassment against, persons whoProtection of human rights 623 exercised the right to freedom of opinion and ex- pression and the intrinsically linked rights to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, of peaceful assembly and freedom of association and the right to take part in the conduct of public affairs. The Commission decided to renew the man- date of the Special Rapporteur on the subject for a three-year period, which the Economic and So- cial Council approved on 23 July by decision 1996/266. The Commission asked the Special Rapporteur to report in 1997 and asked the Secretary-General to consider ways of publiciz- ing the Special Rapporteur's work. Administration of ju stice Commission action. On 19 April [res. 1996/32], the Commission on Human Rights, reaffirming the importance of the full im plementation of all relevant United Nations standards on human rights in the administration of justice, called on Member States to spare no effort in providing for effective legislative and other mechanisms and procedures, as well as adequate resources, to en- sure full implementation of those standards. It appealed to G overnments to include in their na- tional development plans the administration of justice as an integral part of the development process and to allocate adequate resources for the provision of legal-aid services. The Commission asked Governments to provide training in human rights and the administration of justice, includ- ing juvenile justice, to judges, lawyers, prosecu- tors, social workers and other professionals, in- cluding police and immigration officers, and called on special rapporteurs, special repr esenta- tives and working groups of the Commission to continue to give special attention to the effective protection of human rights in the administration of justice and to provide specific recommenda- tions, including proposals for concrete measures of advisory services and technical assistance. The High Commissioner for Human Rights was urged to consider favourably requests by States for assistance in the administration of justice and to strengthen system-wide coordination in that field, particularly between the UN human rights programme of advisory services and technical as- sistance and the technical cooperation and advi- sory services of the UN Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Pro gramme (see PART THREE, Chapter IX). Working G roup activities. The five-member sessional Working Group on the administration of justice and the question of compensation held three meetings in 1996, on 7, 9 and 13 August in Geneva [E/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/16]. The Subcommis-sion had decided to establish the Working Group on 6 August [dec. 1996/103]. The Working Group considered a revised set of basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of gross violations of hu- man rights and humanitarian law [E/CN. 4/Sub.2/ 1996/17]. On 29 August [res. 1996/28], the Subcom- mission decided to transmit the revised princi- ples and guidelines to the Commission on Human Rights, together with the comments of the Working Group and the comments of the Subcommission during its 1996 session. It asked the former Special Rapporteur on the subject to prepare a note, taking into account the com- ments of the Group and the Subcommission, to facilitate the Commission's examination of the revised principles and guidelines. The Group also considered a preliminary draft international convention on the prevention and punishment of enforced disappearances, abolition of the death penalty, habeas corpus as a non-derogable right and as one of the require- ments for the right to a fair trial, and juvenile jus- tice. It postponed to its 1997 session considera- tion of the item concerning proposals for the effective implementation of the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide [GA res. 260 A (III)]. Compensation for victims Report of Secretary-General. Pursuant to a 1995 Commission request [YUN 1995, p. 744], the Secretary-General submitted a report with later addenda [E/CN.4/1996/29 & Add.1-3] describing leg- islation adopted or planned by States relating to restitution, compensation and rehabilitation for victims of grave violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Secretary-General summarized replies received from 1 7 States. Commission action. On 1 9 April [res. 1996/35], the Commission on Human R ights called on the international community to give increased atten- tion to the right to restitution, compensation and rehabilitation for victims of grave violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms. It en- couraged the Subcommission to continue to give consideration to the proposed basic principles and guidelines (see above). The Commission asked States that had not done so to provide infor- mation to the Secretary-General on the legisla- tion adopted or in the process of being adopted relating to the right to restitution, compensation and rehabilitation for victims of grave violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Secretary-General was asked to report in 1997.624 Human rights Rule of law Commission action. On 1 9 April [res. 1996/56], the Commission on Human Rights, affirming that the High Commissioner, with the assistance of the Centre for Human Rights, remained the focal point for coordinating system-wide atten- tion for human rights, democracy and the rule of law, asked him to continue to explore the possibil- ity of obtaining from all relevant UN institu- tions, including financial institutions, technical and financial means to strengthen the Centre's capacity to provide assistance to national projects aiming at the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law. It asked the Secretary-General to report to the General As- sembly in 1996 on the results of any contacts es- tablished by the High Commissioner. The Com- mission's request to the Secretary-General was approved by the Economic and Social Council by decision 1996/267 of 23 July. Report of Secretary-General. Pursuant to a 1995 General Assembly request [YUN 1995, p. 744], the Secretary-General submitted an O ctober re- port [A/51/555] in which he outlined support of- fered by the Centre for Human Rights to States to strengthen the rule of law. Under the pro- gramme of advisory services and technical coop- eration in the field of human rights, States could avail themselves of assistance in the areas of constitution-making; the l egal framework under the constitution, including penal law and the ad- ministration of justice, which protected human rights and democracy; electoral assistance; and institution-building and training. The High Commissioner had initiated a series of consultations and contacts with other partners in the UN system to enhance inter-agency coop- eration and coordination, including meetings with executive heads of UN agencies and pro- grammes on matters of policy and coordination, meetings and working-level contacts with agen- cies and pr ogrammes on thematic issues and field-level cooperation. A seminar of the World Bank and the Centre (Washington, D.C., 24-25 July) discussed possible cooperation between the two institutions. The High Commissioner and the World Bank President stressed the need for close contacts and mutual support in env isaging and implementing programmes for strengthen- ing the rule of law. In addition, the High Com- missioner had explored possibilities for obtain- ing from relevant UN agencies and financial institutions technical and financial assistance to support efforts to promote human rights and the rule of law. The Secretary-General recommended the con- vening by the High Commissioner of a high-level meeting of UN agencies and programmes in-volved in the promotion of human rights and of sustainable development, in order to analyse means, modalities, fi nancing and allocation of responsibilities to im plement a c omprehensive UN programme of assistance for the rule of law; developing a structural framework to facilitate ongoing cooperation between UN agencies and programmes involved in the promotion of hu- man rights and of sustainable development, aimed at strengthening the rule of law; and strengthening the technical cooperation pro- gramme of the Centre. GENERAL ASSEMBLY ACTION On 12 December, the General Assembly adopted resolution 51/96.

Report of Special Rapporteur. In June, the Special Rapporteur on the question of human rights and states of emergency, Leandro Despouy (Argentina), submitted his ninth annual report [E/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/19 & Corr.1], con taining infor- mation on 87 States or territories which, since 1 January 1985, had proclaimed, extended or ter- minated a state of emergency. In a December ad- dendum [E/CN .4/Sub.2/1996/19/Add.1], the Special Rapporteur updated his report, adding three States or territories in which measures had been taken that constituted the proclamation, intro- duction, extension, m aintenance or termination of emergency regimes in various forms. Subcommission action. On 29 August [res. 1996/30], the Subcommission asked the Special Rapporteur to update the list of States that had proclaimed, extended or terminated a state of emergency for its consideration in 1997, and to submit final conclusions on the protection of hu- man rights during states of emergency, together with specific recommendations as to how the question should be dealt with in future.626 Human rights Humanitarian standards Reports of Secretary-General. The Commis- sion on Human Rights had before it a report of the Secretary-General [E/CN.4/1996/80 & Add.1,2] sum- marizing comments on the Declaration of Min- imum Humanitarian St andards, adopted by a group of experts (Turku, Finland, December 1990) [E/CN.4/Sub.2/1991/55], received from Gov- ernments, UN specialized agencies, and intergov- ernmental and non-governmental organizations. Commission action. On 1 1 April [dec. 1996/106], the Commission on Human Rights, noting a 1995 Subcommission resolution [YUN 1995, p. 759] and a 1995 Commission decision [YUN 1995, p. 749], de- cided not to forward to the Economic and Social Council the Subcommission's d raft decision authorizing a study on the implications for hu- man rights of UN action, including humanitari- an assistance, in addressing in ternational hu- manitarian problems and in the promotion and protection of human rights. On 1 9 April [res. 1996/26], the Commission in- vited all States to consider reviewing their na- tional legislation pertaining to situations of pub- lic emergency with a view to ensuring that it met the requirements of the rule of law and that it did not discriminate on the grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin. The Commission w elcomed an offer made by Den- mark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden to organize, in cooperation with the International Committee of the Red Cross, a workshop to which governmental and non-governmental ex- perts from all regions would be invited to con- sider the issue. The Secretary-General was asked to transmit the Commission's resolution to Gov- ernments and intergovernmental and non- governmental organizations for their comments for submission in 1997. Detention Arbitrary detention Commission action. On 19 April [res. 1996/28], the Commission on Human Rights asked the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention to: con- tinue to seek and gather information from Gov- ernments and intergovernmental and non- governmental organizations, as well as from the individuals concerned, their families or their le- gal representatives; consider the distinction be- tween detention and imprisonment and to submit conclusions and recommendations thereon (see below); apply the treaties relevant to the case un- der consideration only to the States that were par- ties to them; and report in 1997. The Commission expressed concern that most cases of arbitrarydeprivation of liberty were motivated by denial of the right to fr eedom of opinion and expression, and recalled the need to pay attention to cases of arbitrary detention motivated by violation of other human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Commission noted with concern t hat, ac- cording to the Working Group, the practice of ar- bitrary detention was facilitated and aggravated by factors such as abuse of states of em ergency, ex- ercise of the powers specific to states of emergency without a formal declaration, non-observance of the principle of proportionality between the grav- ity of the measures taken and the situation con- cerned, too vague a definition of off ences against State security and the existence of special or emer- gency jurisdictions. The Secretary-General and the Subcommission's Special Rapporteur respon- sible for studying the question of human rights and states of emergency were asked to extend their assistance to Governments that wished to re- ceive it, as well as to special rapporteurs and work- ing groups. The Secretary-General was further asked to provide the Working Group with all the assistance it needed. Working Group activities. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention held its fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth sessions in Geneva in 1996 (15-20 May, 16-20 September, 17-27 Novem- ber) [E/CN.4/1997/4]. During the year, the five- member Working Group transmitted 30 commu- nications concerning 205 new cases of alleged ar- bitrary detention to 24 Governments, of which 12 had provided information. The Group noted that of the 205 individual cases, 10 were based on in- formation communicated by members of the families or relatives of the detained persons, 91 on information communicated by local or re- gional NGOs, and 104 on information provided by NGOs in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council. As to urgent appeals, the Group transmitted 75 such communications to 35 Governments and to the Palestinian Authority, to which 1 9 of the Governments and the Palestinian Authority replied. A description of the cases transmitted, the contents of the Governments' re- plies and decisions adopted in November and December 1995 and in May and September 1996 were contained in a separate addendum to the Group's report [E/CN.4/1997/4/Add.1]. Regarding the Commission's request to con- sider the distinction between detention and im- prisonment, the Working Group examined the interpretation of the term detention in relation to the scope of the Group's mandate, analysed positions adopted by the Commission and ad- dressed the implications of limiting the Group's mandate to pre-trial detention only. The Group concluded: that its 1991 mandate [YUN 1991, p. 557]Protection of human rights 627 covered both administrative and judicial deten- tions and, among the latter, those prior to, dur- ing and after trial; that a 1988 G eneral Assembly resolution [YUN 1988, p. 510] had sought to make a terminological distinction bet ween detention and imprisonment only as an aid to construction, solely for the purposes of the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment contained there- in; and that the Commission had accepted that approach for the past five years. The Group rec- ommended that the Commission renew the mandate assigned to it in 1991, so that it might continue to consider any alleged arbitrary dep- rivation of liberty, regardless of whether or not it followed a conviction. In 1996, the Group carried out missions to Ne- pal (22-26 April) [E/CN.4/1997/4/Add.2], B hutan (29 April-6 May) [E/CN.4/1997/4/Add.3] and China (14-21 July). At both the constitutional and the legislative levels, the Group reported, Nepal had gradually established a system governed by the rule of law which was among the most advanced of the re- gion. However, the implementation of the legis- lation was problematic and slow, because of the low standard of living of a large part of the popu- lation and because of the weight of previous prac- tices and attitudes. The main difficulties identi- fied by the Working Group were related to arrests and custody; the infrequency of free legal aid and assistance of an o fficially appointed lawyer; ill-treatment during investigation; conditions of application of the Public Offence Act; habeas cor- pus and states of emergency; military courts; fo- rensic investigations; overcrowding in prisons for procedural reasons; standardization of the pres- entation and keeping of records in places of de- tention; and legislation concerning aliens. The Group recommended to Nepal measures to re- duce overcrowding in prisons and to monitor the lawfulness of detention, ensure the right to a de- fence, prosecute those guilty of ill-treatment and torture, reform emergency legislation and pro- mote human rights. The Working Group's objective in Bhutan was to ensure the implementation of recommenda- tions made during its 1994 visit [YUN 1994, p. 1021], which had been requested by the Bhutanese authorities in order to draw up an inventory of existing problems in the administration of justice and to make recommendations thereon. The Group concluded that its recommendations had generally been implemented and almost all the cases of detention considered during its 1994 visit to be irregular or arbitrary had been recti- fied. Recommendations to B hutan following the 1996 visit were to adopt as early as possible a draftlaw reforming the Code of Criminal Procedure; implement the technical cooperation pro- gramme in the field of the administration of jus- tice that was agreed upon by Bhutan and the Cen- tre for Human Rights, giving high priority to training judges and Jabmis (substitute lawyers), whose function was insufficiently known to the public; and appoint Jabmis to assist persons who lacked financial means. The Group's 1996 visit to China was prepara- tory to its projected 1997 visit. The formal confir- mation of the 1997 visit was still pending. In China, the Group held t alks with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and professional groups, includ- ing the National Association of Lawyers and the China Society for Human Rights Studies. It vis- ited prisons and centres for re-education through labour. The Group concluded that it was very im- portant that China undertake the modernization of its legislative system. Juvenile detention Report of Secretary-General. In January, the Secretary-General reported [E/CN.4/1996/31 & Add.1] on the promotion and protection of all rights of the child and juveniles in the adminis- tration of justice, providing replies received from Governments, UN human rights treaty bodies, specialized agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations. Commission action. On 1 9 April [res. 1996/32], the Commission on Human Rights called on States to give high priority to the promotion and protection of all rights of the child and juveniles in the administration of justice. It urged them to take into account in their nati onal legislation, and to disseminate widely, the 1985 United Na- tions Standard Minimum Rules for the Adm inis- tration of Juvenile Justice (The Beijing Rules) [GA res.40/33], the 1990 Un ited Nations Guidelines for the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency (The Riyadh Guidelines) [GA res. 45/ 112], and the 1990 United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juve- niles Deprived of their Liberty [GA res. 45/113]. States were also urged to take steps to ensure compliance with the principle that depriving children and juveniles of their liberty should be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time, in particular before trial, and to ensure that if they were ar- rested, detained or imprisoned, children and ju- veniles were separated from adults. The Com- mission recommended that States ensure that all structures, procedures and programmes in the administration of justice with regard to child of- fenders promoted assistance to allow children to take responsibility for their actions and to en-628 Human rights courage reparation, mediation and restitution, especially for the direct victim of the crime. The High Commissioner for Human Rights was asked to continue to pay special attention to the subject of juvenile justice and, in close coop- eration with the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Crime Prevention and Crimi- nal Justice Division of the UN Secretariat, de- velop strategies to ensure effective coordination of juvenile justice technical-cooperation pro- grammes. The Secretary-General was asked to report in 1997. On 23 July, the Economic and Social Council, by resolution 1996/13, asked the High Commis- sioner for Human Rights to continue to pay atten- tion to the subject of juvenile justice and, in close cooperation with the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Division of the Secretariat, UNI- CEF and CRC, develop strategies to ensure effec- tive coordination of juvenile justice technical- assistance programmes. The Secretary-General was asked to organize, in cooperation with the Government of Austria, a meeting of an expert group on the elaboration of a programme of action to promote the effective use and application of international standards and norms in juvenile justice (see PART THREE, Chapter IX). Detained UN staff members Report of Secretary-General. In February, the Secretary-General submitted a report [E/CN.4/1996/32] updating developments pertain- ing to the detention of international civil servants and their families. He stated that, over the past two years, there had been a decrease in the number of staff members arrested or detained; however, that trend had been reversed by the situation in Rwanda (see PART ONE, Chapter II). Annexed to the report were a consolidated list of staff members under arrest and detention or missing and a list of the status of signatures and ratifications of the 1994 Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel [GA res. 49/59] (see PART FOUR, Chapter III). Commission action. On 1 9 April [res. 1996/29], the Commission on Human Rights asked the Secretary-General to request the UN organs con- cerned to submit to him their views and com- ments on the recommendations contained in a 1992 report [YUN 1992, p. 739] of the Special Rap- porteur on the protection of the human rights of UN staff mem bers, and to submit a report evalu- ating the measures proposed for the impl ementa- tion of those recommendations. It also asked him to: continue his efforts to ensure that the human rights, privileges and immunities of UN staffmembers, experts and their families were fully respected and to seek redress and compensation for the damage caused to them; prepare a docu- ment containing the relevant principles of pro- tection found in the 1994 Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Person- nel for use as guidelines in bilateral negotiations of headquarters agreements and mission agree- ments with concerned Governments; and report in 1997 on the status of the Convention, on the situation of UN staff members, experts and their families detained, imprisoned, missing or held in a country against their will, on cases that had been successfully settled since the presentation of his last report, and on the implementation of its current resolution. The Commission appealed to Member States to respect and ensure respect for the rights of staff members and others acting under United Nations authority, and their fam ilies. Regarding detained staff, it urged States to provide ade- quate and prompt information co ncerning their arrest or detention; grant immediate access to de- tainees by representatives of international or- ganizations; allow indepen dent m edical teams to investigate the health of detained staff members, experts and their families and afford them med- ical assistance; allow representatives of interna- tional organizations to attend hearings; and en- sure the speedy release of detained UN staff members, experts and mem bers of their families. Impunity As requested by the Subcommission in 1995 [YUN 1995, p. 745], the Special Rapporteur on the question of the im punity of perpetrators of viola- tions of human rights (civil and political), Louis Joinet (France), submitted his final report in June [E/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/18]. He presented a set of principles intended to strengthen action to com- bat impunity, which rested on three fundamental rights of victims: the right to know, the right to justice and the right to reparation. Those rights comprised three of the five parts of the set of principles, and were the main substance of the text. The other two parts included a preamble and definitions essential for the interpretation of the principles. The Special Rapporteur proposed that the Subcommission t ransmit the report to the Commission, with comm ents for submission to the Economic and Social Council and to the General Assembly. Annexed to the report was a synoptic table of the set of principles for the pro- tection and promotion of human rights through action to combat impunity, as well as the set of principles itself. On 29 August [dec. 1996/119], the Subcommis- sion asked the Special Rapporteur to submit inProtection of human rights 629 1997 a revised version of the set of principles for the protection and promotion of human rights through action to combat impunity. In July, the Special Rapporteur on the question of the impunity of perpetrators of human rights violations (economic, social and cultural), El Hadji Guiss\u00e9, submitted his second interim re- port [E/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/15]. The report focused on recent violations of economic, social and cul- tural rights and their consequences, and the mechanism of and events leading to such viola- tions. It also dealt with the campaign against im- punity for violations of those rights, encompass- ing both preventive action, which included political, economic, legislative and administra- tive m easures, and repressive and/or remedial action that aimed at penalizing violations that had already been committed. The Special Rappo rteur suggested cancelling all or part of the debt and debt servicing of the States that were colonized or subjected to slavery as compensation for the injury suffered; declar- ing violations of economic, social and cultural rights to be international crimes; drawing up an optional protocol on economic, social and cul- tural rights requiring States to report on m eas- ures adopted or planned for a genuine imple- mentation and improved protection of those rights; proposing more sophisticated standards to States to combat impunity in cases of corrup- tion, misappropriation of public or private funds, abuse of trust by public officials, and tax and customs fraud, and giving greater considera- tion to the harm suffered by victims; and estab- lishing and improving machinery for monitoring the management of public affairs. He also sug- gested the holding of a high-level international meeting on the impunity of perpetrators of viola- tions of economic, social and cultural rights. On 29 August [res. 1996/24], the Subcommission asked the Special Rapporteur to submit his final report in 1997. The Secretary-General was asked to provide any assistance required by the Special Rapporteur. Independence of the judicial system Report of Special Rapporteur. In March, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Dato'Param Cumaraswamy (Malaysia), submitted his second r eport [E/CN.4/1996/37], in w hich he discussed his man- date, methods of work and 1995 activities. The Special Rapporteur reviewed various is- sues which he considered im portant for the de- velopment of an independent judiciary. He con- cluded that the use of \"faceless\" judges to combat terrorism in Colombia and Peru violated theprinciple of the independence of the judiciary, restricted the defendant's right of due process, and violated the right to a fair trial in a systematic way; welcomed the proposal to establish an Inter- national Criminal Court, and the 1995 adoption by a group of experts in international law of the Johannesburg Principles on National Security, Freedom of Expression and Access to Informa- tion; and expressed concern about the relation- ship between the media and the judiciary. He ob- served that the 1995 adoption of the Beijing Statement of Principles of the Independence of the Judiciary in the LAWASIA (Law Association of Asia and the Pacific) Region would be an invalu- able supplement to existing standards. Other subjects dealt with in the r eport were mecha- nisms for the appointment of judges; conflicts between the legal profession and the ju diciary; the commercialization of the legal profession; and the 1995 Cairo Declaration adopted at the Third Conference of Francophone Ministers of Justice. The Special Rapporteur provided an analysis of information received concerning at- tacks on the judiciary, a summary of allegations transmitted to Governments, information re- ceived from Governments in response to his ini- tial communications and in response to the alle- gations transmitted, as well as follow-up with authorities and sources, and specific comments, conclusions and observations. He summarized his communications with international organiza- tions, including the W orld Bank, and with the Council of Europe. The Special Rapporteur concluded that the in- dependence of judges and l awyers rem ained a se- rious concern. Nonetheless, he observed that cur- rently there was greater awareness of the importance of judicial independence for main- taining the rule of law and protecting human rights. Judicial independence was threatened not only by the executive arms of Governments and legislatures, but by organized crime, powerful businessmen, corporate giants and multinational corporations. The Special R apporteur stated that he intended to observe certain specific trials of particular interest to his mandate, either person- ally or through a representative appointed by him. He called on Governments to respond to his inter- ventions promptly, and, in cases where m issions were sought, he called on them to respond without delay. In the absence of a monitoring mechanism, the Special Rapporteur sought the cooperation of NGOs and other organizations to provide him with timely information on any attacks on the inde- pendence of judges and law yers in their respective countries or neighbouring countries. Commission action. On 1 9 April [res. 1996/34], the Commission on Human Rights invited the630 Human rights High Commissioner for Human Rights to con- tinue to provide technical assistance to train judges and lawyers and to assist the Special Rap- porteur in developing a m anual on the training of judges and lawyers in human rights. It asked the Special Rappo rteur to report in 1997 and the Secretary-General to assist him. Right to a fair trial On 29 August [res. 1996/29], the Subcommis- sion, recalling a 1994 resolution [YUN 1994, p. 1029] in which it expressed its appreciation to Special Rapporteurs Stanislav C hernichenko (Russian Federation) and William Treat (United States) for their final report on the right to a fair trial and a remedy, and approved their pr oposal to compile the entire study so that it could be published in one volume in the UN Human Rights Study Se- ries, asked Mr. Chernichenko and David W eiss- brodt (United States), having recognized the completion of Mr. Treat's term as a Subcommis- sion member, to compile and update the study so that it could be published in that series in all offi- cial UN languages. Capital punishment In 1995 [YUN 1995, p. 747], the Secretary-General submitted his fifth qui nquennial report on capi- tal punishment, containing information on the implementation of safeguards guaranteeing pro- tection of the rights of those facing the death penalty. A 1996 report [E/CN.15/1996/19] covered 12 additional replies from Governments. On 23 July, in resolution 1996/15, the Economic and Social C ouncil took note of the Secretary- General's report (see PART THREE, Chapter IX). Other issues Terrorism Report of Secretary-General. By a February note [E/CN.4/1996/43], the Secretary-General pre- sented views concerning terrorism submitted by Governments and regional and intergovernmen- tal organizations. As requested by the General Assembly in 1994 [YUN 1994, p. 1112], the views of Governments on the establishment of a UN vol- untary fund for victims of terrorism were also presented. Commission action. On 19 April [res. 1996/47], the Commission on Human Rights condemned all acts, met hods and practices of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, as well as incite- ment to ethnic hatred, violence and terrorism. Noting that a 1994 Subcommission decision [YUN 1994, p. 1112] concerning the preparation of a work-ing paper on human rights and terrorism had not yet been implemented, it called on the Subcom- mission to report on the matter in 1997. The Secretary-General was asked to continue to col- lect information on terrorism and to make it available for consideration by special rapporteurs and working groups concerned and to the Com- mission. Subcommission action. On 29 August [res. 1996/20], the Subc ommission condemned all acts, methods and practices of terrorism, regardless of their motivation, in all forms and manifestations, wherever and by whomever comm itted. It called on Governments to take measures to prevent, combat and eliminate terrorism, and urged the international community to enhance coopera- tion at the national, regional and international levels. The Subcommission decided to entrust Kalliopi K. Koufa (Greece) with the task of pre- paring a working paper on terrorism and human rights, for submission in 1997. Hostage-taking On 23 April [res. 1996/62], the Commission on Human Rights, emphasizing that the taking of hostages constituted a serious obstacle to the full enjoyment of all human rights and was, under any circumstances, unjustifiable, demanded that all hostages be released im mediately and without any preconditions. It called on States to take all measures necessary to prevent, combat and pun- ish acts of hostage-taking, and asked rel evant NGOs to bear in mind, where appropriate, the problem of hostage-taking in their deliberations. All thematic special rapporteurs and working groups were urged to address, as appropriate, the consequences of hostage-taking in their forth- coming reports to the Commission. Extra-legal executions Report of Special Rapporteur. The Commis- sion on Human Rights had before it in 1996 a re- port [E/CN.4/1996/4] subm itted by its Special Rap- executions, Bacre Waly Ndiaye (Senegal), updating his activi- ties since the submission of his 1995 report [YUN 1995, p. 750]. He discussed his mandate and activi- ties undertaken to promote it, and described situations where urgent appeals and other com- munications alleging violations of the right to life had been transmitted to Governments, together with replies or observations received from them. Issues of special concern to the Special Rap- porteur related to violations of the right to life of women; violations of the right to life of persons under 1 8 years of age; massive displacement of populations; violations of the right to life againstProtection of human rights 631 persons exercising their right to freedom of opin- ion and expression; the protection of human rights in the administration of justice; violations of the right to life of persons belonging to na- tional or ethnic, religious and linguistic minori- ties; violations of the right to life of staff mem- bers of the United Nations and specialized agencies; violation of the right to life and terror- ism; violations of the right to life committed by civil defence forces; deaths caused by l and-mines; cooperation with the High Commissioner for Human Rights; and safeguards and guarantees to protect the right to life. The Special Rapporteur's conclusions and rec- ommendations dealt with capital punishment and the desirability of the abolition of the death penalty; impunity, including legislation exempt- ing perpetrators of human rights abuses from prosecution and failure to pursue or conclude in- vestigations; the rights of victims; and allegations received and acted upon by the Special Rap- porteur, including death threats, deaths in cus- tody, deaths due to abuse of power by law enforce- ment officials, violations of the right to life by paramilitary groups, violations of the right to life in armed conflict and expulsion of persons to countries where their lives might be at risk. Commission action. On 23 April [res. 1996/74], the Commission on Human Rights, strongly con- demning all extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, demanded that Governments ensure that those practices were ended and that they should take action to combat and eliminate them. It asked the Special Rapporteur to continue ex- amining situations of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary detention and to report annually; re- spond to information he received; enhance his dialogue with Governments and follow up on his recommendations after country visits; continue to pay special attention to extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions of children and women and to allegations concerning the right to life; pay special attention to executions where the vic- tims were carrying out peaceful activities in de- fence of human r ights and fundamental free- doms; continue monitoring the implementation of existing international standards on safeguards and restrictions relating to the imposition of capital punishment; and apply a gender perspec- tive in his work. The Secretary-General was asked to inform the Commission on the implementation of a 1995 Economic and Social Council decision [YUN 1995, p. 750]; to continue to use his best endeavours in cases where the minimum standard of legal safe- guards provided for in articles 6, 9, 1 4 and 15 of the 1966 International Covenant on Civil andPolitical Rights [YUN 1966, p. 423] appeared not to be respected; and to continue to ensure that per- sonnel specialized in human rights and humani- tarian law issues formed part of UN missions, where appropriate, in order to deal with serious human rights violations, such as extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. The Commis- sion asked the Special Rapporteur to s ubmit an interim report to the General Assembly in 1996. The Commission's request to the Special Rap- porteur was approved by the Council by decision 1996/279 of 24 July. Report of Special Rapporteur. By an October note [A/51/457], the Secretary-General transmit- ted an interim report of the Special Rapporteur covering the period from 20 July 1992 to 1 Sep- tember 1996, the time during which the current Special Rapporteur had been in office. The Spe- cial Rapporteur offered an interpretation of his mandate and the legal framework within which it had been implemented and covered his met hods of work and activities. He discussed various situa- tions involving violations of the right to life and presented an account of issues requiring his spe- cial attention. The Special Rapporteur's recommendations related to the death penalty, death threats, death in custody, excessive use of force by law enforce- ment officials, violations of the right to life dur- ing armed conflict, genocide, imminent expul- sion of persons to countries where their lives were in danger, impunity and the rights of victims. GENERAL AS SEMBLY ACTION On 12 December, the General Assembly adopted resolution 51/92. Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions The General Assembly, Considering that the subject of extrajudicial, sum- mary or arbitrary executions has been discussed in the United Nations for many years within the framework of discussions on human rights based on the general recognition of the right to life of every person as guar- anteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and a large number of other inter- national human rights instruments, that extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions can be fought effec- tively only through a genuine will on the part of Gov- ernments to enforce the safeguards and guarantees for the protection of the right to life of every person, that declarations of commitment to the protection of the right to life by Governments are only effective if they are translated into practice and respected by all and that, if the aim is protection of the right to life, the em- phasis must be on prevention of all forms of violations of this fundamental right, 1. Strongly condemns once again all the extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary ex ecutions that continue to take place throughout the w orld;632 Human rights 2. Demands that all Governments ensure that the practice of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary execu- tions be brought to an end and that they take effective action to combat and eliminate the phenomenon in all its forms; 3. Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impa rtial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, arbitrary or summary executions, to identify and bring to justice those re- sponsible, to grant adequate compensation to the vic- tims or their families and to adopt all necessary meas- ures to prevent the recurrence of such executions; 4. Reiterates also that the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on extrajudicial, sum- mary or arbitrary executions needs to be able to re- spond effectively to credible and reliable information that comes before him, and invites him to continue to seek the views and comments of all concerned, includ- ing Member States, in the elaboration of his report; 5. Reaffirms Ec onomic and Social Council decision 1995/284 of 25 July 1995, in which the Council ap- proved the decision of the Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 1995/73 of 8 March 1995 to ex- tend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extra- judicial, summary or arbitrary executions for a three- year period, and recommends that the Comm ission at its fifty-fourth session continue his mandate; 6. Takes note of the interim report of the Special Rapporteur; 7. Notes the important role the Special Rapporteur has played towards the elimination of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; 8. Notes that the Comm ission on Human Rights, in its resolution 1996/74, requested the S pecial Rap- porteur, in carrying out his mandate: (a) To continue to examine situations of extrajudi- cial, summary or arbitrary executions and to submit his findings, together with conclusions and recommenda- tions, to the Commission, as well as such other reports as the Special Rapporteur deems necessary in order to keep the Commission informed about such serious situations of extrajudicial, sum mary or arbitrary exe- cutions that warrant its immediate attention; (b) To respond effectively to information that comes before him, in particular when an extrajudicial, sum- mary or arbitrary execution is imminent or threatened, or when such an execution has occurred; (c) To enhance further his dialogue with Govern- ments, as well as to follow up on recommendations made in reports after visits to particular countries; (d) To continue to pay special attention to extrajudi- cial, summary or arbitrary executions of children and women and to allegations concerning violations of the right to life in the context of violence against partici- pants in demonstrations and other peaceful public manifestations or against persons belonging to minori- ties; (e) To pay special attention to extrajudicial, sum- mary or arbitrary executions where the victims are in- dividuals who are carrying out peaceful activities in the defence of human rights and fundamental free- doms; (f) To continue monitoring the implementation of existing international standards on saf eguards and re- strictions relating to the im position of capital punish- ment, bearing in mind the comments made by the Hu-man Rights Committee in its interpretation of article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as the Second Optional Protocol thereto; (g) To apply a gender perspective in his work; 9. Strongly urges all Governments to respond to the communications transmitted to them by the Special Rapporteur, and urges them and all others concerned to cooperate with and assist the Special Rapporteur so that he may carry out his mandate effectively, includ- ing, where appropriate, by issuing invitations to the Special R apporteur when he so requests; 10. Encourages Governments, international organi- zations and non-governmental organizations to organ- ize training programmes and to support projects with a view to training or educating military forces, law en- forcement officers and government officials, as well as members of the United Nations peacekeeping or ob- server missi ons, in human rights and human itarian law issues connected with their work, and appeals to the in- ternational community to support endeavours to that end; 11. Urges the Special Rapporteur to continue to draw to the attention of the United Nations High Com- missioner for Human Rights such situations of extraju- dicial, summary or arbitrary executions as are of par- ticularly serious concern to him or where early action might prevent further deterioration; 12. Welcomes the cooperation established between the Special Rapporteur and other United Nations mechanisms and procedures in the field of human rights, as well as with medical and forensic exp erts, and encourages the Special Rapporteur to continue efforts in this regard; 13. Encourages the Governments of all States in which the death penalty has not been abolished to com- ply with their obligations under the rel evant provisions of international human rights instruments, taking into account the safeguards and guarantees referred to in Economic and Social Council resolutions 1984/50 of 25 May 1984 and 1989/64 of 24 May 1989; 14. Requests the Secretary-General to inform the Commission on Human Rights of the implementation of Economic and So cial Council decision 1995/284, keeping in mind the comments on this matter by the Special R apporteur in his report, in order to enable him to carry out his mandate effectively, including through country visits; 15. Again requests the Secretary-General to continue to use his best endeavours in cases where the minimum standard of legal safeguards provided for in articles 6, 9, 1 4 and 1 5 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights appears not to have been respected; 16. Requests the Special Rapporteur to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-third session an interim report on the situation w orldwide in regard to ext raju- dicial, summary or arbitrary executions and his recom- mendations for more effective action to combat that phenomenon. Adopted wit hout voteGeneral Assembly resolution 51/92 12 December 1996 Meeting 82 Approved by Third Committee (A/51/619/Add.2) without vote, 26 Novem- ber (meeting 53); 50-nation draft (A/C.3/51/L.46), orally revised; agenda item 110 (b). Meeting numbers. GA 51st session: 3rd Committee 38-53; plenary 82.Protection of human rights 633 Freedom of movement On 6 August [dec. 1996/102], the Subcommission decided to add to its agenda a new sub-item enti- tled \"The right to leave any country, including one's own, and to return to one's own country\". On 22 August [dec. 1996/109], the Subcommis- sion decided to entrust Volodymyr Boutkevitch (Ukraine) with preparing a working paper on the right to freedom of movement and related issues for submission in 1997. Mass exoduses Report of Secretary-General. In a February report [E/CN.4/ 1996/42], the Secretary-General provided information and views on solutions that Governments, specialized agencies and intergov- ernmental and non-governmental organizations had found to be effective in the area of mass exo- duses. He also presented a compilation of infor- mation and recommendations from human rights mechanisms on problems resulting in mass exoduses of populations or impeding their vol- untary return home, and his views on those mat- ters. The Secretary-General noted that the problem of mass exoduses, both in ternal and external, had grown over the last few years to alarming di- mensions. In the overwhelming m ajority of cases, they were caused by human rights viola- tions and abuses, including in the context of armed conflict. They were also frequently prompted by deliberate measures to remove a population from its area of origin. The grave hu- man rights violations and humanitarian i ssues called for substantially increased levels of inter- national cooperation and solidarity that im plied action at the l evel of Governments, the Commis- sion on Human Rights, human rights bodies and mechanisms, UN specialized agencies and the non-governmental community. Human rights elements must be further in tegrated into the work of relief agencies, as well as in peacekeeping operations, the Secretary-General said. He em- phasized the importance of specific information and recommendations in the areas of prevention, protection and solutions in cases of mass exo- duses. He stressed the need for an early w arning focus and for particular attention to be paid to vulnerable groups, including women, children and the elderly. It was most fundamental, he said, to call on all States to promote human rights and fundamental freedoms and to refrain from deny- ing them to individuals in their population be- cause of nationality, ethnicity, race, religion or language. Commission action. On 1 9 April [res. 1996/51], the Commission on Human Rights, strongly de-ploring ethnic and other forms of intolerance as one of the major causes of migratory movements, urged States to ensure respect for human rights. It invited special rapporteurs, special representa- tives and working groups of the Commission and UN human rights treaty bodies, acting within their mandates, to seek information on problems resulting in mass exoduses of populations or im- peding their voluntary return home, and to in- clude such information, together with recom- mendations thereon, in their reports, and to bring that information to the attention of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. All UN bodies, the specialized agencies and governmen- tal, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations were asked to cooperate with all Commission mechanisms and to provide them with information on human ri ghts situations cre- ating or affecting refugees and displaced per- sons. The Commission asked the High Commis- sioner to pay attention to situations which caused or threatened to cause mass exoduses and to ad- dress them effectively through emergency pre- paredness and response mechanisms. The High Commissioner was also asked to invite Govern- ments, specialized agencies and intergovernmen- tal and non-governmental organizations to pro- vide information and to prepare for the Commission's 1997 session an update of the Secretary-General's report (see above). Welcom- ing the contributions of the UN High Commis- sioner for Refugees to the deliberations of inter- national human rights bodies and mechanisms, the Commission invited her to address the Com- mission in 1997 (see also PART TH REE, Chapter XII). Internally displaced persons Commission action. On 19 April [res. 1996/52], the Commission on Human Rights, emphasizing the need for better implementation of existing international law applicable to internally dis- placed persons, asked the Secretary-General to publish the compilation and analysis of l egal norms (see below) [E/CN.4/1996/52/Add.2] pre- pared by his representative and to disseminate it widely. It called on the representative to continue, on the basis of his compilation and analysis, to de- velop an appropriate framework for the p rotec- tion of internally displaced persons and to report thereon in 1997. G overnments were called on to continue to facilitate the activities of the Secretary-General's representative and encour- aged to consider inviting him to visit their coun- tries to study and analyse the issues involved. The Commission encouraged the Secretary- General's representative and the High Commis- sioner for Human Rights, as well as the High634 Human rights Commissioner for Refugees, the United Na- tions Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and all other relevant humanitarian as- sistance and development organizations to strengthen their cooperation further. It called on those organizations and agencies to develop, in cooperation with the Secretary-General's rep- resentative, a more comprehensive and coher- ent system of data collection on the situation of and protection of internally displaced persons. The Commission urged those organizations to establish, in pa rticular through the Inter- Agency Standing Committee and its Task Force on Internally Displaced Persons, frameworks of cooperation with the Secretary-General's repre- sentative. The Secretary-General's representa- tive and regional intergovernmental organi- zations were called on to intensify their cooperation with a view to enhancing their sup- port for the representative and strengthening their initiatives to facilitate assistance to and protection of internally displaced persons. The Commission called on the High Commissioner for Human Rights to develop projects, in coop- eration with Governments, relevant international organizations and the Secretary-General's repre- sentative, to promote the human rights of in ter- nally displaced persons, as part of the pro- gramme of advisory services and technical cooperation. The Secretary-General was asked to assist his representative, and the representa- tive was encouraged to continue to seek the con- tribution of local, national and regional institu- tions. Reports of Secretary-General's representa- tive. In a February report [E/CN.4/1996/52], the Secretary-General's representative, Francis M. Deng (Sudan), discussed situations of internal displacement, the extent to which internally dis- placed persons were covered by international hu- man rights and humanitarian law, and the ques- tion of institutional arrangements for providing protection and assistance to the internally dis- placed. As to his activities, the representative stated that country visits and dialogue with Gov- ernments were the cornerstone of his mandate. During his missions he had noted that children and women accounted for most inhabitants of displaced or returnee communities. The strategy required that the internally displaced focus on measures aimed at prevention, protection and as- sistance, and a secure pro cess of return or perma- nent settlement in another area, rehabilitation, reintegration and sustainable development. The representative concluded that the devel- opment of a l egal framework that would providean explicit, adequate and firm basis for protec- tion of and provision of assistance to the inter- nally displaced was imperative, although views still differed as to the form such an inst rument might take. No ins titution existed with an exclu- sive or full mandate for the internally displaced. Country visits helped raise the level of awareness of the problem inside a country and provided op- portunities for a constructive exchange of views. They also offered an opportunity for fact-finding on the particular problems of the situation as well as the generic problems of internal displacement worldwide. By an October note [A/51/483], the Secretary- General transmitted his representative's report on recent developments covering his main areas of work, namely, the development of an appropri- ate framework for meeting the needs of the inter- nally displaced; promoting effective institutional arrangements for protecting and assisting them; and undertaking visits to countries with serious internal displacement problems. In addenda to his report [A/51/483/Add.1,2], the representative described his mission to Ta jikistan (1-12 June), where the main cause of displace- ment had been the civil war in 1992 [YUN 1992, p. 394]. The representative presented an overview of the crisis that had generated internal displace- ment in the country and discussed patterns of displacement, the return of the displaced, and the response of the international community. He addressed the reintegration of returned inter- nally displaced persons and described steps the international community had taken to promote sustainable development and the protection of human rights. He also described initiatives taken by the international community to further the peace process through peacekeeping, political negotiations and other reconciliatory activities. In his conclusions, the representative stated that the conflict remained unresolved, having flared up very seriously during the summer (see PART ONE, Chapter IV). The ongoing conflict rendered long-term planning difficult and in- hibited foreign investment, since the current eco- nomic crisis exacerbated political and economic instability. He proposed strengthening T ajiki- stan's economy, strengthening the rule of law and promoting and protecting human rights, as well as developing an effective judicial system and strengthening compliance with interna- tional human rights standards. Expanded mon- itoring was needed to address abuses along the border with Afghanistan and in the areas of re- newed fighting to which international agencies had had limited access. The Government would also benefit from cooperating with UN organiza- tions, which could provide human rights mon-Protection of human rights 635 itoring, advisory services and institution- building. In a later report [E/CN.4/1997/43/Add.1], the Secretary-General's representative discussed his visit to M ozambique (21 November-3 Decem- ber), where one of Africa's largest displacements of population caused by armed conflict, com- pounded by drought, had taken place between 1977 and 1992. Some one third of the population had been forced to move either inside the coun- try or into one of six neighbouring States. Given the fact that the cou ntry had experienced dis- placement in all its aspects, and that the return process had been described as an overall success, the representative considered that a visit could provide useful insights into the problems of dis- placement and ways to address them construc- tively. He presented an overview of the context in which internal displacement occurred, as well as initiatives taken by the international community to further the peace process through political ne- gotiations, peacekeeping and other activities to support social stability. The representative dis- cussed patterns of displacement and the steps taken to protect and assist the displaced, and de- scribed the conditions under w hich return took place, efforts made to ensure a durable reintegra- tion of the internally displaced, and current chal- lenges. In conclusion, the representative noted that the Government had dem onstrated a re- sponsive attitude towards its citizens and actively sought the support of the international commu- nity in providing assistance and protection to the war-affected population and in its search for a peaceful solution to the conflict. He emphasized that the first condition of a durable solution to displacement was agreement between the parties on a framework for a peaceful resolution to the conflict and their continued commitment to sup- port the peace process. Population transfer Commission action. On 1 9 April [dec. 1996/108], the Commission on Human Rights, taking note of a 1995 decision [YUN 1995, p. 755] and a 1994 resolution [YUN 1994, p. 1028] of the Subcom- mission, decided to endorse a request that the Special Rapporteur submit his final report in 1996 and that the Secretary-General provide him with all assistance needed to complete his work. The Economic and Social Council approved the Commission's decision on 24 July by decision 1996/292. Note by Secretary-General. In a 9 August note [E/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/29], the Secretary-General stated that he had not been in a position to put into effect a 1993 Subcommission request [YUN 1993, p. 887] to organize a seminar, prior to thepreparation of the Special Rapporteur's final re- port, in order to formulate appropriate final con- clusions and recommendations. Because the seminar had not taken place, the Special Rap- porteur was not in a position to submit his final report, but would do so in 1997 provided the nec- essary conditions existed. Subcommission action. On 23 August [res. 1996/9], the Subcommission reiterated its request to the Secretary-General that he convene the ex- pert seminar on population trans fer, in coopera- tion with relevant intergovernmental and non- governmental organizations, in time for its con- clusions to be of use for the Special Rapporteur's final report, and strongly requested the Special Rapporteur to submit his final report in any case in 1997. Disappearance of persons Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances On 1 9 April [res. 1996/30], the Commission on Human Rights deplored the fact that some Gov- ernments had never provided substantive replies concerning cases of enforced disappearances in their countries or acted on the recommendations concerning them made by the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, estab- lished in 1980 [YUN 1980, p. 843]. Governments were urged to cooperate with and assist the Group. The Commission asked the Group to pay par- ticular attention to cases of children subjected to enforced disappearance and children of disap- peared persons, and to cooperate with the Gov- ernments concerned to search for and identify those children. It asked the Group to continue to consider the question of impunity; to identify ob- stacles to the realization of the 1992 Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance [GA res. 47/133]; and to report in 1997. The Secretary-General was asked to keep the Group and the Commission informed of steps taken widely to disseminate and promote the Declaration, and to compile observations from Governments on possible measures they had carried out to take the Declaration into ac- count. Working Group activities. In 1996, the Work- ing Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disap- pearances held three sessions: its forty-eighth in New York (3-7 June) and its forty-ninth and fifti- eth in Geneva (19-23 August, 13-22 November) [E/CN.4/1997/34]. In addition to its original man- date, which was to act as a channel of communica- tion between fam ilies of disappeared persons and Governments concerned, with a view to en-636 Human rights suring that sufficiently documented and clearly identified individual cases were investigated and the whereabouts of the disappeared persons clarified, the Working Group monitored States' compliance with the 1992 Declaration. The total number of cases under active consid- eration stood at 43,980 in 1996. A lthough many of those cases occurred more than 1 0 years ear- lier, there had been no major progress in their clarification. The number of countries with out- standing cases of alleged disappearance was 63. During the period under rev iew\u2014up to 22 No- vember, the last day of the Group's third annual session\u2014the Group had received some 551 new cases of disappearance in 28 countries. The Group sent urgent action appeals to Govern- ments regarding 97 cases. With a view to making the 1992 Declaration better known and in order to draw G overnments' attention to their responsibilities, the Group con- tinued to adopt general comm ents on specific provisions. The Group adopted general com- ments on article 10, considered a most practical and valuable tool for ensuring compliance by States with their general commitment not to practise, permit or to lerate enforced disappear- ances, and to take effective legislative, adminis- trative and judicial measures to prevent and ter- minate such acts. In its conclusions and recommendations, the Group reminded Governments that authentic co- operation was based on effective action to clarify outstanding cases and pr event new ones. In that respect, results were very poor, and progress in implementing the 1992 Declaration seemed to be extremely slow. The G roup stated that it was es- sential to its activities to continue receiving coop- eration from NGOs, but noted with concern that in some cases they had failed to maintain contact with their source, and, in others, had relegated cases to their archives, thus seriously affecting ef- forts by the Group to follow up on individual cases. Report of Secretary-General. In an October report [A/51/561], the Secretary-General de- scribed action he had taken to disseminate and promote the 1992 Declaration. GENERAL ASSEMBLY ACTION On 12 December, the General Assembly adopted resolution 51/94. Question of enforced or involuntary disappearances The General Assembly, Guided by the purposes and principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declara- tion of Human Rights, the International Covenants on Human Rights and the other relevant international hu- man rights instruments,Recalling its resolution 33/173 of 20 December 1978 concerning disappeared persons and its resolutions 46/125 of 17 December 1991, 47/132 of 18 December 1992 and 49/193 of 23 December 1994 on the question of enforced or involuntary disappearances, Recalling also its resolution 47/133 of 18 December 1992 proclaiming the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance as a body of principles for all States, Expressing concern that, according to the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the practice of a number of S tates can run counter to the Declaration, Deeply concerned, in particular, by the intensification of enforced disappearances in various regions of the world and by the growing number of reports concern- ing harassment, ill-treatment and intimidation of wit- nesses of disappearances or relatives of persons who have disappeared, Convinced that further efforts are needed to promote wider awareness of and respect for the Declaration, and taking note in this regard of the report of the Secretary-General, Bearing in mind Comm ission on Human Rights reso- lution 1996/30 of 19 A pril 1996, 1. Reaffirms that any act of enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity and a grave and flagrant violation of the human rights and fundamental free- doms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Hu- man Rights and reaffirmed and developed in other in- ternational instruments in this field, as well as a violation of the rules of international law; 2. Reiterates its invitation to all Governments to take appropriate legislative or other steps to prevent and suppress the practice of enforced disappearances, in keeping with the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, and to take ac- tion to that end at the national and regional levels and in cooperation with the United Nations, including through technical assistance; 3. Calls upon Governments to take steps to ensure that, when a state of emergency is introduced, the pro- tection of human rights is ensured, in particular as re- gards the prevention of enforced disappearances; 4. Reminds Governments of the need to ensure that their competent authorities conduct prompt and im- partial inquiries in all circumstances, whenever there is reason to believe that an enforced disappearance has occurred in territory under their jurisdiction, and that, if allegations are confirmed, perpetrators sh ould be prosecuted; 5. Once again urges the Governments concerned to take steps to protect the fam ilies of disappeared per- sons against any intimidation or ill-treatment to which they might be subjected; 6. Encourages States, as some have already done, to provide concrete information on measures t aken to give effect to the Declaration, as well as obstacles en- countered; 7. Requests all States to consider the possibility of disseminating the text of the D eclaration in their re- spective nati onal languages and to facilitate its dissemi- nation in the national and local languages; 8. Notes the action taken by non-governmental or- ganizations to encourage implementation of the D ecla- ration, and invites them to continue to facilitate its dis-Protection of human rights 637 semination and to contribute to the work of the Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities; 9. Expresses its appreciation to the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Di sappearances for its hu- manitarian work; 10. Requests the Working Group, in the continued exercise of its mandate, to take into account the provi- sions of the Declaration and to modify its working methods, if necessary; 11. Recalls that the primary role of the Working Group, as described in its reports, is to act as a channel of communication between the families of disappeared persons and the Governments concerned, with a view to ensuring that sufficiently documented and clearly identified indivi dual cases are investigated, and to as- certain whether such i nformation falls under its man- date and contains the required elements, and invites the Group to continue to seek the views and comments of all concerned, including M ember States, in prepar- ing its report; 12. Invites the W orking Group to identify obstacles to the realization of the provisions of the Declaration, to recommend ways of overcoming those obstacles and, in this regard, to continue a dialogue with Govern- ments and relevant intergovernmental and non- governmental organizations; 13. Further encourages the Working Group to con- tinue to consider the question of impunity, in close col- laboration with the rapporteur appointed by the Sub- commission and with due regard for the relevant provisions of the Declaration; 14. Requests the Working Group to pay the ut most attention to cases of children subjected to enforced dis- appearance and children of disappeared persons and to cooperate closely with the Governments concerned to search for and identify those children; 15. Appeals to the Governments concerned, in par- ticular those which have not yet replied to the commu- nications transmitted by the Working Group, to coop- erate fully with it and, in particular, to reply promptly to its requests for information so that, while respecting its working methods based on discretion, it may per- form its strictly humanitarian role; 16. Encourages the Governments concerned to give serious consideration to inviting the Working Group to visit their countries so as to enable the Group to fulfil its mandate even more effectively; 17. Expresses its profound thanks to the many Govern- ments that have cooperated with the Working Group and replied to its requests for information, and to the Governments that have invited the Group to visit their countries, asks them to give all necessary attention to the recommendations of the G roup, and invites them to inform the Group of any action they take on those recommendations; 18. Calls upon the Commission on Human Rights to continue to study this question as a matter of priority and to take any steps it may deem necessary to the pur- suit of the task of the Working Group and to the follow-up of its recommendations when it considers the report to be submitted by the Working Group to the Commission at its fifty-third session; 19. Renews its requests to the Secretary-General to continue to provide the Working Group with all the fa-cilities it requires to perform its functions, e specially for carrying out missions and following them up; 20. Requests the Secretary-General to keep it in- formed of the steps he takes to secure the widespread dissemination and promotion of the Declaration; 21. Also requests the Secretary-General to submit to it at its fifty-third session a report on the steps taken to implement the present resolution; 22. Decides to co nsider the question of enforced dis- appearances, and in particular the implementation of the Declaration, at its fifty-third session under the sub- item entitled \"Human rights questions, including al- ternative approaches for improving the effective enjoy- ment of human rights and fundamental freedoms\".

On 23 April [res. 1996/71], the Commission on Human Rights commended the expert member of the Working Group on En- forced or Involuntary Disappearances for his re- port [E/CN.4/1996/36] describing the situation in 1995 concerning the special process on missing persons in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. It asked for the coordination of efforts by the In- ternational Tribunal for the Prosecution of Per- sons Responsible for Serious Violations of Inter- national Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 [YUN 1993, p. 440] (see PART FOUR, Chapter II), the High Representative appointed in 1995 [YUN 1995, p. 511], the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the state of Bosnia and Herzego- vina, the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Re- public of Y ugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), and ICRC, particularly through the Expert Group on Exhumations and Missing Persons estab- lished under the authority of the High Represen- tative (see PART ONE, Chapter V). They were also asked to prepare a plan for dealing with the issue in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as in the Republic of Croatia. The Commis- sion underlined the need for the estab lishment of an ante-mortem database to assist with the iden- tification of the dead before large-scale exhuma- tions could be considered, and demanded that all parties refrain from any action intended to de- stroy, alter, conceal or damage any evidence of violations of human rights and international hu- manitarian law and that they pre serve such evi- dence. It also demanded that all parties cooper- ate fully with the expert for the special process, the Expert Group and the ICRC Working Group on Missing Persons by providing information to aid in determining the fate of missing persons, in638 Human rights conformity with their obligations under the 1995 Peace Agreement [YUN 1995, p. 544]. The Commission asked the expert for the spe- cial process to assume responsibility for securing support for the activities of the Expert Group and asked the international community to make avail- able the necessary m eans to that end; it also recom- mended that the High Commissioner for Human Rights provide means to assist the expert to secure the necessary financial assistance. The Secretary- General was also asked to continue to provide nec- essary resources. The Commission decided to ex- tend the expert's mandate for one year, a decision endorsed by the Economic and Social Council on 23 July by decision 1996/276, and asked him to continue to report on the subject. Report of expert. In a report to the Commis- sion [E/CN.4/1997/55], the expert stated that he had spent between one and two weeks in the re- gion each month, primarily in Sarajevo. He had met regularly with representatives of Govern- ments, NGOs and the international community, as well as family members of missing persons. During 1996, a total of 3,058 cases had been re- ceived through NGOs and field offices, which were considered, processed and transmitted to the authorities all egedly held responsible. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, some 20,000 per- sons were still missing, the majo rity of whom were Bosnian men of M uslim origin. In Croatia, some 5,000 persons were missing. The expert deeply regretted the uncooperative attitude of the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) towards the problem of many thousands of missing persons in the territory of the former Yugoslavia for whom it bore the main responsibility under in- ternational law. The ante-mortem database (AMDB), a joint proj- ect coordinated by the Expert Group on Exhu- mations and M issing Persons and carried out un- der the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, started in July. During its initial phase, the project focused on collecting data on some 6,500 B osnian Muslims missing from the region of Srebrenica. Since the majority of t heir families lived in and ar ound Tuzla, it was decided to estab- lish the AMDB headquarters there. Following a re- quest from the authorities of the Republika Srpska, it was also decided to establish an office in Banja Luka to collect data on missing persons of Serb origin. Physicians for Human Rights, an NGO, was responsible for the establishment and maintenance of AMDB, and another NGO, the As- sociation for the Promotion of the Ludwig Boltz- mann Institute, was responsible for collecting relevant data by conducting interviews with fam- ily members of missing persons.The expert welcomed the United States initia- tive to establish the International Commission on Missing Persons in the Former Yugoslavia since it comprised, for the first time, high-level represen- tatives of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Ser- bia and Montenegro), Croatia and all Bosnian parties, in addition to a number of well-known personalities. It was his conviction that only a high-level multilateral commission comprising all relevant parties and enjoying the support of the international community would be in a posi- tion to exert sufficient pressure on all authorities concerned to disclose relevant information and to proceed with the excavation of mass graves. Forensic science Report of Secretary-General. In March, the Secretary-General submitted a report [E/CN.4/1996/41] containing comments received from Governments and NGOs on measures taken to introduce into their rules and practices the in- ternational standards set forth in the 1989 Princi- ples on the Effective Prevention and Investiga- tion of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions [YUN 1989, p. 627], as well as the model autopsy protocol set out in the Manual on the Effec- tive Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbi- trary and Summary Executions [Sales No. E.91.IV.1]. The Secretary-General discussed guidelines for investigations for which there were no or few pro- cedures already in place, which were contained in a booklet prepared by the Legal Counsel of the United Nations entitled Guidelines for the conduct of United Nations inquiries into allegations of massa- cres [DPI/1710]. Annexed to the report were names of forensic experts and experts in related fields recommended by Governments and NGOs, as well as the standard cooperation service agree- ment to be used in the event that a Member State or NGO provided the services of a forensic scien- tist and the standard special service agreement to be used in the event that the services of a forensic expert were engaged directly by the United Na- tions. Commission action. On 1 9 April [res. 1996/31], the Commission on Human Rights asked the Secretary-General to consult with Governments, relevant UN bodies, professional organizations of forensic experts, the organizations mentioned in his 1993 [YUN 1993, p. 884], 1994 [YUN 1994, p. 1024] and 1996 reports, as well as other interested insti- tutions, with a view to: identifying experts who might be asked to join forensic teams or to pro- vide advice or assistance to thematic or country mechanisms, advisory services and technical as- sistance programmes; submitting biographical data on experts; and seeking their further advice as to development of principles, guidance, proce-Protection of human rights 639 dures, mechanisms, practical experience and training, in addition to the Manual. The Commission asked the Secretary-General to continue efforts to establish a list of forensic experts and experts in related fields who could be asked to help international mechanisms in the field of human rights, Governments and the Centre for Human R ights in providing technical and advisory services, advice regarding the mon- itoring of human rights violations and training of local teams or assistance in the reunification of families of persons who had disappeared. The Commission's request was approved by the Eco- nomic and Social C ouncil by decision 1996/262 of 23 July. The Commission also asked the Secretary-General to update annually the list of forensic experts and to make it available to work- ing groups, special rapporteurs and experts of UN human rights mechanisms; to ensure that the forensic experts abided by the 1989 Principles [YUN 1989, p. 627]; to provide resources to fund the Centre in implementing the Commission's reso- lution (a request approved by the Council by de- cision 1996/262); and to report in 1998 on pro- gress made. It invited the Centre and the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Di vision of the Secretariat to consider the possibility of revising the Manual. Torture and cruel treatment Reports of Special Rapporteur. In January, Special Rapporteur Nigel S. Rodley (United Kingdom) submitted his annual report [E/CN.4/ 1996/35] to the Commission on Human Rights concerning torture and other cruel, i nhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. He made urgent appeals on behalf of persons who were al- legedly being tortured or whom it was feared might be. The Special Rapporteur transmitted 1 1 3 urgent appeals to 43 Governments concern- ing some 410 individuals, of which at least 31 were known to be women, as well as several groups of persons, with regard to whom fears of torture had been expressed. He also sent 55 let- ters to 48 Governments containing some 750 cases or incidents of alleged torture, about 120 of which concerned women. If the information re- ceived from the sources contained a critical analysis of a more general nature regarding the phenomenon of torture, that information was also brought to the attention of the Governments concerned. Some 41 countries provided the Spe- cial Rapporteur with replies on approximately 330 cases for 1995, wh ereas 26 did so regarding some 330 cases submitted in previous years. The Special Rapporteur provided brief summaries of general allegations, statistics of numbers of indi- vidual cases transmitted and responses received,as well as his observations where applicable. More complete summaries were contained in an addendum to his report [E/CN.4/1996/357Add.1 & Corr.1]. The Special Rapporteur urged Govern- ments to do their utmost to provide the informa- tion he sought in order to enable him to improve his capacity to assess situations accurately. Pakistan. In 1996, the Special Rapporteur visited Pakistan (23 February-3 M arch) [E/CN.4/ 1997/7/Add.2], where he held meetings with gov- ernment officials and representatives of human rights NGOs. He also visited detention centres in Lahore and Karachi, but was not allowed to en- ter a centre in Islamabad, which was operated by the Federal Intelligence Agency. The Special Rapporteur stated that Pakistan was racked by inter-communal and inter-sect strife, and poli- tics took the form of hostile, confrontational and self-interested manoeuvring. Under those circumstances, it was difficult to install a culture of respect for the rule of law. Torture, including rape, and similar cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, were rife in Pakistan, although those with important family, political or international connections were somewhat less likely to su ffer the most extreme forms of torture. Torture was most frequently used to secure confessions or information relating to suspected crimes. It was also used, like arrest and detention, as a means of extorting bribes. Jails were overcrowded and had inadequate medical facilities. The prison regimes appeared to be arbitrary, brutal and op- pressive. The Special Rapporteur welcomed the Aboli- tion of the Punishment of Whipping Act, 1996, as it promised to end judicial sentences of corporal punishment. He recommended that Pakistan be- come a party to the 1984 Convention against Tor- ture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment [GA res. 39/46] (for de- tails see PART TWO, Chapter I); abolish the re- maining use of corporal punishment; terminate the use of bar fetters and similar restraining in- struments; recognize as a criminal offence the unlawful detention of any person and the deten- tion of any person in a place of d etention not offi- cially designated as such; remove police service from the ambit of political patronage and ma- nipulation and ensure that the recruitment, pro- motion and deployment of officers were based on professional merit; improve police remuneration and training; establish independent complaints bodies and bodies with aut hority to inspect any place of detention; and expand special police sta- tions for female suspects. He also advocated the establishment of an independent m onitoring system for prisons, with an NGO component.640 Human rights Venezuela. During his visit to Venezuela (7-16 June) [E/CN.4/1997/77Add.3 & Corr.1], the Special Rapporteur met with high-level government offi- cials, torture victims and their families and hu- man rights NGOs, and visited detention centres in Caracas and Maracaibo. He was of the opinion that torture and sim ilar ill-treatment were perpe- trated on persons in the hands of all the law en- forcement bodies with powers of arrest, deten- tion or interrogation. It was an available technique resorted to at will if there was felt to be an imperative need to secure a confession or in- formation rel evant to the task of repressing crime, whether it was common or po litically mo- tivated crime. Sometimes it was used to \"settle scores\", elicit bribes or \"teach a lesson\" on behalf of those adversely affected by the victim's sus- pected criminal activities, the Special Rap- porteur said. He noted that the constitutional and legal prohibition against incommunicado detention seemed often not complied with. Ac- cess to courts for a remedy was seriously ham- pered by the lack of free legal advice to persons without the means to pay for it. Describing the three detention centres he visited, the Special Rapporteur stated that they were incompatible with the international prohibition of cruel, inhu- man or degrading treatment or punishment, and ranged from anarchic to grossly overcrowded and exiguously restrictive. In two of them, there was no separation of convicted and unconvicted per- sons, nor between those held in respect of graver or lesser crimes. Most of the problems were blamed on the inadequacy of resources, includ- ing undertrained and underpaid police, over- worked judges and shortages in the prison system such as insufficient space, insufficient and inade- quately paid and trained guards, insufficient and inadequate food, and inadequate medical, rec- reational, educational and work facilities. The Special R apporteur made a series of rec- ommendations pertaining to the rights of detain- ees, law enforcement and military personnel, prison conditions and reform of the system of criminal procedure and the judiciary. He stated that serious attention should be given to propos- als for establishing a national institution for the promotion and protection of human rights. Commission action. On 1 9 April [res. 1996/33 B], the Commission on Human Rights stressed that no one should be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punish- ment, and all allegations of those practices should be promptly and impartially examined by the competent national authority. Those who en- couraged, ordered, tolerated or perpetuated such acts must be held responsible and severely punished, and national legal systems should en-sure that victims should obtain redress, be awarded fair and adequate compensation and re- ceive socio-medical rehabilitation. The Commis- sion reminded States that prolonged incommuni- cado detention might facilitate the perpetration of torture and could in itself constitute a form of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. Com- mending the Special R apporteur for his report, the Commission invited him to examine ques- tions concerning torture directed against women and children and conditions conducive to such torture, and to make recommendations on the prevention of gender-specific forms of torture and the torture of children. It approved the methods of work used by the Special Rapporteur and called on him to include in his report infor- mation on the follow-up by Governments to his recommendations, visits and communications. The Secretary-General was asked to provide as- sistance to the Special Rapporteur to enable him to report in 1997. Voluntary Fund for torture victims Commission action. On 1 9 April [res. 1996/33 A], the Commission on Human Rights called on the Board of Trustees of the Voluntary Fund for Vic- tims of Torture, established in 1981 [YUN 1981, p. 906], to present in 1997 an updated assessment of the global need for rehabilitation services for torture victims and of any need for international funding in that regard. Expressing appreciation for previous contributions to the Fund, it ap- pealed to all Governments, organizations and in- dividuals to respond favourably to requests for contributions. The Secretary-General was asked to continue to include the Fund among the pro- grammes receiving donations at the annual UN Pledging Conference for Development Activities; transmit to Governments Commission appeals for contributions; assist the Board of Trustees in its efforts to make the Fund and its humanitarian work better known and in its appeal for contribu- tions; ensure strict and transparent project man- agement rules for the Fund and arr ange for the holding of annual information meetings; ensure the provision of an adequate level of staffing and technical facilities for the Fund; and continue to keep the Commission informed of the Fund's op- erations on an annual basis. By decision 1996/263 of 23 July, the Economic and Social Council approved the Commission's request that the Secretary-General ensure strict and transparent project management rules for the Fund and arrange for the holding of annual information meetings, and ensure an adequate and stable level of staffing and technical facili- ties.Protection of human rights 641 Report of Secretary-General. In October, the Secretary-General presented his annual report on the status of the Fund [A/51/465]. Contribu- tions received between November 1995 and Sep- tember 1996 totalled $3, 194,396; 26 countries contributed, and 5 regular donor countries dis- continued their support. The Board of Trustees held its fifteenth ses- sion in Geneva (20-31 May). The total amount then available for grants to assist victims of tor- ture came to $2,535,500, of which $100,000 was earmarked for an emergency fund for crisis situations outside the Board's annual session. The amount of assistance totalled more than $5 million in 1996, representing 96 projects or sub- projects in 54 countries. On 21 June, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, on behalf of the Secretary-General, approved the Board's rec- ommendations on grants to 96 projects submit- ted by 92 humanitarian organizations. Grants to- talling $2, 435,500 were distributed in Asia and the Middle East (17 projects, 10 countries, $564,500); Western Europe (26 projects, 10 coun- tries, $564,500); Latin America and the Carib- bean (18 projects, 10 countries, $525,000); Africa (16 projects, 15 countries, $396,000); North America (11 projects, 2 countries, $277,000); and Central and Eastern Europe (8 projects, 7 coun- tries, $108,500). Annexed to the report was a list of contributions and pledges made by Govern- ments from February 1982 to September 1996, and a list of humanitarian organizations receiv- ing the Fund's assistance. In a later report [E/CN.4/1997/27 & Add.1], the Secretary-General stated that by year's end the Fund had received additional contributions to- talling $74,076. He r eported that since the Board's May session, two emergency grants had been made\u2014one for $10,000, to provide medical, psychological and social assistance to torture vic- tims from Latin Am erica, the other for $1,500, to provide medical treatment for a torture victim from an African country.

Anti-personnel landmines On 23 August [res. 1996/15], the Subcommission, reaffirming its support for a total ban on the pro- duction, marketing and use of anti-personnel landmines, urged States that had not done so to sign and ratify the 1980 Convention on Prohibi- tions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Con- ventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects and the Protocols thereto [YUN 1980, p. 76]. It urged States to modify, where necessary, their legislation in order to prohibit the production, marketing and use of anti-personnel landmines in and from their territories. The Subcommis- sion asked the Secretary-General to transmit to Governments its appeal for voluntary contribu- tions to the mine-clearance programme and to the Voluntary Trust Fund for Assistance in Mine Clearance established in 1994 [YUN 1994, p. 172]. Weapons of mass destruction On 23 August [res. 1996/14], the Subcommission affirmed that weapons of mass destruction, par- ticularly nuclear weapons, should have no role to play in international relations and therefore should be eliminated. It recommended that rele- vant international forums, particularly the Con- ference on D isarmament (see PART ONE, Chapter VII), should start negotiations on nuclear dis- armament to reduce nuclear weapons globally within a phased programme, thus contributing to the enhancement of international peace and security and the protection of human r ights and fundamental fr eedoms. On 29 August [res. 1996/16], the Subcommission, by a roll-call vote of 15 to 1, with 8 abstentions, asked the Secretary-General to collect informa- tion from Governments, UN bodies and agencies and NGOs on the use of nuclear weapons, chemi- cal weapons, fuel-air bombs, napalm, cluster bombs, biological weaponry and weaponry con- taining depleted uranium, on their consequen- tial and cumulative effects, and on the danger they represented to life, physical security and other human rights. It also asked him to report in 1997 on the information gathered, together with recommendations and views which he mightProtection of human rights 643 have received on ways of eliminating those weap- ons. Economic, social and cultural rights Right to development Reports of Secretary-General. In 1996, the Commission on Human Rights considered a January report [E/CN .4/1996/25] of the Secretary- General describing measures taken to implement its 1995 resolution on the right to development [YUN 1995, p. 757]. The Secretary-General stated that the High Commissioner for Human Rights had given particular attention to the right to de- velopment in the restructuring of the Centre for Human Rights, with a new branch responsible for promoting res pect for that right. In addition, the High Commissioner was developing a strat- egy relating to the right to development and eco- nomic, social and cultural rights. The elements of the strategy included identifying ways to im- prove implementation of those rights, including human rights aspects of a lasting solution to the debt crisis of developing countries; considering the application of findings and recommenda- tions of the Working Group on the Right to De- velopment; promoting the right to development and economic, social and cultural rights at the national level, including pilot projects; identify- ing further social and economic indicators which should facilitate assessing the progressive realiza- tion of those rights; preparing procedures for communications regarding economic, social and cultural rights; identifying international action necessary to promote the right to development; cooperating with international/regional finan- cial and development or ganizations and with the regional economic commissions; and involving NGOs and grass-roots organizations active in de- velopment and human rights in the implementa- tion of the 1986 Declaration on the Right to De- velopment [GA res. 41/ 128]. The Secretary-General stated that he had drawn the General Assembly's attention to the reports of the Working Group on the Right to Development. In an October report [A /51/539], the Secretary- General described activities taken by the UN sys- tem to implement the 1986 Declaration, possible cooperation with regional economic commis- sions, consultations between the High Commis- sioner and the President of the World Bank, and the right to development and the restructuring process of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Centre for Human Rights.Commission action. On 1 1 April [res. 1996/15], the Commission on Human Rights decided to es- tablish for a tw o-year period an intergovernmen- tal working group of exp erts to develop a strategy for implementing and promoting the right to de- velopment, as set forth in the 1986 Declaration. The group would develop practical measures to implement and promote the right to develop- ment, and submit reports and consult with treaty bodies and with the High Commissioner for Hu- man Rights on all issues related to the implemen- tation of the right to development. The group was to be composed of 10 experts, and members would be appointed on the basis of equitable geo- graphical representation. The Commission also asked the High Commissioner to continue his dialogue with appropriate specialized agencies and UN bodies regarding the impact of their pro- grammes on the implementation of the right to development. The Secretary-General was called on to ensure that the working group receive all the assistance it needed and to report in 1997. On 23 July, the Economic and Social Council, by decision 1996/258, endorsed the Commis- sion's decision to establish the working group and approved the terms of its establishment set out by the Commission. The Council decided to consider how best to promote system-wide action to promote and protect the right to development and to deepen the review of all issues relevant to the implementation of that right, including the promotion of a favourable international and na- tional economic environment. Subcommission action. On 29 August [res. 1996/22], the Subcommission decided to continue consideration of questions related to the right to development and to review annually the progress made in international cooperation towards the implementation of the right to development in the context of human rights and the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006) (see PART THREE, Chapter I), pro- claimed by the General Assembly in 1995 [YUN 1995, p. 844]. The Subcommission asked the Secretary-General to invite all relevant UN bod- ies and specialized agencies to step up their ac- tion aimed at international cooperation for the realization of the right to development in the context of the Decade and to provide him with in- formation thereon, and also asked him to trans- mit annually the information received. Intergovernmental Group of Experts. The In- tergovernmental Group of Experts on the Right to Development held its first session in Geneva from 4 to 1 5 November [E/CN.4/1997/22]. The Group made a series of proposals for measures to implement and promote the right to develop- ment for future consideration. It agreed that it644 Human rights would address four broad categories of issues: economic, social, cult ural and civil rights or polit- ical aspects related to the right to development. The Group entrusted its Chairman with compil- ing information on work undertaken in the UN system on indicators for development and hu- man rights and on early w arning mechanisms and methods. An expert member of the Group was entrusted with preparing a study on the pro- motion and implementation of the right to devel- opment by the African Commission on Human and Peoples' R ights, in line with relevant provi- sions of the A frican Charter of Human and Peo- ples' Rights [YUN 1981, p. 942]. The Group felt it necessary to hold an additional two-week session in 1997 and requested the Commission to con- sider that recommendation.

He described general principles upon which the conduct of such a dialogue should be based and presented guidelines for the formula- tion of an equitable and durable solution to the problem of foreign debt. He noted that the prob- lem of foreign debt was one of the most acute fac- tors adversely affecting economic and social development in many developing countries, as well as their full enjoyment of all human rights. As to sharing responsibility for a solution, the646 Human rights Secretary-General examined the responsibility of States at the national level, the duty of States to cooperate with each other at the international level, and the duty of international financial in- stitutions. Commission action. On 1 1 April [res. 1996/12], by a roll-call vote of 34 to 16, with 1 abstention, the Commission on Human Rights stressed the importance of continuing to implement immedi- ate actions for alleviating the debt and debt- service burdens of developing countries within the framework of the realization of economic, so- cial and cultural rights. It asked the Intergovern- mental Group of Experts to pay special attention to the social repercussions of the policies adopted to face the effects of external debt on the realiza- tion of those rights and to make recommenda- tions. The Commission considered that to find a durable solution to the debt crisis, a political dia- logue within the UN system was needed between creditor and debtor countries, based on the prin- ciples of shared responsibility. It asked the Secretary-General to continue efforts to carry out such a dialogue and to report in 1997, following a high-level consultation process with Govern- ments, heads of m ultilateral financial institu- tions and specialized agencies, as well as with intergovernmental and non-governmental or- ganizations, on measures to be implemented to solve the debt crisis. The Commission asked the High Commissioner for Human Rights to con- tinue to pay particular attention to the problem of the debt burden of developing countries. The Secretary-General was asked to establish a pro- gramme unit in the Centre for Human Rights to promote economic, social and cultural rights, in particular those related to the debt burden of de- veloping countries and the impl ementation of the right to development. On 1 1 April [dec. 1996/ 103], the Commission, tak- ing note of a 1995 Subcommission resolution [YUN 1995, p. 761], decided, by a vote of 34 to 16, with 1 abstention, to establish an open-ended working group of the Commission, to meet for a period of one week prior to its 1997 session, to de- velop guidelines based on the preliminary set of basic policy guidelines on st ructural adjust ment programmes and economic, social and cultural rights contained in a 1995 report of the Secretary-General [ Y U N 1995, p. 760], in close coop- eration with the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It also decided to invite Gov- ernments and intergovernmental and non- governmental organizations, as well as the Com- mittee, to contribute to the development of the draft policy guidelines by providing comments for consideration by the working group.ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL ACTION On 23 July, the Economic and Social Council adopted decision 1996/257. Effects on the full enjoyment of human rights of the economic adjustment policies arising from foreign debt and, in particular, on the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development At its 46th plenary meeting, on 23 July 1996, the Economic and Social Council, taking note of Commis- sion on Human Rights resolution 1996/12 of 11 April 1996, approved the Commission's request to the Secretary-General to establish a programme unit in the Centre for Human Rights of the Secretariat for the pro- motion of economic, social and cultural rights, in par- ticular those related to the debt burden of developing countries and the implementation of the right to devel- opment.

Effects of structural adjustment programmes on the full enjoyment of human rights At its 47th plenary meeting, on 24 July 1996, the Eco- nomic and Social Council, taking note of Commission on Human Rights decision 1996/103 of 11 April 1996, and resolution 1995/32 of 24 August 1995 of the Sub- commission on Prevention of Di scrimination and Pro- tection of Minorities, endorsed the Commission's deci- sion to establish an open-ended working group of the Commission to meet for a period of one week prior to its fifty-third session to elaborate, on the basis of the preliminary set of basic policy guidelines on structural adjustment programmes and economic, social and cul- tural rights and in close cooperation with the Commit- tee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, policy guidelines on the subject matter and requested the Secretary-General to provide all the assistance neces- sary to enable the working group to carry out its work. The Council also endorsed the Commission's decision to invite Governments, intergovernmental organiza- tions and non-governmental organizations, as well as the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, to contribute to the elaboration of draft policy guidelines by providing their comments on the pre- liminary set of basic policy guidelines for considera- tion by the working group.

Income distribution Report of Special Rapporteur. In June, Spe- cial Rapporteur Jose Bengoa (Chile) submitted a provisional report on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights, in particular eco- nomic, social and cultural rights, and income dis- tribution [E/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/14]. He analysed in- come distribution at the international level and reported a growing trend towards the concentra- tion of wealth within a small group of countries. He analysed international c ooperation policies, the alleged purpose of which was to ensure that the ever-widening gap did not widen further. The Special Rapporteur also provided an analy- sis of income distribution at the national level, which attempted to reveal main trends, develop an indicator whereby it was possible to list coun- tries on the basis of their domestic income distri- bution, and provide a theoretical classification of countries in accordance with the manner in which income was distributed internally. He out- lined the relationship between income distribu- tion, at the international and national levels, and education and poverty. The report stated that two simultaneous processes of concentration of wealth were under way, one of them at the world level, between rich and poor countries, and the other at the regional level, between large and small countries. In addition, the Special Rap- porteur analysed the value of the concept of equal opportunities as a means of more fully en- suring the fulfilment of economic, social and cul- tural rights. Annexed to the report was an income distribution index in relation to per capita gross domestic product in selected countries. Subcommission action. On 29 August [(res. 1996/26)], the Subcommission asked the Special Rapporteur to pay particular attention to the im- pact of the enjoyment of human rights on income distribution; to take special care to analyse the in- dicators needed to m onitor the full satisfaction of human rights; and to submit his final report in 1997. It asked the Secretary-General to organize a seminar of experts to develop appropriate indica- tors and to m onitor the implementation of com- mitments made by Governments; to invite Gov- ernments, UN bodies, specialized agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental or- ganizations to provide the Special Rapporteurwith information related to the preparation of his report; and to assist the Special Rapporteur. Transnational corporations Report of Secretary-General. In a July report [E/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/12 & Corr.1], the Secretary- General discussed the impact of the activities and working methods of transnational corporations (TNCs) on the enjoyment of human rights, par- ticularly economic, social and cultural rights and the right to development, based on information received from Governments, specialized agencies, and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations. The Secretary-General consid- ered human rights issues related to the transfer of technology and information, the international legal framework relating to TNCs, the need for a new international regulatory framework and relevant norms related to i nternational coopera- tion. He also discussed the need for a people- centred approach to address the negative conse- quences of international technology transfers, such as social problems, deterioration of the hu- man environment and potential use as an instru- ment of domination. Subcommission action. In a 30 August resolu- tion [res. 1996/39], the Subcommission stated that it considered it useful for the Commission on Hu- man Rights to establish for a three-year period a five-member working group of experts, nomi- nated by Governments, to be appointed by the Commission Chairman in 1997, which would identify and examine the effects of the methods of work and activities of TNCs and business enti- ties with franchises and licences from such corpo- rations on economic, social and cultural rights and the right to development. The mandate of the group would be to investigate, monitor, ex- amine and receive communications and gather information on the effects of the methods of work and activities of TNCs on those rights; to make recommendations and proposals aimed at regulating the methods of work and activities of TNCs to ensure that they were in keeping with the economic and social objectives of the countries in which they operated; to promote economic, social and cultural rights and the right to devel- opment; and to prepare annually a list of coun- tries and TNCs, indicating their gross national product or financial turnover, respectively. The Commission was requested to ask the Secretary- General to invite Governments, UN bodies and specialized agencies, and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to submit infor- mation on the effects of the working methods and activities of TNCs, particularly on economic, so- cial and cultural rights and the right to develop- ment.648 Human rights Unilateral coercive m easures Report of Secretary-General. Pursuant to a 1995 request of the Commission on Human Rights [YUN 1995, p. 762], the Secretary-General in January submitted a report [E/CN.4/1996/45 & Add.1] containing replies received from Govern- ments, UN bodies, specialized agencies, and inter- governmental and non-governmental organiza- tions concerning coercive m easures unilaterally implemented against developing countries. Commission action. By a roll-call vote of 32 to 1 4 , with 7 abstentions, the Commission on Hu- man Rights on 1 1 April [res. 1996/9] called on States to refrain from adopting or implementing any unilateral measures not in accordance with international law and the UN Charter, particu- larly those of a coercive nature with extraterrito- rial effects, that created obstacles to trade rela- tions among States. Rejecting the application of such measures as tools for political or economic pressure against any country, particularly against developing countries, the Commission urged the Working Group on the Right to Development to take into account the negative impact of unilat- eral coercive measures in its work on the imple- mentation of the right to development. The Commission asked the High Commissioner for Human Rights to give urgent consideration to its resolution. GENERAL ASSEMBLY ACTION On 12 December, the General Assembly adopted resolution 51/103. Human rights and unilateral coercive measures The General Assembly, Recalling the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, Reaffirming the pertinent principles and provisions contained in the Charter of Economic Rights and Du- ties of States proclaimed by the General Assembly by its resolution 3281 (XXIX) of 12 December 1974, in par- ticular article 32 thereof, in which it is declared that no State may use or encourage the use of economic, politi- cal or any other type of m easures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights, Taking note of the report submitted by the Secretary- General pursuant to Commission on Human Rights resolution 1995/45 of 3 M arch 1995, Recognizing the universal, indivisible, interdepen- dent and interrelated character of all human rights, and, in this regard, reaffirming the right to develop- ment as an integral part of all human rights, Recalling that the World Conference on Human Rights called upon States to refrain from any unilateral coercive measure not. in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations that creates obstacles to trade relations among States and impedes the full realization of all human rights,Bearing in mind all the references to this question in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development, adopted by the World Summit for S ocial Development on 12 March 1995, the Beijing Declaration and the Plat- form for Action, adopted by the Fourth World Confer- ence on Women on 1 5 September 1995, and the Istan- bul Declaration on Human Settlements and the Habitat Agenda, adopted by the United Nations Con- ference on Human Settlements (Habitat II) on 1 4 June 1996, Deeply concerned that, despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and re- cent m ajor United Nations conferences, and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations, unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their ex- traterritorial effects, inter alia, on the economic and so- cial development of targeted countries and peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States, 1. Urges all States to refrain from adopting or imple- menting any unilateral measure not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Na- tions, in particular t hose of a coercive nature with all their extraterritorial effects, which create obstacles to trade relations among States, thus impeding the full realization of the rights set forth in the Universal Dec- laration of Human Rights and other international hu- man rights instruments, in particular the right of indi- viduals and peoples to development; 2. Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for po litical or economic pressure against any country, in particular against de- veloping countries, because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations, in particular children, women and the elderly; 3. Calls upon Member States that have initiated such measures to commit themselves to their obligations and responsibilities arising from the int ernational hu- man rights instruments to which they are party by re- voking such measures at the earliest time possible; 4. Reaffirms, in this context, the right of all peoples to self-determination, by virtue of which they freely de- termine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development; 5. Urges the Commission on Human Rights to take fully into account the negative impact of unilateral co- ercive measures, including enactment of national laws and their extraterritorial application, in its task con- cerning the implementation of the right to develop- ment; 6. Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in discharging his functions relat- ing to the promotion, realization and protection of the right to development, to give urgent consideration to the present resolution in his annual report to the Gen- eral Assembly; 7. Requests Member States to notify the Secretary- General about the implic ations and negative effects of such measures on their populations in the various as- pects referred to in the present resolution; 8. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its fifty-second session on the im- plementation of the present resolution; 9.

On 1 1 April [res. 1996/10], the Commission on Human Rights, reaffirming that extreme poverty and exclusion from society constituted a violation of human dignity and that urgent action was required to eliminate them, asked the Special Rapporteur on the subject, Leandro Despouy (Argentina), to continue to give special attention to the foll owing: the effects of extreme poverty on the enjoyment and exer- cise of all human rights and fundamental free- doms of those affected; efforts by the poorest to exercise their rights and participate fully in the development of their society; conditions in which the poorest could convey their experience and ideas and become partners in the realization of human rights; and means of promoting a better understanding of the experiences and ideas of the poorest and t hose working alongside them. It also asked him to suggest follow-up measures. The Secretary-General was asked to provide the Special Rapporteur with the assistance he needed and to make the Special Rapporteur's second (1995) interim report [YUN 1995, p. 764]available to the special session of the Commission for Social Development and to the next substan- tive session of the Economic and Social Council, at which the coordination segment was to be de- voted to activities taken to eradicate poverty. Report of Special Rapporteur. In June, the Special Rapporteur submitted his final report on human rights and extreme poverty [E/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/13]. He stated that at least 1.1 billion people lived in extreme poverty, and some believed that, if properly re-evaluated, the figure might be as high as 2 billion. It was esti- mated that the number was increasing by 25 mil- lion a year. The Special Rapporteur described ac- tivities relating to poverty, including those of the United Nations D evelopment Programme (UNDP), the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, as well as the outcome of the 1995 World Summit for Social D evelopment [YUN 1995, p. 1113]. He discussed the impact of extreme poverty on human rights, such as the right to a decent standard of living, the right to housing, the right to education, the right to work, the right to health, the right to protection of the family, the right to privacy, the right to recognition as a per- son before the law and to be officially registered, the right to life and the right to physical integrity, the right to justice, the right to take part in politi- cal affairs, and the right to participate in social and cultural life. The Special Rapporteur under- lined the need for a change in the way people per- ceived those living in extreme poverty, whom he said were viewed with fear and contempt. He pre- sented methods for reaching the poorest that fo- cused on involving the poor themselves in design- ing, implementing and evaluating progr ammes. At the international level, the Special Rap- porteur recommended that the subject be dealt with in the context of the U nited Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006) [YUN 1995, p. 844] (see PART THREE, Chapter I) and the agendas of the General Assembly, the Commis- sion and the Subcommission; and by human rights treaty bodies, UN bodies and institutions, and technical and economic cooperation bodies and institutions. He also discussed the i mportant role of human rights education and the mass me- dia. At the national level, he stated that Govern- ments had to draw up a definition of extreme pov- erty, improve conventional indicators and devise methods of measuring all forms of poverty, as well as develop national anti-poverty programmes. The Special R apporteur outlined the machinery necessary to implement the Programme of Action [YUN 1995, p. 1115] adopted in 1995 at the World Sum- mit for Social Development. Subcommission action. On 29 August [res. 1996/23], the Subcommission, expressing deep sat-650 Human rights isfaction to the Special Rapporteur for having prepared his study in consultation with people living in extreme poverty, hoped that his final re- port would be published by the United Nations in all official languages. GENERAL ASSEMBLY ACTION On 12 December, the General Assembly adopted resolution 51/97. Human rights and extreme poverty The General Assembly, Reaffirming the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Politi- cal Rights, the International Covenant o n Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and other human rights in- struments adopted by the United Nations, Considering the relevant provisions of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993, and of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Develop- ment and the Programme of A ction of the World Sum- mit for Social Development, adopted by the World Summit on 1 2 March 1995, Recalling its resolutions 44/148 of 15 December 1989, 44/212 of 22 December 1989, 45/199 of 21 De- cember 1990, 49/179 of 23 December 1994 and other relevant resolutions, Recalling also its resolutions 47/196 of 22 December 1992, by which it declared 1 7 October International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, 48/183 of 21 De- cember 1993, by which it proclaimed 1996 Interna- tional Year for the Eradication of Poverty, and 50/107 of 20 December 1995, by which it proclaimed the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006), Bearing in mind Commission on Human Rights reso- lutions 1992/11 of 21 February 1992, 1993/13 of 26 Feb- ruary 1993, 1994/12 of 25 February 1994, 1995/16 of 24 February 1995 and 1996/10 of 11 April 1996, as well as resolution 1996/23 of 29 August 1996 of the Subcom- mission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protec- tion of Minorities, Recalling its resolution 47/134 of 18 December 1992, in which it reaffirmed that extreme poverty and exclu- sion from society constituted a violation of human dig- nity and stressed the need for a complete and i n-depth study of ext reme poverty, based on the experience and the thoughts of the poorest, Recognizing that the existence of widespread extreme poverty inhibits the full and effective enj oyment of hu- man rights and might, in some situations, constitute a threat to the right to life, Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world, regardless of their economic, social and cultural situation, and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individ- uals, families and groups, who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms, Recognizing that the elimination of widespread pov- erty and the full enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights are interrelated goals,Welcoming the work of the Special Rapporteur on the question of human rights and extreme poverty, and taking into account his final report, 1. Reaffirms that extreme poverty and exclusion from society constitute a violation of human dignity and that urgent national and international action is therefore required to eliminate them; 2. Reaffirms also that, in accordance with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, it is essential for States to foster participation by the poorest people in the decision-making process in the communities in which they live, in the promotion of human rights and in efforts to combat extreme pov erty; 3. Notes with satisfaction that the Special Rapporteur, in the process of preparing his final report, has imple- mented the recommendations of the Commission on Human Rights by paying special attention to the efforts of the poorest themselves and the conditions in which they can convey their experiences; 4. Again calls upon States, the specialized agencies, United Nations bodies and other international organi- zations, including intergovernmental organizations, to give the necessary attention to this problem and to the necessary follow-up to the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur as contained in his final report; 5. Invites the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, within the framework of the imple- mentation of the United Nations Decade for the Eradi- cation of Poverty, to give appropriate a ttention to the question of human rights and extreme poverty; 6. Notes with appreciation the specific action taken by the United Nations Children's Fund to mitigate the ef- fects of extreme poverty on children and the efforts of the United Nations Development Programme to give priority to the search for some means of alleviating poverty within the framework of the relevant resolu- tions, and urges them to continue in this w ork; 7. Decides to consider this question further at its fifty-third session under the sub-item entitled \"Human rights questions, including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms\".

Forced evictions Commission action. On 1 1 April [dec. 1996/104], the Commission on Human Rights, by a vote of 22 to 18, with 9 abstentions, decided to recom- mend that the Economic and Social Council authorize the holding, following Habitat II, of an expert seminar on the practice of forced evic- tions, with a view to developing human rights guidelines on development-based displacement.

In a July report [E/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/11], the Secretary-General up- dated information contained in his 1995 report [YUN 1995, p. 764] concerning guidelines on inter- national events and forced evictions. He stated that good l ocation of the relocation site was one of the most critical aspects of resettlement, as it was the key to access to income-earning opportu- nities. When relocation was unavoidable, a relo- cation/resettlement plan should be prepared and implemented that would ensure sufficient resources to fairly com pensate and rehabilitate those affected. The parties benefiting from the development causing the relocation should pay full relocation costs. Legislation was required to provide for fair compensation to the affected population; it should specify regulations for thevaluation of lost assets, and provide for compen- sation through the substitution of the lost asset by another of comparable productive capacity. The role of NGOs in the pr evention and eli mination of forced evictions was of great importance, the re- port said, because they acted as inter mediaries between policy m akers and affected persons for the mutual benefit of all those involved, and es- pecially to defend the interests of the victims. The Secretary-General noted that developing guidelines on forced evictions could only be a partial solution. They were important, but should not be allowed to be used as a rati onale for encouraging the eviction process. Subcommission action. On 29 August [res. 1996/27], the Subcommission, reaffirming that the practice of forced eviction constituted a gross vio- lation of a broad range of human rights, strongly urged Governments to take immediate measures to eliminate the practice. It asked the High Com- missioner for Human Rights to pay attention to the practice and to take measures to persuade Governments to halt planned forced evictions, as well as to ensure the provision of adequate com- pensation when evictions had already occurred. The Subcommission asked the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements to do everything it could to prevent the practice of forced evictions by using the good offices of the Secretary- General to persuade Governments to refrain from carrying out forced evictions and by com- piling annual lists of all eviction cases br ought to its attention. The Secretary-General was asked to convene an expert sem inar on the practice of forced evictions and the relationship of that prac- tice to internati onally recognized human rights, with a view to developing a set of comprehensive human rights guidelines on forced evictions, and to report on the seminar and on the guidelines in 1997. Right to food On 29 August [res. 1996/25], the Subcommission appealed to the world's leaders who were to assem- ble for the World Food Summit in Rome in No- vember 1996 (see PART THREE, Chapter XIII) to reaffirm the right of everyone to be free from hun- ger; to propose ways in which the right to food could be further clarified and impl emented; and to ensure that due advantage be taken of the work of the Commission and the Subcommission, as well as of the UN treaty bodies monitoring the relevant international human rights legal instru- ments regarding the right to adequate food and other rights relevant to satisfying the nutr itional needs of the human being for survival, develop- ment, productivity and well-being.652 Human rights Scientific c oncerns Human rights and the environment Report of Secretary-General. As requested by the Commission on Human Rights in 1995 [YUN 1995, p. 762], the Secretary-General, in a January report with later addenda [E/CN.4/1996/23 & Add.1,2], summarized the views of eight Govern- ments, as well as of specialized agencies and in- tergovernmental and non-governmental organi- zations, on the final (1994) report of the Special Rapporteur on human rights and the environ- ment [YUN 1994, p. 1123]. Commission action. On 1 1 April [res. 1996/13], the Commission asked the Secretary-General to renew his request for the opinions of Govern- ments, specialized agencies, and intergovern- mental and non-governmental organizations on issues raised in the Special Rapporteur's 1994 re- port, and to report thereon in 1997. Note by Secretary-General. By a note of 10 July [E/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/31], the Secretary-General stated that, pursuant to a 1995 Subcommission request [YUN 1995, p. 762], the Commission, in a resolution adopted on 1 1 April (see above), had extended the time by which it asked the Secretary-General to report on opinions based on the Special Rapporteur's report until at least one session following the report's publication. Toxic wastes Report of Special Rapporteur. In February, Special Rapporteur Fatma Zohra Ksentini (Alge- in 1995 [YUN 1995, p. 763] to investi- gate and examine the effects of the illicit dump- ing of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in African and other developing countries on the enjoyment of human rights, s ubmitted a prelimi- nary r eport [E/CN.4/ 1996/17]. She noted that the volume of wastes produced by industrialized countries continued to rise, with public opposi- tion having brought about a virtual moratorium on the treatment and disposal of waste in some of those countries. Those difficulties had increased incentives for companies to find outlets for wastes in poor, less industrialized countries. The difference in domestic legal standards and the relative costs of disposing of toxic wastes had pro- voked multiple movements of w astes across fron- tiers. Despite general awareness that the trans- boundary m ovement of hazardous w astes had become a global problem demanding global so- lutions, and despite efforts of developing coun- tries to halt international movements of wastes, there had been an increase in their export from industrialized countries towards the developing world, mainly owing to the proliferation of waste\"recycling\" programmes, which allowed waste traders to adapt to changing conditions. Other problems were the transfer of polluting indus- tries, industrial activities and technologies that generated hazardous wastes to less industrialized countries, and the production and export to de- veloping countries of products that had been banned, withdrawn, s everely restricted or not ap- proved in industrialized countries. The Special Rapporteur recommended that all States adopt and implement existing conven- tions relating to the dumping of toxic and dan- gerous products and wastes and cooperate in the prevention of illicit dumping. Commission action. On 1 1 April [res. 1996/14], by a roll-call vote of 32 to 16, with 3 abstentions, the Commission on Human Rights reaffirmed that illicit traffic and dumping of toxic and dan- gerous products and wastes constituted a serious threat to the human rights to life and good health. It asked the Special Rapporteur, in pre- paring her next report, to consult all rel evant bodies, particularly the secretariat for the 1989 Basel Convention on the Control of Transbound- ary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal [YUN 1989, p. 420], and to continue to un- dertake a study of illicit traffic in, transfer to and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in African and other developing coun- tries, with a view to making recommendations in her next report on measures to control, reduce and eradicate those phenomena. The Rap- porteur intended to include in her next report in- formation on countries and enterprises engaged in the illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in African and other developing countries and i nformation on persons killed, maimed or otherwise injured in developing countries through those acts. The Secretary-General was asked to assist the Special Rapporteur. Scientific progress and human rights On 23 August [dec. 1996/110], the Subcommis- sion decided to entrust Osman El -Hajj\u00e9 (Leba- non) with the task of preparing a working paper on the potentially adverse consequences of scien- tific progress, and its applications for the integ- rity, dignity and human rights of the individual, and called on the in ternational scientific commu- nity and the international organizations con- cerned to cooperate with him. Slavery and related i ssues Commission action. On 23 April [res. 1996/61], the Commission on Human Rights, expressing grave concern at manifestations of contemporaryProtection of human rights 653 forms of slavery, asked the Secretary-General to invite eligible States that had not ratified or ac- ceded to the three slavery conventions\u2014the 1926 Slavery Convention, the 1949 Conv ention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of O thers [GA res. 317(IV)], and the 1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery [YUN 1956, p. 228]\u2014to consider doing so. It asked Mem- ber States to consider the possibility of taking ac- tion to protect particularly vulnerable groups, such as children and m igrant women, against ex- ploitation by prostitution and other slavery-like practices. Governments were asked to pursue a policy of information, prevention and rehabilita- tion of children and women victims of the exploi- tation of prostitution and to take the necessary economic and social measures. The Commission approved the draft programme of action for the prevention of traffic in persons and the exploita- tion of the prostitution of others [YUN 1995, p. 766], while taking note of differences between States in the scope of applicability of their criminal legis- lation with regard to prostitution and the pro- duction, distribution and possession of porno- graphic material. The Commission also asked the Secretary- General to examine, in cooperation with relevant UN agencies, particularly the W orld Health Or- ganization (WHO), as well as the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) and all relevant NGOs, the reliability of allegations re- garding the removal of organs and tissues of chil- dren and adults for commercial purposes, in or- der to enable the Commission to decide on follow-up to the matter. The Secretary-General was asked to designate the Centre for Human Rights as the focal point for the coordination of activities in the UN system for the suppression of contemporary forms of slavery. Working Group activities. The five-member Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slav- ery, at its t wenty-first session (G eneva, 17-26 June) [E/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/24 & Corr.1], reviewed develop- ments in the area of contemporary forms of slav- ery and measures to prevent and repress all its forms. It examined the suppression of the traffic in persons and of the exploitation of the prostitu- tion of others, illegal adoptions, traffic in human organs and tissues, bonded labour and child la- bour, forced labour, migrant workers, and other matters such as early marriages, incest and de- tained juveniles. The Working Group also ad- dressed the a ctivities of the Special R apporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, and of the Special Rap- porteur on violence against women. The reviewof information provided to the Working Group showed that despite progress made in protecting human rights and preserving human dignity, various forms of slavery still existed and new, in- sidious forms of slavery were emerging. The Group adopted a series of recommendations on the issues it had considered. Reports of Secretary-Ge neral. In a June re- port [E/CN.4/Sub.2/AC.2/1996/4], the Secretary- General provided replies received from Govern- ments and UN organizations and bodies in re- sponse to his request for information concerning their investigation of allegations that children were victims of, or even killed for, the removal of organs for commercial transplants and measures taken to counteract that practice wherever it ex- isted. By another June report [E/CN.4/Sub.2/AC.2/ 1996/1], the Secretary-General presented the views of Governments, UN organs and bodies and intergovernmental bodies concerning action taken to combat the sexual exploitation of chil- dren. Subcommission action. On 23 August [res. 1996/12], the Subcommission adopted a resolution on issues considered by the Working Group. The subjects addressed included: prevention of traf- fic in persons; the sale of children, child prostitu- tion and child pornography; traffic in human or- gans and tissues; eradication of child labour and bonded labour; forced labour; migrant workers; and violence against women. Fund on sl avery Commission action. On 23 April [res. 1996/61], the Commission on Human Rights, noting with concern that, since its 1991 establishment by the General Assembly [YUN 1991, p. 563], the UN Vol- untary Trust Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery, as a result of its continuing difficult fi- nancial situation owing to a lack of contributions, could not be used for the purposes for which it was established. It asked the Secretary-General to transmit once again to all Governments the Com- mission's appeal for contributions to the Fund, and commended the Fund's Board of Trustees for its efforts to remedy the Fund's continuing fi- nancial difficulties. The Commission asked the Secretary-General to examine the feasibility of alignment and harmonization of the procedures and mechanisms of the Fund with other existing procedures and mechanisms and to report thereon in 1997. Subcommission action. On 29 August [res. 1996/18], the Subcommission asked the Secretary- General to make available to the W orking Group the report he had been asked to prepare by the Commission concerning the feasibility of align-654 Human rights ment and harmonization of the procedures and mechanisms of the Fund with other existing pro- cedures and mechanisms. It urged Governments and intergovernmental organizations, private in- stitutions and private individuals to respond fa- vourably to requests for contributions to the Fund. Report of Secretary-General. In a December report [E/CN.4/1997/76], the Secretary-General noted that on 10 December the UN High Com- missioner for Human Rights sent a letter drawing the attention of Governments to a Commission appeal for contributions to the Fund. The High Commissioner also sent a letter to the five- member Board of Trustees of the Fund explain- ing the process of restructuring the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights/Centre for Human Rights. In that regard, on 30 Septem- ber, a provisional team was established to manage five UN trust and voluntary funds dealing with human rights. Therefore, the Secretary-General determined, all matters regarding the UN Vol- untary Trust Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery had been studied and carried out in line with those of other human rights trust funds. It was estimated that the amount available for grants in 1997 tota lled $27,524, which might not be sufficient to allow the Board to make recom- mendations for travel grants to allow a few NGO representatives to participate in the Working Group's 1997 session, or to recommend a few other grants for NGO programmes to be devel- oped in 1997. Sexual exploitation during periods of armed conflict Commission action. On 11 April [dec. 1996/107], the Commission on Human Rights, taking note of a 1995 Subcommission resolution [YUN 1995, p. 766], decided to endorse the Subcommission's de- cision to appoint Linda Chavez (U nited States) as Special Rapporteur with the task of undertaking an in-depth study of the situation of systematic rape, sexual slavery and slavery-like practices during periods of armed conflict. It also decided to invite Governments, UN bodies, the special- ized agencies, regional intergovernmental or- ganizations and NGOs to provide information on the subject. On 24 July, the Economic and Social Council, by decision 1996/291, approved the Commis- sion's decision. Report of Special Rapporteur. In July, Special Rapporteur Linda Chavez submitted her pre- liminary report on the situation of systematic rape, sexual slavery and slavery-like practices during periods of armed conflict [E/CN.4/Sub.2/ 1996/26]. She outlined the purpose and scope ofthe study and provided a historical overview of the use of systematic rape as an i nstrument of policy during the First and Second W orld Wars and in the conflict in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. She reviewed forums with potential jurisdiction to try perpetrators; described possi- ble sanctions against violators of the interna- tional law on the subject; identified possible forms of reparations, including compensation, rehabilitation and restitution; and discussed methods of deterrence and prevention. The Spe- cial Rapporteur concluded that there was a sub- stantial body of international law relating to sys- tematic rape, sexual slavery and slavery-like practices during w artime, including internal armed conflict. Nonetheless, there was a need for further i nquiry as to how those international le- gal standards could be disseminated broadly, used to prevent further violations, applied to past misconduct, and invoked to provide remedies for victims. She presented an outline of issues for consideration in her final report, scheduled to be made in 1997. Subcommission action. On 23 August [res. 1996/11], the Subcommission, welcoming the pre- liminary report of the Special Rapporteur, asked her to submit her final report in 1997. Vulnerable groups Women Violence against women Report of Special Rapporteur. In February, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, Radhika Coomaraswamy (Sri Lanka), submitted a report [E/CN.4/1996/53] examining domestic violence as a violation of international human rights law, as well as the question of domestic violence and other forms of violence against women in the family. She presented a checklist of existing na- tional legislation on domestic violence as re- ported by Governments and analysed the legal mechanisms available in various countries, in connection with which she submitted a frame- work for model legislation on domestic v iolence [E/CN.4/1996/53/Add.2]. The Special Rapporteur outlined strategies for States to prevent violence against women, urging them to ratify interna- tional human rights in struments; withdraw their reservations to all human rights instruments, particularly the 1979 Convention on the Elimina- tion of All Forms of Discrimination against Women [GA res. 34/180]; comply with r eporting re- quirements of human rights instruments, ensur- ing the inclusion of gender-specific information;Protection of human rights 655 establish special units or procedures in hospitals to identify women victims of violence and coun- sel them; define the powers of the police regard- ing violence against women and provide training to all police; undertake legal literacy campaigns to inform women of their legal rights; ensure that family laws were just and that they provided for the equal protection of women, men and chil- dren; ensure women's economic empowerment through equal remuneration for equal work and increased job opportunities; provide a mech- anism through which victim-survivors could in- voke State protection to enforce their desire to separate; grant full child custody to women in cases of dom estic viol ence; protect the safety of women by allowing them to leave the State or country regardless of whether they had children; recognize the nexus between domestic violence and homelessness; conduct coordinated out- reach efforts in various marginalized communi- ties where there were domestic violence prob- lems; broaden refugee and asylum laws to include gender-based claims of persecution, in- cluding domestic violence; foster cooperative re- lationships between and NGOs; col- lect up-to-date statistical data; reform all laws, practices, policies and procedures that sanc- tioned the practice of son preference; make easily accessible in written form official policies that af- fected, restricted or influenced individuals in the family sphere; adopt legislation making female genital mutilation a crime and implement educa- tion programmes to prevent the practice; pre- vent, prosecute and punish perpetrators of in- cest; recognize marital rape as a crime; and ra tify and comply with ILO conventions on the rights of migrant workers to reduce violence against women migrant workers and take an active stance against their abuse. At the international level, the Special R apporteur recommended adoption and ratification of an optional protocol to the 1979 Convention allowing women the right to seek re- dress for the violation of their rights; adoption of an international convention on the elimination of violence against women; examination by the Commission of reports prepared by NGOs to as- sess the res ponse to and inclusion of gender- specific information in their work; expansion of the mandates of thematic mechanisms that lacked specificity regarding violence against women; and the allocation of resources to human rights bodies and mechanisms specifically to ad- dress violations of the human rights of women. Military sexual slavery In an addendum to her report on violence against women [E/CN.4/1996/53/Add.1 & Corr.1], theSpecial Rapporteur described her 1995 visit to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), the Republic of Korea and Japan on the issue of military sexual slavery in wartime, n ota- bly the provision of women for members of the Japanese Imperial Army during the Second World War. During the mission, the Special Rapporteur, among other things, attempted to clarify the de- mands of former \"comfort women\" and to un- derstand what remedies the Government of Ja- pan was proposing to resolve the matter. The Special Rapporteur summarized some of the 16 testimonies she heard in all three countries and discussed the com pensation sought by the women, including their reaction to a proposed settlement by Japan by way of the Asian Peace and Friendship Fund for Women. Japan had es- tablished the Fund, to compensate the women with contributions from civilians. The Special Rapporteur stated that the DPRK had requested Japan to \"accept full r esponsibil- ity under international law for the crimes it com- mitted and, on the basis of that responsibility, apologize for all its acts\"; pay compensation to the surviving women; and identify and prosecute under national law all persons involved in the comfort women establishment. The Sp ecial Rap- porteur presented the DPRK's legal interpreta- tion with regard to Japan's liabilities under inter- national law. The Special Rapporteur stated that the posi- tion of the Republic of Korea was different from that of the DPRK, in that a 1965 bilateral treaty be- tween the Republic of Korea and Japan had set- tled property claims resulting from the Japanese occupation, but not personal damages. No de- mands for financial compensation had been made by the Republic of Korea; however, it supported the activities of NGOs and women's groups de- fending the rights of the surviving victims. The Special Rapporteur said that Japan had argued that the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 for the protection of war victims and other instruments of international law did not exist during the period of the Second W orld War and, therefore, the Government was not responsible for violating international humanitarian law. Japan had admitted that the \"then Japanese mili- tary was directly or indirectly involved in the es- tablishment and management of comfort sta- tions and the transfer of comfort women\", and that military pers onnel had taken part directly in the recruitment, which was carried out against the will of the women. The Sp ecial Rapporteur stated that the Government of Japan had not ac- cepted legal responsibility, but in many state- ments appeared to accept moral responsibility.656 Human rights The Special Rapporteur saw the Fund as an ex- pression of the Government's moral concern for the fate of comfort women. The Special Rapporteur made a series of rec- ommendations for action by Japan, including that Japan should pay compensation to individ- ual victims and set up a special administrative tri- bunal for that purpose with a limited time-frame, since many of the victims were of a very advanced age; ensure a full disclosure of documents and materials relating to the situation; make a public apology in writing to individual women who had come forward and could be substantiated as vic- tims; amend educational curricula to reflect his- torical realities; and identify and punish per- petrators. In addition, she proposed that inter- national NGOs continue to raise awareness of the issues within the United Nations; that an attempt be made to seek an advisory opinion of the Inter- national Court of Justice (ICJ); and that the Gov- ernments of the DPRK and the Republic of Korea consider requesting the help of ICJ to resolve the legal issues concerning Japanese responsibility and payment of compensation to the women. Other reports Later reports of the Special Rapporteur dis- cussed her mission to Poland (24 May-1 June) on the issue of trafficking and forced prostitution of women; to Brazil (15-26 July) on the i ssue of do- mestic violence; and to South Africa (11-18 O cto- ber) on the issue of rape in the community. Poland. Concerning her visit to Poland, the Special Rapporteur stated that her report [E/CN.4/1997/47/Add.1] on trafficking and forced prostitution of women was intended as a case study of a phenomenon that affected many coun- tries of origin in Central and Eastern Europe in addition to Poland, such as Belarus, the Czech Republic, the Russian Federation and U kraine, as well as a number of countries of destination, such as Austria, Belgium, Germany, the Nether- lands and Switzerland. In addition, Poland, ow- ing to its geographical location in Central Europe, was not only a country of origin for traf- ficking, but also a transit country for those women who moved from Eastern Europe to the West. The Special Rapporteur stated that there was a strong correlation between trafficking and un- employment. It was also contended, the Special Rapporteur said, that economic liberalization brought with it organized enterprises involved in sex and pornography. The Special Rapporteur identified the most common types of prostitution and enumerated ways to combat the problem. She stated that the international framework governing traffickingand forced prostitution was the 1949 Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others [GA res. 317(IV)], which she noted established no mechanism to oversee the Convention's imple- mentation. Mistrust of the police was seen as a major obstacle, especially in countries of destina- tion. Recommendations included increased coop- eration, regionally and internationally, to combat trafficking, and to exchange information among the police and the judiciary; revision of the immi- gration policies of countries of destination; ex- panding the Human Rights, Ethics and Law Network of the HIV/AIDS and Development Programme of UNDP to include a focus on women victims of forced prostitution and traf- ficking; formulating a national policy to elimi- nate the problem of forced prostitution and traf- ficking; constructing social policy to ensure that marginalized women were given alternative ave- nues for their vocations and livelihood; and put- ting forward educational material that com bated negative stereotypes of women. The Special Rap- porteur also proposed that NGOs and wom en's groups attempt to set up at local levels organiza- tions and groups to help women victims of traf- ficking and prostitution. Brazil. The Special R apporteur visited Brazil [E/CN.4/1997/47/Add.2] to study the issue of domes- tic violence against women. She explained that intimacy complicated and obscured the criminal- ity of the use of physical violence in cases of do- mestic violence. Economic independence was a crucial factor affecting wom en's response to do- mestic violence, as most victims did not have al- ternative accommodation, independent liveli- hoods or the means to pay for legal proceedings. Many people with whom the Special Rapporteur met noted the importance in Brazilian society of machismo\u2014the notion of male superior- ity\u2014which was said to result in extreme male dominance. She stated that although many cul- tures shared a sense of male superiority, ma- chismo legitimized not only male superiority but the use of violence against women. There existed a general perception that black women were more susceptible to violence, and that violence in upper-class families was less reported because of the stigma attached to reporting to the police. Regarding combative and preventive meas- ures, the Special Rapporteur stated that Brazil was a State party to the 1979 Convention [YUN 1979, p. 895] and had withdrawn all of its reservations. At the regional level, it was a s ignatory to the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence against Women and was bound to its obligations. TheProtection of human rights 657 Government had developed a plethora of pro- grammes aimed at raising aw areness with regard to violence against women, and the Brazilian leg- islature had taken many initiatives at federal and state levels. As to the judiciary, according to an expert, only 2 per cent of male perpetrators were actually convicted, and sentences in cases of do- mestic violence were often for less than one year. The Ministry of Justice was trying to promote alternative sentences and rehabilitation pro- grammes for perpetrators, since such actions were felt to be more effective than imprisonment. The Special Ra pporteur recommended dis- seminating ideas and concepts contained in the 1993 Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women [GA res. 48/104]; establishing a clearing house for information on ways to combat domestic violence; devising an integrated strat- egy aimed at eliminating violence against women in all parts of the country; establishing shelters for victims and rehabilitation programmes for perpetrators; and creating specialized domestic violence courts. South Africa. At the invitation of the Govern- ment of South Africa, the Special Rapporteur visited [E/CN.4/1997/47/Add.3] Pretoria, Johannes- burg and Cape Town to study the issue of rape in the community. The Special Rapporteur con- cluded that, in addition to the inherently violent character of the society, the status, real and per- ceived, of South African women greatly contrib- uted to their victimization through rape and sex- ual violence. She stressed that the measures taken by the Government to eliminate violence against women, particularly rape, had only been in place for a very short time and their effectiveness could not be fully evaluated. She recommended that South Africa ratify the human rights instruments to which it was a signatory; take measures to ac- cede to the First [YUN 1966, p. 423] and Second [YUN 1989, p. 484] Optional Protocols to the 1966 Inter- national Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and to the 1990 International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families [GA res. 45/ 158]; re- define and develop the criminal justice system; increase the number of female officers in the po- lice services; amend rules of evidence regarding sexual violence; ensure for the whole police force mandatory progr ammes of awareness-raising and training regarding gender issues and prob- lems associated with investigating and prosecut- ing violence against women; and introduce changes in school and university curricula to teach a balanced gender perspective, and manda- tory gender-sensitization training in medical and legal schools.Commission action. On 1 9 April [res. 1996/49], the Commission on Human Rights condemned all acts of gender-based violence against women, and emphasized the duty of Governments to re- frain from engaging in vio lence against women and to prevent, investigate and punish such acts. It also condemned all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict and called for an effective response to those viola- tions, particularly murder, systematic rape, sex- ual slavery and forced pregnancy. Stressing the Special Rapporteur's conclusions and recom- mendations, the Commission called on States to ratify and implement relevant international hu- man rights instruments; include in reports infor- mation pertaining to violence against women and measures taken to impl ement the 1993 Decla- ration on the Elimination of Violence against Women [GA res. 48/ 104]; enact or reinforce penal, civil, labour and administrative sanctions in do- mestic legislation to punish and redress the wrongs done to women and girls who were sub- jected to violence; create, improve or develop, and fund training programmes for judicial, le- gal, medical, social, educational and police and immigrant personnel; enact and enforce legisla- tion against perpetrators; condemn violence against women and not invoke custom, tradition or practices in the name of religion to avoid obli- gations to eliminate such violence; pr omote re- search, collect data and compile statistics relating to the prevalence of different forms of violence against women and encourage research into the causes, nature, seriousness and consequences of violence against women; cooperate with special rapporteurs; and enact and enforce legislation protecting girls from all forms of violence, in- cluding female infanticide and prenatal sex se- lection, genital mutilation, incest, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, child p rostitution and child pornography. The Commission asked Govern- ments to support initiatives of women's organiza- tions and NGOs to raise awareness of the problem and to contribute to its elimination. The Secretary-General was asked to continue to assist the Special Rapporteur and provide adequate as- sistance for periodic consultations with the Com- mittee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) (see PART THREE, Chap- ter X). He was also asked to ensure that the Spe- cial Rapporteur's reports were brought to the at- tention of the Commission on the Status of Women and of CEDAW. On 23 July, the Economic and Social Council, by resolution 1996/12, urged Member States to undertake strategies, develop policies and dis- seminate materials to promote women's safety in the home and in society at large, including spe-658 Human rights cific crime prevention strategies that reflected the realities of women's lives and addressed their distinct needs concerning social development, environmental design and educational pro- grammes in crime prevention. Subcommission action. On 29 August [res. 1996/21], the Subc ommission asked that, where appropriate, studies submitted at its 1997 session include gender-disaggregated statistics and dis- cuss ways in w hich gender affected the various forms of abuse to which women were subjected, the consequences of those abuses, the availability and accessibility of remedies, the relationship be- tween the abuses suffered by women and the sub- ordinate status of women in public and private life, any gaps in existing international standards of protection, and gender-specific recommenda- tions to remedy those violations. The Secretary-General was asked to ensure that UN human rights and humanitarian relief personnel received training to enable them to recognize and address human rights violations directed at women and to carry out their work without gender bias. Violence against women migrant workers Commission action. On 1 1 April [res. 1996/17], the Commission on Human Rights called on States to adopt measures for the effective imple- mentation of the 1993 Declaration, including ap- plying them to women migrant workers, as well as all relevant measures emanating from recent world conferences. It asked the High Commis- sioner for Human Rights, the Centre for Human Rights and the Special R apporteur on violence against women as well as all relevant UN bodies and programmes, to give particular attention to the issue of violence perpetrated against women migrant workers. It welcomed the UN expert group meeting on the issue of violence against women migrant workers (see below), which had been asked to submit to the General Assembly in 1996 recommendations for improving coordina- tion of the various efforts of UN agencies on the issue of violence against women migrant workers and to develop concrete indicators as a basis for determining the situation of women migrant workers. The Commission asked the Special Rap- porteur to consider reporting in 1997 on the issue of violence against women migrant workers. Expert group meeting. In September, the Secretary-General presented the conclusions and recommendations [A/51/325] of the expert group meeting on violence against women migrant workers (M anila, Philippines, 27-31 May) and the actions taken throughout the UN system on the situation of women migrant workers, as well ascomments from Governments describing ap- proaches in dealing with the is sue. The expert group meeting focused on the de- velopment of indicators and on improving coor- dination among UN organizations with respect to the problem of violence against women work- ers. The meeting made extensive recommenda- tions on the types of indicators that might be used; they covered the issues both of violence against women and of tracking international migration conditions. The meeting recom- mended that the appropriate UN body under- take as soon as possible studies in selected send- ing and receiving countries to obtain valid basic data on the extent and nature of violence against women migrant workers and to gain an in-depth understanding of the impact of violence on women migrant workers, their families and their communities. Concerning coordination within the United Nations, the meeting recommended that the Administrative Committee on Coordina- tion (ACC) serve as the focal point responsible for coordinating initiatives on the problem. The re- port said that ACC, its task forces and the Inter- Agency Committee on Women should examine the mandates and policies of UN agencies and bodies to identify where their work could be en- hanced, as well as undertake a review of the effec- tiveness of existing policies on migration, women and violence against women to identify gaps in addressing issues related to violence against women migrant workers. On 12 December, the General Assembly, in resolution 51/65, asked the High Comm issioner for Human Rights, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women and all relevant UN bod- ies, when addressing the issue of violence against women, to give particular attention to the issue of violence perpetrated against women migrant workers. Traditional practices affecting the health of women and children Report of Special Rapporteur. In June, the Special Rapporteur on traditional practices af- fecting the health of women and children, Ha- lima Embarek Warzazi (Morocco), submitted a report [E/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/6] containing informa- tion received from Governments, UN bodies, specialized agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations on progress achieved and obstacles encountered in imple- menting the 1994 Plan of Action for the Elimina- tion of Harmful Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children [YUN 1994, p. 1123]. Subcommission action. On 29 August [res. 1996/19], the Subcommission regretted the lack ofProtection of human rights 659 information from Governments on the imple- mentation of the Plan of A ction. It stressed the importance of continuing to monitor m easures taken by Governments towards the elimination of those practices, particularly through the Plan of Action. The Subcommission decided to extend the Special Rapporteur's mandate for two addi- tional years and called on the Centre for Human Rights to assist her. The Secretary-General was asked to transmit the Special Rapporteur's final report to the Commission. Traffic in women and girls Commission action. On 19 April [res. 1996/24], the Commission on Human Rights called on Gov- ernments of origin, transit and destination, and regional and international organizations, to im- plement the Platform for Action of the Fourth (1995) World Conference on Women [YUN 1995, p. 1170] by: ratifying and enforcing international conventions on trafficking in persons and on slav- ery; addressing the root factors of traffic in women and girls; stepping up cooperation and concerted action by relevant law enforcement authorities; allocating resources to provide pro- grammes to heal and rehabilitate into society vic- tims of trafficking; and developing educational and training programmes and policies and con- sidering enacting legislation aimed at preventing sex tourism and trafficking. It asked the Subcom- mission to encourage its Working Group on Con- temporary Forms of Slavery to con tinue to ad- dress the issue of traffic in women and girls. Report of Secretary-General. As requested by the General Assembly in 1995 [YUN 1995, p. 1189], the Secretary-General in August reported [A/51/309] on traffic in women and girls. He de- scribed the problem and reviewed national and international laws and treaties, and di scussed ap- proaches and measures to address trafficking taken by the Commission on the Status of Women, the Commission on Human Rights and the Commission on Crime Prevention and Crimi- nal Justice, as well as measures taken at the na- tional level. The Secretary-General presented a series of recommendations on possible measures to im- prove reporting on the implementation of inter- national instruments concerned with the prob- lem. On 12 December, the General Assembly, in resolution 51/66, ca lled on Governments to criminalize t rafficking in women and girls and to condemn and penalize all offenders.Women in the UN Commission action. On 1 9 April [res. 1996/48], the Commission on Human Rights called for in- tensified effort at the international level to inte- grate the equal status and human rights of women into the mainstream of UN system-wide activity and to address those issues throughout relevant UN bodies and m echanisms. Welcoming the report of the 1995 expert group meeting on the development of guidelines for the integra- tion of a gender perspective into human rights and programmes [YUN 1995, p. 767], the Commis- sion asked the Secretary-General to distribute the report widely. The Commission encouraged the further st rengthening of cooperation and co- ordination between the Commission on Human Rights and the Commission on the Status of Women (see PART THREE, Chapter X) and be- tween the Centre for Human Rights and the United Nations D ivision for the Advancement of Women, and requested that the joint work plan of the Centre and the Division be made available to the Commission on Human Rights and to the Commission on the Status of Women in 1997. It urged relevant UN entities and human rights bodies, as well as the High Commissioner for Hu- man Rights and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, to provide training in the human rights of women for all UN personnel and offi- cials, especially those in human rights and hu- manitarian relief activities, and promote their understanding of the human rights of women. States and relevant UN bodies were asked to in- clude in their human rights education activities information on the human rights of women. The Commission asked the High Commissioner for Human Rights to consider assigning a high-level staff member within his Office the task of provid- ing advice on integrating the human rights of women throughout the Centre, as well as liaison with other relevant UN bodies on the matter. The Secretary-General was asked to report in 1997. Subcommission action. On 29 August [res. 1996/21], the Subcommission asked the Secretary- General to ensure the reinforcement and further development of the integration of wom en's hu- man rights into the mainstream of UN activities; to establish the post of focal point on women in the Centre for Human Rights and to ensure that women's human rights were effectively sup- ported at all levels in the UN system; and to fulfil his target of having women hold 50 per cent of managerial and decision-making positions by the year 2000.660 Human rights Children Sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography Report of Special Rapporteur. In a January re- port [E/CN.4/1996/100], the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, Ofelia Calcetas-Santos (Philip- pines), discussed developments occurring dur- ing the period October 1994 to N ovember 1995 concerning trafficking in minors, and their sale for commercial adoption, prostitution, pornog- raphy, the exploitation of child labour, use of children in armed conflicts, organ transplants and other purposes, including early m arriages and blood donation. Based on information re- ceived from Governments and NGOs, the Special Rapporteur reviewed developments in the three catalysts for instituting reforms to benefit chil- dren, namely, the justice system, the educational system and the media. The Special Rapporteur's recommendations at the international level were to establish an in- ventory of UN and civilian initiatives and pro- grammes; hold various topical international con- ferences; review legislation with a view to harmonization; impose extremely severe penal- ties on those convicted of child abuse; improve communication and coordination between UN entities concerned with child abuse; and devise a quick-action standard operating procedure to re- spond to urgent cases. At the national and local levels, the Special Rapporteur recommended building a network of contacts for standardized gathering of data, as well as a network to gather evidence on specific cases, with the assistance of UN specialized agencies; designating a focal point to coordinate network construction; and re- viewing nat ional laws to determine if they con- formed to international standards. As for child sex tourism, the Special Rapporteur stated that Governments\u2014not only national tourism admini- strations\u2014as well as the operational sector of tourism should define responsibilities and iden- tify possibilities for joint action. That action, she stated, should be coupled with monitoring mechanisms for effectively imposing sanctions. Commission action. On 24 April [res. 1996/85], the Commission on Human Rights, welcoming the Special Rapporteur's report, asked the Secretary-General to assist her to discharge her mandate fully and to submit an interim report to the General Assembly in 1996 and to the Com- mission in 1997. It welcomed the convening in August of the World Congress against Commer- cial Sexual Exploitation of Children (see below).The Economic and Social Council, by decision 1996/288 of 24 July, approved the Comm ission's request to the Secretary-General. On the same date, the Council, by resolution 1996/26, invited interested Governments fight- ing illicit trafficking in children to collect, wher- ever possible, data and other information on the problem in accordance with national legislation, and to furnish the information to the UN Com- mission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Jus- tice (see PART THREE, Chapter IX). World Congress. By a letter of 20 September [A/51/385], Sweden transmitted the text of the Declaration and Agenda for Action adopted on 28 August by the World Congress against Com- mercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (St ock- holm, 27-31 August). The Congress was or- ganized by the Government of Sweden, in cooperation with UNICEF, End Child Prostitu- tion in Asian Tourism, and the NGO Group for the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Declaration outlined the challenge to protect children from commercial s exual exploitation and the commitment of the Congress against such exploitation. The Agenda aimed at high- lighting existing international instruments, identifying priorities for action and assisting in implementing relevant international instru- ments. It called for action from States, all sectors of society, and national, re gional and interna- tional organizations. Interim report of Special Rapporteur. By an October note [A/51/456], the Secretary-General transmitted the Special Rapporteur's interim re- port. Having participated in various seminars and conferences during the year on the issue of trafficking in children and child prostitution and pornography, the Special Rapporteur noted that the main concern was the problem of sexual ex- ploitation of children and its escalation; there- fore, she had focused her report on the commer- cial sexual exploitation of children. The Special Rapporteur cited causes of the problem: population growth; the erosion of the family structure, and of societal and spiritual val- ues; and the low priority given to development and protection of children in the political sphere, especially in terms of budgetary allocations. Characteristics typifying most commercial sex- ual exploitation of children were that it was in- visible, mobile, global, escalating and highly profitable. The Special R apporteur presented profiles of victims and abusers, and examined motivations for child sexual abuse and effects on children. In considering the justice system, the Special Rapporteur focused on problems associated with law enforcement, prosecution of cases, childrenProtection of human rights 661 appearing before a court of law, and recovery and reintegration programmes. She recommended appointing special police officers to look into cases involving children; conducting information campaigns in cases of perceived police corrup- tion or inefficiency; se tting up mobile units for surveillance of places where children were at greater risk; enforcing laws aimed at protecting children; community i nvolvement in the law en- forcement process; safeguarding the rights of children during criminal court proceedings; en- suring confidentiality of records; utilizing sight- separation procedures (closed-circuit television testimony, video monitors, deposition) during hearings to protect a child victim from confront- ing the accused; improving access to legal and other remedies; and promoting dialogue be- tween the relevant agencies involved in the justice system. The Special Rapporteur stated that the prose- cution of international crimes against children was extremely difficult, expensive and time- consuming. Not only were substantive and proce- dural issues endemic, but national concerns and priorities might also be dissimilar. Differences in language and legal systems and the need to b ring witnesses from abroad further complicated the issue. The Special Rapporteur recommended that cooperative efforts be made by countries and outlined a series of measures for establishing them. In later reports, the Special Rapporteur de- scribed her visits to the Czech Republic (20-25 May) [E/CN.4/1997/95/Add.1] and the United States (9-20 December) [E/CN.4/1997/95/Add.2], which were made at the request of those Governments. Czech Republic. During her visit to the Czech Republic (Prague, Plzen, Brno, Usti nad Labem, Teplice), the Special Rapporteur met with gov- ernmental and non-governmental organizations and concerned individuals, and v isited some field projects assisting children. The Special Rapporteur noted that the general picture in the Czech Republic was encouraging. Police officers, social workers and NGOs in Prague, Teplice and Usti stated that they had never come across any case of the sale of babies. Nothing concrete was reported to the Special Rapporteur concerning trafficking in organs. Cross-border trafficking of children occurred in such areas as North Bohemia in the north-east of the country, bordering Germany. Police officers stated that there was considerable trafficking of prostitutes across the border involving children between the ages of 15 and 18, but that children under 1 5 were not involved. The Special Rap- porteur noted that under Czech law, with respect to sexual consent and sexual relations, a child wasa person under 15. Therefore, persons from ages 15 to 18 were considered as minors, but were no longer children. Some NGOs reported cases of young girls and women wanting to work in Ger- many who often had accepted dubious job offers, and who most of the time ended up in situations of sexual exploitation. According to the Czech authorities, in recent years the number of chil- dren involved in pro stitution and pornography, both girls and boys, had increased steeply, mostly in Prague and N orth Bohemia. NGOs working in the street reported that there were hundreds of boy prostitutes in Prague, the majority boys ages 14 to 20 who had run away from home. Some were homosexuals, but the ma- jority were heterosexual. Most came from dys- functional families; they either were runaway boys or had been rejected by their parents. Child pornography, which in the Czech Republic mainly referred to pornography i nvolving boys, was a growing concern. It was reported that por- nography in the country was usually backed by foreign companies. Sex tourism was described by both governmental and non-governmental sources as a growing phenomenon, with children among its main victims. The Special Rapporteur expressed concern over minority groups in the Czech Republic, par- ticularly the Gypsy comm unity. She was of the impression that children belonging to those groups were further marginalized because of the attitude in some sectors that the problems of chil- dren in prostitution and pornography were not very serious. The Special Rapporteur r ecommended, among other things, establishing a focal point to coordinate the concerns of children; adopting a non-punitive approach to children involved in prostitution; patrolling known areas where boys were available as prostitutes; enhancing coopera- tion between government agencies and NGOs dealing with children; instituting control meas- ures to prevent the use of ch ildren for pornogra- phy; installing greater control and monitoring mechanisms in border regions to prevent traf- ficking; and reviewing programmes and i nitia- tives to ensure that they did not result in unfore- seen adverse effects. United States. In the United States, the Special Rapporteur visited Washington, D.C., New York, Tucson, Phoenix and San Francisco, where she met with high-level government officials and representatives of non-governmental and chil- dren's organizations. She said she had decided to visit the country on the basis of information and materials submitted to her pointing to the exist- ence of child prostitution and child pornogra- phy. She also wished to explore the phenomenon662 Human rights of child pornography and the impact of the Internet in that area in a developed country. In addition, the Special Rapporteur was interested in studying the many initiatives undertaken in the United States, by both Government and NGOs, to combat those problems. Most experts the Special Rapporteur inter- viewed believed that broken families and child abuse within families were the main reasons why children ran away from home. In addition, there were children living on the street who had been thrown out of their homes. She was concerned that statistics and data seemed to be lacking across the country as to the extent of the commer- cial sexual exploitation of children. With the exception of a few cases, she said, commercial sexual exploitation of children seemed to be concentrated in certain areas of the Texas-Mexico border and the California-Mexico border. Customs officials st ated that the trans- portation of children from Mexico to the United States for prostitution by wealthy citizens was a concern. Child prostitutes in San Francisco came from all racial, ethnic and social backgrounds and were as young as nine years old. According to the police, there were 4,000 to 7,000 street chil- dren in the city, of whom an estimated 45 to 50 per cent did not want to return home. Police ex- perts were on 24-hour call for cases involving child prostitution and pornography, and investi- gations followed an approach instituted in 1984 whereby a social worker, a doctor or nurse thera- pist and a police officer immediately attended to the child victims. In San Francisco, lifetime probation for con- victed child-sex offenders was obligatory; regis- tration was required both yearly, on their birth- days, and when they changed residences. Currently, there were 3,000 registered child mo- lesters, of whom some 200 were paedophiles. As to child pornography and the Internet, the Special Rapporteur noted that computer net- works led paedophiles to contact like-minded in- dividuals, with such communications often con- stituting a support basis for their actions. As paedophiles preferred moving images and video sound to computer images, their use of the Inter- net was limited mainly to communication, with videos being sent by mail. The Special Rap- porteur stated that a development which had overtaken legislation was the \"morphing\" of chil- dren's b odies and images to create a \"virtual child\". She felt strongly that whether the image was real or imaginary, the effects remained the same. As for the accessibility of child pornogra- phy by children, the Special Rapporteur stated that parents and family must take responsibility.The Special Rapporteur noted that the United States Supreme Court, in December, agreed to study the Communications Decency Act to de- cide, in 1997, whether Congress had violated con- stitutional rights of free speech by attempting to restrict indecency on the Internet. In her conclusions and recommendations, the Special Rapporteur urged the United St ates Gov- ernment systematically to gather i nformation and data on the commercial sexual exploitation of children, and called on the United States to ratify the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women [GA res. 34/180] and the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child [GA res. 44/25]. She was encouraged by the many federal and state initiatives to investi- gate commercial sexual exploitation and recom- mended that successful investigations be publi- cized nationwide to raise public awareness and to act as a deterrent to potential perpetrators. Child labour Commission action. On 24 April [res. 1996/85], the Commission on Human Rights called on Gov- ernments to take measures to ensure the protec- tion of children from economic exploitation, and urged them to eliminate extreme forms of child labour, such as forced labour, bonded labour and other forms of slavery. Report of Secretary-General. As requested by the General Assembly in 1995 [ Y U N 1995, p. 704], the Secretary-General reported [A/51/492] in October on UN initiatives and programmes, and those of its affiliated agencies, addressing the exploita- tion of child labour. He noted the provisions of various internati onal human rights instruments, International Labour Organization (ILO) mecha- nisms, activities of the Commission on Human Rights and its Subcommission, the work of the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC), and UNICEF-supported country-specific programmes that addressed child labour. The Secretary-General proposed national and international measures aimed at improving co- operation to address child labour issues. Programme of Action In a June r eport with a later addendum [E/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/25 & Add.1], the Secretary-General provided information received from Govern- ments on measures they had adopted to imple- ment the Programme of Action for the Elimina- tion of the Exploitation of Child Labour [YUN 1993, p. 965], adopted by the Commission on Hu- man Rights in 1993.Protection of human rights 663 Children and armed conflict Report of Secretary-General. In a February report [E/CN.4/1996/110], the Secretary-General updated information on a study by expert Gra\u00e7a Machel (Mozambique) on the protection of chil- dren in armed conflict, as called for by the Gen- eral Assembly in 1993 [GA res. 48/157]. The study was being undertaken with the support of the UN Centre for Human Rights and UNICEF. The Secretary-General stated that the expert had made field visits to countries affected by armed conflicts, notably Angola, Cambodia, Lebanon, Rwanda and Sierra Leone. Three re- gional consultations were held: on the impact of armed conflict on children in the Horn of and eastern, central and southern Africa (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, April 1995); on the impact of armed conflict on children in the Arab region (Cairo, Egypt, August 1995); and on the impact of armed conflict on children in West and Central Africa (Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, November 1995). The World Conference on Religion and Peace (Geneva, August 1995) also discussed the issue at a special seminar which adopted statements [E/CN.4/1996/110/Add.1]. Expert study. By a note of 26 August [A/51/ 306], the Secretary-General transmitted the expert's study on the impact of armed conflict on chil- dren to the Assembly. The expert documented some of the most grave impacts of armed conflict on children, stat- ing that one of the most alarming trends was the participation of children as soldiers. They usu- ally had served in supporting roles, such as cooks, porters, messengers and spies, but increasingly were being conscripted as soldiers. Most child soldiers were adolescents, though many were 10 years old or younger, and while the majority were boys, girls also were recruited. The expert dis- cussed the recruitment of children, how they were used, their demobilization and reintegra- tion into society, and steps to prevent recruit- ment. She recommended the launching of a global campaign aimed at eradicating the prob- lem; quiet diplomacy by UN bodies, specialized agencies and international civil society with gov- ernment and non-State forces to encourage the demobilization of child soldiers; including de- mobilization and reintegration measures in peace agr eements; and ensuring the conclusion of the drafting of the optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on i nvolve- ment of children in armed conflicts (see PART TWO, Chapter I). Noting that at least half of all refugees and dis- placed people were children, the expert stated that in the course of displacement, millions of children had been separated from their families,physically abused, exploited and abducted into military groups, or had perished from hunger and disease. She discussed the vulnerability of children in flight, unaccompanied children who had been separated from both parents and not in the care of another adult, children whose parents decide to evacuate them from an area of armed conflict by sending them to friends or relatives or having them join large-scale programmes, chil- dren in refugee and displacement camps, the situation of internally displaced children, chil- dren seeking asylum and children returning to their home communities. She recommended adopting procedures to ensure the survival and protection of unaccompanied children; caring for unaccompanied children in their extended family or the community rather than in institu- tions; prioritizing measures, in all assistance pro- grammes in refugee and displacement camps, to prevent sexual violence, discrimination in deliv- ery of relief materials, and the recruitment of children into the armed forces; addressing the as- sistance and protection needs of internally dis- placed children; developing a legal framework to increase protection for internally displaced per- sons, emphasizing the concerns of children; and supporting Governments in strengthening na- tional legislation challenging any aspect of dis- crimination against women, girls and child- headed households, particularly with respect to custody, inheritance and property rights. The ex- pert urged UNICEF, UNHCR, the Food and Agri- culture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and ILO to give urgent attention to the situation of child-headed households, and to develop pol- icy and programme guidelines to ensure their protection and care. The report stated that rape posed a continual threat to women and girls during armed conflict, as did other forms of gender-based violence, in- cluding prostitution, sexual humiliation and mu- tilation, trafficking and dom estic violence. Boys were also affected, and cases of young boys who had been raped or forced into prostitution, ac- cording to the expert, were underreported. She described situations of child victims of prostitu- tion and sexual exploitation during wartime and the failure to denounce and prosecute wartime rape and other gender-based violence in armed conflict, and discussed preventing gender-based violence. The expert recommended emphasiz- ing, in humanitarian responses in conflict situa- tions, the reproductive health needs of women and girls, which included the issues of access to family planning services, pregnancy as a result of rape, sexual mu tilation, childbirth at an early age or infection with sexually transmitted diseases, and the psychosocial needs of mothers who had664 Human rights been subjected to gender-based violence. She also recommended training for military personnel, including peacekeeping personnel, on their re- sponsibilities towards civilian communities, par- ticularly towards women and children; establish- ing reporting systems for sexual abuse; treating rape as a war crime; improving security in refugee and displaced persons camps for women and girls; and establishing support programmes for victims of sexual abuse and gender-based violence. As to the threat of landmines and unexploded ordnance, the expert stated that currently chil- dren in at least 68 countries lived amid the con- tamination of 1 1 0 million landmines, added to which were millions of items of unexploded ord- nance, bombs, shells and grenades that had failed to detonate on impact. She discussed the special danger of landmines and unexploded ordnance to children; mine clearance; mine awareness and rehabilitation programmes that helped children recover; and the need for an in- ternational ban on the use of landmines. Her rec- ommendations dealt with enacting legislation to ban the production, use, trade and stockpiling of landmines; est ablishing humanitarian mine clearance as part of all peace agreements; govern- ment provision of resources to support long-term humanitarian mine clearance; and the holding of a technical workshop on mine clearance by the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs, UNI- CEF, UNESCO and involved NGOs. The expert observed that an issue closely re- lated to armed conflict was the serious impact on children of the imposition of economic sanc- tions. Most sanctions exempted critical humani- tarian supplies from general embargoes, but those exemptions tended to be ambiguous and were interpreted both arbitrarily and inconsis- tently. They often caused resource shortages; disrupted the distribution of food, pharmaceuti- cals and sanitation supplies; and affected the quality of food, water, air and medicine. The ex- pert proposed ensuring that sanctions provided for humanitarian, child-focused exemptions; exempting UN specialized agency and NGO humanitarian assistance programmes from ap- proval by the Security Council Sanctions Com- mittee; minimizing, in the planning of a targeted sanctions regime, impact on vulnerable groups, particularly children; and monitoring by the Se- curity C ouncil Sanctions Committee of the hu- manitarian impact of sanctions and amending them if they caused undue suffering to children. Concerning health and nutrition, the expert pointed out that many current armed conflicts took place in some of the world's poorest c oun- tries, where children were already acutely vulner- able to malnutrition and disease. The increasedspread of communicable diseases, insufficient at- tention to reproductive health issues, the destruc- tion of health facilities, the disruption of food supplies and malnutrition were other health and nutrition hazards of armed conflict. The expert recommended ensuring the maintenance of ba- sic health systems and services and water supplies by all parties to a con flict; carrying out child- focused basic health needs assessments by or- ganizations working in conflict situations; gov- ernment facilitation of \"days of tranquillity\" or \"corridors of peace\" to ensure continuity of basic child-health measures and delivery of humanita- rian relief; and a consolidated approach by UN agencies to ensure that emergency food and other relief distribution was structured to strengthen family unity, integrity and coping mechanisms. She proposed that parties in con- flict refrain from destroying food crops, water sources and agricultural infrastructure, and urged the World Health Organization (WHO), in collaboration with professional, humanitarian and human rights organizations, to encourage doctors, paediatricians and other health workers to disseminate child rights information and to re- port human rights violations. Apart from direct violence, children were un- der stress from other dimensions of armed con- flict, including destroyed homes, splintered com- munities, and the br eakdown of trust among people. There were also psychosocial concerns such as loss, grief and fear. The expert suggested taking into account psychosocial considerations in all phases of emergency and reconstruction assistance programmes; focusing programmes on supporting the healing process and re- establishing a sense of normalcy; and preventing the institutionalization of chil dren. The expert noted that education gave shape and structure to children's lives, and while all around might be in chaos during periods of armed conflict, schooling could represent nor- mality. She proposed making efforts to maintain education systems during conflicts; m aking preparations to sustain education outside formal school buildings; extending emergency donor funding to include support for education; b ring- ing children together for educational activities as soon as refugee or displaced persons camps were established; and prioritizing support for the re- establishment and continuity of education by do- nors and NGOs. The expert urged CRC to issue strong guidance to States parties on the interpre- tation of articles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child [GA res. 44/25] relating to their respon- sibility to provide education to children. The expert highlighted relevant features of humanitarian and human rights law, and dis-Protection of human rights 665 cussed the reconstruction of war-torn societies in terms of children and their families. The expert recommended the establishment of a Special Representative of the Secretary- General on children and armed conflict who would act as a standing observer, assessing pro- gress achieved and difficulties encountered in implementing the recommendations of the study. She proposed that the Special Repres enta- tive would raise awareness of the plight of chil- dren affected by armed conflict; promote in- formation collection, research, analysis and dissemination; encourage the development of networking to exchange experiences and facili- tate the adoption of measures to improve the situation of children; contribute to coordination efforts; report annually to the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights; work closely with CRC, relevant UN bodies, specialized agencies and other bodies, including NGOs; and maintain contact with the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs and the Inter-Agency Standing Committee. The expert made a series of recommendations for action by Governments, UN bodies, programmes and funds, specialized agencies and other bodies. A separate addendum [A/51/ 306/Add.1] to the expert's report contained statements adopted at the three regional consultations and seminar held in 1995 (see above), as well as those adopted in 1996 at the regional consultation on the impact of armed conflict on children in Asia and the Pa- cific (Manila, 13-15 March); the regional consul- tation on the impact of armed conflict on chil- dren in Latin America and the Caribbean (Santa F\u00e9 de Bogota, Colombia, 17-19 April); and the re- gional consultation on the impact of armed con- flict on children in Europe (Florence, Italy, 10-12 June). The addendum also contained a bibliog- raphy on children and armed conflict. The rights of the child On 12 December, the General Assembly, after considering a wide range of issues relating to children's rights (see also preceding chapter and PART THREE, Chapters X and XI), adopted reso- lution 51/77. The rights of the child The General Assembly, Recalling its resolution 50/153 of 21 D ecember 1995, and taking note of Commission on Human Rights reso- lution 1996/85 of 24 April 1996, Encouraged by the widespread commitment and pol- itical will shown by the unprecedented number of States that have become parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while noting that the goal of achieving universal ratification by 1995 was not reached,Seriously concerned about those reservations to the Convention which are contrary to the object and pur- pose of the Convention or otherwise contrary to inter- national treaty law, and recalling that the Vienna Dec- laration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights, held at Vienna from 1 4 to 25 June 1993, urges States to withdraw such reservations, Reaffirming the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, which states that national and international mechanisms and programmes should be strengthened for the defence and protection of children, in pa rticu- lar the girl ch ild, abandoned children, street children, economically and sexually exploited children, includ- ing through child pornography, child prostitution or sale of or gans, children victims of di seases, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, refugee and displaced children, children in detention, children in armed conflict and children victims of famine, drought and other emergencies, and also requires measures against female i nfanticide and harmful child labour, Reaffirming also that the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration in all actions concern- ing children, Noting with appreciation the im portant work carried out by the United Nations, in particular the Un ited Na- tions Children's Fund, the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the sale of children, child prosti- tution and child pornography and the expert desig- nated by the Secretary-General to undertake the study on the impact of armed conflict on children, Recognizing the valuable work done by relevant inter- governmental and non-governmental organizations for the promotion and protection of the rights of the child, Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions, poverty, natural disasters, armed conflicts, displacement, ex- ploitation, racism and all forms of intolerance, unem- ployment, rural-to-urban migration, illiteracy, hunger, disability and drug abuse, and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for, Recognizing that legislation per se is not enough to prevent violations of the rights of the child, that stronger political c ommitment is needed and that Gov- ernments should impl ement their laws and comple- ment legislative m easures with effective a ction, inter alia, in the fields of law enforcement and the adminis- tration of justice and in social, educational and public health programmes, Recalling the recommendation made by the World Conference on Human Rights that m atters relating to human rights and the situation of children be regularly reviewed and monitored by all relevant organs and mechanisms of the United Nations system and by su- pervisory bodies of the specialized agencies in accord- ance with their mandates,666 Human rights I Implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child 1.

The Subcommission recommended that, at its future sessions, the Group continue to address health and other issues, including edu cation, de- velopment, environment and land. Concerning the Working Group's fifteenth (1997) session, the Subcommission asked the Secretary-General to invite Governments, inter- governmental organizations and indigenous and non-governmental organizations to provide in-formation and data, particularly on matters relat- ing to \"indigenous peoples: environment, land and sustainable development\", which would be the principal item of the Group's 1997 agenda, as well as \"indigenous health\", to be made available as background papers at the session. It also asked him to prepare an annotated agenda for that ses- sion, to include: standard-setting activities, in- cluding a sub-item on the concept of indigenous peoples; review of developments, including sub- items on \"indigenous peoples: environment, land and sustainable development\" and \"indige- nous health\"; a permanent forum for indigenous people; the International Decade; and the study on treaties, agreements and other constructive ar- rangements between States and indigenous peo- ples. The Subcommission asked the Group's Chairman/Rapporteur to inform the Board of Trustees of the UN Voluntary Fund for Indige- nous Populations that the Group would highlight land and environmental issues in 1997, so that the Board could bear that in mind when it met for its tenth (1997) session.

The Centre was represented at meetings and international conferences held to promote the Decade's aims and issues. Pursuant to a General Assembly resolution 50/157, the first meeting of the Advisory Group of the Voluntary Fund for the International Decade of the World's Indige- nous People was held during the year (G eneva, 29 April-1 May). The Advisory Group drew up guidelines for the Fund and a questionnaire for applicants, which were annexed to the report. The Group also decided to consider projects put forward by and on behalf of indigenous people. Depending on the availability of resources from the Fund, the Advisory Group recommended that the Centre give priority to: organizing an in- ternational wo rkshop on a permanent forum for indigenous peoples; developing a project for short-term scholarships to provide indigenous leaders with training and practical experience on human rights and the United Nations, in con- junction with indigenous peoples' organizations and NGOs at Geneva; sponsoring, in conjunction with UNESCO, a human rights training pro- gramme for indigenous representatives and offi- cial delegates of the G overnments of Ecuador and Peru; and providing technical support for an information workshop on the draft declaration on the rights of the indigenous people of the Pa- cific and Asia region, proposed by the Govern- ment of Fiji. It also recommended the provision of the necessary assistance to an indigenous proj- ect of the East Africa Regional Information Of- fice. Subcommission action. On 29 August [res. 1996/34], the Subcommission recommended that special attention be given to improving the extent of indigenous peoples' pa rticipation in planning and implementing Decade activities. It also rec- ommended that the Centre for Human Rights or- ganize a workshop of indigenous journalists, with the participation of the United Nations and other relevant institutions and persons, to im- prove di ssemination of information about the United Nations and its activities relating to in- digenous peoples. The Secretary-General was asked to include in his report to the Assembly the suggestions and r ecommendations made duringthe debate on the Decade at the Working Group's 1996 session. The Working Group was asked to include in its 1997 agenda a separate item enti- tled \"Review of the activities carried out under the programme of activities for the International Decade of the World's Indigenous People during the period 1994-1996\". On the same date [Ires. 1996/32], the Subcommis- sion, noting the concern expressed by some in- digenous and governmental delegations at the Working Group's 1996 session about the need for transparency in the management of the Volun- tary Fund for the Int ernational Decade and the Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations, rec- ommended that the relevant UN departments es- tablish separate accounts and separate bodies for the two funds and, if possible, transfer the finan- cial management of the funds from New York to Geneva. Report of Secretary-General. In an October report [A /51/499], the Secretary-General high- lighted action taken to implement the pro- gramme of activities for the Decade adopted by the Assembly in 1995 [ Y U N 1995, p. 772]. He also de- scribed the observance of the International Day of the World's Indigenous People (9 August) at Headquarters and at Gen eva. The Decade had been observed as part of the proceedings of vari- ous international conferences concerned with its objectives and themes. An Advisory G roup had been established for the Voluntary Fund for the Decade (see above), and the Fund, administered by the Secretary- General, had available resources, as of 12 Sep- tember 1996, amounting to $274,772. The UN Office at Geneva pl anned to implement in 1997 a pilot programme of short-term fellowships for indigenous peoples, to be granted to represen- tatives of three different regions, selected by the Advisory Group. A UNESCO delegation had met with the High Commissioner for Human Rights and officials of the Centre for Human Rights to consider carrying out joint activities under the Decade. An Expert Seminar on Practical Experi- ences Regarding Indigenous Land Rights and Claims (Whitehorse, Canada, 24-28 March) took place at the invitation of the Government of Can- ada and the Centre (see bel ow). Forty representa- tives of indigenous organizations took part in a workshop for indigenous peoples of the Pacific on the UN draft declaration on the rights of in- digenous peoples (Suva, Fiji, 2-4 September). It was organized by the Government of Fiji and sup- ported by UNDP, the European Union, the Ameri- can Friends Service Committee and the C entre. The Centre also held an Inter-Agency Consulta- tion on Indigenous Peoples on 26 July to discuss UN activities relating to indigenous peoples.Protection of human rights 673 The Secretary-General presented information on the activities of regional organizations, Mem- ber States, or ganizations of indigenous people, NGOs and other interest groups, including edu- cation establishments, the media and business. The report's recommendations included: es- tablishing national committees with indigenous participation and regional, national and local fo- cal points to help implement plans of action; ap- pointing Erica-Irene Daes as Special Rapporteur to conduct a comprehensive study on indigenous land rights; more generous donations to the Vol- untary Fund for the Decade; expanding the fel- lowship programme; promoting knowledge and appreciation of the cultures of indigenous peo- ple and preparing teaching material thereon; or- ganization, by the Centre, of a workshop for in- digenous journalists; further technical meetings on indigenous land rights and claims; a commu- nications network guaranteeing the prompt dis- tribution of information about the Decade; giv- ing more time at conferences to discussing matters relating to Decade objectives; a second workshop on a permanent forum for indigenous peoples, in early 1997; adoption of the draft UN declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples during the observance of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1998 (see PART TWO, Chapter I); a review of proj- ects supported by the Voluntary Fund; and a re- port on activities carried out under the Decade programme during the period 1994 to 1996.

Working Group activities. The Working Group established to consider a UN draft decla- ration on the rights of indigenous peoples met in Geneva from 21 October to 1 November [E/CN.4/ 1997/102]. The report of the Group summarized statements by various representatives of delega- tions on articles of the draft, contained in a 1994 Subcommission resolution [ Y U N 1994, p. 999].Voluntary Fund Commission action. On 1 9 April [res. 1996/40], the Commission, expressing its appreciation to the Governments and organizations that had made contributions to the UN Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations, appealed to them and to individuals in a position to do so to con- sider requests for further contributions. Subcommission action. On 29 August [res. 1996/32], the Subcommission, noting the concern expressed by some indigenous and governmental delegations at the Working Group's 1996 session about the need for tra nsparency in the manage- ment of the Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Popu- lations and the V oluntary Fund for the Decade, recommended that the relevant UN departments establish separate accounts and separate bodies for the two funds and, if possible, transfer the fi- nancial management of the funds from New York to Geneva. Report of Secretary-General. In October, the Secretary-General reported [A/51/ 565] on the ac- tivities of the Board of Trustees of the UN Volun- tary Fund for Indigenous Populations on its eighth (24-28 April 1995) and ninth (22-26 April 1996) se ssions, both held in Geneva. The Fund provided financial assistance to representatives of indigenous communities and organizations who wished to participate in the deliberations of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations and the Working Group to elaborate a UN draft declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples. At its 1995 and 1996 sessions, the Board exam- ined requests for financial assistance for 91 and 1 7 1 indigenous representatives, respectively. In the light of the funds available, it recommended, in 1995, the awarding of 53 travel and subsistence grants to beneficiaries from 31 countries and, in 1996, the awarding of 22 travel and subsistence grants for representatives from 1 7 countries to at- tend the 1996 session of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations. In addition, the Board recommended that four travel and subsistence grants be awarded to representatives to attend the Working Group on the draft declaration. The Secretary-General stated that between 1 May 1994 and 21 April 1996, the Fund had re- ceived contributions totalling $308,723, of which $266,563 had been received from seven G overn- ments and $42,160 from four non-governmental sources. Permanent forum for indigenous people Commission action. On 1 9 April [res. 1996/41], the Commission on Human Rights asked the Secretary-General to t ransmit to relevant inter- governmental organizations the report of the first workshop (Copenhagen, Denmark 1995)676 Human rights held on the possible establishment of a perma- nent forum [YUN 1995, p. 779], and comments thereon received by the Centre for Human Rights. It noted a 1995 Assembly recommenda- tion that the Commission consider the conven- ing of a second workshop, and decided to con- tinue consideration of a second workshop in 1997 under the agenda item \"Indigenous is- sues\", which it had added to its provisional agenda on 1 April [dec. 1996/102]. Welcoming a 1995 Assembly recommendation [GA res. 50/157] that the Secretary-General review existing mechanisms, procedures and pro- grammes w ithin the United Nations concerning indigenous people and that he report to the As- sembly in 1996, the Commission asked him to ensure implementation of the review so it could be completed and circulated to Governments, relevant intergovernmental organizations and organizations of indigenous people for their comments in advance of the Assembly's 1996 session. The Commission asked the Working Group on Indigenous Populations at its 1996 session to con- tinue to give priority consideration to the possible establishment of a permanent forum and to sub- mit further comments and suggestions in 1997. The Secretary-General was asked to report in 1997 on the activities undertaken and informa- tion received pursuant to its resolution. Subcommission action. On 29 August [res. 1996/35], the Subcommission welcomed an offer by Chile to host the second workshop on the pos- sible establishment of a permanent forum for in- digenous people. It recommended that such a fo- rum be established in the early part of the International Decade of the World's Indigenous People and that its mandate include questions re- lating to all areas included in the Decade pro- gramme of activities. Report of Secretary-General. As requested by the General Assembly in 1995 [YUN 1995, p. 772], the Secretary-General reported [A/51/493] in October on existing mechanisms, procedures and pro- grammes within the United N ations concerning indigenous people. The Secretary-General discussed the partici- pation of indigenous people in UN meetings on indigenous issues; formulation of policy guide- lines and research activities related to indigenous people; and the work of UN bodies and entities, including the Economic and Social Council and the Commission on Sustainable Development, UNESCO, Habitat, UNDP, ILO, CRC, the United Nations Population F und, the W orld Health Or- ganization, the World Bank, the United Nations Environment Programme, UNICEF, the High Commissioner for Human Rights/Centre forHuman Rights, the Department of Public Infor- mation, the United Nations Non-Governmental Liaison Service, the United Nations Interna- tional Drug Control Programme, the U nited Nations Division for Sustainable Development, the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Development Support and M anagement Serv- ices, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The Secretary-General described funding available for indigenous people and future act ivities and presented the views of indigenous people on existing procedures, mechanisms and pro- grammes. A permanent forum for indigenous people within the United Nations was also con- sidered. The Secretary-General concluded that, on the positive side, it might be suggested that UN ef- forts had contributed to generating widespread public interest in the issue of indigenous people, renewed national commitment to i mproving their conditions, and international initiatives to support those activities. On the other hand, there were inconsistencies on the issue within the UN system. He noted that there were no internation- ally accepted guidelines on the rights of indige- nous peoples. Among the UN agencies, there were wide divergences in approach and level of involvement. In addition, different UN organiza- tions related to indigenous p eople in distinct ways; some UN meetings, even t hose dealing di- rectly with indigenous matters, offered relatively open participation, while others were almost completely cl osed to indigenous organizations. There were virtually no mechanisms that gave the nominated representatives of indigenous or- ganizations or peoples an opportunity to provide expert advice or take part in decision-making. The Secretary-General stated that at a time of financial stringency, it m ight be prudent to con- sider measures that helped to avoid duplication and strengthened cooperation and consistency of approach. He suggested that it might be im- portant to establish procedures that helped to avoid projects and programmes in indigenous areas that were unwelcome by the supposed bene- ficiaries. Study on treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements Commission action. On 1 9 April [dec. 1996/109], the Commission, taking note of a 1995 S ubcom- mission decision [YUN 1995, p. 780], endorsed the Subcommission recommendation to request Spe- cial R apporteur M iguel Alfonso M artinez (Cuba) to submit in 1996 a third report on the study on treaties, agreements and other constructive ar-Protection of human rights 677 rangements between States and indigenous populations to the Wo rking Group on Indige- nous P opulations and to the Subcommission, and, in 1997, a final report to both bodies. The Commission asked the Secretary-General to assist the Special Rapporteur, in particular by providing specialized research assistance and with r egard to visits to Geneva to consult with the Centre for Human Rights, as well as resources to carry out a m ission to examine in situ the contem- porary significance of a historic treaty in one country, to be determined in consultation with the Government concerned, as a practical exam- ple for inclusion in the final report. The Com- mission's request to the Secretary-General was endorsed by the Ec onomic and Social Council by decision 1996/293 of 24 July. Report of Special Rapporteur. In August, the Special Rapporteur submitted his third report [E/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/23], in which it was stressed that the bulk of the data had come from extensive research conducted in 1993, 1994 and early 1995 by him and his consultant. Thus, he stated, the report did not entirely reflect the realities of mid-1996. The report analysed diverse cases in North America, Central and South America and N orth- ern Europe, which illustrated the reversal under- gone by the original juridical condition of sover- eign entities enjoyed by indigenous peo ples at the start of t heir political and economic relations with other non-indigenous peoples, from the time that the latter had arrived on the ancestral lands of indigenous peoples. The Special Rapporteur reserved his conclu- sions and recommendations for inclusion in his final report. Protection of indigenous heritage Commission action. On 23 April [res. 1996/63], the Commission on Human Rights recom- mended to the Economic and S ocial Council a draft resolution for adoption (see below). ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL ACTION On 23 July, the Economic and Social Council adopted resolution 1996/24. Protection of the heritage of indigenous people The Economic and Social Council, Taking note of Commission on Human R ights resolu- tion 1996/63 of 23 April 1996 and resolution 1995/40 of 25 August 1995 of the Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, 1. Requests the Secretary-General to transmit the fi- nal report of the Special R apporteur of the Commis- sion on Human Rights on the protection of the heri- tage of indigenous people, Mrs. Erica-Irene A. Daes,with its annex, as soon as possible to Governments, the specialized agencies, indigenous people's communities and organizations and the intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations concerned, for their comments; 2. Requests the Special Rapporteur to prepare a sup- plementary report on the basis of the comments and information received from Governments, indigenous people's communities and other organizations con- cerned and to include in it a chapter concerning rele- vant activities undertaken in other forums, such as the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organi- zation, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the World Intellectual Property Or- ganization and the World Trade Organization, and to take into consideration, in ter alia, the Convention on Biological Diversity, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experienc- ing Serious D rought and/or Desertification, Particu- larly in Africa and other relevant international instru- ments; 3. Also requests the Special Rapporteur to submit her supplementary report to the Subcommission at its forty-eighth session; 4. Requests the Secretary-General to provide the Special Rapporteur with all the necessary assistance to enable her to carry out her mandate and to complete the study successfully; 5. Decides that the basic and comprehensive study prepared by the Special Rapporteur on the protection of the cultural and intellectual property of indigenous people shall be published in all official languages and disseminated w idely.

Report of Special Rapporteur. In June, Spe- cial Rapporteur Erica-Irene Daes submitted a supplementary report [E/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/22] on the protection of the heritage of indigenous peo- ple, taking into account additional comments and information received from Governments, UN specialized agencies and organizations of in- digenous peoples. She had submitted a p relimi- nary report in 1994 [YUN 1994, p. 1003] and a final report in 1995 [YUN 1995, p. 780]. The Special Rapporteur summarized and ana- lysed the additional information received and presented relevant aspects of recent environ- mental treaties and the implications of recent trade agreements. She noted that parallel efforts to reach an intergovernmental consensus on pro- tection of the heritage of indigenous peoples were being undertaken by several UN organs and specialized agencies. She pointed to an urgent need for communication and coordination to en- sure consistent and mutually reinforcing results. She also proposed entrusting to a member of the Working Group on Indigenous Populat ions,678 Human rights with the approval of the Economic and Social Council, a mandate to: exchange information with all parts of the UN system concerned with the issue; facilitate cooperation and coordina- tion; promote the greatest level of participation by indigenous people; and report to the Council through the Subcommission and the Commis- sion. States should give urgent consideration to providing special funds for the participation of indigenous people in relevant international meetings, she added. Subcommission action. On 29 August [res. 1996/37], the Subcommission decided to transmit to the Commission principles and guidelines for the protection of the heritage of indigenous peo- ple, annexed to the Special Rapporteur's final re- port, with the recommendation that they be adopted. It endorsed the Special Rapporteur's recommendation that a member of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations should be en- trusted with the mandate contained in her sup- plementary report. The Subcommission asked the Secretary- General to convene a technical meeting, with the Special Rapporteur, of representatives of the World Intellectual Property Organization, UNESCO, UNEP, UNDP, FAO and the World Trade Organization to consider how they could contrib- ute to her work, and also to tr ansmit the report of that meeting to the Subcommission and the Com- mission. Indigenous land rights Expert seminar. As part of the activities for the International Decade of the World's Indigenous People, which was approved by the Assembly in 1994 [GA res. 49/214], the Expert Seminar on Practi- cal Experiences Regarding Indigenous Land Rights and Claims (Whitehorse, Canada, 24-28 March) [E/CN.4/Sub.2/AC.4/1996/6] was held. Among the issues addressed were: the obliga- tion of countries to recognize, demarcate and give legal protection to indi genous lands and re- sources; the problems of claims processes; the co- lonial concept of exti nguishment of inherent rights; the link between land rights and self- determination and the experience of indigenous peoples with colonialism; and the loss of lands and resources for military purposes. It also ex- amined the negotiation process and legal ar- rangements for the demarcation, titling and protection of indigenous lands; sustainable devel- opment and arrangements concerning the use and sharing of natural resources; and the role of intergovernmental organizations. The Seminar recommended that Govern- ments renounce discriminatory legal doctrines and policies which denied human rights or lim-ited land and resource rights; adopt corrective legislation and policies; establish fair procedures for reviewing situations and for taking corrective action in cases in which indigenous land or re- sources had been taken or extinguished through processes that were claimed or found to be unfair or discriminatory; ensure indigenous people ac- cess to adequate resources to research and nego- tiate their claims; hold negotiations on a basis of equality, acknowledging indigenous leadership, structures, languages and social and legal sys- tems; recognize land rights and titles and imple- ment effective and appropriate procedures and mechanisms; guarantee access to land of indige- nous peoples deprived of land or lacking suffi- cient land; review their laws and policies; estab- lish impartial mechanisms to oversee and facilitate fair and equitable conclusions to land claims processes and im plement land agree- ments; and encourage trade among indigenous peoples and other parties from different coun- tries. It was proposed that the United Nations consider whether a permanent forum for indige- nous people could play a constructive role re- garding land rights problems; prepare a st udy, with the participation of indigenous experts, on the extinguishment of land rights and its impli- cations, with a view to recommending new ap- proaches; consider, with its specialized agencies, providing technical assistance to States and in- digenous peoples to resolve land claims; before funding demarcation projects, provide for ade- quate consultative mechanisms at all stages of planning and implementation of projects; con- sider holding further consultations, workshops and seminars on the subject; consider ways of harmonizing ex isting guidelines relating to in- digenous peoples; emphasize com parative policy work relating to indigenous land titling; consider creating indigenous advisory councils at all lev- els; or ganize training workshops for representa- tives of indigenous organizations, particularly on land questions; and consider how the 1995 Agree- ment on Identity and R ights of Indigenous Peo- ples [YUN 1995, p. 436] could provide guidance in other situations. It was suggested that the Ce ntre for Human Rights consider collecting examples of indigenous land agreements to facilitate the promotion of technical cooperation. The semi- nar also proposed that military and occupation practices carried out by Governments, which had an impact on the ways of life of indigenous peo- ples, should be open to international considera- tion in accordance with international human rights standards, and that international coopera- tion supporting the administrative management of their lands and resources should include full cooperation with indigenous peoples. Participa-Protection of human rights 679 tion by indigenous peoples in decision-making and policy regarding land resources and devel- opment at all levels, and the provision by States and intergovernmental organizations of develop- ment assistance through organizations of indige- nous peoples, were also recommended. An addendum to the report [E/CN.4/Sub.2/AC.4/ 1996/6/Add.1] contained background papers for the seminar. Subcommission action. On 29 August [res. 1996/38], the Subcommission recommended that the Commission on Human Rights authorize the Subcommission to appoint Erica-Irene A. Daes as Special Rapporteur to conduct a comprehensive study on the problem of recognition of and re- spect for indigenous land rights, which would, among other things, update the status of efforts to secure indigenous land rights and detail prob- lems that continued to exist in that regard, as well as catalogue existing national laws, policies and procedures concerning indigenous land rights. Sacred sites and religious freedom On 29 August [res. 1996/36], the Subcommission asked the Special Rappo rteur on religious intol- erance to take into account the specific problems faced by indigenous people relating to the de- struction and violation of their sacred sites and religious ceremonies. It also asked him to take into account the spiritual relationship the indige- nous communities had with the land and the sig- nificance of traditional lands for the practice of their religion, and to examine the history of events that were responsible for violating their right to freedom of religion and religious prac- tice. The Subcommission recommended that the Special Rapporteur explore in depth the im pact that outside influences had on indigenous com- munities' ability to practise their religion. Migrant workers On 23 August [res. 1996/10], the Subcommission urged countries of employment to review and adopt measures to prevent the use of force against m igrant workers, and to ensure that po- lice forces and migration authorities complied with basic standards relating to decent treatment of all migrant workers. It urged States to sanction employers for the confiscation of passports be- longing to migrant workers, particularly migrant domestic workers. Member States were asked to sign and ratify or accede to the 1990 Interna- tional Convention on the P rotection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families [GA res. 45/ 158] as a matter of priority (for status of Convention, see PART TWO, C hapter I).Family reunification On 12 December, the General Assembly adopted resolution 51/89.

Once again calls upon all States to guarantee the universally recognized freedom of travel to all foreign nationals legally residing in their t erritory; 2.

Calls upon all States to allow, in conformity with international legislation, the free flow of financial re- mittances by foreign nationals residing in their terri- tory to their relatives in the country of origin; 4. Also calls upon all States to refrain from enacting, and to repeal if it already exists, legislation intended as a coercive measure which discriminates against indi- viduals or gr oups of legal migrants by adversely af fect- ing family reunification and the right to send financial remittances to relatives in the country of origin; 5.

Persons with disabilities Commission action. On 1 9 April [res. 1996/27], the Commission on Human Rights called on the Secretary-General to maintain the integrity of programmes within the United Nations relating to persons with disabilities, and asked him to en- sure support for the effective functioning of the Long-term Strategy to Implement the World Pro- gramme of Action concerning D isabled Persons to the Year 2000 and Beyond [YUN 1995, p. 1256]. It also asked him to report biennially to the Assem- bly (a request approved by the Economic and So- cial Council by decision 1996/261 of 23 July) and to make available to the Commission in 1997 the latest report of the Special Rapporteur on dis- ability of the Commission for Social Develop- ment on his monitoring of the 1993 Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities [GA res. 48/96].Report of Secretary-General.

The Commission, recognizing that the Olympic Games had exemplified excellence through edu- cation and cultural expression, reaffirmed the valuable contribution of the Olympic M ovement to the promotion, protection and impl ementation of human rights and to the creation of global friendship and the maintenance of world peace.
