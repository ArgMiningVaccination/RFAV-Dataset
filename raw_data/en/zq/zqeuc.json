After all, to live your best life, your body needs to run the way it's meant to! Many health-conscious people know that the best way to fight off illness is to boost their immune system's functionality. The immune system is a network of cells and tissues that protects the body from foreign anomalies. If your immune system isn't working properly, you are more susceptible to illnesses like the flu. Thankfully, chiropractic can maximize your body's immune function to fight off colds and the flu!! To show you how a chiropractor can boost your immune system, we discuss the close relationship between chiropractic care and proper immune function. Chiropractic Care and the Immune System History of Chiropractic Care and the Immune System To understand how care today can help you stay healthy, it is helpful to look at the history of chiropractic care and illnesses. The 1918 [influenza outbreak](https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/2018/05/outbreak-pandemic-strikes?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI993eqteu5wIVLSCtBh2FvwFIEAAYASAAEgIhsvD_BwE) is a timeless example of the relationship between chiropractic care and illness. In October of 1918, 195,000 Americans died due to the rapidly spreading flu virus. Because of the lack of modern knowledge and technology that we have today about viruses, this illness was devastating. It felt as if there was no real way to combat the spread of the virus. And yet, there was a small percentage of the American population that wasn't getting sick. Naturally, this drew the attention of many across the nation. How were these people not getting sick? While the pandemic spread, chiropractors across the United States focused their attention on providing spinal adjustments that kept the nervous system healthy. Why Does Chiropractic Care Help? Chiropractors help patients stay healthy because chiropractic adjustments [indirectly boost your immune function](https://www.chirohealthusa.com/patients/why-chiropractic-care-is-good-for-your-immune-system/). Overall, studies of the human body have shown an [undeniable link](https://health.usnews.com/health-news/patient-advice/articles/2015/11/30/surprise-chiropractors-can-treat-these-5-conditions) between your nervous, endocrine, and immune system. The three systems share messenger molecules that communicate information throughout the body. Information that is gathered by one bodily system is shared with other systems to create optimal responses for the body to adapt and heal. What does this link have to do with the health of your spine? When one system is not operating at its fullest capacity, neither can any of the other systems. Studies show that a misaligned spine interrupts the functionality of the nervous system. In turn, the immune system does not operate to its fullest capacity, leaving you vulnerable to illnesses like the flu. Luckily, with chiropractic and immune system care, your body can use the built-in intelligence of your nervous system to stay healthy. What Chiropractic and Immune System Care Looks Like It is important to know that seeing a chiropractor once will not magically boost your immune system. While that first adjustment can help you initially, it's necessary to see your chiropractor regularly. In general, knowing [how often you should go to the chiropractor](https://beginwithinscottsdale.com/how-often-should-you-go-to-the-chiropractor/) can vary. Because this [specific chiropractic care](https://beginwithinscottsdale.com/how-to-find-a-good-chiropractor/) is often proactive, your chiropractor is likely to recommend visits to ensure you maintain your adjustments. This is similar to a follow-up with any other doctor. After any treatment, a doctor will want to see how you're feeling. With a chiropractor, the same can be said. Plus, you can discuss any new symptoms you may experience or any changes you may want in your treatment. This way, your chiropractor can make sure the treatment you receive is not only helping you but is also continuing to meet your unique needs.
