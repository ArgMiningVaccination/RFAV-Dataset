Acupuncture at a glance An ancient eastern Asian therapy, acupuncture has become widely accepted in Western medicine. Acupuncture is based on the regulation of energy pathways and circulation within your body. Treatment involves stimulating designated points on the body surface with fine needles. Acupuncture can improve several cancer-related side effects and symptoms, including anxiety, pain, nausea and vomiting, hot flashes, peripheral neuropathy, and sleep disruption. It has not been studied for treating or reducing risk of cancer, and evidence to date shows modest effects on immune function. This review summarizes acupuncture. We discuss related therapies in these other reviews. CancerChoices ratings for acupuncture We rate acupuncture on seven attributes, with 0 the lowest rating and 5 the highest.
