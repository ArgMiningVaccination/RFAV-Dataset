With so many new natural therapies and numerous supplements on the market, it's important to streamline our wellness routine as much as possible to avoid getting overwhelmed. I believe, if something can pull double - if not triple or quadruple - duty, why not lean in and incorporate this beneficial powerhouse on a regular basis? One of my favorite examples of this is apple cider vinegar. You probably already have some in the back of your pantry! But it's hard not to wonder how something as simple and understated as apple cider vinegar can boast so many health benefits. So, look no further and let's dive into all the ways that ACV can level-up your health.

Improves gut health Apple cider vinegar has been shown [ (1)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11756/) to have anti-yeast, antiviral, and anti-fungal benefits which all help support the microbiome for a healthy bacterial balance and improved immune health. Studies have also shown that vinegar can inhibit the growth of certain bacterial colonies like Staphylococcus aureus which are higher in lipopolysaccharides. High levels of these bacterial endotoxins have been linked [ (2)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1785201/) to inflammatory gut problems including leaky gut syndrome. 2. Alleviates heartburn and indigestion Apple cider vinegar has an incredible ability to improve indigestion and heartburn. With my patients, I find that low stomach acid or hypochlorhydria is often the cause behind these uncomfortable problems. I have seen firsthand an improvement in my patients heartburn, acid reflux, and overall digestion when they take a small amount of apple cider vinegar with their meals. 3. Natural antihistamine If you suffer from seasonal or year-round allergies, you'll want to load up on ACV. It's natural antihistamine effects [ (2)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1785201/) can help to lower symptoms of allergies and chronic immune problems including wheezing and sneezing. 4. Stabilizes blood sugar Research has shown that ACV helps to lower fasting glucose and increase your muscles ability to take up sugar from your blood. 5. Reduces cravings Because it helps to stabilize blood sugar, you won't get that \"hangry\" feeling as often as you would on the blood sugar roller coaster. It also helps reduce cravings through decreasing your appetite in a healthy way through increasing your feeling of satiety. 6. Boosts weight loss Fewer unnecessary sugar cravings means you'll take in less empty calories. And when your blood sugar is stabilized, it translates into improved metabolic health overall that results in weight loss for those struggling with weight loss resistance. ACV also helps stop new fat from accumulating by activating an enzyme called AMPK. While I am always a fan of using a food-first approach, that's not necessarily the case with ACV if you are going to take it on a daily basis. Since ACV is very acidic, drinking straight apple cider vinegar can actually damage tooth enamel and even burn your esophagus. But my friends at Paleovalley solved that issue and more with their amazing [Apple Cider Vinegar Complex](http://paleovalley.com/offers/apple-cider-vinegar-complex-promo/dr-will-cole-acv?uid=34&oid=3&affid=561&source_id=blog&sub1=june).
