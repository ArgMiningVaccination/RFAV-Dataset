SPIRITUAL MODALITY OF CURE...2 \u00b7 The spiritual approach to cure is mediated through the physical processes. \u00b7 Psychosomatic processes affect the immune functions and other metabolic functions of the body. \u00b7 A believer who is spiritually calm will have positive psychosomatic experiences and not negative ones because he or she will be psychologically healthy and at ease. \u00b7 Faith can change the very perception of disease symptoms. Pain is for example subjective. A believing person who trusts in Allah may feel less pain from an injury than a non-believer with the same injury. \u00b7 Faith healing is using divine power to cure disease. Jesus did faith healing. CONCEPT OF LIFE, hayaat \u00b7 Life, from the tauhidi-based holistic integrative Islamic paradigm, shumuliyat al Islam, is a complex phenomenon with biological, chemical, social, psychological, and spiritual components. \u00b7 The relations among the components of life are governed by the physical laws, sunan al kawn, of balance, mizan, equilibrium, i'itidaal, and reciprocal action-reaction, tadafu'u. \u00b7 Humans share biological life with plants and animals and share spiritual life with angels. \u00b7 Humans are the only creation to have both biological and spiritual life at the same time. \u00b7 Human life devoid of spirituality is like animal or plant life. CONCEPT OF HEALTH, sihhat, raahat, 'aafihat \u00b7 Health is a positive and holistic state of well-being and not mere absence of disease or illness. \u00b7 Health includes spiritual, physical, psychological, emotional, and psychological dimensions in holistic balance and equilibrium. \u00b7 The spiritual component is the most important and its impairment adversely affects all the other components. \u00b7 Holistic measures of quality of life and health must incorporate all the dimensions above. CONCEPT OF THE SOUL, ruh \u00b7 The ruh, the permanent and eternal essence of each human life, was created before Adam. \u00b7 Ensoulment, nafakh al ruh, occurs in intra-uterine life. It is a spiritual event that also sustains biological life; Desoulment, naza'u al ruh, is followed rapidly by biological death. \u00b7 The limited knowledge of humans about the ruh is only from revelation, wahy. \u00b7 The Qur'an used several terms that seem to be referring to various manifestations of the same essence of human life: ruh, nafs, aql, naasiyat, lubb, dhihn, fuadetc, \u00b7 These can be mapped by experts in tafsir al Qur'an to spiritual, psychological, cognitive, emotional, and social modalities that professionals use in providing holistic spiritual support to patients. CONCEPT OF SPIRITUAL SUPPORT, al da'am al ruhi \u00b7 Patients should be supported to reach calmness devoid of fear or anxiety by accepting death as a transitional event \u00b7 The transition is from inferior and temporary life on earth, hayat al duniyat, through the interregnum, hayat al barzakh, to the superior and eternal life in the hereafter, hayat al akhirat. \u00b7 Death is not a terminal event and neither does it break the reassuring direct communication between the human and the Creator. \u00b7 Of all links and relations that a human can have, it is only the link with Allah that persists after the disappearance of parents, siblings, children, spouses, friends, and enemies PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORT,al da'am al nafsaani \u00b7 The patient should be supported to ascend from the lowest to the highest levels of the nafs \u00b7 From the evil-inclined soul, nafs al ammaratto the self-conscious soul, nafslawaamat \u00b7 From the self-conscious soul, nafslawaamatto the high levels of the calm soul, nafsmutmainnat. \u00b7 Nafsmutmainnat is described as raadhiyat, mardhiyat, qanuu'at \u00b7 At this level the patient bravely faces the suffering and pain of illness. COGNITIVE SUPPORT FOR THE PATIENT, al da'am al ma'arifi/al fikri \u00b7 The patient should be supported to appreciate illness as just one minor phenomenon in the wide and expanding spatio-temporal dimension of the universe 'aalamiin \u00b7 The patient should be guided to appreciate that illness can have beneficial aspects such as forgiveness of sins and bringing out the best in the human who can overcome pain and suffering and stay calm and composed. EMOTIONAL SUPPORT, al da'am al 'aatifi \u00b7 The patient's self-worth, self-esteem, and self-confidence to face the challenges of illness should be enhanced \u00b7 The patient should be aware of the superiority of human creation that overcomes innate weakness such as evil-doing fisk, and spilling blood, safk al dima, to become a vicegerent, khalifat, who with limited control of the universe, taskhiir, is able to build a material civilization, imarat al ardh. SOCIAL SUPPORT, al da'am al ijtima'e \u00b7 The patient should be given support to live the remaining life with the highest quality of social relations with the family and the wider community. \u00b7 Members of the family should be welcome as partners in patient care and should be treated as honored guests of the hospital with all the rights of the visitor, huquuq al dhaif. \u00b7 The patient should be enabled to stay in contact with the outside community and not be confined to the 4 walls of the hospital room: news, visits, participation in radio talks etc PHYSICAL SUPPORT, al da'am al maadi \u00b7 The spiritual support professional cannot ignore the physical needs of the patient \u00b7 The primary necessities, dharuraat, are those needed to preserve life like basic staple food and water \u00b7 The needs, haajiyaat, bring emotional satisfaction like favorite dishes served in an attractive way \u00b7 Embellishments, tahsiinaat, and complementaries, mukamillaat, are what are beyond the necessities and needs.
