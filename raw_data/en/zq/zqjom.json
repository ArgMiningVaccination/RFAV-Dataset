For serious. For over six years, I had been suffering from unexplainable recurrent attacks of debilitating vertigo and dizziness and after a plethora of tests the doctors finally diagnosed me with a vestibular disorder and I was told there was no cure. I had been managing my symptoms quite well over the years but the problem was, I was four weeks out from a month-long physically intensive yoga teacher training course in India and my symptoms had returned with a vengeance. I was so worried that I was going to have to cancel my two-month-long trip that I decided once and for all that I was going to heal myself. It was that or I had to cancel my trip and forget about my dreams and that wasn't an option! After years of researching what could be wrong with me and having no luck with [allopathic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allopathic_medicine) medicine I decided to utilize my naturopathic training and create a 30-day detox program. A month went by, eating certain foods and eliminating others and I slowly noticed a change in my body. I was beginning to feel healthy again! Feeling relieved that I was well enough to go to India and excited that I had finally found the key to good health, I decided to write about what I did to get well again and share it with others because I strongly believe that it is our birthright to enjoy good health and with the correct information, it should be accessible to all regardless of status or income. Just imagine what could be achieved in a body that is functioning well and in optimal health! Firstly, one of the most important steps is to take full responsibility for our own health rather than relying solely on allopathic medicine, which often treats only the symptoms and not the root cause. Contrary to what we have been told and what is being taught in mainstream medical schools worldwide, there is strong evidence to suggest most illness and disease can be healed with proper nutrition and research carried out in [epigenetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics) proves that environmental factors outside the genes can trigger cellular changes, which can lead to ill health. This means that the environment that we live in, the air we breathe, the thoughts we have and the food we eat can all have an impact on turning on certain genes that cause disease. After being told there was no cure for my disorder, my research led me to find the underlying causes of my health condition. What I discovered was, most of the world's population are unwittingly riddled with parasites and the parasitic yeast infection candida albicans. These parasitic invaders often go hand-in-hand with each other and depending on our immune system they can go silently unnoticed or more often than not, they are accountable for a myriad of health complaints. Adding to the problem, most of the world's population consumes a highly acidic diet and research has shown that an array of diseases including cancer thrives in an acidic environment. It's important to understand that until we rid our bodies of these harmful parasitic infections and bring our body back into an alkaline environment, any actions we take to improve our health will most likely not have the desired effect. It's a bit like servicing a car without first changing the oil and filter. Any new oil that we add will not be fully utilized because the old oil and filter hadn't first been removed. Therefore, the money we spend on supplements or super foods to manage our symptoms may as well be flushed down the toilet until we clean our body up first! My 30-day, all natural detox program is in three parts as follows: Parasite Cleanse: Immediately begin the detox with a herbal intestinal cleanse that contains the correct balance of vermicidal herbs. To find a suitable formula, I highly recommend visiting a qualified medical herbalist. The parasite cleanse will help create the right gastrointestinal environment, which will allow for optimal nutrient absorption and when finished, the body will be ready to continue onto the next phase of the detox. From Acid to Alkaline: Adopt a healthy alkaline rich diet and fill the body up with the correct nutrients it needs to heal itself. When the body has become off-balance it's usually because it has become too acidic. Research has shown that a wide range of diseases including cancer thrives in an acidic environment and most of our western diet consists of highly refined food, alcohol, coffee and carbonated drinks, which can all upset the body's delicate balance and tip it over to acidity. During the detox it's important to drink plenty of filtered water\u2014water that has passed through an alkaline filter is best and a few drops of liquid chlorophyll could be added to help bring the body's pH level to neutral. Water also helps to flush toxins from the body through the passing of urine. Avoid consuming: tea, coffee, carbonated drinks, alcohol, fruit juice and sugar. Check labels as sugar is often added to a lot of packaged foods or disguised using other names! Avoid food items that contain artificial additives, colours and preservatives\u2014fresh is best! Avoid consuming hydrogenated oil, meat, gluten, dairy and foods high in carbohydrates such as bread and pasta. Carbohydrates turn into sugar in the body, which feeds candida albicans. Eat plenty of organic leafy greens (raw is best), quinoa, lentils and beans, soups and broths, organic genetically engineered free tofu, nuts and seeds, soaked chia seeds, spirulina, soya and nut milks and fresh organic vegetables (limit potatoes). Add to your diet lots of fresh garlic and raw apple cider vinegar\u2014these can both be used in a salad dressing with extra virgin olive oil. Drink lots of green smoothies. Candida Cleanse: The best all natural way to tackle an overgrowth of candida albicans is to create an alkaline rich environment in the body by avoiding consuming acidic foods as discussed above, however below are a few extra tips: Take a good quality probiotic such as Saccharomyces Boulardii. SB is a non-colonizing probiotic yeast that inhibits the growth of other disease-causing microbes and yeasts such as candida albicans. Taking a probiotic supplement that contains SB increases the production of secretory lgA (slgA), which is the predominant immunoglobulin (proteins that are present in the immune system, which function as antibodies) found in mucosal secretions in the body. slgA is essential for healthy mucosal immunity, it helps to neutralize toxins, agglutinate microorganisms and it prevents the adherence of pathogens to the gastrointestinal epithelial lining. SB encourages healthy intestinal flora to adhere to and colonize the gastrointestinal tract and is a powerful weapon against harmful yeasts and disease causing pathogens. [Silver Sol](http://www.silversol.org) is pure silver mineral particles dispersed in purified water. It is a more potent form of colloidal silver and it is highly effective at killing bacteria, virus, fungi and parasites. It also strengthens the immune system so the body can carry out the necessary functions to protect itself against foreign invaders. Maintenance and Support: To complete the 30-day detox, colonic therapy is a good way to clean out the intestines from any residual toxins left behind, and to continue on a path of wellness it's important to maintain a healthy diet. Eliminating stress is also a crucial part of the healing process as stress triggers a wide range of physiological responses within the body, which can contribute to ill health. Allowing ourselves the time to take rest if our lives have become too busy by going outside, reconnecting with the earth and getting some much needed vitamin D from the sun, or taking a trip away and filling our lungs with fresh air is sometimes all we need. The body is a complex system, which is continuously carrying out functions to maintain homeostasis and it has an amazing way of telling us when something is not quite right in our external environment by creating dysfunction within the body. Giving ourselves the time to reflect quite often illuminates what is causing us stress and ill health so that we can take the necessary steps to create the right environment that is conducive for healing. Meditation and yoga can also be powerful tools for wellness and sometimes branching out and taking up a new hobby can create opportunities to meet like-minded people, or we may need to simply take the time to reconnect with the ones we love. After all, our body is the only real vehicle we have in life and if we focus on loving ourselves and taking care of it, we can live a healthy and happy life!
