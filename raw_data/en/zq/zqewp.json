Yes, everyone knows certain fruits and veggies have properties that provide your body with certain nutritional benefits\u2014 But did you know the specific COLOR can also target the remedy an ailment for healing? Colors of the foods you eat are associated with an energy, and this can directly correlate to providing healing properties to that certain energy center (Chakra System) within your body. Below is an outline of the meaning of the colors and how you can incorporate different colorful foods into your diet, to not just benefit your health- but your dreams, goals, aspirations and FUEL your body in a specific way to create TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE in certain areas of your life. RED- Associated with the ROOT CHAKRA (Element= Earth) This chakra is directly correlated to your foundation and feelings of belonging or being part of a \"tribe.\" Red Foods include: red apples, tomatoes, radishes, beets, strawberries, raspberries and ALL root vegetables to GROUND your energy into the earth and help create (or heal) a solid foundation. ORANGE- Associated with the SACRAL CHAKRA (Element = Water) This chakra is associated with your creativity, sexuality, and your ability to \"go with the flow\" in life. Orange foods include: oranges, carrots, cantaloupe, mangoes, peaches, apricots, walnuts, flax seeds YELLOW- Associated with the SOLAR PLEXUS (Element = Fire) This chakra is associated with your personal power, purpose, goals, balance and radiates the \"true self\" Yellow foods include: bananas, corn, yellow pepper, yellow curry, lemons, or all whole grains/fiber-filled foods like oats, brown rice and sprouted grains GREEN- Associated with the HEART CHAKRA (Element = Air) This chakra is in touch with your heart, healing center, where we feel and experience joy and compassion. Green foods include: broccoli, cucumbers and leafy greens (Spinach, Kale, Chard, Dandelion greens) green apples, avocado, peas, lime, etc. BLUE- Associated with the THROAT CHAKRA (Element = Akasha/ Space/Sound) This chakra is how you express your truth and how you communicate. Blue foods include: Blueberries, blackberries, plums and anything that supports your throat- like herbal tea, raw honey, lemon, coconut water, water/staying hydrated INDIGO/PURPLE- Associated with the THIRD EYE CHAKRA (Element= Light) This chakra is associated with your connection to spirit and your center of wisdom aka \"Third Eye\"/Seeing or Perception of things beyond your senses aka: intuition Purple foods include: grapes, blueberries, purple cabbage, eggplant, purple carrots, or foods rich in flavonoids, like cocoa (of course dark chocolate is associated with healing the higher self LOL)! WHITE- Associated with the CROWN CHAKRA (Element = No \"element\"/ Thought) This chakra is located at the very top of your head, representing your truth, knowing and connection to all. This chakra is all about your self realizations and how you uniquely connect to the world around you. This chakra promotes peace, faith, trust, gratitude and all things connected to spirituality. White Foods include: Cauliflower, Root Veggies, Onions Mushrooms...But this chakra is less about food choices and more about detoxing and cleansing (perhaps intermittent fasting or cutting back from sugar/dairy/toxins/alcohol, etc) Using meditation, mindfulness techniques, herbs (like sage or lavender) or essential oils can help to heal and activate this energy center in the body. When I post colorful foods and recipes on insta and say \"EAT THE RAINBOW\"- I mean it!!! The more variety of choices you have throughout your day and weeks will increase your total body energy system. Try to eat foods from EVERY color group to be as BALANCED as possible... Of course, if having trouble in a particular area of your life or feel \"blocked,\" the foods you select can really help make a difference.... For example, I have a client who is a writer and experiences \"writers block\" and is not always in the flow of her craft- I always recommend recipes and food choices containing YELLOW & ORANGE ingredients. Having her increase these specific colors will link to increasing the energy flow in her body and provide extra nutrients she might be lacking. Last but not least, how gorgeous and HAPPY is your plate when it's bright and colorful?! With Spring and the warm weather approaching, it should be easier to select colorful fruits and veggies as they are more accessible and affordable at local farmer's markets- Try to select organic whenever possible and continue to make healthy choices to support not just your bikini bod- But your MIND, BODY AND SOUL. Much Love, Coach Aly *Here is a helpful diagram of the \"colors\" or \"energy centers\" in your body, known as your chakra system: Balanced Beauty Bonus Tip: Colors have vibrations and frequency. In addition to FOODS - Try wearing colors, accessories, nail polish, make-up or jewelry with the specific chakra colors to enhance the energy of this area of your body. It can serve as a powerful reminder for you or way to introduce your energy in a room before even speaking. Try using them to put your best foot forward and express yourself in new ways and see how "}
