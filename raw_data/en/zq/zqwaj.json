Immunisation keeps us safe from many infectious diseases, but, just like any medication, we may experience side effects after our vaccinations. Everyone is affected differently by vaccination. Some may experience few or no side effects while others may experience multiple side effects. While side-effects with vaccines are temporary (and a good indicator), fear can push people away. The most frequent adverse reaction most people experience are pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia (muscle pains), chills, arthralgia (joint pains), fever and vary rare blood clots / infertility etc. You must contact a healthcare professional if any side effects grow significantly worse. Vaccinia is a condition in which there is a localized skin infection, which occurs due to vaccination of vaccinia virus. CAUSATION Vaccinia is a side effect of the inoculation of vaccinia virus. In immuno-suppressed persons the inoculation of vaccinia virus can cause severe disease. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS - A small eruption arises on the skin at the site of inoculation which then gets filled with water. - Fever accompanies the eruptions. - After 2 weeks the eruption turns into a scab and then heals. - Fever and enlarged glands can be present. Holistic Remedies to supplement vaccinations and prevent any unwanted bad effects. There are a few things that you can do to minimise your chances of incurring side effects when you have any vaccine, be it Covid or any other. The essential thing to do is give your immune system a big boost before and after the vaccination with optimal nutrition or additional supplements. Take 1000mg Vitamin C - 2-3 times daily between meals for 3 days around every vaccination. This powerful anti-inflammatory will protect your immune system. You can take more, but if you experience loose bowels, that is the sign that you have taken enough. Take Vitamin E for several weeks to reduce any potential negative immune reactions. You can also adjust your diet to include foods that have a high content of natural Vitamin E, such as avocados, seeds, raw red bell peppers, etc. For reactions at the injection site, such as pain or swelling, use a clean, cool wet washcloth to create a compress. This might also help with muscle and joint aches. To ease soreness or stiffness in the arm, move it as much as possible. This may seem counterintuitive and cause a little discomfort, but it helps prevent further stiffness by loosening up sore muscles. Anyone with chills and a low-grade fever should make sure to drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration. Wearing light clothing and dressing in layers will help prevent overheating. Take the herbal remedy Echinacea for a week before and a week after your dose. This gentle herb turbo-charges the whole immune system naturally. Please remember only to take it for 2 weeks at a time for optimal efficacy. Apply an ice pack to the site of the vaccination and re-apply regularly throughout the day for 10-15 mins a time to reduce localised inflammation (and on consecutive days if it continues to hurt). Homeopathic approach: Homeopathy is one of the most popular holistic systems of medicine. The selection of remedy is based upon the theory of individualization and symptoms similarity by using holistic approach. This is the only way through which a state of complete health can be regained by removing all the sign and symptoms from which the patient is suffering. The aim of homeopathy is not only to treat a disease but to address its underlying cause and individual susceptibility. As far as therapeutic medication is concerned, several remedies are available to treat the bad effects following vaccination that can be selected on the basis of cause, sensations and modalities of the complaints. For individualized remedy selection and treatment, the patient should consult a qualified homeopathic doctor in person.
