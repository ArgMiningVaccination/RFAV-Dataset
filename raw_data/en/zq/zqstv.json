Please check with local acupuncture clinic for help. [Adam Perna](/Expert/81226479-Adam-Perna)Acupuncturist Roseland, NJ Now this is just my personal experience, skin issues is one of the hardest things to treat. Now, if from Chinese med side of evaluation, we could find what is causing the issue lets say because of digestion, then, yes, you would have better shot than lets say a genetic cause. Needles are good for most issues, but with skin you may need needles and herbs. I personally do not do herbs, so, if you call an acupuncturist with herbal experience, I would think you may have a higher % chance to help your sister. [Mr. Anthony James Lorenzo](/Expert/2819877-Anthony-James-Lorenzo)Acupuncturist Acupuncture along with herbal therapies should be able to fix this, yes. Obviously, nothing is guaranteed to work 100% of the time, but I have found this medicine to work very well. Don't give up if you try someone in my field and they don't help... we aren't all created equally. Make sure you start with a fully trained acupuncturist (not an MD or Chiropractor that did minimal hours of training to get a license). [Po Hsun Chang](/Expert/2998523-Po-Hsun-Chang)Acupuncturist Austin, TX Yes, acupuncture helps various skin disorders. For eczema, it will most likely need acupuncture and Chinese herbs working together. [Huan-wen Jonathan Fang](/Expert/2125554-Huan-wen-Fang)Acupuncturist Acton, MA Hi, Yes, acupuncture and even herbal medicine can be very effective for treating eczema. Western medicine often masks symptoms rather than getting to the root of why they are occurring. Acupuncture and/or herbal medicine can help discover the underlying imbalance which is causing the eczema to occur, thus treating the root. Hope your sister feels great soon, Jonathan Fang Yes, acupuncture and even herbal medicine can be very effective for treating eczema.

Hope your sister feels great soon, Jonathan Fang [Dr. Hui Gao](/Expert/2028512-Hui-Gao)Acupuncturist Albany, NY Yes. Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine can help in treating eczema, but you would need to find an acupuncturist who has more experience in treating those symptoms. Dr. Hui (Grace) Gao LAc., TCMD Dr. Hui (Grace) Gao LAc., TCMD [Tatyana Yakovleva](/Expert/3676788-Tatyana-Yakovleva)Acupuncturist Brooklyn, NY Skin disorders and treated effectively with acupuncture. [Dr. Alexandre Yves Hillairet](/Expert/2554708-Alexandre-Yves-Hillairet)Acupuncturist Ventura, CA We have had positive results with acupuncture and herbal medicine treating skin disorders. [Diana Abramachayeva](/Expert/902165-Diana-Abramchayeva)Acupuncturist Queens, NY Hi. Acupuncture should help as long as acupuncture dr is specialized in skin disorder. Also dr needs to make sure its not autoimmune condition. [Roxene Bates DOM LAc ADS](/Expert/81227082-Roxene-Bates-DOM-LAc-ADS)Acupuncturist Logan, UT Many holistic practitioners believe that eczema is not the chief issue in and of itself, but rather, the sign of a deeper problem. Thus, holistic treatment aims to address the patient's underlying problems. Once these problems have been identified and resolved, the eczema will often go away. [Daisy Dong](/Expert/1916920-Daisy-Dong)Acupuncturist Denver, CO Acupuncture can do some. The best treatment is Chinese herbal medicine done by experienced herbalists. Ninety-nine percent of the chronic skin conditions can be treated internally with herbal medicine. [Natalie Ramsey](/Expert/3662693-Natalie-Elizabeth-Ramsey)Acupuncturist Montclair, New Jersey Acupuncture can certainly improve eczema, but even moreso, it will help to identify the factors in which are making her eczema worse, thereby empowering her to improve it on her own. In Eastern Medicine, there are many patterns within each of the western diagnoses, which just goes to show that not every case of eczema (or any other condition) is the same. Learning about her eczema would make even one acupuncture treatment incredibly beneficial. [Ms. Kim Doan Nguyen](/Expert/1448722-Kim-Nguyen)Acupuncturist Richmond, VA I have had better results treating eczema with herbal medicine but acupuncture can reduce the inflammation in a short-term flare up. [David Chen](/Expert/81227116-David-Chen)Acupuncturist Whittier, CA Yes, acupuncture can help most skin disorders. David David [Ms. Ellen D. Leonard](/Expert/1434534-Ellen-D-Leonard)Acupuncturist Grants Pass, OR I have had a lot of success treating eczema with acupuncture, but what seems to help the most is getting off gluten. So many people have an intolerance to the genetically engineered grains and it can lead to almost all of the common diseases we face in our society today, eczema being a very common one. [Dr. Herbert Kwong yee Lau](/Expert/903578-Herbert-K-Y-Lau)Acupuncturist East Amherst, NY Hello, Of course, every person is different and how they respond to acupuncture is different as well. Acupuncture can help with eczema. Results vary based on the severity of the eczema. Steroid creams are effective, but are only a temporary fix. Acupuncture treats the eczema from the inside out. It might require some time to see results. Of course, every person is different and how they respond to acupuncture is different as well. Acupuncture can help with eczema.

However, it would be important to identify a pattern, potential cause, aggravating factors, etc. Sometimes we can clear it up quickly, other times we can manage the flare-ups, and on other occasions it requires more than just acupuncture. Dietary changes, stress management, and allergy testing are some examples. It's possible that acupuncture Chinese Medicine (herbs) would be a better choice for cost-effective treatment or even just Chinese herbs. Our goal is always to find the most cost-effective method of treatment. Acupuncture is amazing and can help most conditions, but it's not always the most affordable and sometimes the number of sessions needed makes it a poor choice. I hope this answer helps.

[Dr. Carol Revak](/Expert/2293443-Carol-Revak)Acupuncturist Tucson, AZ Along with Chinese herbs and dietary therapy, small studies have shown acupuncture to help relieve, itching, inflammation and skin changes in eczema and other skin disorders. [Snohomish Brown](/Expert/1782420-Snohomish-Brown)Acupuncturist Los Angeles, CA Yes, acupuncture and Chinese herbs will resolve the problem your sister is having. Also, having a look at her diet and examining the root causes of her eczema will prevent it from returning. [Zhen Hu](/Expert/3449735-Zhen-Hu)Acupuncturist Chandler, AZ Yes. [Susan Elaine Friedrich](/Expert/2348430-Susan-Elaine-Friedrich)Acupuncturist Everett, WA It can help, but usually combined with herbs. Susan Friedrich Susan Friedrich [Yu Wei Chen](/Expert/81227127-Yu-Wei-Chen)Acupuncturist Santa Ana, CA Yes, we can use acupuncture, natural herbs, and/or oil cream to treat skin problem. It depends on each patient's condition if some people heal faster than others. [Byung hong Cho](/Expert/441363-Byung-hong-Cho)Acupuncturist Buena Park, CA Eczema is caused by the mosquito cells containing too much moisture, and in order to treat it, the pancreas must be treated and metabolized well. Then it is easily cured. The principle of acupuncture treatment is to make our organs function well and to eliminate the problems of our bodies.

[Angela Sinnett](/Expert/1080850-Angela-Sinnett)Acupuncturist COSTA MESA, CA Eczema is usually a multi-faceted issue. I would highly recommend evaluating diet, allergies and lifestyle in addition to Chinese Medicine. [Jackie Hinzman](/Expert/81227153-Jackie-Hinzman)Acupuncturist Lincoln, Nebraska Absolutely! But need to know cause of rash and type (allergic, psoriasis, etc.) [Jennifer Kolter](/Expert/81226363-Jennifer-Kolter)Acupuncturist Henderson, MN Yes it can help. Eczema stems from deeper issues than just the skin. We look at the whole body and try to discover what the cause is. I've seen a few cases with good results. [Yan Jin](/Expert/81226324-Yan-Jin)Acupuncturist Boston, MA It is good to use acupuncture to treat Eczema caused by anxiety, but not the best for infractions. [Phranque Wright](/Expert/81225847-Phranque-Wright)Acupuncturist Chicago, IL Acupuncture can do some help if you have a really well-trained needler, but you would probably have more luck with an herbal salve, rub or tincture. Find an acupuncturist who is trained in herbs and has good experience with skin. [Abe Shahabelmolki](/Expert/81226414-Abe-Shahabelmolki)Acupuncturist Sarasota, FL Acupuncture does not help with eczema. Less street, diet, lifestyle changes. Also could be food allergies. Consult with a good functional medicine doctor. Thanks [Andrea Cillo](/Expert/81226399-Andrea-Cillo)Acupuncturist Bay Shore, New York Yes, acupuncture can help. We actually understand skin conditions to be an internal imbalance that manifests symptomatically on the skin. This is likely why the cream did not help her; it was only treating the symptoms, not the cause. [Kathleen Blazek](/Expert/81227025-Kathleen-Blazek)Acupuncturist Colorado Springs, CO Skin disorders are typically a symptom of something that is going on within the body. In Chinese medicine, skin rashes are typically due to heat either in the digestion or lungs. If your sister has recurring bouts of eczema, I would encourage her to have a food allergy test and a skin allergy test done. In my experience, patients with eczema and psoriasis have heat manifestations due to reactions to spicy foods, wine and alcohol, asthma and breathing issues, stress, not drinking enough water, etc. Acupuncture is not as effective as the proper Chinese herbs and lifestyle modifications. [Jeff Rippey](/Expert/81225813-Jeff-Rippey)Acupuncturist Saint Joseph, MO Acupuncture can help with skin issues. In my experience, it takes several treatments, so she needs to be prepared to commit to at least 5 or 7 visits. For the best results, make sure she sees an NCCAOM board certified and state licensed acupuncturist. "}
