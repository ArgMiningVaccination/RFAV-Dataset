If climate change is affecting your mental health, spending time connecting to nature may be helpful. You could also get involved with conservation activities or campaigns to protect the environment. See our information on [helping the environment](/information-support/tips-for-everyday-living/nature-and-mental-health/ideas-to-try-in-nature/#HelpTheEnvironment) for suggestions, and have a look at [The Wildlife Trusts](http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/volunteer), [Groundwork](https://www.groundwork.org.uk/) and [The Conservation Volunteers](https://www.tcv.org.uk/volunteering) websites for more tips and ideas.
