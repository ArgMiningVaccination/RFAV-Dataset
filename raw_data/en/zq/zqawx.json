Educate yourself with the facts, the risks and rewards, and then make an informed decision. This breaking news from Italy is yet another example of the potential dangers of vaccinations. I'm sure if these parents knew the potential effects of the MMR vaccine, they would have made another decision. Now it's too late and there son will NEVER be the same. From mercola.com Valentino Bocca was given an MMR shot in 2004, at the age of 15 months. According to his parents, the change in his behavior was immediate. That same night he refused to eat, and he developed diarrhea during the night. It quickly went downhill from there. Within days he was no longer able to put a spoon to his mouth, and he spent nights crying in pain. His parents immediately suspected the vaccination, but were told this was \"impossible.\" Valentino progressively regressed, and received the diagnosis of autism a year later. In the final analysis, the Italian Health Ministry disagreed with the initial conclusion of the pediatrician, conceding that the vaccine was at fault. As a result, a court in Rimini, Italy recently awarded the Bocca family a 15-year annuity totaling 174,000 Euros (just under $220,000), plus reimbursement for court costs, ruling that Valentino \"has been damaged by irreversible complications due to vaccination (prophylaxis trivalent MMR)i.\" According to a featured article in the UK newspaper, The Independentii, about 100 similar cases are now being examined by Italian lawyers, and more cases may be brought to court. \"Luca Ventaloro the family lawyer, said yesterday: \"This is very significant for Britain which uses, and has used, an MMR vaccine with the same components as the one given to Valentino. It is wrong for governments and their health authorities to exert strong pressure on parents to take children for the MMR jab while ignoring that this vaccine can cause autism and linked conditions.\" The number of autism cases has risen sharply since the 1970s, with one in 64 British children affected,\" The Independent reportsiii . The complete lack of coverage of this case in the US media is a potent example of how health information is flat out censored in the US. Is it any wonder so many Americans are still in the dark? Whether hearing about this case in the US media would sway you to believe vaccines may cause autism or not, the REAL story here is the fact that you're not even being allowed to learn about it in the first place!
