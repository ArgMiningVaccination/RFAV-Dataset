Mindful Pediatrics is happy to announce that we have received our preservative/mercury/thimerosal free flu vaccines for the 2017-2018 season for both children and adults. About the 2017 - 2018 Flu Vaccine: - This year's vaccine has expanded coverage for four strains of influenza. - Supplies are limited and due to the seasonal nature of this vaccine, it will be given on a first come first serve basis. You will be asked to pay when you schedule your visit and payments are non-refundable. - Children under the age of 8 years old require 2 doses, one month apart, for proper immunity only the first year they receive the flu shot. - All children who have previously received a flu shot will only require one dose. - You may reserve the second dose for your child by pre-paying for it when you schedule your appointment. Again, due to the seasonal nature of this vaccine the pre-paid amount is non-refundable. - We have ordered plenty of vaccine for our regular patients and their parents, and will have additional doses for the general public, so please feel free to forward this announcement. Mindful Pediatrics is one of the few practices to offer mercury free flu vaccine to adults. - The cost of the vaccine is $45 per dose and there is no additional visit fee. - You must call 303.318.4102 to reserve your vaccine and schedule an appointment. Who should receive the Flu shot? The CDC and American Academy of pediatrics both recommend that all children receive the influenza (flu) vaccine annually. Although I am aware that flu vaccine prevents significant mortality and morbidity annually, I find it difficult to recommend that we vaccinate our children (potentially) more than 80 times over their lifetime. How many times are they truly likely to get infected by influenza over their lifetime? That being said, certain populations are considered higher risk and I do recommend the following: - The highest risk for serious infection is in the first 6 months of life. The problem is that these children are not eligible to receive the flu vaccine. In general I recommend vaccinating close contacts including siblings, parents and regular caretakers. This is often called \"cocooning\". - Children under the age of 5 years old (especially in the first 3 years) are also more likely to be hospitalized and suffer complications from the flu. In general I would consider vaccinating children in day care, school or with older siblings in these settings. - Children with chronic illness regardless of age should be considered for the flu shot. Examples include: Prematurity, asthma, other chronic respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, chronic gastrointestinal illness, diabetes, seizures, and immune deficiencies. - Women who are likely to become pregnant or are pregnant during the flu season should also consider getting vaccinated, as they are more likely to suffer complications including mortality. - Families that travel frequently in the fall and winter are at higher risk for contracting infectious illnesses and may consider getting a flu vaccine for that reason. - We know that adults over the age of 65 years old or younger adults with chronic health conditions can also be at much greater risk for complications. It is sometimes wise to vaccinate the child in order to protect a family member or close contact. A few basic guidelines for vaccination: - Although the American Academy of pediatrics and CDC only recommend avoiding vaccines with serious illness, I only recommend vaccinating your child if they are completely healthy. For most children I would simply wait a week or two after they have recovered from an acute illness. - For children with chronic illness I recommend setting up an appointment to personally discuss whether it makes sense to vaccinate your child. For children with complicated illness, it can be more challenging to assess the risk/reward ratio. - Children who have severe egg allergy may need to receive the vaccine at an allergist office.
