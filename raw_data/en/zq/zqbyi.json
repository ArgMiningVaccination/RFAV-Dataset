The evidence shows thatadvice tailored to the lifestyle of an individual, as well as their clinicalcondition, and based on constructive negotiation is more likely toresult in positive outcomes. The importance of effective communication is reflected in the Standards of Prociency for dietitians which lay down the standards for registration by the Health Professions Council. In addition to effect-ive and appropriate skills in relation to patient care, the Standards also emphasise the ability to work as a member of a multidisciplinary team.This means dietitians working together with the broad range of healthprofessionals who are involved in the prevention and treatment of the non-communicable degenerative diseases that dominate modernhealth care priorities. Counselling Skills for Dietitians is an invaluable source of insight and practical guidance, which will help those who are new to the professionto develop the skills which are so vital for effective practice. In this new edition there is also plenty for the more experienced practitionerto reflect upon. Judy Gable brings her long experience as a dietitianand a trained counsellor, together with insights gained from workingwith student dietitians and running in-service workshops, to producea book of unique value. This volume will enable others to share thebenets that we have been able to enjoy at King's through Judy'sinvolvement with the teaching of our students.

However, once I had become involved in the project, I found myself engrossed. Thisprocess, I believe, mirrors that of many dietitians when faced with the prospect of learning counselling skills. I have heard a number ofdietitians say 'Counselling skills are all very well, but I haven't the time'.In this book I hope to show how counselling skills can be integrated by dietitians so that the limited time they have with patients is utilisedeffectively and meaningfully for both dietitian and patient. The rst edition, published in 1997, stemmed from the needs and interest shown by dietitians who participated in the training courses incounselling skills and personal development that I facilitated duringthe 1990s. Many common difculties emerged when sharing experi-ences about giving dietary advice to patients. For example, the patientswho appeared not to heed the advice given, however clearly the dietitianthought she was putting it across, and the interviews when it becameclear that the patients' difculties were not diet related. In such situ-ations frustration, helplessness and disenchantment frequently developfor the dietitian who then thinks 'What am I doing wrong?' or 'Thispatient is not worth bothering with'. Once the dietitian nds herselfgroaning inwardly at the prospect of seeing yet another patient, she islikely to nd herself developing a routine 'spiel' to help her get throughyet another busy clinic. Other difculties arise from a lack of com-munication skills and a lack of self-condence. As a result a dietitian is likely to be overly anxious, for example about giving up-to-date andaccurate information or talking to certain people. This anxiety can beexpressed as an inflated desire to help and to please, a fear of con-frontation and a reluctance to be with someone who is emotionallydistressed. A dietitian may experience such difculties not only withpatients but also with consultants, other doctors, nursing staff andmanagers.CSFA01 10/10/06 8:32 PM Page viiiThis book explores ways in which these difculties can be addressed. When writing I have drawn on my personal experience as a dietitianand a counsellor. The counselling theory in the book is based on theperson-centred approach, which was originally the work of the late CarlRogers, an eminent American psychologist, whose extensive researchhas moulded the development of counselling for decades. The person-centred approach, whether it is used in counselling, education or any other area, is more than a set of skills; it is both a philosophy and an attitude of mind. In the book, I focus on the use of counsellingskills in clinical settings between dietitians and patients, because thisis an area familiar to all dietitians. Those working in other areas and in management will nd it equally useful as they discover how theycan apply the skills in their communications with clinicians, colleaguesand managers. The material includes exercises and clinical examplesdesigned to stimulate self-awareness and encourage the reader to adopta self-directed approach to learning. All examples and names given todietitians and patients throughout the book are ctional and referenceto any individual is purely accidental. I hope the reader nds the bookthought provoking and satisfying to read. In my experience the materialis valuable to students and so could also be useful to trainers who havean interest in interpersonal communication. In this second edition, the basic structure of the book is unchanged. When considering what to amend and what new material to include, I realised much has progressed and much remains unchanged in theelds of both dietetics and counselling in the years since the publicationof the rst edition. Public awareness of counselling as an acceptablemeans of getting help continues to grow and counselling is increas-ingly widely available. Courses in counselling skills are now held inmany colleges throughout the UK. Developments in the practice ofhealth care in the past decade have placed emphasis on practitionersworking in multidisciplinary teams. This means there is an even greaterneed for effective communication between colleagues from differentdisciplines if misunderstandings are to be avoided. Anxiety about rolesand tasks and how these are to be performed and by whom, often leadsto conflicts within teams. Meanwhile, when helping others changetheir eating behaviour, dietitians continue to struggle with the issue ofmotivation and Motivational Interviewing is a term familiar to many.Since writing the rst edition there has been great interest in the use ofcognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) to help people towards changingtheir perceptions in the world of both counselling and dietetics. Waysin which aspects of CBT can be incorporated in patient-centred workand used for personal development are included in this edition. As therole of dietitians becomes more complex, their need for support, bothIntroduction ixCSFA01 10/10/06 8:32 PM Page ixprofessional and personal, increases. When incorporating a counsell- ing approach into their dietetic practice, dietitians need opportunitiesto engage in their own personal development in order to become competent practitioners. Those working interactively with patients whoare emotionally vulnerable also need the support provided by the typeof clinical supervision which attends to their emotional needs. In anincreasingly demanding working environment, I believe it is even morenecessary for dietitians to be able to maintain healthy boundaries con-cerning their role, time keeping and the extent to which they can offercondentiality. Maintaining such boundaries supports both dietitianand patient. As in the rst edition the book is divided into four parts. Part 1 examines the counselling approach as applied to the role of the dieti-tian and distinguishes this from the dietitian as teacher or adviser. A key feature in counselling is the relationship between the helper and the person being helped. Therefore, in developing a counsellingapproach it is necessary for the dietitian to examine her approach andunderstand how this affects her relationship with her patients. Anotherkey feature is understanding the process of change and the ways inwhich this can be facilitated. Exploring the ambivalence that underliesan inability to change is the basis of Motivational Interviewing, whichis outlined in Chapter 4 of this edition. Part 2 centres on the fundamental skills of listening and responding and introduces the reader to the skills of reflective responding. Usedeffectively, these skills further the development of the helping relation-ship. They also enable the dietitian to gain an understanding of thepatient's attitude to change. In Chapter 7 I examine ways in which theseskills, together with skilful questioning, can be used to make helpfulinterventions. The chapter now includes a section 'towards clearerthinking' which describes aspects of CBT and shows how these can beincorporated into a person-centred approach. Examples show how theskills can be used by dietitians when inviting patients to think aboutchanging their eating behaviour. The skills of Part 2 are applied to different settings in Part 3, which has been extensively revised in this edition. Chapter 8 describes a frame-work to use as a basis for the patient interview and introduces topicssuch as assessing motivation, contracting, tracking the helping processand reviewing the interview. Chapters 9-11 remain unchanged. Inresponse to the general increased incidence of self-harm in the popula-tion, Chapter 12 contains a new section to help the dietitian cope inthe event of her patient expressing suicidal thoughts. A new chapter(Chapter 13) illustrates the application of the interview framework andthe counselling skills described in Parts 2 and 3. The three ctitiousx Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFA01 10/10/06 8:32 PM Page xinterviews show counselling skills being used by three dietitians in different dietetic situations. Part 4, focusing on personal development, has been revised and expanded in this edition. In response to requests by dietitians, Chap-ter 14 explores ways of developing assertive behaviour and handlingaggressive behaviour, not only with patients but also with colleaguesin the workplace. The nal chapter (Chapter 15) focuses on personalsupport. This includes managing stress, building self-esteem and coun-selling. A new section is included in this chapter which introduces the subject of mutual collegial support and describes how this can beestablished. Finally, the appendices have been amended and updatedto include details of books for further reading and contact details oforganisations associated with subjects raised in the book. The wealth of information in the book may seem overwhelming at rst. A dietitian may say 'How will I ever remember this' and 'I willforget it all when I'm with a patient'. I believe what matters most is our willingness to become better listeners more of the time, both toothers and to ourselves. This involves being more skilful in the way werespond to what we hear. The skills described in Part 2 and demon-strated throughout the book are valuable life-skills. Developing, honing,polishing, and applying our listening and responding skills leads togreater understanding and opportunities for negotiation, co-operationand change. I hope this book is both useful and well used. About the author As a State Registered Dietitian, Judy Gable rst specialised in paediatrics, where she was involved in clinical research in gastro-enterology and food sensitivity. Her MSc (Nutrition) was followed by research into diet and diabetes among the Asian community. Her interest in the psychological aspects of weight management ledher to training as a counsellor. As an accredited counsellor she has worked in private practice and primary care, and has taught coun-selling skills to dietitians and students at King's College, University of London, for many years. She currently works in Primary Care as acounsellor in a general medical practice. How to use this book The following guidelines are designed to help the reader make mosteffective use of the book.Introduction xiCSFA01 10/10/06 8:32 PM Page xiGeneral points Although chapters can be read in isolation, the reader will obtain maximum benet by reading them in order, particularly in Part 2where each chapter builds on the skills covered in the preceding one.References are made in each chapter to other chapters, where this isthought to reinforce the reader's learning. Each chapter contains exer-cises, in boxes, which are designed to increase the reader's awarenessand aid learning. Dialogue is designed to demonstrate the practicalapplication of the counselling skills and to clarify the process occurringbetween patient and dietitian. Dietitians who are new to counselling Y ou are recommended to read Chapters 1-9, followed by Chapter 13 and Part 4. Other chapters can then be read as interest dictates. Dietitians who work in specialised areas Y ou are recommended to read Chapters 1-9, followed by the relevant chapter in Part 3, followed by Chapter 13 and then Part 4. Thoseworking in either mental health or with physical disabilities are recom-mended to read the introduction section of Chapter 12 in addition tothe section they are interested in. Dietitians who have completed some training in counselling skills Y ou are recommended to read Chapters 1, 3, 4 and 13, followed by Part 4, all of which are designed to add to your understanding.Chapter 2 and Chapters 5-9 aim to increase awareness and refresh andadd to skills previously learned. The different issues raised in Parts 3and 4 provide opportunities to clarify and develop earlier thoughts. Notes on terminology Dietetics is still a predominantly female profession and this fact is used in delineating gender. Dietitians are referred to as 'she' throughoutand those receiving their help as 'patients'. As counselling is also a pre-dominantly female profession, counsellors are referred to as 'she' andthe person with whom they are working is referred to as a 'client'. Names given to dietitians and patients are ctional and do not refer to individuals. Examples given are either based on my personal experi-ences or have been adapted so that any resemblance to specic real-lifesituations is purely accidental.xii Counselling Skills PM Page xiiPart 1 A Counselling Approach In Part 1, I introduce the reader to a counselling approach. I will be: exploring the role of the dietitian including her personal philosophy and qualities to develop when using a counselling approach; explaining some of the different approaches to counselling so thatthe reader can gain some background knowledge; considering the patient's concerns, expectations, reactions andfeelings; exploring the nature of change and the process of adapting to it; focusing on the relationship between patient and dietitian and thequalities of empathy, acceptance and genuineness which the dieti-tian can provide; describing what is involved in the helping process, and how thedietitian can manage the issues of time keeping, condentiality andreferral when working with patients.CSFC01 10/10/06 8:39 PM Page 1Chapter 1 The Dietitian as a Skilled Helper 't'is not enough to help the feeble up but to support him after' Shakespeare: Timon of Athens In this chapter I discuss: Teacher, adviser, guide or counsellor? Continuum of control Developing a personalphilosophy Portrait of a dietitian usingcounselling skillsQualities of a dietitian Developing a counsellingapproach Different approaches tocounselling Teacher, adviser, guide or counsellor? In a statement taken from an information leaflet produced by the British Dietetic Association (2003) the work of dietitians is describedas follows: 'Dietitians are skilled in taking scientic information relating to food and health, and translating it into terms that everyone can understand.' In other words, dietitians communicate with others on nutrition matters and dietary management. They provide a service for the sick and thosewho live with a chronic condition, and a service for those concernedwith maintaining and promoting health. Traditionally dietitians haveseen their role as that of a teacher, adviser or guide. Nowadays manydescribe their role as one of facilitating change or of dietary counsell-ing. As practising dietitians know only too well, fullling the role is not straightforward.CSFC01 10/10/06 8:39 PM Page 3Dietitians may do their best to inform, educate and facilitate using the most up-to-date knowledge at their disposal, yet patients do not alwaysfollow their information or respond to their teaching. So what goeswrong? Is it the dietitian, the patient, the diagnosis or the informationgiven by the dietitian? Much research is done into medical diagnosesand dietetic information, and dietitians undergo lengthy training toensure their understanding of their subject. In meeting the demandsof continuing professional development they endeavour to keep abreastof current developments in the eld of nutrition and dietetics. In recent years there have also been signicant developments concerned with helping people change their behaviour. The model'Helping People Change' launched by the Health Education Author-ity in the 1990s helps dietitians identify the stage in a patient's process(Prochaska & DiClemente 1986). Motivational Interviewing has alsobeen adopted by many dietitians to use within the Helping PeopleChange model (Chapter 4). Motivational Interviewing provides aframework to help explore and resolve the ambivalence people feelabout implementing change, and requires the dietitian to apply a style of interviewing that draws on characteristics of client-centredcounselling (Rollnick & Miller 1995). Another form of counselling iscognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), in which patients are intro-duced to strategies to help them implement change (see the section'Different approaches to counselling' later ). CBT programmes have been developed for use in the treatment of obesity (Rappoport 2000).Being able to track the change process, explore and resolve ambiva-lence and have strategies to show people how to implement changehas greatly increased a dietitian's resources. However, patients may bewilling to change and know how to do this, yet the desired outcomeremains elusive. The Empowerment Model, based on principles thatvalue the patient's right to make choices about their own health and be responsible for their own well-being, is about the helper being ableto empower her patient's own resources for change (Valentine 1990;Funnell et al. 1991; McCann & Weinman 1996). The Helping People Change Model, motivational interviewing and the EmpowermentModel have all been found to be useful in dietetic consultations withdiabetic patients (Parkin 2001). Whereas the developments described above have focused on helping obese and diabetic patients change their behaviour, dietitians work-ing in other specialities also need resources to enable them to helptheir patients modify their diets. Whatever their area of work, manydietitians nd the following difcult: dealing with a patient's reasons for not changing their eatingbehaviour;4 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC01 10/10/06 8:39 PM Page 4handling ambivalence when a patient is unsure about changing; coping with the emotions expressed by a patient; knowing what to say or do when a patient raises a non-dietetic problem. In addition to her own difculties the dietitian needs to consider those of her patients. In medical practice, research into non-compliance bypatients has identied a lack of satisfaction with the consultation, a lack of understanding by the patient, and a failure by the practi-tioner to meet expectations, as signicant factors. It was concludedthat patients whose expectations are met, who are listened to, who arereceived in a friendly manner and are not kept waiting, experiencegreater satisfaction with the consultation and are more likely to com-ply with the practitioner's advice (Ley 1988). It would seem that patients are more likely to be satised and to follow the dietitian's advice when: they are welcomed and seen on time; they feel they have been heard and understood; they are given information they recognise as relevant to them; they understand what they have to do. It follows that, in addition to being able to give information, advice and instruction, dietitians need skills in: demonstrating to patients that they have been understood; assessing and meeting patients' needs and expectations; working within limited time boundaries. How can the dietitian develop these? And the skills to employ the models described earlier? Competency in using high-level commun-ication skills is essential if the dietitian is to be able respond to herpatients' emotional needs and manage appropriately the non-dieteticproblems that emerge during their work together. Counselling skills, which offer dietitians the means to provide this quality of support for patients, have been dened for the Advice,Guidance & Counselling Lead Body as 'high level communicationskills used intentionally in a manner consistent with the goals and values of counselling' (Russell, Dexter & Bond 1992). Many health professionals use counselling skills in their work, although not all health professionals are counsellors. Those usingcounselling skills may also use other methods such as instructing,teaching, advising and discussing. Table 1.1 highlights the differencesbetween these methods.The Dietitian as a Skilled Helper 5CSFC01 10/10/06 8:39 PM Page 5Instructing, teaching and advising centre around a one-way rela- tionship, in which the helper is in the powerful position of being theexpert in control of the situation. Discussing and counselling centreon a two-way relationship. When using counselling skills, the helpersupports the person being helped to gain a sense of power and controlfor themselves. The nature of the relationship between the counsellorand the client, and the process which occurs within that relationship, iscentral to counselling. The helper who uses counselling skills developsan approach that is different from the one adopted by an instructor,teacher or adviser. This difference centres around the issue of control. Continuum of control The continuum of control (Eweles & Simnett 2003) relates differentmethods of communication to the degree of control held by the health professional, as shown in Figure 1.1. Traditionally dietitiansare trained to use those methods in which they have most control. The dietitian is qualied to pass on her knowledge to others and to6 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Table 1.1 Comparison of methods of communication.

She is therefore likely to be most familiar with, although not necessarily most comfortable with, methods where she has controlover what takes place. Counselling skills on the other hand require an approach in which the helper chooses to exert less control. The dietitian may feel un-comfortable with the uncertainty that this entails. However, educationis of limited value when the provider has only one or two methods ofdelivery. The dietitian who can choose to assert her control or let go ofit, depending on her purpose and the perceived needs of the patient,has a choice of approach. This enables her to be highly competent inher work. Developing a personal philosophy Traditionally, health professionals have been seen as experts andinvested with power. This attitude is reflected in their communicationwith patients. Recent trends to involve patients more directly andencourage personal responsibility for health, require health profes-sionals to examine their perception of themselves and their attitudestowards patients. When faced with a problem, many helpers feel a responsibility to come up with a solution for the other person. Often, as the expert andthe person in authority, they take this responsibility on themselves.Once the helper thinks of a solution, they see it as their job to persuadethe other person to adopt and implement this. The dietitian who thinks she should be the one to provide the solution to a problem is also likely to associate compliance by the patient withher own effectiveness. This attitude is reflected in the way in which thedietitian communicates. For example, if a patient does not follow heradvice she may persuade the patient to comply in the future not only'for their own good' but also in an attempt to feel better about herself.She is likely to use methods which allow her to be in control, such aslecturing the patient on the importance of modifying their diet or byallowing the patient to think that she also has difculty in restrainingher intake, as a way of inviting them to disclose indiscretions with their diet. The dietitian who perceives herself as someone who knows what is best for the patient reflects a different attitude from the dietitian whothinks of herself as someone who is available to share her professionalknowledge with her patients in order that they may make use of this if they choose. The latter will endeavour to provide, to the best of herThe Dietitian as a Skilled Helper 7CSFC01 10/10/06 8:39 PM Page 7ability, an environment in which a patient can feel safe, acknowledged and supported as a worthwhile human being (Chapter 3). She is likelyto recognise the value of counselling skills in: encouraging a patient to make the choices that are best for them; helping a patient explore thoughts and feelings about changingtheir eating behaviour; providing a supportive relationship in which the patient feels ableto make small changes for themselves. Portrait of a dietitian using counselling skills Sally is a dietitian who encourages her patients to take control andresponsibility for themselves. She sees herself as someone whose roleis to enable the patient to make their own choices. She believes thathuman beings are unique, that each one knows best how they feel andwhat they think and believe, and that although these values may not bein accord with her own, they are worthy of her respect. The respectshe has for herself and others enables her to trust that her patients areable to use her information in whatever way is best for them. In doing this she is neither naive nor irresponsible in her attitude. She is realistic and able to respond to her patients. She accepts thateach individual has difculties which are unique to them. Some ofthese are known to her and others are unknown. Likewise, she knowsher patients are aware of some difculties themselves and unaware of others. She sees her role as one of offering support in helping herpatients understand and deal with the difculties they have with regardto their diet (see Exercise 1.1).8 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 1.1 How would you describe your philosophy about helping your patients? Thinking back to the continuum of control, which methods do you feelmost comfortable with? Method Colleagues A patient A group of patientsInstructingTeachingAdvisingDiscussingCSFC01 10/10/06 8:39 PM Page 8Qualities of a dietitian Dietitians frequently describe the qualities of someone who is effective in their role of helping others as someone who is: trustworthy; honest; reliable; a good listener; caring; knowledgeable; competent. These are qualities which come readily to mind to most people working in the caring professions. Someone who is trustworthy andhonest is thought of as someone who can be believed and relied on to do what they say they will. We trust someone and consider themhonest and reliable when we experience them as being authentic, realand genuine (Rogers 2004). Genuineness (see Chapter 3) is a qualitythat counsellors strive continually to develop. It is demanding to behonest with oneself and to trust oneself. However, the more able we areto be this way with ourselves the more able we are to be this way withothers. Openness and honesty are key characteristics of the personwho is perceived to be trustworthy and reliable. Many actions are taken which are said to be caring because they are thought to be in the best interest of another. In truth, these actions areoften in the best interest of those giving the 'care', and as a result therecipient feels unheard, manipulated and disempowered. We demon-strate true caring of another when we feel empathy towards another(Chapter 3) and are willing to place ourselves at their service. We showcaring by: giving time and attention to another; being fully present when listening to another; doing what is needed to meet the needs of another; helping another in their process of resolving their difculties. Caring is demanding yet empowering of oneself and the other person. Our ability to be available to another in this way is closelylinked with our ability to establish our own boundaries, which in turnis dependent on knowing our own limits in terms of competency, and physical and emotional availability.The Dietitian as a Skilled Helper 9CSFC01 10/10/06 8:39 PM Page 9Developing a counselling approach Acquiring information and monitoring competence are continual requirements for any health professional. Usually these are thought ofas keeping up to date with technical and scientic developments. It isalso the responsibility of the professional to develop her interpersonaland self-management skills, for without these she is unable to providetrue quality care for her patients. A dietitian who wants to develop the qualities mentioned earlier will be concerned with developing self-awareness . This is the key to developing genuineness and empathy (Chapter 3). Increasing self-awareness enables us to learn how we respond emotionally. This is aprerequisite if we want to help others effectively. With self-awarenesswe can learn to recognise our own feelings and those of another. Indoing so we are less likely to attribute our own emotional response to the person to whom we are listening. In other words, we are lesslikely to become angry, fearful or confused by the other person andwill be more able to take in what they are saying without interpretingand distorting this. Developing self-awareness is about becoming more wholly ourselves. As Verena Tschudin (1995) succinctly says in Counselling Skills for Nurses : 'when we can hold the doubtful and the certain, the strong and the weaksides of ourselves in balance, then we can use ourselves positively'. Shegoes on to say, 'what matters is not so much that we have been \"good\"or \"skilled helpers\" but that we have been real people'. As self-awareness grows so does 'a greater openness to and accept- ance of others' (Rogers 2004). During this process we question andclarify our beliefs and experiences. These form our 'frame of reference'or the position from which we view our world. Each of us holds a different frame of reference. Using counselling skills necessitates beingable to step into the frame of reference of another in order to provideempathy with someone whose experience and beliefs are different fromour own. We do not have to be widowed, for example, before we canempathise with someone whose spouse has died. What is important isthat we can draw on our experience of loss and suffering for the benetof another. Developing self-awareness is closely related to developing self-worth. An ability to value and respect oneself leads to self-acceptance andtrust in oneself. As a result self-condence grows. Patients will placegreater trust in someone they sense they can rely on to be open andhonest with them. Relating in this way develops a mutuality. As thedietitian's trust in herself grows, so does her willingness to trust herpatients.10 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC01 10/10/06 8:39 PM Page 10Imagination and intuition develop with self-trust. To be able to empathise and step into another's world requires the dietitian to useher imagination. As an ability to be empathic and genuine develops, soalso does an ability to sense or intuit. Hunches provide potent materialwhen used in an appropriate way. It is important to distinguish betweenhunches and assumptions, and to be aware when we are sharing ahunch, and when we are making an assumption and treating this as a fact. An important part of building self-worth, self-value and self-respect lies in learning to care for and about oneself, in mind, body and spirit.Caring for others stems from being able to care for ourselves. If we donot feel cared for we look to others to ll our needs. Caring for thecarer is therefore essential, otherwise the carer, as much as the personseeking help, is in need of receiving the care outlined earlier. Those who are considering using a counselling approach in their work face the challenge of examining their reasons for choosing to be amember of the caring professions. Is it the hope that in providing forothers they will ll their own needs? If so what are these? Is it a needfor acknowledgement and recognition? Is it a desire to be thought ofas 'kind' 'helpful' and 'doing something worthwhile'? A dietitian'sprofessional practice is in question if her needs are mainly fullled byher patients. Y et if she has a commitment to her work and her patientsis this not going to be the case? An integral part of a counsellor's train-ing involves exploring their commitment to their own personal develop-ment. Dietitians who are thinking of using counselling skills in theirwork also need to explore their commitment to themselves. Part 4outlines some aspects of personal development for the dietitian toconsider. Different approaches to counselling Within counselling there are many different approaches based onvarying beliefs about human nature. These can be broadly categorisedunder three headings: psychoanalytic, behavioural and humanistic. Psychoanalytic approach Psychodynamic counselling comes under this heading as it is based on Freud's belief that unconscious motives and drives lead us to behavein certain ways. Past experience, of which we are unaware, is relivedwhen we encounter a similar experience in the present. Psychodynamiccounselling encourages the client to explore their past in relation toThe Dietitian as a Skilled Helper 11CSFC01 10/10/06 8:39 PM Page 11the present problem. Anxiety is reduced when clients are able to make sense fully of their patterns of behaviour. The principles and practiceare clearly explained by Michael Jacobs (2004) in his book Psychodynamic Counselling in Action . This approach is useful in health care when the patient has long-term emotional problems, suffers anxiety and talks ofan unhappy childhood (Burnard 1999). Behavioural approach The behavioural approach is based on the belief that all behaviour is learned and so can be unlearned. The rst step is to identify theundesirable behaviour and to replace this with desired behaviour by ascheme of positive reinforcement. The focus is on the behaviour andnot on exploring the reasons behind the patterns of behaviour. Thisapproach could be applied in health care with long-term behaviourproblems such as those which may occur in children (Burnard 1999),and is the approach recommended by Hunt and Hilsdon (1996) intheir book Changing Eating and Exercise Behaviour . Cognitive approaches are frequently combined with behavioural therapies and this has led to the development of CBT, which studieshave shown to be helpful for patients suffering from a range of emo-tional disorders including depression (Beck et al. 1987). CBT is based on the principle that our perception of ourselves and the world aroundus, that is, our point of view, shapes our thoughts (opinions, beliefs,ideas) and feelings and by learning to change our thoughts we changehow we feel and behave (Beck 1989). In Chapters 7 and 15 there are examples of how aspects of CBT can be used by dietitians. Thepotential for CBT to be misused in a coercive way has provoked criticism (Stickley 2005). Therefore in describing how dietitians canapply the principles I have carefully considered their integration withina person-centred approach. Humanistic approach The aim of a humanistic approach is to 'increase the range of choices and encourage and enable the client to handle this successfully' (Rowan1998). It is concerned with a client's thoughts, behaviour and feelings,and it is useful with problems concerning self-image and when some-one believes they are powerless to change their circumstances (Burnard1999). The humanistic approach is based on the existential philosophythat people are unique individuals essentially able to be responsiblefor the choices they make in their lives, rather than their actions beingdetermined by their unconscious as in the psychodynamic approach,12 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC01 10/10/06 8:39 PM Page 12or learned mechanically as in the behavioural approach. In the period from 1940 to 1970, Carl Rogers formulated his theory of person-centred counselling based on his knowledge of psychoanalytic andbehavioural theories, his clinical experience and a vast amount ofresearch (Thorne 1992). A fundamental tenet of the person-centredapproach is the realisation that a move towards change will occur whenthe qualities of empathy, acceptance and genuineness are present in arelationship (Rogers 2003). For a more detailed exposition of the humanistic approach the dietitian is recommended to read John Rowan's (1998) account in hisbook The Reality Game - a Guide to Humanistic Counselling and Therapy and Philip Burnard's (1999) account in his book Counselling Skills for Health Professionals . There are many schools of therapy within each approach and many of these are concisely described in Who Can I Ta l k To ? (Cooper & Lewis 1995). Many counsellors describe them- selves as having an eclectic approach and draw on aspects from several approaches in the belief that no one approach suits every situation and that individuals benet from the approach that most suits theirneeds at the time. The person-centred approach forms the foundation of the counselling skills described throughout this book and is concerned with: enabling patients to make appropriate choices; helping patients express their thoughts and feelings; demonstrating to patients that they have been heard and understood; enabling patients to feel valued and respected; supporting patients in the actions they choose to make. Transactional analysis , founded by Eric Berne, is another humanistic approach used in this book. Berne developed the concept of ego states calling these 'Parent, Adult and Child' (Stewart & Joines 1987).Understanding and recognising ego states can be useful as a frame-work for analysing an interaction when there are difculties in com-munication. For example, a dietitian in Parent ego state may say to apatient, 'Y ou shouldn't go without your breakfast.' The patient mayrespond from a Child ego state with, 'Well, I've never had breakfast up to now so I don't see why I should start at my age.' This conjuresup an impression of a rebellious child. Alternatively, the dietitianwhen in Adult ego state may say, 'It is generally recognised that havingsome breakfast is a healthy way to start the day.' The patient whoreplies, 'I understand that it is healthier for me to eat something in themorning rather than start the day on an empty stomach', is then alsoresponding from an Adult ego state.The Dietitian as a Skilled Helper 13CSFC01 10/10/06 8:39 PM Page 13Material is drawn from two other models where appropriate. Concepts from family therapy are described in Chapter 10. The aim of family therapy is to look at a family as a dynamic system and help thefamily members deal with their difculties in a different way. It is notconcerned with apportioning blame to an individual within the family,but rather with enabling family members to explore together the waysin which communications between them are unclear. They learn torecognise mixed messages and develop other ways of behaving towardsone another. The aim of therapy is to help family members develop a different perspective on their problems and discover alternativestrategies for coping. Techniques from neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) developed by John Grinder, a linguist, and Richard Bandler, a mathematician andtherapist (Bandler & Grinder 1979) are applied in this book wherethese can clarify communication. NLP includes skills such as mirroring,which can be used to great effect in creating rapport (Chapter 5). Apractitioner of NLP pays great attention to detail and observation.NLP focuses on treating problems in the present without recourse tothe past, and changing specic aspects of behaviour related to clearlydened problems. For example, a patient who has a phobia aboutheights is asked to describe in minute detail their experience of heights,including taste, smell, sight and sensation, and is then helped to changethe experience by a technique called 'reframing'. This chapter has examined the role of the dietitian and introduced some aspects of counselling. The next chapter focuses on the thoughts,feelings and behaviours associated with being a patient.

A patient who hasbeen referred to the dietitian is likely to be concerned about what will be said and done to them and who they will be seeing. Patients are also likely to be concerned about the time involved, where theinterview is to take place, how much, if anything, it is going to costthem and whether they will get satisfaction from their appointment(see Exercise 2.1). The following are some examples of questions thatmay occur to patients: Will I get there on time? Am I going to be kept waiting? How longwill it take? Where am I going? Will I be able to nd it?CSFC02 10/10/06 8:39 PM Page 16How much is the fee (if to be seen privately)? Will there be any extras? Will I be able to afford the diet recommended? Will I be weighed? Will I have to get undressed? Will I have bloodtaken? Will I be told to keep a food diary? Will I be told not to weighmyself ? Will I understand what I am told to do? Will I be given writteninstructions? Will I have to remember everything? Will I be asked lots of questions? Will I be told off or criticised? Will the person I see be younger or older than me? Will they ask about my past? How much do they already knowabout me? Their level of concern will be much related to the signicance of the illness for them, in other words, what it means to them to have thiscondition. This may differ from the concern of the dietitian or anotherhealth professional. For example, on the one hand the dietitian mayconsider fluctuating blood levels a worrying sign whereas the patientmay attach very little meaning to this. On the other hand the patientmay be extremely concerned about the results of a particular bloodtest although the doctor has told them not to worry. Patients with a chronic condition are likely to have concerns about: the abilities that they have lost, e.g. no longer able to do the job or activities they did before they became ill; whether life is still worth living; how and when they will die; their feelings of helplessness and dependency on others; what others think about them, e.g. how to cope with the socialstigma attached to some conditions;The Patient 17 Exercise 2.1 Think of as many points as you can that may concern a patient about to see the dietitian, e.g. What will she look like?, Will she be friendly?, Will she tell me off for weighing too much/too little? You may nd it helpful to imagine or recall how you would think, feel and behave if and when you, as a patient, consult an expert, e.g.your doctor.CSFC02 10/10/06 8:39 PM Page 17the ways in which their condition affects their relationships and sexual activity; whether their needs will be met by the medical profession and/orsocial services. When working with, or caring for, patients who are living with a chronic condition the dietitian or carer is likely to make the followingassumptions: 'I've got to be kind to them and think nicely about them becausethey have enough to put up with.' 'I can't possibly understand unless I also suffer from this illness.' 'It's not fair to be happy myself when he/she is suffering.' Dietitians who are aware when they themselves are making these assumptions are more likely to also be aware when other carers may bedoing the same. They are better placed to: think about how these assumptions affect their ability to provide ahelping relationship; empathise with those carers who may seek their help; recognise when patients want them to believe these assumptions,e.g. a patient may say, 'Y ou can't possibly know what it's like for me - you haven't got what I've got.' The patient's feelings Feelings are powerful forces which govern our thinking and behaviourand form the foundation of our experience. Culturally, we are notencouraged to express our feelings except in times of crisis. For somepeople, being a patient is a crisis situation. The intensity of feelingassociated with being a patient will vary from person to person depend-ing on the situation and the patient's attitude towards it. When in hospital there is increased dependency on others and this may arousefeelings which stay near to the surface. As patients we may feel: afraid; powerless; vulnerable; bewildered and confused; disorientated due to disruption of the normal pattern of life; misunderstood; worried and anxious; PM Page 18embarrassed; guilty; frustrated. Our anxiety as patients may be associated with thoughts about: not getting the help we need; being rejected when we ask for help; our survival being under threat; being less of a person in some way; losing self-condence and self-esteem; becoming dependent on others; being under the control of others and compelled to do something; the unknown; that the worst will happen. A patient may nd it easier to express anger than to acknowledge fear. Anger may cover disappointment, anxiety, a sense of failure, sadnessand loss. It has been recognised for a long time that emotion which isbottled up and trapped within the body affects muscle tension, pos-ture, and physical and mental well-being (Reich 1980). When we aretense we have difculty in making decisions and are more likely to setunrealistic goals. Bottled up emotion eventually leads to the develop-ment of low self-esteem and distorted beliefs about oneself and theworld in general (Burnard 1999). Physiotherapists and remedial gymnasts are trained to recognise muscle tension. Dietitians can train themselves to observe ways inwhich a patient may hold tension in their body, such as pursed lips,furrowed brows and rigid shoulders. Becoming more aware of the wayin which people express themselves gives the dietitian clues as to howher patient is feeling (Chapters 5 and 6). The patient's reactions When we are patients our health is under threat. Under conditionswhen we feel threatened it is normal to feel afraid and angry. 'Whyme?' is a common reaction to an unwelcome change such as ill health.This question, which is often asked by newly diagnosed patients as the implications of the diagnosis sink in, is a way of expressing theseemotions. Discovering we are ill can be a shock . Hearing news of our diagnosis may be a tremendous blow, especially if the news is given in an incon-siderate and clumsy way. Many dietitians see patients who have comeThe Patient 19CSFC02 10/10/06 8:39 PM Page 19straight from their doctor, who may have had to convey some bad news. The dietitian who is able to help her patient deal with the shockis providing a truly caring service. When we are in shock we need: to have someone with us; to be listened to; to have contact, e.g. a hand in ours, an arm around our shoulder. When we come out of the shock we feel a strong release of emotion , often anger and fear. Dietitians who understand that this is a normalreaction and feel comfortable enough to allow someone to expresstheir feelings are providing quality care, as the following exampledemonstrates. Patient : It's so hard to believ e... the doctor says the test is positive. At rst I didn't believe him. No w...I j ust want to kno w... why m e... (in a louder voice ) What have I done to deserve this ?...( begins to shout ) It's not fai r...( suddenly looks at dietitian ) sorr y...I shouldn't go on about it.Dietitian :(calmly ) You have had a shock and you're angry that this is happening to you.Patient : Yes I am angr y...a n d...( with voice shaking ) what am I going to do? How am I going to manage? What's going to happen to me?The doctor said he'd write to my G P...b u t w hat can he do? Dietitian :(calmly ) You feel scared when you think about what this means for yo u... how it will affect your lif e... and you wonder how the doctors can help you.Patient : Y e s...( sighs deeply ) What a mes s... you seem to under- stand. It's helped being able to talk to you. Some patients react to an unwelcome change by distancing them- selves from what is happening to them. This may take the form ofdenying to themselves and others the signicance of their illness. They make talk in a way that discounts the importance of any treat-ment or symptom, for example saying 'Oh I'll start my diet after myholiday' or 'The pain is nothing really - don't fuss'. They may behaveas though no change has occurred and continue to live their life asthough nothing has happened. Frequently, at some stage, the patient makes a bargain with him or herself or with another person. It is as though by promising to behavein a certain way, normality will be resumed; for example, 'If I try hardwith the diet for a while, maybe the diagnosis will turn out to be a mistake', or 'If I keep my appointment with the dietitian, maybe myblood tests will be normal'. Our thinking at such a time is not logicalbut a desperate attempt to restore our life to the way it was before 20 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC02 10/10/06 8:39 PM Page 20the change in health occurred. Dietitians will be familiar with patients who say, 'If I do without this, can I have more of that?'. Substitutingone food with another is often a practical way of managing dietaryrestrictions, and such a question may show understanding of the prin-ciples of substitution. On the other hand it may be an indication that apatient is having difculty in accepting the need for dietary change. A common reaction to a change in circumstances is to doubt our ability to cope . The patient who asks the dietitian 'Do you think I'll manage all right?' is expressing these doubts as much as the one whoclearly says 'I don't know how I'm going to cope with this diet'. Thedietitian who recognises the implied anxiety in what her patient saysand responds to this demonstrates her empathy (Chapter 3). Seekingto reassure the patient with remarks such as 'Y ou'll be all right', 'Ofcourse you'll cope' and 'I'm sure you'll be ne', risks being perceivedas patronising by the patient, who may feel diminished rather thancomforted (Chapter 6). Although such reassurance seeks to allay dis-comfort it invites the patient to think in an unrealistic way and leads to confusion. Demonstrating empathy, however, acknowledges thereality of the patient's feelings. An empathic response is more likely tobe perceived as afrming and assuring despite the discomfort. As well as experiencing self-doubt, patients may blame themselves, making remarks such as 'If only I hadn't eaten so much' or 'If only Ihadn't been tempted'. The underlying message is 'I'm not good enough'and 'I'm a bad person'. The dietitian is demonstrating empathy, whichis invaluable in creating a helping relationship (Chapter 3), when sheresponds to remarks such as these by acknowledging the anger patientsare expressing towards themselves. One way of doing this is to say 'I think you're being very hard on yourself' or 'Y ou seem annoyed withyourself for eating so much'. The patient who talks freely and openly and discloses a lot about themselves may on another occasion withdraw and be reluctant toengage in further discussion. When the dietitian is aware that this is a normal way to react, she is more able to assess the situation real-istically and not blame herself unnecessarily for the lack of fruitful discussion. Patients may distance themselves from their illness and their emotions in the following ways (see Exercise 2.2): Withdrawing and not talking Avoiding the topic by skating around it, dismissing it or diminish-ing it Being reluctant to take the necessary steps to ease the situation Talking about the difculties continually without resolving them.The Patient 21CSFC02 10/10/06 8:39 PM Page 21What the patient wants Many of the patient's problems are likely to be long-standing. The vulnerability of being a patient is likely to bring underlying problemsand emotions to the surface. The patient may want to talk about theseto someone and the dietitian may be the person they have chosen.Patients may nd it easier to talk to the dietitian than the doctorbecause they think the dietitian has more time to listen, will be moreunderstanding or is someone they will only see once. Some people feel more comfortable talking to someone they only see briefly, what isknown as 'the stranger on the train' phenomenon (Burnard 1999). Patients want to: be heard and understood; have the opportunity to tell their story; have information; feel able to cope; know they have support. Patients know that seeing the dietitian is something to do with their diet and that some change is likely. They may know exactly what theinterview entails or they may not know what to expect. Patients may want to know: how important is the change in diet to their health; if a change in diet is a short-term measure or a lifetime change; if the dietitian is going to be encouraging or dismissive; how a change in diet is going to affect the rest of their life; how to manage a change in diet as well as the other changes that arehappening to them. The nature of change Change has a ripple effect A change in a patient's diet may lead to unforeseen changes in other areas of the patient's life. For example, it may mean changes to a22 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 2.2 What examples can you think of where patients behave in the ways mentioned here? Note the remarks you think they may make, e.g. 'I'mne, the diet's no problem' (dismissing any difculties), and how theymay behave, e.g. patient pretends to be asleep (withdrawing).CSFC02 10/10/06 8:39 PM Page 22whole family pattern of eating, cooking and shopping, resulting in increased anxiety and arguments within the family. The dietitian hasonly a limited knowledge of the patient and cannot appreciate the full meaning that the prescribed change may have for that patient.However, understanding more about the process of change can helpthe dietitian develop greater respect for a patient as they struggle tomodify their eating behaviour. Change occurs in a number of ways Change may be thrust upon a patient, as when a diet is prescribed to treat an acute illness. It may be initiated by a patient, as when some-one decides to modify their intake because they want to lose weight fora special occasion. It may develop over time as a result of an earlieridea, as when people gradually change their eating habits as ideas onhealthy eating become more widespread. People react and adapt to change in various ways When a change is thrust upon us we often suffer shock and grief before we are able to come to terms with it. A person with newly diagnoseddiabetes, for example, is likely to react in this way. In the struggle to adapt to enforced change we make efforts at times to reinstate the situation as it was before the change occurred. The diabetic patientwho follows the newly prescribed regimen carefully for a time andthen appears to give up, reflects this stage. Our reactions to change arecovered more fully in the next section. Change is paradoxical in that we both want it and do not want it A change that we have initiated because we desire the outcome, as with the woman who goes on a diet because she wants to lose weight,seems at rst to be straightforward to implement. But however muchshe wants the change to happen, there is likely to be a signicant partof her which is anxious about the process she will have to go throughto effect the change. She may also have fears about how she will beonce the change has occurred. Someone who succeeds in losing excessweight will be a different shape and size. As a result of the change inher body others will relate differently to her and she will also have adifferent perception of herself. This may have unforeseen repercussionsand give rise to a different set of problems. The patient may thereforebe ambivalent about achieving the results of the change which, on theface of it, she wants to happen.The Patient 23CSFC02 10/10/06 8:39 PM Page 23Change can have implications of which we are not aware A modication to the diet, even though small, may have a signicance for the patient that is beyond their immediate awareness. A womanwho has struggled with dieting in the past will have mixed thoughtsand feelings about trying another diet. Her ambivalence may reflectsome underlying issues involved in changing weight. She may beunaware of these and, even if she were to become aware that thesewere at the root of her eating behaviour, she may not be willing to facethem. She may continue to struggle with dieting and let her innerconflicts remain as they are. Reactions to change Reactions to change or the idea of a change are largely determined by attitude. If change is perceived as unwelcome and as a threat, wemourn the loss that the change brings. If we think of the change aswelcome we respond actively. If we see it as a challenge we may rise tothe occasion or feel overwhelmed and unable to cope. We react in a characteristically ambivalent way. At rst we may deny that a change is necessary. Denial may be the case even when a changehas obviously taken place. For example, when someone has died thebereaved person may refuse to accept the death for some time. Whenwe realise that a change is slowly taking place we are often reluctant toacknowledge it, as may happen when someone has a chronic wastingdisease. Even when the change is one we want to initiate and knowhow to implement, we are often beset by misgivings: 'Am I doing theright thing?' 'Was this the best choice?'. The anxiety we feel reflectsthe signicance we attach to the change. We may cope with the anxiety associated with a change by talking about it with someone else. We act in the hope that 'a trouble shared is a trouble halved'. This may well produce temporary relief. In returnwe may receive advice (helpful or otherwise) or be diverted away fromour concerns on to those of the listener who wants to talk about theirown anxieties. Our condence may be shared with others without our permission and we may regret that we have spoken. On the otherhand we may nd it too difcult to talk or we may not have anyone inwhom we feel safe enough to conde. We may try shrugging off ouranxieties, telling ourselves that things will get better in time, that thereis nothing we can do about it anyway. We may distract ourselves in anattempt to assuage the discomfort by getting involved with someone24 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC02 10/10/06 8:39 PM Page 24or something else. We may turn to alcohol, drugs or food as a prop to help us through. Adapting to change Although a change may be precipitated by a single sudden event,adapting to the change takes place over time. For example, the resultof a blood sugar test resulting in a diagnosis of diabetes heralds amajor change in a patient's life, which takes time to accept. Implementing change is a process made up of a series of steps in a particular direction and we make changes only to return to morefamiliar ways of behaving in times of stress. A patient who successfullykeeps to a diet for a while returns to more established patterns of eatingwhen feeling anxious or depressed. Any change involves giving up orletting go of something familiar and gaining something new, and theuncertainty associated with this is frightening or exciting dependingupon our perception. We experience a range of emotions during change,such as hope, desire, frustration, fear, determination, confusion, hope-lessness and inadequacy. We are more likely to implement a change if we perceive that the benets to be gained by the change outweigh those we get by con-tinuing the existing behaviour. For example, someone who realises the benets to their health of not smoking may decide to stop buyingcigarettes. However, a smoker may not succeed in becoming a non-smoker despite taking the necessary actions to stop because they stillthink of themselves as a smoker, not a non-smoker. Similarly, a patient may understand that the risks of heart disease will be reduced if theyeat less fat and know the type of foods to buy as substitutes. Despitethis knowledge, they may not change their eating behaviour because itis associated with their perception of themselves as someone leading a particular way of life. This chapter has explored the thoughts, feelings and behaviour which many experience when they are unwell. The next chapter examinesthe relationship between patient and dietitian.The Patient 25 Exercise 2.3 Make a list of changes that have occurred for you in the last year.

Carl Rogers (2004): On Becoming a Person In this chapter I discuss: Issues arising in the relationship between patientand dietitian The core conditions for ahelping relationshipEmpathy Acceptance Genuineness Issues arising in the relationship between patient and dietitian Difculties arise in any relationship when it is perceived as being one-sided, that is, when one person feels that the other has more power and that there is little they can do to influence what happens. In the relationship between patient and dietitian the dietitian is in theauthoritative position as the health professional and the patient is inthe less powerful position as the person seeking help. It is importantfor the dietitian to be aware of this imbalance. It is also important forher to recognise that her patient does have power, however limited. Aswell as the patient needing help from the dietitian, the dietitian alsoneeds something from her patient, for example, their attention andco-operation. When this mutuality can be appreciated by the dietitianshe is more able to foster a mutually fullling relationship. Her attitudeCSFC03 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 27towards her patients and her perception of her role as a dietitian funda- mentally affect her ability to develop a helping relationship. As well as her approach, the circumstances in which the dietitian and patient meet also affect the development of a helping relation-ship. The length of time they spend together and the privacy available(Chapter 4) are just two examples. To patients it may seem that theyhave little opportunity to talk freely. Similarly the dietitian may thinkshe has little time to listen fully. Feelings of disillusionment, then, may develop for both patient and dietitian with each attributing power to the other, yet neitherexperiencing this for themselves. Each may have thoughts such as'There's not much point in meeting again' and 'What am I doing this(job) for?'. Aggressive or manipulative behaviour may be used in anattempt to counteract the feelings of powerlessness, and may result inblame, recrimination and a high degree of non-compliance. Patientsmay vote with their feet and not keep the next appointment, and thedietitian may heave a sigh of relief that a patient has defaulted. Clearlywhen this happens a helping relationship has not been established. There are times when patients do their best to carry out the advice and instructions they are given. There are also times when they mayfeel resentful and refuse to co-operate. Most of us can recall how wefeel when someone else tells us what we 'could' or 'should' or 'ought'to do. As children there will have been many times when we were told'your mother/father/teacher knows best'. We had limited experienceof the world compared with the adults who cared for us and weneeded to be told what to do and how to behave. However, when thesemessages are communicated between adults they reinforce the beliefthat the helper knows best. The relationship between helper and theperson being helped becomes one in which the helper continues to be invested with the power. The person being helped is encouraged to remain dependent on the helper for advice, and so the idea of the professional being the powerful expert is perpetuated by healthworker and patient alike. Dependency may be fostered when patients follow a diet because the doctor or dietitian has said this is what they have got to do. When this happens patients are likely to feel anxious if they do not getthe approval they want. Patient and dietitian may both see failure to comply with dietary advice as a lack of willpower and a sign of weak-ness. The dietitian may then respond by trying to make the patientfeel better about themselves, or the dietitian may blame the patient aswell as herself for being ineffective. The issues of power and dependency are manifested in transfer- ence. It is valuable for dietitians to become aware of the possibility of28 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC03 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 28transference in their relationships with patients and the ways in which this may affect their work. Transference can occur in any relationshipand is a concept familiar to psychodynamic counsellors and psycho-analytic therapists. Dietitians who are interested in further reading onthis subject are referred to Jacobs (2004). As patients we are likely to feel helpless, frustrated and anxious. We may, without realising it, begin to relate to those caring for us inways which are similar to the ways we related to parents or teachers inour childhood. When this happens transference is said to have takenplace. For example, patients may feel helpless and want or expect thedietitian to solve their problem for them. They may place the dietitianin the role of a mother who is there to take care of them. The patientmay say things which reflect this, such as 'What are you going to do forme then?' or 'Y ou're going to tell me I can't eat the things I really likeany more, aren't you?'. These remarks are reminiscent of a child-parent relationship. The dietitian may respond in a way which entersinto this type of relationship, for example, 'It's for your own good, youknow'. If she does behave in a way reminiscent of the patient's mothershe is said to be in countertransference . Transference is not limited to the patient. The dietitian may also project her feelings and desires onto the patient; for example, a dieti-tian may relate to a patient as if she were a daughter by projecting onto the patient her feelings of anxiety to do the 'right' thing and herdesire for approval. Alternatively she may relate to a patient as if thepatient were her child and project onto them her desire to protect orcriticise. Entering into transference and countertransference usually happens without much awareness by either party. The difculties that arise limitthe quality of help and support that the dietitian can provide. The typeof relationship which develops is one in which the power is held by oneperson, usually the dietitian, and there is an increased dependency bythe patient. The dietitian can minimise the possibility of such a relation-ship developing by focusing on her use of active listening and reflective responding as described in Chapters 5 and 6. In Rogers' experience, transference was less likely to build up when the helper was able toprovide what he called the core conditions in the relationship (Rogers 2004). The core conditions for a helping relationship A high degree of mutual respect and a sense of self-empowermentpromote a sense of equality in a relationship, with each person takingThe Relationship Between Dietitian and Patient 29CSFC03 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 29responsibility for their actions. The dietitian who wants to develop her ability to relate in this way will nd the core conditions of empathy, acceptance and genuineness (Mearns & Thorne 1999) a rich source of material. The core conditions form the foundation of the person-centred approach and provide a relationship in which the patient feelsheard, accepted and valued. As a result, the patient is more able toexperiment, take risks and change behaviour. In other words the patientis more motivated to change. The dietitian too is likely to experience agreater sense of satisfaction and motivation in her work. Empathy, acceptance and genuineness are simple words to say but they are not easy to describe, as words are a limited means of com-municating an experience. Those who have received empathy andacceptance from someone who is genuine are likely to recall the experience as having been particularly meaningful. These three coreconditions are so interrelated that if one is missing the others are limited. Demonstrating empathy is therefore more than a skill; it is areflection of an underlying attitude of acceptance and honesty bothtowards oneself and another. Developing an ability to provide the core conditions is demanding for the helper. It requires a high degree of self-assessment and explorationof thought patterns, feelings and behaviour, and above all a willing-ness to question existing beliefs and to be open to new concepts. Empathy It is important to distinguish empathy from sympathy. Empathy involvescaring in a truly genuine and accepting way and developing a sensitiveand accurate understanding of the way in which another perceives theirexperience, while at the same time maintaining a sense of one's ownidentity. When we are empathic we share another person's experienceas if it were our own, while being aware throughout that it is not. Empathy is experienced as 'having been understood' and is empower-ing for the person receiving it. When we feel sympathy we seem to take on the experience of the other person as though it were our own. We may identify with anotherand experience a merging with them, which can lead us to be increas-ingly critical or protective. Our response tends to be to criticise in the hope that the other person will see the 'error' of their ways, or toreassure in the hope that the person will feel better. However, this carries a risk of creating a barrier in the relationship (Chapter 6). The person who is receiving the sympathy may feel comforted, but on the other hand they may feel patronised and chastised.30 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC03 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 30To demonstrate empathy we need to be willing and able to gain an understanding of the world of another from their point of view. Thisrequires us to be open and accepting of their thoughts and feelings.Empathy is about a way of being with another. We can demonstrate empathy through our use of active listening and reflective responding(Chapters 5 and 6) and, as we develop our ability to listen in this way,we increase our ability to be empathic. However, our ability to beempathic is limited by our own need to be heard and understood byanother. Therefore the more we are able to meet our own needs themore we are able to be available to another. As health professionals, dietitians see and hear a lot about others' pain and distress. When listening to someone in distress the dietitian mayhave feelings which make it difcult for her to distinguish those thatbelong to her and those that belong to the other person. She may feelirritable, frustrated, guilty, surprised, fearful, helpless and overwhelmed.In order to cope with this she may cut herself off emotionally or elseworry greatly about the other person, which limits her ability to helpeffectively. It is therefore important for her to be able to understandher own reactions (Exercise 3.1). Developing the ability to observe and acknowledge feelings appro- priately is a process of personal development (see Part 4) duringThe Relationship Between Dietitian and Patient 31 Exercise 3.1 If possible do this exercise with a partner. Below are outlines of three 'real life' experiences of dietitians. Take each one separately. One personreads through a situation and the other listens. As you do so focus onyour immediate reactions. How do you feel, what are you thinking, whataction do you want to take? Discuss this with your partner. (1) A patient you have seen once before returns for a follow-up appoint- ment. She says, 'I've been turning a lot of things over in my mind sincemy last visit. I think a lot of how I feel about myself and my weight isbecause I was interfered wit h...a s a child... you kno w... what do you think?' (2) A terminally ill patient on enteral feeds says to you: 'You're very kind to take so much trouble with me. I don't know why you bother though -there's not much point is there? I'd like to die now.' (3) A patient says, 'It's all very well for you, you're getting paid for this. You can afford to eat. M e... I'm unemployed with barely enough to live on and you tell me I can afford this diet. How do you know? I betyou've never known what it's like to go without.'CSFC03 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 31which the dietitian becomes more open and able to provide the core conditions. Empathic responses Different levels of empathy have been recognised. These range from a response which shows no understanding at all to a response in which the helper demonstrates an understanding which is beyond theclient's present awareness (Mearns & Thorne 1999). In the followingexample four different responses are given to illustrate the various levels of empathy. Patient : I try so hard to lose weight and manage to keep to my diet most of the week. It's at weekend s... when I'm on my ow n...I feel so lonely I just ea t...I guess it's for comfort really. Dietitian 1: ( shows no understanding ) There's no point in comfort eating - that won't help you at all.Dietitian 2: ( shows partial understanding of thoughts and feelings ) That makes it really difcult for you.Dietitian 3: ( shows accurate understanding of feelings and thoughts ) It's as if all the effort you've made in the week is undone at the weekends whenyou're on your own and feeling lonel y...t h a t ' s when you want to eat. Dietitian 4: ( shows understanding beyond the patient's immediate awareness ) When you talk about being lonely and eating to comfort yoursel f...y o u speak very quietl y...a s though you're feeling really sad? In the third response the dietitian reflects, by paraphrasing, what the patient has said, and in the fourth response she is focusing on the feeling which the patient is communicating through her tone ofvoice (Chapter 6). Empathy at a deep level involves getting a sense ofwhat is just beyond the other person's present awareness, as in this lastexample. The level of empathy which is appropriate at the time dependson the relationship that the dietitian has with a particular patient. Ifthe dietitian responds showing a depth of understanding inappro-priate to the level of relationship, the patient is likely to deny what the dietitian has said and to refrain from disclosing more. Similarly, if the dietitian shows no understanding the patient is unlikely to divulgefurther information. By showing partial and accurate understanding,as in the second and third responses, the dietitian is indicating heracceptance and understanding of the patient. When rst practising empathic responses the dietitian may try hard to make the 'right' one. But being empathic is more than making theright response; it is about being able to sense what the other personmay be thinking and feeling, and sharing this with them. The ability to do this comes with experience, increasing self-awareness, and thedevelopment of acceptance and genuineness.32 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC03 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 32Acceptance When we attempt to understand the experience of another we show our willingness to accept them. We nd it relatively easy to acceptsomeone we like, someone we nd attractive in some way, or someonewho shares our beliefs and values. It is far more difcult to acceptsomeone whose behaviour we do not understand, whose beliefs we donot share or whose attitudes we dislike. When we consider the extentof our acceptance we begin to realise just how much this is conditionalupon the other person being and acting in a particular way, as the following example shows. Patient :( speaks in an accusing tone of voice ) There's no point in weigh- ing me this week; I know I haven't lost any. I said to my husband, 'There'sno point in me going to see her - she'll only tell me off'. I've no will power,that's my problem.Dietitian :(feels taken aback, thinks to herself, 'She's right - there is no point in her coming. She'll never lose any weight'. Feels hopeless, defeated. Gives a little laugh thinking she needs to be cheerful about this ) Well, we'll have to see what we can do about that won't we? Let's see what the scales have to say, shall we? ( indicates to patient to step on scales ). Patient :( without speaking steps slowly onto scales ). The dietitian in this example nds it difcult to accept the patient when she is behaving in an aggressive manner. Her response is anattempt to get the patient to behave in the way she would like. In thefollowing scenario the dietitian responds differently. Patient :( speaks in an accusing tone of voice ) There's no point in weigh- ing me this week; I know I haven't lost any. I said to my husband, 'There'sno point in me going to see her - she'll only tell me off'. I've no will power,that's my problem.Dietitian :(thinks 'This sounds familiar'. Recalls a recent experience while working on the computer when whatever she tried did not work as she wanted.She thought then there was no point in going on and remembers how frustratedshe felt. She wonders if this is how her patient is feeling. Now feels more acceptingtowards her patient and wants to demonstrate her empathy ) You nearly didn't come because you were worried that if you haven't lost any weight I'd you? Dietitian :(gently ) No, I'm not cross with you but I'm wondering if you're feeling cross with yourself ?Patient :( with a sigh ) You're right. I just can't seem to keep to the diet. Can you help me? Acceptance involves having respect and warmth for another as a human being, regardless of who they are or what they have done.Acceptance of another relates closely to acceptance of ourselves.The Relationship Between Dietitian and Patient 33CSFC03 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 33There are many things we criticise about ourselves and often we do this without being fully aware of it. The more self-aware we become,the greater our self-understanding and the greater our ability to acceptourselves. The process is a painful one at times as we gain insight intothe many ways in which we do not accept ourselves, the many timeswe put ourselves down, the difculties we have in acknowledging ourstrengths, qualities and achievements, and the way in which we focuson our faults, failings and mistakes. In most cultures, we are frequentlyencouraged to discount our attributes, to criticise ourselves, to setourselves high standards and demand a great deal of ourselves. Greatvalue is placed on achievement as a source of personal satisfaction, yetthere are many who despite their considerable achievements, remainextremely self-critical. The extent to which we are critical of ourselves and critical of others limits our ability to provide acceptance. We either expect a great dealfrom others or underestimate them. When people do not meet ourexpectations we behave in various ways, for example we may persuade,manipulate and cajole them into behaving the way we want them to. Ifthis fails we are likely to criticise them either to their face or to othersor else inwardly to ourselves. As our resentment and frustration growwe may threaten, order or lecture them until we reach a point of despair,when we are likely to give up (Exercise 3.2). As shown in Chapter 6,each of these ways of responding carries a risk of creating a barrier inthe relationship. The things we nd unacceptable in others are those that we have dif- culty in accepting within ourselves, and the qualities and characteristicswe admire in others are those we admire, or would like to develop inourselves.34 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 3.2 Think of a patient you have seen recently. What are some of the things you like about them? Write these down. What are some of the things youdislike or nd uncomfortable about them? Write these down. Take eachitem you have noted in turn and consider this in relation to yourself. For example, you may have written 'Arrived late for appointment' as oneof the things you disliked. Now think about how you keep appointments. Do you make sure you arrive early so as not to be late? Do you criticise yourself for being late?Do you blame circumstances for making you late or do you accept thatyou were late as a consequence of not leaving yourself enough time?What have you learned about yourself from this exercise?CSFC03 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 34Genuineness Genuineness, which Rogers also described as congruence, means being who we truly are without front or facade (Bolton 1986), or as thephilosopher Kiekegaard put it 'being that self that one truly is'. This is by no means easy. Our culture encourages us to value achievementand undervalue emotional needs, thus fostering a society which hasdifculty in expressing feelings, something psychotherapist Susie Orbach(1994) describes as 'our emotional illiteracy' in her book What's Really Going on Here? . The more genuine the person, the more trust we have in them. We recognise someone as genuine when what they say matches how theysay it and these are both matched by their facial expression (Bandler & Grinder 1979). There is a congruence between verbal and non-verbal communication. Conversely, we recognise when there is anincongruity. In the following example the dietitian notices this. Dietitian : Hello. How are you today Mrs Jones? Patient :( does not make eye contact but looks down at the floor. Her face is blank apart from a slight tremor of her lower lip ). I'm OK. Dietitian :(notices incongruence between words and body language. Speaks gently ) You seem upset. Has something happene d...d o you want to tell me about it?Patient :( begins to cry ). Our difculty in expressing feelings stems from childhood when we decided that certain feelings were unacceptable. We also learnedthat certain behaviours were unacceptable. When we are children we confuse feelings with behaviour and, as a result of our experienceconclude that while we should not behave in a certain way, we shouldnot feelcertain feelings either. The following is an example of how the confusion can occur. Jane is a 3-year-old who is happy with her discovery of a bar of chocolate, which she is smearing over her face. Her mother is horried to nd her in asticky mess. She pulls the chocolate away from Jane and smacks her, sayingloudly, 'Naughty girl'. Jane starts to cry. She feels upset. She knows hermother is cross with her. In her mind she decides this means she is a badperson. Her mother picks her up and hugs her saying, 'There's no need tocry - you can have some chocolate after you've had your dinner.' Jane stopscrying but feels very confused. She thinks, 'Mummy smacks me and I cry but then she hugs me and tells me not to cry.' In order to deal with our confusion we learn to mask how we truly feel. However, if we want to help others who are in emotional distress weThe Relationship Between Dietitian and Patient 35CSFC03 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 35need to be able to recognise and acknowledge our own feelings because these are a valuable indicator, as the following example demonstrates. Patient :( accosts dietitian in clinic waiting room, speaks in loud voice ) I was given an appointment for 10 o'clock. It's now after 11. How would youlike it if you had to wait that long?Dietitian :(speaks calmly, makes eye contact ) I wouldn't like it and would feel angry. I recognise that you are too, by the way you are pointing yournger at me.Patient :( pauses, lowers hand ) O h... sorry...I didn't mean to take it out on you. It's just getting to me not knowing how much longer I've got to wait. Here the dietitian is being open and honest with the patient in acknow- ledging her feeling of anger and pointing out the patient's behaviour.We sense when someone is putting on a front, when there is a discrep-ancy between their verbal and non-verbal communication, as wouldbe the case if the dietitian had responded as follows. Patient :( in loud voice ) I was given an appointment for 10 o'clock. It's now after 11. How would you like it if you had to wait that long?Dietitian :(while moving away ) Now reall y... there's no need to get into such a state. I'm sure you won't have to wait longer than is really necessary ( smiles in what she hopes is an encouraging way and walks away ). Patient :( shakes st at her departing back ). As we become more open to our feelings we gradually learn that we provide empathy and acceptance when we allow ourselves to be genuine.We come to recognise that in being who we truly are, we are creatingan environment in which a healthy, helping relationship can develop. Having examined the conditions required for a helping relationship, the next chapter focuses on how the dietitian can begin to put theseinto practice. References Bandler, R. & Grinder, J.

They may meet by appointment in a clinic for an allotted time, or in ahospital setting at the request of a nurse or doctor, where the patientmay either be in bed, sitting beside the bed or in a day room. They maymeet in a place where there is little privacy or they may have a room to themselves. They may meet once only or on a number of occasionsCSFC04 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 37over an unspecied length of time. The time available may be limited to a few minutes or may last half an hour or more. The meeting maybe interrupted or brought to a premature end by the dietitian's bleep,by the patient feeling unwell or by outside factors such as the arrival ofvisitors or the demands of medical procedures. This variety of circumstances means the dietitian has to quickly assess what is needed and what help she can offer, while taking into accountthe time and privacy available. The dietitian who uses counsellingskills will be concerned with creating an environment in which bothshe and her patient can feel relaxed and at ease together (Chapter 8).She will be helped in this by having a framework in which to t herwork (the helping process) and a model to help her understand theprocess of change that her patient is experiencing. Helping the patient Chapter 2 describes some of the concerns experienced by patients.The dietitian who appreciates these can help her patients by also takinginto account the following points. When giving the appointment Clarify that the patient knows where to come and at what time. Explain how long the appointment is for, how much the fee is and when this is to be paid (if seeing the patient privately). Inform the patient what the interview will be about. Let the patient know what the procedure will be. At the appointment Explain: how much time you have together; the purpose of the appointment; what you will be covering; the arrangements for future appointments (if any); what information you already have about the patient; whether the information given by the patient is condential or to be discussed with others.38 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC04 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 38Concerns of the dietitian In addition to the concerns about privacy and time described above, the dietitian is likely to be thinking about the: Patients : Will I be able to help them? If not what shall I do? Will they be friendly, approachable or rude and disagreeable? Information : Do I know enough? Is my information accurate? Interview : Will they tell me what I need to know? How can I get them to talk? How can I get them to stop talking? The dietitian may also be asking herself how she can tell if: the change in diet is one that the patient wants; the patient thinks dietary change has been thrust upon them; the patient has been considering a change in diet for some time; dietary change is recommended by the doctor but not accepted by the patient; the patient has previously made attempts to change their diet.Working Together 39 Exercise 4.1 Imagine yourself about to send an appointment to a patient. Think what you would say if you were to include each of the points mentioned. Nowimagine yourself as a patient receiving the information. How would youfeel and what would you think? Exercise 4.2Imagine yourself seeing a patient for the rst time. What would you say to cover each of the points mentioned. Exercise 4.3 Close your eyes and allow yourself to relax. Now recall yourself with a patient. A specic scene may come to mind; if so, notice as much detailas you can. Be aware of how you feel. What are you thinking about thepatient? It may be that your mind remains blank or that vague memoriescome back to you. Whatever your experience, now return yourself to thepresent by recalling the room in which you are sitting before slowlyopening your eyes. Write down or share with a partner your experienceof this exercise, in particular your thoughts and feelings.CSFC04 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 39Establishing a time boundary Limited time is a constraint felt by many dietitians. All too often the next patient is waiting to be seen or there are other tasks waiting to be done. The dietitian hopes that the present interview will not taketoo long and that there will not be any interruptions. Although sheknows that, theoretically, she has, say, 20 minutes for a patient, it isoften difcult to keep to this in practice. Keeping to time boundariescan be seen as being strict and authoritarian. The dietitian wants to befriendly and helpful yet she realises that if she gives more time to onepatient she will have less with another and may feel guilty about doingthis. When this situation persists, resentment, frustration and stresscan grow. It is helpful and caring for both the patient and herself if the dietitian keeps clear time boundaries. Clarifying the time available helps thepatient feel secure and safe and allows the dietitian to relax knowingthat a structure has been formed. One way to do this is to explain thisto the patient at the beginning of the interview. Dietitian :(after she has introduced herself ) We have 20 minutes together this morning. If we nd we want more time we can arrange another appoint-ment before you leave. Having established the boundaries it is important to keep to them. This is easier to do when they have been openly stated at the start.Many dietitians believe that it will take extra time if they get involvedin listening to a patient's personal concerns. However, this need not be the case if the time available has been established at the start.Counsellors who listen deeply to someone's personal concerns aretrained to establish clear time boundaries and to keep to these both for their own well-being and for that of their client. A dietitian will be more able to make effective use of time in a dietetic interview by stating clearly the time available and keeping to this. As a result both dietitian and patient will be more able to attend to what is being said. Condentiality This is an issue at the heart of counselling because by its very natureclients are divulging personal information and sharing intimate feel-ings and opinions. Condentiality is also of concern in the practice of dietetics. A statement issued by the Disciplinary Committee of theDietitians Board (1996) makes it clear that40 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC04 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 40'dietitians must not knowingly disclose to any unauthorised person the result of investigations or any other information of a personal or condentialnature gained in the course of practice of his/her profession.' The Ethical Framework for Good Practice in Counselling and Psychotherapy (British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy 2002) statesthat respecting client condentiality is a fundamental requirement forkeeping trust. Those using counselling skills in medical settings mayhave difculty maintaining client condentiality, in that informationabout a patient needs to be shared with others concerned with thepatient's care. A health professional who ensures that her patient knowsthe extent to which they are being offered condentiality is providing a good standard of practice and care. The following example shows how this code of practice can be applied in dietetic practice. In the example an interview between a patient and a dietitian is in progress. Introductions have been made and thepatient is talking about her previous attempts to lose weight. Patient :( begins to cry ) It's the same every time I try to lose weight. He has a go at m e...h e ' s s o c r u e l...I don't know how long I can put up with it.Dietitian :(realises the patient could disclose information of a highly personal nature and decides to make her position clear ) You seem very upset and if it would help you to talk about it to me, I'm here to listen. Whatever you saywill be condential between us although if I think, from what you tell me,that your health is in imminent risk or that anyone else may be hurt I mayneed to talk about this to a colleague. I would not take this step withouttalking to you about it rst ( pauses to give patient time to consider this ). Would you like to talk to me about why you're upset? A dietitian may nd it more practical to establish condentiality at the beginning of an interview as in the following example. Dietitian : This is the rst time we've met and before we discuss your diet I want you to know that what you say to me is condential between us.I do keep records about the dates of your appointments and your dietrequirements. If I think that anything we talk about concerns your medicalcondition I may need to talk to my colleagues, although if this happens I would do my best to discuss this with you rst. When considering the issue of condentiality the following questions merit discussion: What are the advantages to the patient and the dietitian in estab-lishing condentiality? Under what circumstances might the dietitian to breakcondentiality?Working Together 41CSFC04 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 41How can the dietitian manage situations where others invite her to break condentiality, e.g. when a doctor wants to know what sheand a patient have been talking about? Questions concerning condentiality apply to both written and verbal communication. Dietitians are required to keep records and write in medical notes and guidance on standards for record keeping have been published jointly by the British Dietetic Association and the Dietitians Board (Eaton & Lewis 2001). These guidelines refer to the ethical aspects of keeping records and state the need to 'protectcondentiality, to ensure consent and to assist patients and clients(and their carers) to make informed decisions'. Such information maybe read by many people other than those immediately concerned withthe patient. In deciding what constitutes good practice the followingquestions, raised in a counselling context (Bond 2000), are worthconsideration by dietitians. Who has access to the written material? What might this be used for? Why is it desirable to keep this particular information? How securely are records kept and for how long? As greater computerisation of records becomes widespread, issues of access and condentiality become more complex. Dietitians needto record clear and accurate nutritional and biochemical informationin sufcient detail. The following questions concerning condentialitybetween patient and dietitian also merit consideration: To what extent is it necessary to record information on social and per-sonal issues in addition to nutritional and biochemical information? Can social and personal issues be distinguished from dietetic-relatedinformation or are they inextricably linked? Do patients realise their records might be read by people otherthan the dietitian and their doctor? If the dietitian does not record non-technical information but assignsthis to memory, how might a subsequent interview with the patientbe affected? If a colleague at a follow-up appointment does not have knowledgeof the social and personal issues previously discussed, how mightthe interview with the patient be affected? How might a patient feel when a dietitian, having read her colleague'snotes, refers to certain social or personal issues which the patienthad previously talked about in condence? Where does professional integrity and respect for patient conden-tiality cease and professional incompetence begin?42 Counselling Skills 8:38 PM Page 42The dietitian may nd it helpful to inform her patients what she considers necessary to record, or ask them what they want or do notwant her to include. The following example shows how this could be done. Dietitian : We have talked about changes in your diet and you have told me quite a lot about yourself. I have to write a record of our appointment.Is there anything you would want me to include or to leave out?Patient : Well I don't want everyone to know I've just got divorced for instance - it's none of their business. I only told you because you asked meabout cooking at home and my family. I don't mind you knowing but it'snothing to do with anyone else.Dietitian : So if I note the changes you can make in your diet and that you are willing to try these out, is that all right with you? If you see anotherdietitian in the future you can decide then what else you want to tell her.Patient : Yes, that's ne. The helping process In his book The Skilled Helper , Egan (2004) describes three main stages in the helping process, based on providing the core conditions ofempathy, acceptance and genuineness (Chapter 3). He identies therst stage as one of helping someone to tell their story and in so doinghelping them to clarify and identify their problem. The skills of activelistening and building rapport are used in this stage in building a help-ing relationship. The second stage concerns helping someone clarifywhat they need and want. This may help someone to gain a differentperspective, that is to develop a new way of thinking about their prob-lem. The helper focuses on identifying patterns in feelings, thoughtsand behaviour and clarifying meanings, in addition to using the skillsin Stage 1. The person helped in this way feels safe enough to considerchange as possible and benecial. The third stage is concerned withdeveloping strategies to achieve goals and includes making decisionsand plans for taking action. During this stage the helper focuses onskills of problem solving and action planning. Stage 1 - Listening to the patient's story Although the dietitian may feel impatient and anxious to give informa- tion and advice, allowing patients time in which to tell their story isimportant in fullling their needs. Some patients have a greater need to talk than others and telling the story can in itself bring relief asthose who know they have been fully heard are more able to clarifyWorking Together 43CSFC04 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 43their problem (Egan 2004). Attending, listening and demonstrating empathy help patients tell their story and these skills are examined indetail in Chapter 5. The skilled dietitian who, on listening to her patient, recognises the issue that is the basis of the problem, can demonstrate her empathy by reflecting this to her patient, as shown in the following example. Patient : I have to get up early to get to work on time; there's no time for breakfast. I'm lucky if I can grab a bun when I have a coffee break. Ifnot, by lunch time I'm really hungry and sometimes there's so much to do I only have time to have a coffee at my desk.Dietitian : The problem is, how are you going to manage to have some- thing to eat regularly with your present work schedule.Patient : Y e s...I just can't see how I can do i t... not every day. Although each patient has their unique individual story, patients' problems are likely to be one or more of the following: How to live with their disability, e.g. diabetes? How to manage this in their work? How to live more independently? How to become more assertive? How to live with or get out of a relationship? How to feel more fullled? How to feel better about themselves? Egan explains that part of the helper's task at this stage is to confront assumptions. The skill in making effective confrontations is covered in Chapter 7. In the example above the patient is saying that they 'can'tsee how to do it'. One way in which the dietitian can confront this is to paraphrase as follows: Patient : Y e s...I just can't see how I can do i t... not every day. Dietitian : There will be days when you can and days when you will nd it difcult.Patient : Y e s... that's how it is at the moment. As the dietitian listens to the patient's story she may pick up clues about the patient's attitude towards modifying their diet. Althoughthe patient in this example seems unable to resolve the problem ofmanaging the diet at work, she does add 'at the moment' indicatingshe is not entirely closed to the idea of nding a way. Stage 2 - Clarifying what the patient wants A patient may not be able to express what it is they want to achieve. They may feel confused and ambivalent about this. One way to help44 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC04 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 44someone clarify what they want is to ask an open question (Chapter 7) which invites the patient to consider different futures. This can bedone using the phrase 'What if you were to (lose weight)?' and 'Whatif you did not make any changes (to your diet)?'. Continuing with openquestions such as 'What do you think that would be like?' or 'What do you think might happen as a result?' invites the patient to explorethe advantages and disadvantages of a particular outcome. This canhelp someone to clarify what is important to them. When someonecan open their mind to different possibilities for the future they aremore able to make choices about the actions they might take in thepresent, in other words to work in Stage 3. In the following example the dietitian invites the patient to experi- ence this more fully, using some techniques from neuro-linguistic programming (Chapter 1). Patient : I can't seem to lose weight however hard I try. It's no good . . . I'm fat and I'll always be that wa y...a hopeless case. Dietitian :(invites her to consider a different future ) What would it be like for you if you were to weigh less?Patient : (after long pause) I'm not sure what you mea n...d o y o u mean what would I look like?Dietitian :(invites her to imagine herself differently ) What would you look like? What would you be doing? How would you be feeling about yourself ?What would you be thinking about yourself?Patient : I'd have more energy, I'd feel lighter, brighte r... less of an elephant.Dietitian : Less of an elephant? What sort of animal would you be like? Patient : I think . . . it sounds silly I know . more like a giraffe . . . they're graceful and tall and slender. The imagination is an undervalued resource in creating a future without the problem (Egan 2004). Imagery, as in the form of the elephant and the giraffe in the above example, can be powerful as asymbol . In the example these images are created by the patient and represent a different future for her . Symbols suggested by the helper are less likely to be effective. Using the imagination to create a different future is different from using the more established form of goal setting based on rationalthinking and logical argument. Goal setting needs to be realistic and specic, for example a goal to attain a certain weight. Although'becoming a giraffe' is specic it is hardly realistic! Patients may set goals which seem, at least on the face of it, to be attainable to them, yet to the dietitian are clearly unrealistic. This canpresent a difculty for the dietitian who knows that it is not sounddietetic practice to encourage rapid weight loss, for example, but doesWorking Together 45CSFC04 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 45not want to dampen the patient's motivation. In the example which follows, the patient, a woman in her mid-forties, wants to lose 12 kg (2 stone) in the month before Christmas. Patient : I really want to lose weight this tim e... everyone says I'll look much better if I lose a couple of ston e... and I think I ca n... I'd like to for Christma s... it's really special this year. So what do you sa y... shall I go for it?Dietitian :(reflects on what patient has said ) You're keen to lose weight before Christmas ...( reflects on what this seems to mean to patient ) and you'd feel better about yourself if you lost weight. ( claries what patient wants her to do) You ask me what I think. ( pauses to give herself time ) I think to lose 2 stone in a month is too much to expect of yourself and not healthy to lose it so quickly. Also I think if you set yourself that goal you would becomedisappointed with yourself.Patient : You think I'm setting my sights too high? Dietitian :(calmly states what she thinks ) I think if you aim for a lower target you could successfully lose some weight before Christmas and alsofeel you have achieved what you set out to do. The patient is likely to feel relieved to hear this from the dietitian as she may have inwardly known she was being unrealistic yet thoughtshe 'ought' to put herself under this pressure. She may also be undulyinfluenced by others who have told her that she should lose this much. By using her skills of reflective responding and stating clearlyher point of view, the dietitian is demonstrating that she is taking the patient's eating behaviour seriously, which is one of the prin-ciples of good practice when working with people in eating distress(Waskett 1993). Stage 3 - Planning ways to achieve goals It is a signicant step to move from talking about a problem to taking the necessary action which brings about change. The dietitian whophrases her questions in the form of 'How do you think you could dothis?' invites the patient to consider the actions which lead towardsachieving the desired goal. The patient's commitment to change islikely to be tested at this stage. It is useful to focus on small stepswhich are achievable as this builds up the experience of success. If we recall the paradoxical nature of change (Chapter 2), we realisethere are many ways in which we can undermine our own attempts toimplement change. The dietitian can help the patient become awareof likely pitfalls by asking such questions as, 'If this were to happenhow could you best deal with it?'. Discussing ways and means of managing difcult situations is part of preparing to take action.46 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC04 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 46There may be times when the patient seems to be making no progress and despairs of achieving the goal. The dietitian can help byreviewing, encouraging and supporting. Below are some suggestionsof how she might do this. Reviewing How do you think you're managing so far? In what way have things improved since you began the diet? What do you nd satisfying about the changes you have made? What do you nd difcult? What would make it easier for you? Encouraging When you think of what you have achieved, how do you feel? Y ou have succeeded in ( name an achievement ). Y ou are ( name quality , e.g. determined, keen, motivated). Supporting Does your goal still seem right for you or would you like to change it? In what way can I support you? What would help you most at the moment? How could you get the support you want? By paying attention to each stage of the helping process the dietitian is demonstrating her desire to create a helping relationship with thepatient (Chapter 3). She will be pacing her input to match the pace of the patient. As a result the patient will experience the interview ashelpful and is more likely to feel motivated to put the desired changeinto practice. The dietitian, however, may feel anxious about theamount of time she is taking and think the interview should be pro-ceeding at a faster rate than the patient seems willing to go. Under-standing the phases of change described in the next section may helpthe dietitian to contain her frustration and increase her willingness toproceed at the patient's pace. Phases of change A model of change showing different phases (Prochaska & DiClemente1986) is outlined below and fully described by Hunt and Hilsdon (1996)in Chapter 4 of their book Changing Eating and Exercise Behaviour . This model can be a useful framework for dietitians in assessing how readyWorking Together 47CSFC04 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 47or not a patient is to change their behaviour. Dietitians who are familiar with Prochaska and DiClemente's model will recognise the following: Not interested in changing Thinking about change Preparing to change Making changes Maintaining changes Relapsing. Counselling skills can be used effectively to help a patient in the different phases. In the following example counselling skills are beingapplied in the different phases of the model. Patient : The doctor sent me to see you. He said to give you this ( hands dietitian referral slip requesting dietary advice ). Dietitian :(notices patient's use of language and suspects he has come to see her because he has been told to rather than because he wants to. She reads referral ). I understand you've been having some trouble with your heart. The doctorthinks it would be useful if we discussed your diet.Patient : He said I've got to go on a diet - something about having less fat.Dietitian :(notices the patient speaks as though he is following the doctor's orders, which reinforces her rst impression ) The doctor thinks it would help your heart if you ate less fat. What do you think? ( raising the issue by inviting him to speak for himself ) Patient : M e...( gives a small shrug of his shoulders ) I don't kno w... it's not up to me is it? You're the expert, you tell me what to do.Dietitian :(noticing the patient is giving her the responsibility for changing his behaviour, states what action she can take ) I can give you some information about how to have less fat in your diet. ( gently probing ) I am wondering though if you really want to make any changes?Patient : W e l l... now you mention i t...I like my chips and roast potatoe s... and what's a bit of meat without fat on i t... not worth hav- ing! We've always lived to a ripe old age in my family . . . always hav e... and had good wholesome foo d...I can't see the point in changing now. Dietitian :(accepts the patient is not interested in changing, and decides to give him some information to take away and to end the interview ). Although you do not want to do anything about changing your diet at the moment, I would like to give you this leaflet to take away with you. Many people who have had heart trouble like yours have been helped by following theadvice inside ( points to this in the leaflet ). You may want to read it later when you've had time to think it over ( inviting him into the next phase of the model concerned with thinking about change ). The next example shows counselling skills being applied when a patient is already thinking about change and is preparing to makechanges.48 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC04 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 48Patient : The doctor told me that what I eat could have something to do with what's wrong with me. I've been trying to work out what foodsupset m e... I've even written it dow n... here ( passes over notebook )... look. I don't know if it's any hel p... what do you think I should do? Dietitian :(notices the frown on patient's face as she sits down on the edge of the chair and leans forward; forms impression of someone anxious 'to get it right';decides to clarify what patient has said ) You think that changing your diet might help and you want to know what changes to make ( patient nods; decides to invite her to participate ). Shall we go through it together and see what changes you want to make?Patient :( face relaxes and shifts back into the chair ) Y e s...t h a t would be helpful. The patient has now indicated that she would like some information, advice and suggestions. At a follow-up appointment, however, thepatient expresses doubts about maintaining the changes discussed ather previous appointment. Patient : I've been on this diet for two months now and it doesn't seem to do me any good. I don't think there's much point in going on with it.Dietitian :(notices low, flat tone of voice and difculty in making eye contact ) You're not sure if the changes you've made have been any help.Patient : At rst it was worth i t...I felt so much better for a whil e... b u t n o w...I ' m n o t s o s u r e .Dietitian :(recognises ambivalence, senses patient feels sad and helpless, invites patient to talk about this in more detail ) You've not been feeling so well lately?Patient :( eyes ll with tears, looks down at the floor ) N o...I ' v e had a bad wee k... everything's gone wrong. Dietitian :(realises patient may want to talk, yet aware of their limited time together ) You seem upse t... would you like to talk about it? We've got ve minutes and we can arrange to talk about your diet some other time ifyou want to ( giving patient the option to talk about what is troubling her or to talk about her diet ). Patient : I've not told anyone ye t... perhaps it would help to tell you. The dietitian recognises that the most helpful action she can take is to listen. She realises that what her patient is about to say is clearlysignicant to the difculty she is having in maintaining her diet. Shedecides this is an appropriate point to talk about condentiality as inthe example given earlier in the chapter. Helping with ambivalence In the example above, the dietitian recognises the ambivalence expressedby the patient when she says 'At rst it was worth it. I felt so much Working Together 49CSFC04 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 49better for a whil e...b u t n o w... I'm not so sure'. Such doubts may arise at any time during the process of changing one's behaviour. As in the example the dietitian who is listening closely will realise that herpatient is struggling and may have lost sight of their purpose. Thedietitian who is tracking the helping process will recognise that shenow needs to focus on the tasks and skills of Stage 2 of the helpingprocess described earlier in the chapter. In other words she will helpher patient to clarify what they want using the skills of active listening,reflective responding and skilful questioning (Chapters 5-7). Thedietitian who is familiar with 'Motivational Interviewing' will focus on giving feedback and advice and on providing a menu of options for change. Her style will be empathic and her attitude will be one ofencouraging the patient to be responsible for the changes to their diet.These are key elements in Motivational Interviewing which is basedon the assumption that ambivalence underlies someone's inability tochange and once this has been resolved by the patient there may ormay not be a need for further intervention (Rollnick & Miller 1995).Once ambivalence is resolved a patient will be able to move forward to another phase in the process of change. The guiding philosophy of Motivational Interviewing is based on client-centred counselling.However, the interpersonal style is directive and it seems that in theabsence of a clear denition and with the focus on implementing techniques, Motivational Interviewing has been used in prescriptiveand manipulative ways that do not accurately reflect the concept andapproach (Rollnick & Miller 1995). In accordance with accepted coun-selling practice, the practitioner who uses Motivational Interviewingwill be: seeking to understand another's frame of reference through activelistening (Chapter 5); able to express acceptance and afrmation; eliciting and acknowledging the patient's own beliefs, thoughts andfeelings about change; monitoring the patient's readiness to change and working withthem at their pace. If the strategies of Motivational Interviewing are used in persuasive and manipulative ways the dietitian is likely to encounter denial by the patient. As described in Chapter 2 the very nature of change isparadoxical and personal to the person making the change. Thus thedietitian cannot make the dietary alterations or lifestyle changes forthe patient nor can she control the pace at which the patient deals withtheir ambivalence. However, she can help the patient become moreaware of their thoughts, beliefs, feelings and behaviour associated with50 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC04 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 50any change. If the patient and the dietitian are willing to engage in this process and the dietitian is also competent and capable of doing so,the outcome can be rewarding for both. In order to engage effectivelythe dietitian needs to be able to respect the patient and understandboth the helping process and the different phases of the process ofchange. When the dietitian can sensitively apply her skills of active listening and reflective responding (Chapters 5 and 6), thereby demon-strating the 'core conditions' (Chapter 3), she may nd patients willingto explore their ambivalence about changing their behaviour. Whenusing these skills the dietitian needs to bear in mind that she is invitinga personal revelation on the part of the patient which may arouse emotional pain. An example of this occurring has been illustrated inthe previous dialogue. It may also become apparent that the patient'seating behaviour is their way of coping with a deeper problem. Whenthis is the case the dietitian may decide that any further work with thepatient is outside her professional role. She will then need to considerother means of help for the patient. When, how and where to refer When using counselling skills the dietitian is providing in-depth sup-port and the patient may respond by sharing problems that are outsidethe role of the dietitian. The nature of the problem may mean that the help needed by the patient calls for skills and competence that thedietitian does not possess. The problems caused by working beyondour limits are recognised by Sanders (2002) who states that 'in workingbeyond our limits we are not helping, and are probably doing damage,to the person we are trying to help as well as causing ourselves unduestress'. Exercise 4.4 will help you to dene those limits.Working Together 51 Exercise 4.4 The following questions are designed to help you recognise and acknow- ledge your limits. Ask yourself: Do I have sufcient time to give to this patient? Do I have the information this patient requires? How condent do I feel in my ability to use counselling skills? What sort of problems would affect me emotionally and hinder mein my attempts to give a patient my full attention? Would this patient benet from help given by someone with moreknowledge and experience in this area?CSFC04 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 51Dietitians who are members of a department and part of a medical team have these resources to draw on. When discussing referral withcolleagues and with patients, respect for the patient is paramount.The following guidelines, which include some taken from First Steps in Counselling (Sanders 2002), may be helpful: Invite the patient to decide what is best for themselves. Pass the patient on as though they were a precious gift not an awkward bundle. Focus on offering the referral to the patient not ordering. Make sure the patient understands that the referral is not a rejec- tion of them but an honest attempt to help them meet their ownneeds. Make sure the patient knows that they will be welcome to seek helpfrom the dietitian in the future. Make it as easy as possible for the patient to take action, e.g. giveverbal and written information and directions clearly and concisely. It is useful to have current information to hand when offering a patient information about where to go for further help. When thinkingabout whether a referral is appropriate or not, the counsellor or user of counselling skills will have the question, 'What do I really knowabout what is available locally' (Williams 1993). Compiling a local listof resources provides dietitians with contacts and information whichmay be useful at some stage. A list of national resources, many ofwhom have local branches, is given in Appendix 2. How to end The end of a relationship with a patient is as important as the begin-ning. When a patient is seen for a one-off consultation the ending process takes place in the same session as the beginning process and,of necessity, both will be brief. When the dietitian and patient havemet several times the last meeting is clearly a time to attend to the end-ing of their work together. Many of us have had painful experiences ofendings which feel like a severance or a death. The thought of anotherending can arouse anxiety for many people, particularly when a patientor dietitian have formed a strong attachment. This may be the case if the patient's illness has been life-threatening or if their relationshiphas become established over a long period of time. People deal with endings in various ways. Some avoid the last meet- ing by not turning up or cancelling the appointment, often at the lastminute. Others may not want to leave and procrastinate by introducing52 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC04 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 52other topics or asking further questions. Most dietitians will be familiar with the situation where the patient asks a signicant question as theappointment is drawing to a close. Some patients announce a changeor give an important piece of information as they are going out of the door. When this happens the dietitian may feel surprised initially and then frustrated. However, the patient may have been biding theirtime and 'testing the waters', only feeling safe enough to risk makingthe remark on leaving. By acknowledging apparently 'throwaway'remarks rather than letting them go without comment, the dietitiandemonstrates she has heard. Rather than extending the appointmentand getting behind with subsequent ones, the dietitian could offer thepatient another appointment, thereby giving the patient an opportunityto raise the subject again if they wish. This demonstrates respect forthe patient while maintaining a clear working arrangement for bothdietitian and patient. A planned ending provides an opportunity for the patient and the dietitian to part with a sense that their work together is complete.When the sense of completion is absent both people can be left withfeelings of dissatisfaction. The following points are worth consideringwhen planning a nal session with a patient: Allow time to review as previously described. Invite questions, e.g. 'is there anything else you would like to askme?'. Give information about further support as appropriate, e.g. thetelephone number of the dietetic department. Share with the patient your observations on their progress in thetime you have known them. Share your experience of working with them, e.g.: 'I have enjoyed working with you.' 'We have sorted out some problems together.''We don't seem to have made much headway.''I don't think either of us found it easy yet we seem to have sortedout a few things.' Support for the dietitian When saying goodbye to a patient a dietitian may feel: relief that she is no longer working with this person; sadness that the relationship has come to an end; pleasure that the patient is able to manage without help;Working Together 53CSFC04 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 53satisfaction that she has done a good job; anxiety about how the patient will cope; concern that she could have done more; frustration about the unsatisfactory way things turned out; annoyed with herself and guilty that she made mistakes. A particular relationship may bring to the surface a variety of issues for the dietitian to deal with. Having personal support and someonewith whom to talk these through in a safe environment is important if a helper is to provide quality help for others. For this reason coun-sellors are required by the ethical framework of their professional body,the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, to be inregular and ongoing counselling supervision, which is independent of any managerial relationship. This framework is also applicable tousers of counselling skills (British Association for Counselling andPsychotherapy 2002). Supervision is about taking an overview, in the presence of someone with experience, 'at what you and your patient have said and done and is a central task so that you are better informed and empowered to practise' (Houston 1995). The relationship between supervisorand the person supervised, where both have a high commitment tounderstanding and learning, is a key issue in fullling this aim (Shohet & Wilmot 1991). Dietitians who use counselling skills are advised toconsider how they can get similar support for themselves. This chapter highlights the way in which the dietitian can create a working environment in which counselling skills can be effectivelyused. The issues raised are further explored and applied in the patient interview in Part 3 of this book. Firstly though it is necessaryto examine and develop the counselling skills of active listening andreflective responding. References Bond, T. (2000) Standards and Ethics for Counselling in Action .

I focus on the skill of attending to verbal and non-verbal com-munication, which form the foundation of active listening discussedin Chapter 5. In Chapter 6, I explore different types of verbal responseand the effect each has on the listener, and introduce the reader to the skill of reflective responding. By using the skills of active listeningand reflective responding the dietitian is able to take in information,demonstrate empathy and build a helping relationship. These skillsalso provide the means to confront another in a non-threatening way,as shown in Chapter 7. This chapter introduces the reader to otherhelpful interventions and demonstrates how skilful questioning can beused effectively in a helping relationship. In Part 2, I show how a dietitian can train herself effectively by: observing non-verbal communication and noticing discrepanciesand incongruities; being aware of the many factors which can interfere with listening; becoming more comfortable with silence and emotional distress; increasing her understanding of the profound effect that words andthe way they are used can have upon another; using reflective listening skills to demonstrate to a patient that theyhave been heard and understood, and to help a patient clarify whatthey have said; reducing the doubts and anxieties associated with confrontation byskilful use of reflective responding and questioning and in so doinghelp someone change.CSFC05 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 57Chapter 5 Active Listening 'It is the province of knowledge to speak and the privilege of wisdom to listen.' Oliver Wendell Holmes In this chapter I discuss: The process of listening Attending - a way of demonstrating acceptance Barriers to attending Attending to non-verbalcommunicationDiscrepancies andincongruities Developing powers ofobservation Managing silences Mirroring Touching The process of listening It is often said that communication is a two way process - of speaking and of listening. Although knowing what to say and expressing thisclearly is obviously important when giving dietary information, beingable to listen to the patient is fundamental to the development of ahelping relationship. Listening is often thought of as a passive process - an opportunity to sit back and relax while the other person does the work of com-municating what they want to say. As a passive listener we may ndourselves thinking of other things and switching in and out of hear-ing what is being said. We may feel bored or guilty that we are not taking in what the speaker is saying and vow to ourselves that nexttime we will concentrate harder. We may feel irritated that the otherperson is not saying more clearly what they mean, that they are beingCSFC05 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 59long-winded and uninteresting. For their part the speaker who does not experience being listened to feels undervalued and negated. Active listening on the other hand is a dynamic process which involves the skill of attending , i.e. giving someone our wholehearted attention. When attending, the listener nds it easier to concentrate and com-prehend and is less likely to experience boredom. The ability to attendor 'be there' for someone is a basic counselling skill which offers in-depthsupport. As a result the other person feels afrmed in who they are,and becomes more open and more able to listen attentively in return.In this way, greater understanding develops and the relationship becomesmore co-operative. This chapter focuses on attending and examineshow the dietitian can develop her skills of a ttending. Chapter 6 focuses on ways of responding which demonstra te that she has listened. Attending - a way of demonstrating acceptance When attending, the listener is demonstrating the core condition of acceptance, as described in Chapter 3. The extent to which she can do this for a particular person depends upon her ability to accept thatthe other person has a right to express their point of view and that thismay or may not coincide with her own. A listener who conveys acceptance is someone who is safe to talk to Conveying acceptance is related to our ability to accept ourselves. The more accepting we are of ourselves the more able we are to be open60 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 5.1 Think of a time when you felt safe to talk to someone. Recall what the listener did. Make a note of what you remember. Exercise 5.2You may like to practise by talking to someone you feel safe with using the topics here. Note those that you feel uncomfortable talking about. Something I feel strongly about Why I chose my profession My strengths and qualities My hopes for the future My fears for the future My thoughts on deathCSFC05 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 60with ourselves and others (Chapter 3). When we are more accepting of ourselves we become less concerned with what others may think ofus and more able to pay attention to what they say. Counsellors in training focus on becoming more open and comfort- able with themselves so that they are more able to understand andaccept those they are helping. Some aspects of this process of personaldevelopment are explored in Part 4. Attending is giving someone our attention as fully as we can When attending we focus on the other person by observing their verbal and non-verbal communication and forming an impression oftheir attitudes and feelings. Attending also involves being aware of our own non-verbal communication which reflects our thoughts, feelings and attitudes. The more prejudiced we are, the more fearfulor angry about something or someone, the more this will leak out inour non-verbal communication despite efforts to mask it. The moregenuinely relaxed and at ease we are the more able we are to respondhelpfully. The following acronym (adapted from Egan (2004)) acts as a checklist to guide the dietitian in non-verbal communication whenattending to another: Sfacing the other person as squarely as is comfortable Oadopting an openposture Lleaning a little towards the other person Emaintaining eye contact without staring Rkeeping as relaxed as possible. Barriers to attending Many factors can interfere with our attempts to attend fully. Exer- cise 5.3 is designed to increase awareness of some of these. Lack of eye contact is one way in which we indicate that we are not listen-ing and this has a profound effect on the person who is talking. Whenpatients do not have eye contact with the dietitian they are likely tostop after a short while or may persist using a variety of means toattract the dietitian's attention. A barrier develops between patientand dietitian as the patient realises that they are not being listened to.This may occur when the dietitian is unable to maintain eye contactwhile simultaneously listening and writing down details of the diethistory.Active Listening 61CSFC05 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 61Other factors which create a barrier between listener and speaker can be categorised under three headings: environment events and emotions echoes within. Environment Environmental factors, such as time constraints, temperature, humidity, noise, the room we are in and the seating available can all play a part infacilitating or hindering giving another person our full attention. Events and emotions Events can set in motion a train of thoughts and give rise to a variety of emotions. For example, the dietitian may feel pity, compassion,sadness, irritation, possibly anger, probably fear, maybe even horrorwhen a patient talks about their illness. An emotional response mayalso be triggered if the dietitian notices something unexpected, suchas a facial disgurement or a limb missing. As a result her attentionbecomes focused on her own thoughts and feelings and she is unableto attend fully to what the patient is saying. Patients may explaindetails of relationships and activities that are outside the dietitian'sexperience. The dietitian may have strong opinions on the rights andwrongs of these and her beliefs and prejudices can become a barrier to listening. The extent to which her emotional response becomes abarrier to listening depends upon the intensity of her emotion. Events may happen to the dietitian resulting in her being unable to give a patient her full attention. For example, if the dietitian witnessed62 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 5.3 With a colleague or friend, take it in turns to talk about an incident in your day, for example your journey to work. As a listener indicate in as many ways as possible that you are notlistening. Take about three minutes each. (You may nd it difcult to keep it up for this long.)Share with each other what you did, how you felt and what you werethinking, both when you were the listener and the speaker. Now take it in turns to talk about something else, for example your plans for tomorrow. As the listener be as attentive as you can. Allowthree minutes each and afterwards share again your thoughts, feelingsand actions, both as the speaker and the listener.CSFC05 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 62an accident on the way to work and has not been able to talk about it to anyone, her shock and upset is likely to occupy her attention and limit her ability to give her attention to her patient. Similarly, anunresolved problem or conflict with someone else can gnaw away atthe back of the dietitian's mind and the resultant anxiety can preventher being fully present for her patient. Echoes within Echoes within are the thoughts we may have when we are listening to someone else. Although we may or may not be aware of them, theyprecede and colour our verbal response and influence our non-verbalcommunication. These internal echoes are often in the form of criticism,either of ourselves or of the other person. The following are someexamples of thoughts which may be familiar: 'Surely that's not true.' 'They don't stand a chance of losing weight.' 'They're wasting my time.' 'It's useless giving them this advice.' 'That's a stupid thing to say.' 'Of course the trouble with this patient i s... ' 'What advice can I give now - they've tried everything - it's hopeless.' In becoming more aware of these echoes and what they mean to her, the dietitian can begin to recognise and understand the ways inwhich they influence her communication with others. Attending to non-verbal communication The voice We speak with various accents and dialects and at different speeds. Voices are capable of a wide range, volume, pitch and tone. We expressActive Listening 63 Exercise 5.4 Take a piece of paper and a pencil. Sit quietly with arms and legs un- crossed. Close your eyes. Be aware of your breathing. Now focus on thesounds around you. Be aware again of your breathing. Now focus yourattention inwards. As you become aware of a thought write it down.Your thoughts may well be judgements (criticisms or agreements) aboutwhat you have just read.CSFC05 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 63emotional states through our voice. When hearing someone's voice we make assumptions about them which may or may not be accurate(Exercise 5.5). For example, if someone is talking unnecessarily loudly,we may assume they are angry. However, on the one hand they maythink the person they are talking to is hard of hearing. On the otherhand they may be hard of hearing themselves and not realise the volume they are using. They may intend someone nearby to overhearor they may be in the habit of raising their voice and are unaware whenthis is unnecessary. If someone is speaking too quietly it is easy toassume they are shy and lacking in condence. Whatever the reason,the speaker's voice affects the listener who may feel irritated, anxiousor sympathetic. Eye contact Eye contact is used to send and receive information, show attention and interest. We use it to synchronise when to speak and when to listen. Eye contact also reveals attitudes. When we look into some-one's eyes we may detect warmth or fear. In the former the pupils are dilated, in the latter the pupils contract. We spend 25-75% of thetime looking at one another and look nearly twice as much while weare listening as talking. Eye contact can be unpleasant when strongemotions are aroused, if the topic is difcult or intimate or if there are other things to look at especially when these are relevant to theconversation such as a leaflet or diet sheet. Facial expressions The seven main facial expressions are happiness, surprise, fear, sadness, anger, disgust and interest. We are fairly aware of our facial64 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 5.5 Focus your attention on someone's voice. How would you describe the volume, tone and pitch? Notice the speed of delivery, intonation, dialectand accent. What picture have you built up of this person? Exercise 5.6 Experiment with using more eye contact, then using less eye contact. Notice your reaction and that of the people you are talking to.CSFC05 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 64expressions and can control them, although we may communicate the emotion through another part of our body. Smiling expresses happi-ness. It can also be used to ridicule, reassure or cover uncomfortableemotions. A genuine smile conveys warmth and openness. Appearance Appearance can convey social status, attractiveness and occupation. It expresses something about our attitude to ourselves and our environ-ment. Many facets of appearance vary with changing fashions. Clothes,hair, skin and physique all communicate something about us. We 'carry'clothes differently depending on our attitude or the way we feel. Theycan show rebelliousness or conformity. Posture Posture indicates how tense or relaxed we are. Standing or sitting in a relaxed and upright position when listening indicates condence. Thisin turn instils condence in the speaker that they are being listened to.When listening we show interest by leaning slightly towards someone.By adopting a more open and relaxed posture we invite interactionand encourage others to be more open and accepting. Gestures Gestures and body movements have been dened by Desmond Morris (2002) as any action which sends a visual signal to an onlooker.Gestures add meaning by displaying, pointing and illustrating. We use them to show agreement or disagreement, to describe, explain orquestion something, and to represent ideas and express feelings.Active Listening 65 Exercise 5.7 Be aware of facial expressions. Do you think they are genuine or assumed because they are what seems most appropriate to the situation? Exercise 5.8 Notice how posture changes in different situations and with different people.CSFC05 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 65Discrepancies and incongruities It is important to place observations in context. A single gesture, for example clenching a st, may not be of much signicance on its own,but together with a reddening of the face, a pursing of the lips, a tight-ening of the facial muscles and a tensing of the shoulders, indicatessomeone who is experiencing a strong emotion. When words reinforcethis non-verbal communication, for example, 'I wanted to throw the plateat him', we are left in little doubt that the patient felt angry. However, ifthe non-verbal communication indicates one emotion (e.g. the patientsmiles) and the verbal communication another (e.g. anger as whensaying 'I wanted to throw the plate at him'), the listener is likely to feelconfused. We are more likely to believe the non-verbal message thanthe verbal. In the above example the skilled listener would probablyconclude that the speaker was angry yet was not acknowledging this. Incongruities also occur between a communication and the context in which it occurs. For example, a patient who has just received badnews may say 'I'm OK' with a xed smile on their face when askedhow they are feeling, leaving the dietitian unsure how to respond.Observing discrepancies and incongruities is fundamental when usingcounselling skills. Developing powers of observation We inform one another about our attitudes and emotions and presentourselves to the world through our non-verbal communication, whichmay support or conflict with any verbal communication. When thereis a discrepancy we tend to believe the non-verbal rather than thewords which are said. Attending therefore means listening with eyesas well as ears. Observations are made from what we see or hear, as forexample 'I notice you are smiling' or 'I hear you say you are pleasedthat you have lost weight.' Helpful responding requires skilful use ofobservations (Chapter 6). When using counselling skills it is important to distinguish between observation and interpretation . Observations are what we see or hear; interpretations are what we think and are based on assumptions and66 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 5.9 When next listening to someone, notice what gestures they use and what these indicate to you.CSFC05 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 66conclusions which may or may not be accurate. Interpretations form the basis of any judgements we make; for example, the dietitian maynotice a patient is smiling (observation), think that this person is nottaking her advice seriously (assumption), decide that the patient doesnot care about the diet (conclusion) and say, 'Y ou haven't lost muchweight have you?' (judgement implying the patient should have donebetter). Noticing when she moves from observation into interpretationis useful to the dietitian when deciding how to respond (Chapter 6). Managing silences People stop talking when they are unsure how to proceed, when theyare struck by a thought that they have not yet articulated, or when they are experiencing a feeling which they are unsure of expressing.They may be assessing how safe they feel to express themselves. As thelistener, the dietitian may feel uncomfortable if a silence lasts morethan a few seconds and may either withdraw into herself or feel com-pelled to say something. As she searches for something to say she islikely to feel more anxious. She may think she should say something,that it is her responsibility to take charge of the situation. She may feel things are slipping out of control or think that she should keep theconversation going. She may want to protect the speaker from dis-comfort. One way in which she may cope with her anxiety is to comein quickly with a series of questions, so breaking the silence. When the dietitian responds prematurely she crowds the patient and intrudes into their psychological space. This may produce temporaryActive Listening 67 Exercise 5.10 With a friend or colleague, practise sitting with each other in silence maintaining eye contact as you observe the non-verbal communication.Notice how long you can do this and feel comfortable. You could use an alarm to time this or invite a third person to do the exercise with you,taking it in turns to keep time for the other two. Be aware of what you are feeling and thinking as you do this. Share your experience of thisexercise with each other. If you found it difcult and felt uncomfortabletell your colleague this. You may want to do this exercise on your own. Have a paper and pencil at hand. Sit or stand in front of a mirror. Maintain eye contactwith yourself. What do you notice? What are you feeling? What thoughtsare you aware of? A useful way to debrief is to write down your experi-ence of the exercise afterwards.CSFC05 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 67relief from discomfort for the dietitian, but the patient may feel upset at not being given enough time. Either way it is a missed opportunityfor the dietitian to listen fully. Attending involves listening to thesilences, being aware of our feelings as well as observing the other person. In attending, the dietitian may form a hunch as to how apatient may be feeling. Being at ease with silence comes with practice. The more at ease she feels with silence the safer the dietitian will be perceived as a listener.When she allows the silence to take its course she gives the patient thechoice of whether to speak. Mirroring Mirroring the other person's non-verbal communication develops thelistener's understanding, demonstrates empathy and creates rapport.Mirroring is not the same as mimicking. Mirroring is based on arespectful desire to understand the other person, whereas mimickingis making fun of another. We can mirror posture, gestures, facial expressions, and voice volume, tone and pitch. Mirroring is something we do naturally when we aregetting on well with someone. We experience a warm feeling of rapportand feel understood. The times when we suddenly became aware thatwe are walking in step with someone or standing in the same positionare spontaneous examples of mirroring. Practitioners of neuro-linguistic programming develop the skill of mirroring to a ne art whereby they mirror breathing, eye movementsand many ner points of non-verbal communication. Mirroring takespractice and at rst may seem crude and obvious. By mirroring someone's breathing we can get an idea of how they are feeling. When someone is anxious or fearful their breathing becomesmore shallow, quite rapid and high in their chest. The more relaxedsomeone is, the slower and deeper the breathing.68 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 5.11 Practise mirroring as you listen to a patient talking. Notice their posture and discreetly adopt a similar one. As you focus on their gestures beginto mirror these by doing the same simultaneously. Keep your eyes ontheir face as you do so and maintain eye contact when you can. As theyare speaking, their eyes will move in many directions. Your eyes need tobe available to them when they seek you.CSFC05 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 68Touching Touching is a powerful way of responding non-verbally to indicate caring, encourage trust and promote liking. We touch someone toguide them or attract their attention; for example, when we take some-one by the arm to help them up or down stairs. There are strict socialrules about touching. Infringing some rules clearly amounts to abuse.Other rules are unwritten and may be culturally specic. There are codes of etiquette which if not adhered to can be inter- preted as ignorance. The handshake is an example. The way in whichwe shake hands can tell us a great deal. If rm it inspires condence; if limp and moist it indicates doubt and nervousness. Most peopleappreciate physical contact and nd it reassuring. A hand on theshoulder, taking someone's hand in yours or putting your arm aroundsomeone's shoulder can say more clearly than any words that you arethere for support in their distress. Some may nd any form of touchthreatening. It is important therefore to be aware of individual reac-tions to physical contact and to check before taking action if you areunsure how touch will be received. In this chapter, the importance of attending has been emphasised. The following chapter focuses on responding verbally and how thismay help or hinder the development of a helping relationship.

Thoreau In this chapter I discuss: The effects of responding Types of response The purpose behind a response The power of languageReflective responding Mirroring language When and when not to reflect Self-disclosure The effects of responding There are times when we respond without fully understanding what has been said, hoping that our reply is appropriate. For example, patientsmay say 'yes' and nod in agreement as though they have understoodwhen in fact they have not. The dietitian may not realise that thepatient's subsequent lack of compliance is due to lack of comprehen-sion. Instead, she may decide the patient is not motivated and so herresponses will reflect her desire to motivate. Her attempts to do thiswill then be at cross-purposes with the patient's need for a clearerexplanation. Thus, the way in which the dietitian responds affects herrelationship with her patient and the outcome of an interview. The effect of a response may be to arouse feelings of inadequacy and inferiority. When someone feels diminished they become defensive.As a result they may become over anxious to please or increasinglyresentful and unco-operative. Patients are more likely to co-operatewith the dietitian when she responds in ways which demonstrate hersupport. They are less likely to do so when she responds in ways whichreinforce their sense of inadequacy.CSFC06 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 70Helpful responses facilitate the development of a therapeutic rela- tionship and are concerned with empowering the other person. Thischapter examines the different types of response and their effects onthe dietitian's relationship with her patients. T ypes of response Some responses carry a higher risk than others of diminishing theother person. High-risk responses may hinder further communicationand damage a relationship; low-risk responses are less likely to havethis effect. Each type of response in Table 6.1 carries some risk. Inaddition to the words spoken there is the non-verbal communicationassociated with the response (see Exercise 6.1).Responding 71 Table 6.1 Examples of different types of response. Type of response Example Encouraging 'Right', 'mmm' 'uhuh' Asking questions 'What do you eat normally?'Making statements 'Eating too much is unhealthy'Giving instructions 'Have three a suggestions 'You could you'Moralising 'You really should lose weight'Threatening 'If you don't lose weight you'll need an operation'Informing 'Poor diet is linked to heart disease'Diverting from subject 'Do you like your job?'Diverting onto own concerns 'I've been off sick myself'Faking attention 'mm ...I s e e...m m ' Exercise 6.1 Say each response in Table 6.1 in various ways by altering your tone and volume of voice. Imagine yourself as the receiver. How would youfeel if someone responded to you in this way? Categorise the responsesinto high, medium, low risk of creating a barrier between speaker andreceiver.CSFC06 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 71Low-risk responses Encouragers are ways in which the listener can indicate interest and willingness to listen. As a result the speaker feels encouraged to talkfurther. Some examples are: The head nod. 'Um-hm m... ' 'Y es.' 'Tell me more.' ' A n d... ' 'Really?' 'And the n... ' Overuse of encouragers can be a hindrance and an irritation to the speaker. We may not be aware of the frequency with which we use this form of response. It can become a habit or an unconscious way of expressing our impatience. Opening statements invite the other person to talk. Some examples are: 'Would you like to talk more about it?' 'I'd like to hear what you have to say.' 'There seems to be something bothering you.' Moderate-risk responses Asking questions Making statements Non-specic praising. Much depends on the frequency with which questions are asked and the manner in which they are delivered, as well as the purposebehind them (Chapter 7). All questions are confrontational to someextent and so carry some risk of creating a barrier. Comments orstatements are ways of expressing personal opinion, for example, 'Ithink that . . .' or 'In my opinion . . .' or 'I've read that . . .'. When notprefaced by 'I' the response carries a greater risk of being perceived as opinionated or patronising. Although praise is designed to be encouraging, it can be perceived as patronising when it is non-specic. For example 'Good', 'Welldone', 'Haven't you done well' offer non-specic praise. The risk ofbeing perceived as patronising can be minimised by expressing praisespecically, for example, 'Y ou are eating a healthier diet now you areeating more fresh fruit and vegetables'.72 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC06 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 72High-risk responses High-risk responses are commonly used by those wanting to help others. The responses are authoritative in nature rather than facilitative andestablish a relationship which encourages the patient to look up to thedietitian for evaluation rather than the dietitian supporting the patientto discover their own solution. High-risk responses include: Reassuring Giving instructions Giving advice Giving solutions Making suggestions Informing Persuading. When the patient asks for information, suggestions, instructions or advice, responses in this category are effective. However, when suchresponses are unrequested the patient may perceive the dietitian as superior, may feel resentful and unwilling to co-operate, and mayhave thoughts such as 'Who does she (the dietitian) think she is'.Dietitians need to give information. However, an assumption may bemade that the patient knows nothing about the subject. The dietitianthen proceeds to give what she considers necessary information. Thisoften results in her giving long explanations in her efforts to cover allthe points. This increases the risk of the patient not listening, as muchof the explanation seems irrelevant. The dietitian who makes a pointof nding out rst what information the patient wants can save herselfand the patient a lot of time. We often use persuasion when other methods, such as making a suggestion or giving an instruction, have failed to get us the outcomewe want. If asked to explain why we are doing this we often say 'It's fortheir own good'. However, this means of communication has a highrisk of creating a barrier between those concerned. The person whoreceives the communication may seem acquiescent at rst but morethan likely will feel confused and annoyed, if not immediately, thenlater. Many examples of this sort of interaction occur between parentsand children, for example when a mother anxious to get a child tonish a meal, says 'Y ou want to watch TV and your programme startsin ve minutes so you'd better get a move on'. The child begins to eatthen slows down. The mother then says 'Come on now - just nish it then you can watch TV'. In an interview with a patient a similarinteraction occurs as follows:Responding 73CSFC06 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 73Dietitian :(anxious to motivate the patient ) If you want to lose weight before the wedding we need to start you on your diet straightaway.Patient : Yes it's only six months away now. I'll try really hard this time. The only problem is I'm going on holiday next week so I won't beable to start until I get back. As in the earlier example of the mother and child, the dietitian is then likely to resort to further manipulation which may take the form of athreat. Dietitian : You have lost a little weight which is really good but if you aren't strict with yourself from now on you won't reach your target beforethe wedding. Some use persuasion as a way of trying to motivate someone. How- ever, rather than motivated and encouraged, the other person is morelikely to feel controlled and resentful. Persuasion is a manipulativetactic frequently expressed in the form of a threat, for example 'If youdon't . . . then. . .'. Although patients may very much desire the goalthey have set themselves, the fear and annoyance engendered by themanipulative communication may outweigh their desire and theirmotivation will not be sustained. V ery-high-risk responses Challenging Criticising Moralising Confronting Disagreeing Threatening. Reactions to these responses are likely to be defensive. Although at the time the recipient may agree with the response, they may later feel upset. Their hurt and anger is likely to leak out in disguised ways,for example they may not keep future appointments, they may turn uplate, they may blame the treatment and they may criticise the dietitianto others. The following responses also carry a very high risk of creating a barrier in communication as they give a message which says 'I don'twant to listen to you': Diverting to another subject Diverting to own concerns Faking attention.74 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC06 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 74Any response carries a risk of creating a barrier between people. When communication breaks down or becomes difcult it is valuableto reflect upon the type of responses made and work out other ways of responding which carry less risk. The purpose behind a response The purpose behind a response may be complex and varied. Table 6.2gives some examples. We may not be aware of our underlying purposeor intention although this will be conveyed in the way we express ourselves (Exercise 6.2). Being more aware of her purpose helps the dietitian to become clearer in her communication and her responses are likely to be moreopen and direct. As a result the patient is less likely to feel confusedand manipulated. The power of language The words we use can have as great an effect as the type of response.They can serve to form clear communication, or create misunder-standing and confusion. Effective use of language can help build a co-operative, rewarding relationship and ill-considered words canResponding 75 Table 6.2 Examples of different purposes behind a response. Response Purpose 'How do you do' Establish friendship 'I'm the senior dietitian' Establish status'Yes . . if that's all right with you' Gain approval'Sugar is a source of carbohydrate' Give information'Why did you do that?' Curiosity'I'm not sure I'm available then' Be non-committal'You can never rely on them to . . .' Blame someone'What will you gain from eating more healthily?'

Many people are aware of the misunderstand- ings which can result from the use of jargon and this topic is coveredmore fully in Chapter 8. This section examines the use of simple pro-nouns such as 'we' and 'you' and the ways in which words can indicatefailure and negativity or can create change and self-condence. 'We' and 'you' are frequently used to convey membership of a group or to speak on another's behalf. A dietitian could understandably feelconfused when a patient, asked how frequently they eat a particularfood, replies, 'We always have a large one once a week'. Who is 'we'?How many are included in 'we'? How is this divided? The more vaguethe reply, the more the dietitian will want to clarify what the patient hassaid. The use of 'we' and 'I' by the dietitian and the effect of this on the patient are examined in Chapter 8. We develop patterns of speech which can convey an attitude of success or failure (Stewart & Joines 1987). Both dietitian and patientmay talk about achieving a successful outcome using the language offailure, for example 'can't', 'shouldn't', 'have to', 'need', 'try'. A rststep in changing such a speech pattern is to become more aware of the words used currently and their implications. For instance 'can't'implies 'being unable to', 'shouldn't/should/have to/must/ought' allimply a lack of choice and a handing over of power to another. Recog-nising and replacing these words with ones which convey ability, possibility and choice are an important part of developing a sense of resourcefulness and empowerment. The following example showshow a dietitian could do this: Patient :I should go on a diet. I needto lose weight. Dietitian : You could change your diet and be the weight you want to. The way we use language can indicate lack of condence. T ag questions , which are statements with questions added at the end, are an example. 'Y ou know how much I want to lose weight, don't you?' is atag question which indirectly invites the listener to agree or reassure(Morgan 1996). Dietitians may nd it useful to reflect on their ownuse of tag questions and how these can communicate their lack of selfcondence. Instructions can be phrased in the negative by using 'don't' or in the positive by stating the desired behaviour. Although our intentionin using 'don't' may be to reinforce the seriousness of the message, the use of the negative injunction focuses the attention of the listener,making it difcult to pay attention to anything else. When told 'Don'tthink of pink elephants' most people immediately conjure up an imageof a pink elephant. People seem to respond more co-operatively whenmessages are phrased as a positive instruction (Morgan 1996). It islikely that patients who are told 'Learn how to make small changes 76 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC06 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 76in your diet' will heed the instruction more than those who are told 'Don't lose weight too quickly'. Dietitians can therefore foster a climate which encourages change by paying close attention to the language used by both the patient andthemselves. As the dietitian becomes more aware of the effect of lan-guage she is more likely to want to develop other ways of responding. Reflective responding Reflective responding is an effective way of demonstrating understand-ing and acceptance and of creating an environment in which change cantake place. When the listener reflects back to the speaker what has beensaid, she is acknowledging that she has heard, accepted and understood.The speaker, on hearing the reflection, feels validated (Chapter 3).Reflecting leads to greater understanding because in the process anyuncertainties are claried. Reflecting is particularly useful when thereis a problem, when something is unclear and needs clarifying and whensomeone is upset. Reassuring or suggesting what someone could do tofeel better both carry a high risk of closing down on the relationship. In the following example a dietitian uses a reflective response. Patient : I went out for a meal at the weekend and blew my diet. I have been trying ever so hard since but it's really difcult. It's the same when I go on holiday - I get so easily tempted. I don't know whether it's worth it.Dietitian : You nd it very hard to keep to a diet and are wondering if it's worth the effort.Patient : Yes. I wonder if I'll ever lose weight. If the reflection is inaccurate the speaker will respond in such a way as to clarify the misunderstanding as below. Patient : I went out for a meal at the weekend and blew my diet. I have been trying ever so hard since but it's really difcult. It's the same when I go on holiday - I get so easily tempted. I don't know whether it's worth it.Dietitian : You're wondering if it's worth going on holiday. Patient : No that's not what I meant. It's like . . . well . . . I ever lose this weight. . . . The technique of reflecting When considering how to reflect there are a number of ways in which we can do this. One is to repeat word for word what has just been said. For example: Patient : I do try to keep to my diet. Dietitian : You are trying to keep to your diet.Responding 77CSFC06 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 77Another way is to repeat key words , that is words that have seemed particularly signicant. Patient : I've tried absolutely everything. I don't know what to do next. Dietitian :(with emphasis ) Everything? Patient : Maybe not everything. Perhaps there is something I could try? Another way is to put into our own words what someone has said, that is to paraphrase as shown in the example below. Patient : I have breakfast every day and then I don't have anything else until the evening. By that time I'm really hungry so I have a big meal then.Dietitian : You have breakfast and then eat a large meal in the evening because you're very hungry by then. Summarising is a way to reflect what has been said when the speaker talks for some time. Patient : I went out for a meal at the weekend and blew my diet. I have been trying ever so hard since but it's really difcult. It's the same when I goon holiday - I get so easily tempted. I don't know whether it's worth it. I dotry to keep to the diet though. I've tried absolutely everything. I don't knowwhat to do next. I have breakfast every day and then I don't have anythingelse until the evening. By that time I'm really hungry so I have a big meal then.Dietitian : You've tried hard to keep to your diet but when you get hungry in the evening or go out for a meal or are on holiday you nd it toodifcult and eat more than you need. When considering what to reflect back to the speaker, the listener can focus on one of the following: the content of what has been said; the meaning this has for the speaker; the feeling that is expressed; the process that is taking place between speaker and listener. When reflecting content the listener focuses on the words that have been said: Patient : I do try to keep to my diet. Dietitian : You are trying to keep to your diet. When reflecting meaning the listener is assessing what she thinks this means to the speaker: Patient : I do try to keep to my diet. Dietitian : It would mean a lot to you to lose weight. When reflecting the feeling the speaker has expressed, the listener takes into account non-verbal clues such as tone of voice and facial expres-sion as well as the language the person has used:78 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC06 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 78Patient :( frowning and speaking impatiently ) I do try to keep to my diet. Dietitian : You feel frustrated keeping to a diet. Reflecting process can be a greater confrontation to the speaker and is best used in an established relationship: Patient : I do try to keep to my diet. Dietitian : You are keeping to your diet some of the time but there are times when you don't? The skill lies in developing a sense of the most appropriate choice to make when responding. Exercise 6.3 is an opportunity to practisereflective responses.Responding 79 Exercise 6.3 Read each remark below and write your reflective response on a piece of paper. Consider more than one response, i.e. repeating word for word,selecting key words, paraphrasing. You may nd it helpful to do thisexercise with a colleague so that you can discuss your responses. Example Patient : You can't say no when people offer it to you, can you? Responses : (1) You can't say no when people offer you something (reflecting word for word). (2) Can't? (reflecting key word).(3) You nd it difcult to refuse when someone offers you something (paraphrasing). Remarks : 'I've not been feeling too good since I last saw you.''My husband says I don't eat enough to keep a fly alive.''Everything I try giving him, he just won't eat.''It's not easy when all the family want something different.''I eat before I go out so I won't be tempted when I get there.''I have never had breakfast so I can't see me starting now.' Repeat the exercise focusing on reflecting content, meaning, feeling or process. Example Patient : You can't say no when people offer it to you, can you? Responses : (1) 'Saying no is something you nd difcult (reflecting content)'(2) 'You think you have to accept when someone offers you something?' (reflecting meaning). (3) 'You feel helpless in this situation?' (reflecting feeling).(4) 'You're asking process).CSFC06 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 79The skill of reflecting The dietitian may feel awkward when she rst practises reflecting. Like any other newly acquired skill reflecting requires awareness, per-severance and practice. Fluency in paraphrasing and mirroring theemotional tone and meaning of what has been said are important sub-skills which the listener needs to develop if she is to avoid seemingarticial when she responds reflectively (Nelson Jones 2006). So farthe focus has been on how to reflect short statements. However, muchof the time people talk in 'paragraphs'. For example: Patient : I've just seen the doctor, he told me to come and see you for a diet. He's ever so nice, not the one I usually see but he told me not toworry and to come back in three months. I'll need to have transport though- I have to leave home at the crack of dawn and they go all round the housesto get here. It's such a nuisance. Can't I go to my own doctor? Here the patient has given the dietitian some information ('I've just seen the doctor, he told me to come and see you for a diet'); alsoexpressed some feelings (implied in the words 'It's such a nuisance');posed a problem ('I'll need to have transport though - I have to leavehome at the crack of dawn and they go all round the houses'); andasked a question ('Can't I go to my own doctor?') all in one speech.The dietitian has to decide what to focus on in her response. Does she pick one item or attempt to cover all? Does she choose the mostimportant? And in deciding this is she selecting the one that seemsmost important to the patient (the transport), or the one that is ofmost concern to her (the diet)? Summarising is a useful way to focus someone on the matter in hand. When the dietitian becomes aware that the patient is drifting offthe topic she can refocus attention by summarising as shown here. Dietitian : The doctor said to come back in three months, in the mean- time to see me about your diet. You're also worried about transport fornext time and want to know if you can see your own doctor instead. This response has the effect of confronting the speaker but not in a blaming or critical way. The dietitian is acknowledging the patient'sconcern and demonstrates caring and understanding without takingon responsibility for solving the appointment problem which is nother concern. Focus on feelings Many people nd it difcult to express how they feel. Some have dif- culty in nding words to describe their emotions. Some feel embarrassed80 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC06 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 80about acknowledging sensations they do not nd acceptable. Y et thoughts, feelings and behaviour are inextricably linked. When some-one talks about something that is troubling or distressing them, the listener is likely to reassure or suggest what could be done for the personto feel better. However, as described earlier in the chapter, these waysof responding carry a high risk of closing down on the relationship.Sensitively reflecting how someone feels on the other hand demon-strates empathy and at a greater level than reflecting the content of whatsomeone has said. In order to be able to demonstrate this we need tobe able to recognise and put a name to the feeling that is being expressed.Identifying feelings can be easier when we consider them under thefour categories of anger, fear, sadness and joy (Exercise 6.4). We have many, varied ways of expressing feelings, as shown below: In words, for example 'I feel good', 'I feel angry', 'I'm scared'. In example 'I'm on top of the world', 'I've been really down in the dumps'. By describing behaviour, for example 'I want to jump for joy', 'I felt like slamming the door'. When reflecting feelings we can reflect the word used by the speaker, for example: 'I was annoyed because I missed the bus.' 'Y ou felt annoyed.' Or we can reflect the feeling implied in the phrase or behaviour described by the speaker as shown in the two examples below: 'I was really put out becaus e... ' becomes 'Y ou felt annoyed becaus e... ' 'It made me see red whe n... ' becomes 'Y ou felt angry whe n... ' It is important to recognise the degree of intensity that the speaker is feeling and to reflect at the same degree of intensity. If someone saysthey are extremely annoyed it is not very helpful to them to reflect thatthey seem a trifle vexed!Responding 81 Exercise 6.4 Take a piece of paper and divide it into four columns. Head one 'Anger', another 'Fear', another 'Sadness' and the fourth 'Joy'. Thenwrite down as many words, phrases and behaviours as you can think ofin each column.CSFC06 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 81When recognising how someone is feeling we take into account non-verbal clues such as smiling (joy), clenched sts (anger), lookingdown (sadness). Culturally we are not encouraged to express feelingsand so we learn to mask them. When observing non-verbal clues weform hunches about how someone is feeling. A tentative reflection is away of checking if this hunch is accurate. The tentative nature of thereflection can be conveyed by intonation, as for example 'Y ou seemangry about that?'. This is an advanced empathic response (Chapter 3)and requires experience to use effectively. When used clumsily the otherperson will react defensively. Mirroring language We can mirror language as well as non-verbal communication. Inneuro-linguistic programming (NLP) researchers have recognisedthat people predominantly use words from one of three categories torepresent the way in which they think (O'Connor & Seymour 2003).These categories are 'visual', 'auditory' and 'kinaesthetic'. A fewexamples are given in Table 6.3. When using words in the same category as the other person we are literally speaking their language. We speak directly to them, thusavoiding some of the problems which arise from differences in under-standing. The following is an example of a patient using visual languageand the dietitian reflecting in the same language: Patient : I always watch what I'm eating but I haven't lost any weight to show for it.Dietitian : You keep an eye on what you eat but haven't noticed a change in your weight.82 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Table 6.3 Examples of words in each category of expression. Visual (see) Auditory (hear) Kinaesthetic (feel) Appear Overhear Affected Demonstrate Hear PM Page 82The dietitian has responded using visual language. Speaking the same language is something we all do naturally when we are in rapport.Using it consciously is a way of creating rapport. Notice the differ-ence in rapport building when the dietitian responds using a differentlanguage. Patient : I always watch what I'm eating but I haven't lost any weight to show for it.Dietitian : You eat what you feelyou should but this hasn't affected your weight. When and when not to reflect There are times when reflective responding is helpful and times when it is not. Reflective responding is useful when: someone expresses a concern; there is a problem; something is unclear and needs clarifying; someone is upset; there is a difference of opinion; you are presented with something unexpected. Reflecting is valuable to do before you argue or criticise (Bolton 1986). When this takes place, greater understanding is gained beforeexpressing an opinion. Bolton also advocates reflecting before takingaction, by paraphrasing or summarising what has been discussed untilagreement is reached about what is to be done. It is not helpful to use reflecting when we are tired, rushed, frus- trated, stressed or anxious and when we have too much on our mindto give our attention fully to another. Reflecting is a way of respondingwhich reflects our attitude to another as being a human being worthyof respect and acceptance, who has the potential to nd their ownsolution. It is therefore not useful or effective to use reflecting skillswith those for whom we are not able to provide these core conditions(Chapter 3). Reflecting requires us to be open to accepting the other person and ourselves. One way of becoming more open is to respond reflectivelyto oneself (Chapter 13). When we are unable to be open to another we can use listening as a way of hiding. This happens when we listenpassively, letting the other person take charge of the situation. At suchtimes when we do not want to engage with another we are not able touse reflective responding.Responding 83CSFC06 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 83Self-disclosure Talking about herself when interviewing a patient is something for the dietitian to consider carefully. What is her motive in talking aboutherself ? Is it to establish friendship, feel better about herself, get thepatient to comply with her instructions, gain the patient's approval, or to reassure the patient that he or she is not the only one with such a difculty? Is the self-disclosure honest, appropriate and relevant tothe patient? Is it for the benet of the patient or the dietitian? What is the likely outcome of her self-disclosure? The effect of self-disclosure may be to divert attention from the patient to the dietitian, as in the example below: Patient : I haven't got much appetite - I don't think I'll be able to eat it all.Dietitian : Don't worry, eat as much as you can. When I was in hospital I hardly ate a thing after my op.Patient : Oh, what were you in for? The interviewing time is for the patient not for the dietitian! Instead of using self-disclosure the dietitian could reflect as shown below: Patient : I haven't got much appetite - I don't think I'll be able to eat it all.Dietitian : You feel worried that you'll be expected to eat more than you can manage just now.Patient : Yes, and then I don't want to try any of it. As a result the patient has an experience of being heard and her lack of appetite accepted by the dietitian, who herself has a greater under-standing of how the patient feels. As well as diverting attention to the dietitian self-disclosure may result in patients feeling manipulated instead of empowered to act forthemselves. The dietitian who makes up examples of eating behaviourand shares these with the patient as if they were her own, uses covertmeans in the hope of receiving an honest response. The dietitian maybe tempted to do this when taking a dietary history, in the hope thatshe can convey acceptability to the patient of eating a particular food;for example, remarks such as 'We all eat chocolate biscuits from timeto time. I know I do - once a packet is open you can't stop at just oneor two can you?' Although her intention in making this remark is 'forthe patient's good', the hidden message she conveys is 'I want to catchyou out'. The patient is unlikely to feel safe enough with the dietitian totalk to her openly and honestly as the patient will sense the dietitian'slack of genuineness. This may not be apparent to the patient at the84 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC06 10/10/06 8:38 PM Page 84time but, as with all manipulative behaviour, it will be realised later. As a result distrust has been created in the relationship. This chapter has identied different types of response and high- lighted reflective responding as a skill which the dietitian can developand use effectively in building a helping relationship with her patients.The next chapter examines the use of reflecting in dealing with con-frontation as well as other ways of making helpful interventions andshows how these can be used in conjunction with reflective responding.

The nature,timing and content of these interventions are important if they are toperceived as helpful. As shown in the previous chapter, different typesof response carry different degrees of risk of diminishing the otherperson and hindering the helping relationship. The manner in which a response is made also determines whether it hinders helpfulness or enhances the receiver's process. When skilfully applied, an appro-priate intervention can help a person gain understanding, knowledge,insight and condence. Such interventions can be classied as con-fronting, catalytic, supportive and informative (Heron 2001). A dieteticexample of each type of intervention is given below:CSFC07 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 86Confronting - 'If you could eat more healthily, what changes would you make?'. Catalytic - 'What would it mean to you if you were to lose weight?'. Supportive - 'Y ou do matter, your health is important'. Informative - 'A persistent high blood level is a sign that somethingis not right'. The purpose of catalytic interventions is to enable someone to think about something in a new way. In other words the intervention acts asa catalyst. The purpose of supportive and informative interventions,as their name implies, is to support and inform the other person. Theperson on the receiving end will also be brought face to face with thesubject matter, that is they will be confronted with the topic or issue. In many dictionaries confrontation is dened as meeting face to face although for many the word 'confrontation' is more associated withthe idea of a head-on collision or conflict. There is often fear that aconfrontation will be perceived as hostile and aggressive and so evokea defensive and aggressive response. Such reactions occur when con-frontations made clumsily and in anger, are perceived as uncomfortableand hurtful. Confrontation then, is generally perceived as somethingundesirable, even threatening rather than helpful and rewarding. Thisperception makes us wary of both giving and receiving such commun-ications and so we may let opportunities pass by or make efforts to'soften the blow', which can lead to misunderstanding and confusion.However, confronting a patient, that is helping them face something,is an essential part of enabling someone to change their behaviour. Confrontation then is necessary and helpful and not harmful in itself although the way in which it is done can be. It is important there-fore that interventions are made in a way that forms part of the helpingprocess. When someone is brought face to face with something in askilful and helpful way, the confrontation is likely to be experienced as constructive and helpful and to stimulate change. When an inter-vention is made with an attitude of enquiry and a desire to clear up a difculty or to enable another person, it becomes less charged withanxiety. Effective confrontations are those which increase awareness,facilitate change and lead to completion of a task, growth in a relation-ship and personal development (Heron 2001). Clear, open and honestcommunication includes making interventions which are rewarding,stimulating, helpful, supportive and enlightening. They provide some-one with an opportunity to learn something new. The ability of thedietitian to make effective confrontations is related to her communication skills, her attitude towards herself and others and the manner and timing of her intervention.Making Helpful Interventions 87CSFC07 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 87Examining attitudes When examining her attitude towards confrontation it is important for the dietitian to consider her role. As a dietitian, on the one handdoes she have permission to confront on the issue in question? If sheexceeds her role she may be 'perceived as a bully, a do-gooder or a nag'(Heron 2001). If on the other hand she does not confront a patient, isshe fullling her role to help that person change their eating habits?How much is her attitude towards confrontation affected by her fearof what might happen if she were to intervene? Dietitians who seethemselves as facilitators may nd effective confrontation comes moreeasily than those who see themselves as teachers or instructors. If adietitian believes it is her role to facilitate and enable the patient tochange their diet then she is likely to see any necessary confrontationas part of that process. In other words her confrontation is her 'best'way of responding to the patient in order to resolve or clarify a dif-culty. If a dietitian sees her role as an adviser or teacher she is likely to feel a burden of responsibility to 'say the right thing', to give the'right' instructions or advice. Her anxiety that she may get it wrongunderstandably makes her wary of confronting a patient. Fear of what might happen When feeling anxious about confronting someone, many people behave either manipulatively or aggressively. Initially they may try an indirectapproach and do what they can to manoeuvre the other person in thedirection they want. If this does not work they may pluck up courageto deal with the situation more directly. Phrases such as 'taking thebull by the horns' and 'tackling it head-on' come to mind. Stress levelsincrease and the belief that confrontation is difcult, anxiety provok-ing and unpleasant is reinforced. Dietitians may fear that those they confront will perceive them as hostile and react by dissolving into tears or becoming verbally or evenphysically abusive. Although indirect and devious ways may preventobvious distress, the patient who has been confronted will probablyrealise later that they have been manipulated. They may then feel irritated and confused and be doubtful about making a change. Thefollowing example, in which a dietitian is advising a patient on fluidrestriction, illustrates this. Patient : I try not to drink too much. Dietitian :(smiling and speaking brightly ) You mustn't drink a lot. It's important with your condition that you only have a litre of fluid a day. Thismay be difcult but once you get used to it you'll manage ne.88 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC07 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 88Patient :( wondering how much a litre is )...M m m...I ' m sure you're right. I'll have to get used to it.Dietitian :(wanting to be reassuring ) Oh there's no need to start unless the doctor tells you.Patient :( feels confused ) So I don't start now? When confrontation is unclear, misunderstandings can accumulate until feelings reach such a level of intensity that someone feels com-pelled to say something or take some action. The subsequent effectson the relationship can be considerable. Our point of view It is difcult to make a helpful confrontation when we are unable to distance ourselves sufciently to see any other point of view, althoughmany people feel easier about confronting someone only when theyare sure of their point of view and able to stand their ground in theevent of an argument. Having a xed point of view makes it difcult tolisten to another person without risking loss of face. When one personis convinced their point of view is the only one worth consideration,confrontation easily becomes a conflict. When two people share the same point of view they can reinforce each other in being 'right' and so make it more difcult for either to consider alternative possibilities and opportunities for change. Wecan confront one another most effectively when we are open to under-standing and accepting another point of view at the same time asknowing our own. T owards helpful confrontation When an intervention is made in a spirit of wanting to clarify under- standing, or to help another consider a different way of thinking, itbecomes an invitation to change. The other person is less likely to feelobliged to defend themselves and therefore is more able to perceivethe intervention as supportive. As a result they are more likely to bemotivated to act. The following is an example of a dietitian confront-ing a patient in this way. Dietitian :(summarising what patient has said ) From what you tell me, cutting down on alcohol seems a big sacrice at the moment as drinking isa way you deal with your stress.Patient : What else can I do? If I didn't have a drink now and again it would all get on top of me.Dietitian :(paraphrasing ) You're not sure how else to cope. ( gives informa- tion) There are other ways to manage stress. ( opens up an opportunity to Making Helpful Interventions 89CSFC07 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 89give more information ) If you would like to know more I can give you some information.Patient : Yes. That might give me some new ideas. Providing the core conditions when making an intervention When our attitude to confrontation is based upon a desire to clarify understanding, showing respect for another and for ourselves, we areable to confront and simultaneously demonstrate our empathy, accept-ance and genuineness. For example, when a patient complains to thedietitian about the hospital food yet the nursing staff have assured herthat the patient eats the meals provided, the dietitian could demon-strate her genuineness by saying to the patient: Dietitian : The nurses tell me you are eating well yet I am puzzled because you tell me that you dislike the food. Here the dietitian has confronted the patient without attaching any blame either to the patient or the nurses, thus demonstrating her acceptance.She has expressed her genuine feeling of puzzlement at the apparentcontradiction. On hearing this, the patient has no need to be defensiveand has an opportunity to explain more fully if he wishes. In the following example a patient explains that he nds it difcult to refuse the food served by his wife. The dietitian helps the patientface the problem through demonstrating her empathic understanding. Patient : When I get a plateful in front of me, I just can't say no. Dietitian :(gently ) You can't? Patient : W e l l... it's just so difcult ...I don't want to hurt her feel- ingsafter she's gone to so much trouble. Dietitian :(reflecting ) You're worried she'll be upset if you don't eat it once she's cooked it for you?Patient : I suppose the best thing would be to tell her before she starts cooking. Gently reflecting the key word 'can't' in a questioning way brings the patient face to face with his statement and invites him to examinewhat he has said. Asking questions Questions are the most commonly used interventions and many dietitians are unaware of how many they ask and the way in which theyask them or of their effect upon the patient. When questions focus on90 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC07 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 90the concerns, intent and perspective of the person asking the question they become a barrier to communication (Bolton 1986). Questionscan be facilitative or authoritative in nature. They can be investigative,probing, inquisitorial and manipulative. They can also be expressionsof curiosity. Questions have a useful purpose in checking understanding and assessing knowledge . The way in which a question is phrased, the purpose of asking it and the type of questions asked, all have an effecton the other person. Questions can be open or closed. Open questions invite the other person to talk about the subject in some detail and begin with wordssuch as 'what', 'where', 'when' and 'how'. Open questions phrased inthis way are examples of facilitative questions. They show interest andconcern and are useful in opening interactions; for example, 'How areyou?' is an open question used in everyday conversation. Dietitians often ask 'How can I help you?'. This example of an open question can be effective in the opening stages of an interview with apatient. Open questions are an effective way of focusing attention on a particular topic, as in 'What did you have for breakfast this morning?'.Open questions can induce motivation. For example the dietitian mayask 'What would you like to be able to do as a result of losing weight?'.This catalytic intervention invites the recipient to think about whatlosing weight means to them. If the patient perceives herself safe enoughto answer honestly she may take the opportunity to clarify her thoughts.If these are realistic and she receives acceptance not criticism, she is more likely to be motivated to take the necessary action. Thus, byasking open questions the dietitian encourages greater participationand invites the patient to express their opinions, attitudes and feelings.Although open questions may yield seemingly irrelevant material andplace more demand upon the dietitian to listen, the fuller reply whichthey evoke allows for a more accurate assessment than is obtainedthrough the use of closed questions. Questions beginning with 'why' are frequently used to obtain the reason behind something. While this may be asked out of curiosity thereis considerable risk that the person being asked the question will feelinterrogated. They are likely then to come up with an answer whichthey think will satisfy the questioner, rather than an honest explanation.The dietitian who asks, 'Why don't you eat boiled eggs instead of fried?'is likely to get an evasive and defensive reply such as, 'Oh it's not methat has them fried, it's the rest of the family that like them this way. I always boil mine.' The dietitian is then faced with the dilemma ofwhether to believe the patient or not. Closed questions invite a monosyllabic response such as 'yes' or 'no' and are useful for getting specic information. By asking questionsMaking Helpful Interventions 91CSFC07 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 91which elicit a minimal answer the questioner retains control of the interview. However, even if the person gives more than a monosyllabicanswer, they are unlikely to disclose much, particularly about theirfeelings. The reply to a closed question may also be misleading. Apatient may answer 'Y es' in response to the dietitian asking 'Do youunderstand?' because this is what is expected, and in doing so theymay imply a greater understanding than they actually possess. Closedquestions inviting only a limited reply may provoke frustration inarticulate patients. It is important the dietitian is aware of her purpose in asking the question. Knowing this can help her decide whether to frame it as an open or closed question. A closed question is adequate if the dieti- tian knows specically what information she requires. If she wants toencourage her patient to talk and think for themselves, and wants toascertain general information, an open question is more likely to ther purpose. The examples of confronting and catalytic questions onp. 87 illustrate this. As she becomes more aware of the way in which she asks ques- tions, the dietitian may be at a loss as to other ways to respond. Whenpeople give up their over-reliance on questioning they usually feeluncomfortable with the silences (Bolton 1986). The skills of active listening and reflective responding (Chapters 5 and 6) and assertivecommunication (introduced below), are valuable alternatives. Effective confrontation Effective confrontation involves: listening to the other person's point of view; stating the facts; being specic; speaking for oneself using 'I'; skilful questioning. The skills of active listening and reflective responding described in Chapters 5 and 6 clarify understanding and demonstrate listening to the other point of view. Stating the facts involves sharing observa-tions and referring to actual events that took place. Phrases such as'When yo u... ' o r 'When I... ' (followed by the behaviour) or 'When (the event) happened I (noticed/thought/felt )... ' are useful as a way to raise the subject. The skill in being specic is to keep to thebehaviour in question. It can be tempting to generalise and add othersituations and refer to other examples. This can lead to side-tracking92 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC07 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 92and loss of impact. Speaking for oneself involves the skills of assertive communication (Chapter 13) and using 'I' as the pronoun not 'you'. In the following example the dietitian who has thought about con- fronting the patient for some time has now decided to do so using theskills described above. Patient :( having gained weight ) I always do that - lose some and then put it back on. It doesn't seem to make much difference coming here.Dietitian :(reflecting ) You think there's not much point in coming here any more. ( stating her point of view ) As I see it we have been meeting for over a year now. During this time you have made some changes to your diet andlost weight although you have put some on in the past three months, over-all you have lost weight. ( Invites patient to assess progress ) I am wondering what you have got from our meetings that has been helpful to you? The timing and level of confrontation Knowing that confrontation is likely to arouse anxiety in both herself and her patient, the dietitian will want to consider an appropriate time to make an intervention. When considering this she will be taking intoaccount the quality of the relationship she has established with herpatient and assessing her patient's ability to act upon her confronta-tion. In the following example a dietitian has been listening attentivelyand consciously using reflective responding for much of the interview.She is aware her patient uses phrases such as 'I can't . . .' and 'I'll by 'It doesn't really matter' and ne really,I've always been like this'. The dietitian recognises these phrases asexamples of discounting (Stewart & Joines 1987). We can discount: our ability to change, e.g. 'I can't (keep to a diet)'; the possibility of change, e.g. 'It will never happen. (I'll never loseweight)'; the signicance of the event, e.g. 'It doesn't really matter (beingclinically obese)'; the existence of the problem, e.g. 'I'm ne. I've always had this(been overweight)'. A confrontation may be ignored or deflected onto something else if someone is not ready to listen, with the result that no change takesplace. As a general guideline it is effective to confront someone at thetime or as near to this time as possible. The more time that elapses themore room there is for misunderstandings and anxiety to develop anddetails become less clear. If considerable time has passed, the otherperson may not even remember the occasion or issue in question.Making Helpful Interventions 93CSFC07 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 93The level of confrontation is important. If the confrontation is supercial it will be treated as insignicant. If the confrontation is toodeep the person concerned will defend themselves in some way, forexample by brushing it aside or denying their part in the situation, asin the following example. Patient : It's so difcult to refuse. I just can't say no to chocolate cake. I'm hopeless.Dietitian :(briskly ) Have you thought of some assertiveness training. Patient : Oh no . . . I couldn't possibly. The ability to assess the timing and level of an appropriate confronta- tion is closely linked with being empathic. The dietitian who focuses onproviding the core conditions of empathy, acceptance and genuine-ness as described earlier in this chapter, will nd that she is able torespond to her patient appropriately by using reflective responding orpurposeful questioning. What to confront How does the dietitian know what to bring face to face with another?She can choose to confront how someone feels, for example their anxiety; how someone thinks , for example the accuracy of their know- ledge; or how someone behaves , for example the fact that they missed their last appointment. Some more examples of different feelings,thinking and behaviour are given in Table 7.1. It is important to confront one thing at a time. It is not helpful to confront someone with, for example, their incorrect knowledge aboutfoods rich in saturated fat, the appointment they missed last week and their air of depression, all in one sentence! Given that there is somuch to choose from how does the dietitian decide what to focus on?Her choice depends upon her awareness. As she listens to the patientshe may become aware of their hesitant tone of voice, for example,and choose to focus on this by saying, 'Y ou sound unsure when yousay that'. She may notice a frown on the patient's face and wonder if they have understood. She could confront this by saying, for example, 'I'm not sure if I've explained myself clearly. Would you like me to gothrough it again?' Confronting paradoxes, discrepancies and inconsistencies The dietitian may be aware of a particular paradox , discrepancy or inconsistency in what the other person is saying; for example, she may94 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC07 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 94realise patient has contradicted himself. When the dietitian recog- nises a discrepancy she may feel confused and decide that the patientis lying or that she has misheard. She may ignore it and miss theopportunity to clarify what the patient said, or ask a series of questionsin an attempt to establish the truth. Too many questions are likely to produce a defensive response. The dietitian can bring her observa-tion to the patient's attention by using the phrase, 'On the one hand I hear you say . . . yet on the other you tell me . . .'. By highlighting the contradiction in this way she is confronting the patient in a non-threatening manner. Another way to confront involves reflecting the inconsistency, as in the following example. The question mark indicates the dietitian'spuzzlement rather than criticism. Dietitian :(with curiosity ) 'You say you had some last week yet earlier I thought you said you this was something you never ate?' The dietitian has an opportunity to confront when a patient uses words such as 'never', 'always', 'everyone', 'no-one'. These are examples ofMaking Helpful Interventions 95 Table 7.1 Examples of different feelings, thinking and behaviour. Feelings Anger ConcernUncertaintyFearFrustrationSadnessDisappointmentIrritationRelief Thinking Knowledge Point of viewAttitudesExpectationsBeliefs Behaviour Missing appointments Expressing opinionsRefusing to complyCryingNot talkingDiverting onto PM Page 95words which dene something in absolute terms. Such words are all embracing and exclude alternatives. When someone says, for example,'I never eat (a certain food)' they may be dismissing occasions whenthey have. 'I always eat breakfast' similarly discounts any occasion whenthis meal was not taken. Use of such words can alert the dietitian, forthey may imply that a patient is not yet open to change. The dietitianhas an opportunity to confront the patient with what they have said byreflecting the key word, for example 'never' (Chapter 6). In so doingshe is inviting the patient to think about what they have said. Confronting issues The dietitian may come across a situation in which she is aware of certain issues, such as a patient's lack of trust in the hospital food. For example, a patient is not eating his hospital diet despite efforts by the dietitian to make sure the food he likes is available. When thedietitian learns that the patient's wife is supplying him with food sheassumes he is not willing to comply with his diet. She later learnsabout his religious background and she suspects that he does not trustthe hospital to provide food that suits his beliefs. She has now replacedher initial assumption that he is deliberately being difcult because heis unconcerned about his diet, with the hunch that he does not trustthe hospital to provide meals which are acceptable. She decides toconfront him with this by rst stating the facts and then sharing herthoughts, and she invites the patient to explain his point of view: Dietitian : The nurses tell me that you are not eating your meals except those your wife brings you and I'm wondering if this is because you don'tlike the hospital food. When the dietitian does not believe the patient 'I don't believe you but I can't say that' is a thought which may occur to a dietitian as she listens to a patient, and it provides her with anopportunity to confront her patient in a constructive way. The follow-ing example demonstrates this. Patient :( at appointment following return from holiday ) I had a wonderful holiday, good weather, great company and marvellous food. I was very goodthough - I kept to my diet all the time.Dietitian :(not sure whether to believe this or not, decides to accept it at face value ) You enjoyed your holiday and kept to your diet throughout. Patient : Yes, I surprised myself but there was so much variety I could choose lots that is OK on my diet. I didn't feel I was going without.96 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC07 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 96Dietitian :(hunch that patient is being honest ) There was a lot of choice and you didn't nd your diet restricted you. I'm glad for you because holidays can be difcult times to be on a diet.Patient : I know. I wondered if you'd believe me. I'm pleased you do but I wouldn't have been surprised if you hadn't. This interview could have turned out differently as shown below. In both examples the dietitian focuses on reflective responding as anon-threatening way to confront the patient. Patient :( at appointment following return from holiday ) I had a wonderful holiday, good weather, great company and marvellous food. I was verygood though - I kept to my diet all the time.Dietitian :(not sure whether to believe this or not, decides to accept it at face value ) You enjoyed your holiday and kept to your diet throughout. Patient : Well, almost. You won't be cross will you if I tell you there was one occasion . . . on the last evening I had a real blow out but that wasthe only time.Dietitian :(decides to ignore the invitation to admonish or commiserate with the patient ) The last evening you decided not to limit yourself. Patient : Yes, I paid for it though . . . had indigestion all night. Helping someone towards clearer thinking When the dietitian becomes aware that the patient is using phrases such as 'I can't', 'it doesn't matter' or words such as 'never', 'always' orrecognises other examples of discounting (p. 93), she has an opportunityto help the patient change their way of thinking. As a result, feelingschange and different outcomes are possible. The strategies to enablethis to take place are encompassed in cognitive-behavioural therapy(CBT, described in Chapter 1) and can be helpful to the dietitian,both in her own personal development (Chapter 14) and in her workwith patients. The following CBT strategies are useful to help a patientgain a different perspective and are appropriate when both patient anddietitian are working in Stage 2 of the helping process described inChapter 4. Recognising thoughts and distinguishing these from feelings To be able to change our thinking we rst need to distinguish our thoughts from our feelings. This is not so straightforward as it seemsas much of the time we express feelings as thoughts and vice versa. Forexample when asked how they feel someone may reply 'I think I could do with a holiday'. When asked what they are thinking someone mayMaking Helpful Interventions 97CSFC07 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page becomes adept at distin- guishing thoughts from feelings can help her patient think, feel andbehave differently. What's going through your mind when you think that? This is a useful question to ask a patient who is ready to gain a new perspective. When she asks this question the dietitian is inviting thepatient to describe the thoughts that are occurring to him in associa-tion with a particular feeling or behaviour. Patients may nd thisdifcult to articulate at rst. Some may be willing to keep a record of their thoughts, associated with a particular behaviour, betweenappointments (an example of how this can be done is given in Exercise15.5, Chapter 15). This exercise could usefully be incorporated into afood diary. Keeping such a record can help someone become morefamiliar with the process of identifying their thoughts. In the followingexample the patient is talking about how difcult she nds it to refusefood. Patient : I just wish I could say no when I'm offered a second helping but I can't.Dietitian : I'm wondering what is going through your mind when you think that?Patient : Oh . . . . . I just haven't any will power. As she listens the dietitian is identifying the extreme negative thoughts of 'I can't' and 'I'm hopeless'. In saying this the patient is discountingher ability to change by focusing solely on negative beliefs. Identifyingthis and replacing these negative thoughts with more realistic onesenables the patient to gain a different, less one-sided perspective. Thedietitian now helps the patient do this as follows: Dietitian : When I hear you say 'I can't and I'm hopeless', I'm wonder- ing if these thoughts are really true? And I'm thinking what if you were to replace those thoughts with more realistic ones. For example 'What if I could? Then what?'.Patient : I suppose I would feel less hopeless. Dietitian :(summarising ) So when you're offered another helping you could say no and this would mean you would feel less hopeless?Patient : I suppose so. . . . Dietitian : And if you felt less hopeless how would this affect your will power?Patient : I suppose I would then have a little. Dietitian :(invites patient to practise ) How about imagining you are about to comfort eat and saying to me now 'I could say no'?98 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC07 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 98Patient nods and repeats the phrase hesitantly back to the dietitian saying she feels silly. Dietitian :(acknowledging how patient feels ) Yes, it seems strange at rst to hear oneself saying something you're not used to. How about havinganother go and speaking more rmly this time? The dietitian then invites the patient to repeat her new way of think- ing several times. Patients differ in their willingness to engage in thisexercise. Although those who decline to participate will not have heardthemselves utter a new thought they will go away with a greater under-standing of how they could change their thinking. Patients who dotake part are likely to say how strange they feel saying these unfamiliarwords. The dietitian can encourage them by afrming each attempt. Some other typical examples of negative thinking are given in Table 7.2. These examples can be replaced by more positive and realistic thoughtssuch as shown in Table 7.3. By replacing negative thoughts with helpful positive ones we are not only being more realistic but also showing more compassion. Insteadof putting ourselves down in a harsh and critical way, we can learn toMaking Helpful Interventions 99 Table 7.2 Typical examples of negative thoughts. Negative thought Assumption 'Now I've blown my diet completely' There is no way forward 'I'll never be slim again like I was before' I can't change'I know you're going to tell me off' I'm in the wrong again'I just know I've put on weight' I can't succeed'I feel guilty I can't keep to a healthy diet' I'm a failure Table 7.3 Some examples of replacements for negative thoughts. Negative thought Replacement 'Now I've blown my diet completely' 'I've eaten more than I intended but I can have less this evening' 'I'll never be slim again like I was before' 'It may be difcult to lose weight but not impossible' 'I know you're going to tell me off' 'I have done the best I could given the circumstances' 'I just know I've put on weight' 'I will only know this when I get on the scales' 'I just can't keep to a healthy diet' 'Over the past week I've not done too badly'CSFC07 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 99talk to ourselves in the same compassionate way we would to a friend with a similar problem. In other words we can learn to be our own bestfriend! The following example shows how such self-compassion canbe developed. The mother of a child with sensitivity to cow's milk nds out her child has been given milk to drink at nursery school. She holds herselfpersonally responsible for an event that isn't entirely under her con-trol. As a result she feels guilt, ashamed and inadequate as a mother.She thinks 'It's all my fault. If I were at home instead of at work thiswouldn't have happened'. Realising how she is thinking she now saysto herself, 'The reality is that this has happened and could have doneso whether I was at home or at work. What I can do now is think how I can reduce the risk of it happening again'. We not only blame ourselves but also blame others, or the circum- stances, for a problem and in so doing overlook the part we may have played. The following example shows a patient complaining to adietitian. Patient : 'It's all the doctor's fault. If I'd been told to lose weight sooner I wouldn't have to wait so long for the operation'.Dietitian :(rst identies the blaming thought then uses reflective responding to invite the patient to reconsider ) 'You're thinking it is all the doctor's fault that you are having to wait so long for your operation'.Patient : 'I realise it is not all the doctor's fault but he could have sent me to see you sooner'.Dietitian :(paraphrasing ) 'You would have found it helpful to have had advice about losing weight at an earlier stage?'Patient :( now thinking clearly ) 'Yes. If I had succeeded in losing weight last year I might not have had so long to wait for my operation'. When we blame ourselves or others we tend to use words like 'should' 'need', 'ought', 'must' and 'got to'. Thinking something or someoneshould be the way we hope or expect indicates that we are thinking in a demanding and inflexible way. The following are typical examples: 'I really should try harder to stick to my diet' and 'They should knowby now not to give me things I shouldn't eat'. 'Should' statements may be directed towards others or oneself, to particular individuals or groups or the world in general and lead to frustration and anger.Some people think 'should' and 'must' statements are motivating tothe other person. However there is a high risk that these statementswill chastise and demotivate leading to a refusal to co-operate. Another way in which we attach blame and evoke negative thoughts is when we dene ourselves using an action or event and assume thatwhat we do is who we are. For example a patient buys or eats anunsuitable food then thinks 'I'm stupid' or 'I am for DietitiansCSFC07 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 100thinking arouses anger, depression and low self-esteem. As well as labelling ourselves we label others in a similar way, such as whensomeone behaves in a way we don't like we think of them as 'bad'. Forexample when a dietitian thinks a patient is awkward and demandingand then considers him to be a bad patient. We can learn to think in ways which do not distort the reality by applying the following three steps: (1) Identifying the negative way we are thinking (2) Challenging the assumption that the negative thought is true(3) Replacing the negative thought with a more appropriate one. For example 'should' statements can be replaced with 'it wouldhave been better if I had . . .' or 'I prefer to . . .' or 'I aim to . . .'. Here are some ways to help someone challenge their negative thought: helping them to list the reasons why this might not be true; asking questions, e.g. 'How do you know this?' 'What if this weren't so?'; inviting them to think in terms of partial success rather than com-plete failure; asking them to rate, e.g. hunger, on a scale (1-10) helps someoneto evaluate an event or feeling and make an assessment; inviting them to ask others if their thoughts and attitudes are realistic; reminding them that doing something idiotic or foolish does notmean they become an idiot or a fool; encouraging them to talk to themselves in a gentler, less emotion-ally laden way; helping them consider the many factors that may have contributedto their negative thinking. Not all patients will be willing to change the way they think. How- ever doing so can lead to a greater sense of fullment and possibility of change. The dietitian who is familiar with identifying, challengingand replacing negative thoughts for herself can incorporate these stepsinto her way of helping patients as shown in the examples above . This chapter has examined the skills of questioning and, together with the skills of active listening and reflective responding described in theprevious two chapters, shows how these interventions can be effectivelyapplied to help a patient in the process of change. Although all theexamples in Part 2 are related to the dietetic interview, dietitians willnd it helpful to apply the principles in their interactions with others,for example with students. Part 3 focuses on the patient interview anddemonstrates how these skills can be used in a variety of settings.Making Helpful Interventions 101CSFC07 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 101References Bolton, R.

Lifespace Publishing, 8:37 PM Page 102Part 3 The Patient Interview In Part 3, I show how the skills described in Part 2 can be used in dietetic practice. Chapter 8 focuses on developing a framework for the dietetic interview, consisting of three sections (beginning, middleand ending) and certain tasks within each section. The beginning section plays a signicant part in creating an environment in whichdietitian and patient can work comfortably together. First impressionsare quickly formed by both patient and dietitian and assumptions madewhich affect their communication with each other. Setting an agendaand clarifying the time available and the limits to condentiality establish boundaries which enable the dietitian to use her counsellingskills effectively. The middle section of the interview includes assess-ing motivation to change the diet, forming a working agreement orcontract, taking a diet history and giving dietary advice. When thesetasks are accomplished using a person-centred approach, a relationshipof trust, respect and individual responsibility develops. The chapterconcludes with the process of closing the dietetic interview and howthe dietitian can use the interview framework to review her work in astructured way. Some particular issues of working with different groups of people, for example those who are bereaved, children, those whose culturalbackground differs from that of the dietitian and those with physicaland mental health problems are addressed in Chapters 9-12. Theseare included to help the reader recognise and understand how: bereavement is part of adapting to any change and how grieving aloss evokes an intense mixture of thoughts and feelings and resultsin people behaving in many different ways; an awareness of the dynamics between the family membersincreases the dietitian's understanding of the child and his or herenvironment;CSFC08 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 103104 Counselling Skills for Dietitians cultural differences and attitudes can create commonplace mis- understandings, threaten human relationships and result in theineffective use of time and resources; patient and dietitian reflect their attitudes about physical and learn-ing difculties and mental health in the way they communicatewith one another. Anxiety, depression and deep-seated difcultiesconcerning the use and abuse of food require skilled help fromdietitians and others. Chapter 13 describes three interviews in which I show how dietitians can integrate into dietetic practice: the issues raised in Part 1; the counselling skills described in Part 2; the framework described in Chapter 8.CSFC08 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 104Chapter 8 Developing a Framework ' \"I could tell you my adventures beginning from the beginning\" said Alice a little timidly.'

Anxiety can give rise to common problemsin an interview (Table 8.1). A framework also helps the practitioner monitor, review and learn from the interview. The framework described in this chapter is basedon accepted practice in counselling and psychotherapy and has beenCSFC08 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 105applied to a standard dietetic interview. The interview has been broken down into three stages: beginnings, middles and endings. Beginnings The interview setting Environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, noise and seating can either facilitate or hinder the dietitian in giving her fullattention to the patient. Rooms in out-patient departments which are too warm, windowless or airless may be familiar to many. Somerooms have little privacy; others are so cut off from the main area thatdietitians feel isolated. Patients can spend time wandering aimlessly in search of where to go and this increases their anxiety. Althoughenvironmental factors may be outside the dietitian's control, smallchanges can often be made which result in a more effective environment(Exercise 8.1). Position of desk It is well recognised that a desk between two people is an obstacle to communication. Nowadays computers may add to the impedimenta106 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 8.1 Think of your workplace. What environmental factors do you consider a barrier to listening? What changes would you like to make? You maynd it helpful to list these under the headings of 'barriers' and 'possiblechanges'.Table 8.1 Some examples of problems that can arise if anxiety is present. Anxiety about Problem Available time Pace - going too fast or too slow Rambling - on the part of the patient and/or the dietitian Getting it right Probing - excessive probing being perceived as intrusive Embarrassment (shame) - of either patient or dietitian Pleasing another Flexibility - too much or a lack of thisSafety/security Issues about condentiality and talking openlyCSFC08 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 106on desk tops. Objects placed between dietitian and patient cut off some of the information communicated by each person; for example,if a desk is between her and her patient the dietitian is unlikely tonotice the patient's foot tapping rhythmically. If she were to notice this she might interpret it as a sign of agitation and an indication thatthe patient is having difculty listening. Seating We tend to sit opposite one another on either side of a desk if we want to compete or negotiate; side-by-side to co-operate; and diagonallyopposite to discuss. If seats are identical there is no problem in decidingwhich one to take. If they are different the dietitian needs to assign onefor herself and one for the patient. Should she have the more comfort-able chair because, as the dietitian, she will be sitting in it throughoutthe clinic, or should she offer this to the patient? What is the likely effecton the patient and the relationship between them when the dietitiancommands the superior chair? Proximity and orientation The closer and more direct (face to face) two people are, the more open they become to one another. On the one hand this may indicateintimacy; on the other hand one or the other may feel threatened. We show interest by leaning towards each other, yet if we lean tooclose we invade the other's personal space. Our willingness to allowsomeone to enter our personal space varies according to our relation-ship with them, the job we do and the culture we come from. Doctors,dentists and nurses, for example, are allowed to enter a patient's personal space because of the role they full, whereas dietitians maynot have the same permission. Having considered these aspects of the physical framework the dietitian needs to consider how able she is to provide a helping relationship (Chapter 3) and how her attitude may be influenced by the rst impression she is forming of her patient. Preparing to provide a helping relationship The dietitian can prepare herself before an interview by allowingenough time to adjust the physical environment and giving herselftime to reflect upon the following.Developing a Framework 107CSFC08 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 107Practical Have I read the patient's notes? Do I need to speak to another member of staff (e.g. doctor, nurse, receptionist) before I see this patient? Do I need to set up the computer? What resources (e.g. diet sheets, information leaflets) do I need onhand that might be useful? Personal How able am I right now to listen to this patient? How able am I to provide the core conditions of empathy, accept- ance and genuineness? What is my agenda for this appointment? Am I able to set clear boundaries about time, condentiality andfurther appointments? Checking these points is a useful habit. The reader is recommended to refer to Chapters 3 and 4, where these points are discussed andexamples are given of setting boundaries about condentiality and time.There will be times when, for many reasons, the dietitian is not able to offer the patient much apart from answering questions and givingbrief information. There will be other times when the dietitian realisesthat she can give the patient the support they need through using herskills of active listening, as described in Chapter 5. First impressions The rst impression we form of someone happens very quickly in anymeeting. During the 'safe talk' period we absorb a lot of information,mainly from the other person's non-verbal communication. Tone ofvoice, posture and facial expression give clues about a person's emo-tional state; for example, someone introducing themselves in a grufftone of voice and with a frown on their face is likely to be perceived asirritable and ill at ease. Someone who is speaking in a warm tone andwith a smile on their face is thought to be welcoming and friendly. A person's appearance gives opportunities to make assumptions about their way of life, status, social position, health and self-esteem.A person who appears well groomed is assumed to think well enoughof themselves to make the effort to do this. However, appearances canbe misleading; for example, someone who is immaculately turned out may have made this effort because they place great signicance 108 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC08 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 108on what others think of them. Unlike many aspects of non-verbal communication, we can control aspects of our appearance. Dietitiansneed to consider the appropriateness of what they wear and how theypresent themselves to the patient group with which they are work-ing (Exercise 8.2). It is easier for the patient to accept the dietitian if the dietitian's appearance is appropriate to her role and ts thepatient's expectations. Many different aspects beside appearance areused in forming rst impressions, some of which are listed here (seeExercise 8.3): Age Gender Attitudes Intelligence Attractiveness (hairstyle, skintone, eyes, teeth) Opinions Personality Character The importance of any particular aspect varies from person to person and according to the situation; for example, attractiveness may bemost important at a party, whereas education and attitude may bemore important at a job interview.Developing a Framework 109 Exercise 8.2 Think about the effect of the 'white coat', the hallmark of a dietitian's professional status in the hospital environment. If you wear one, how doyou do this - casually or formally? Whether or not you wear a white coat,does your appearance represent who you are? Do you feel comfortablewith it? Have you been through your wardrobe recently? Do you throwaway or give away clothes you no longer wear or which no longer t your image, or do you hang on to them? Exercise 8.3 Think of a recent interview you have conducted with a new patient. When forming your rst impression, which aspects of the patient wereimportant to you? What aspects can you recall? What assumptions didyou make about this person?Physique - weight, height, posture Cultural background Possible occupation Education Temperament Financial status Voice.CSFC08 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 109First impressions are useful in predicting the behaviour of the other person and deciding on the way to behave in response. However, there are drawbacks. We may be influenced too much by one particu-lar aspect, for example attractiveness. When we attribute someonewith many of the characteristics of a particular type we treat them as astereotype. This leads us to expect people to behave in the same wayeach time. We also assign a status to the other person and to ourselves (Exercise 8.4). If we place someone in a higher status than ourselveswe may feel nervous. If we place someone in a lower status than our-selves we may patronise them. We are likely to treat the predictionsand assumptions we make as facts, forgetting that each person is aunique individual and therefore different from another. Once formed, rst impressions are difcult to change. Further information is used to reinforce our rst impression and we tend to dismiss any which is not consistent with this. As we become moreaware of the way in which we categorise people and the errors thatmay arise from doing this, we become more able to accept others asthey are rather than as we expect them to be. We can amend our con-cept of someone and add to it as we go along by keeping an open mindand assessing impressions continually. Letting go of rst impressionsallows us to relate with others moment to moment instead of relatingto our idea of how we think they should be. While the dietitian is forming a rst impression of her patient, they are forming a rst impression of her. A dietitian wanting to show afriendly attitude can do so by: adopting an open posture with uncrossed arms and legs; speaking in a soft tone of voice; smiling; making eye contact; leaning towards the other person; shaking hands. We nd it easier to accept a rst impression if it is appropriate to the situation and meets our expectations. The impression we generally110 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 8.4 In your interactions in the next 24 hours be aware of the status you assign to the other person and to yourself. In what way do you think thisaffects your communication with that person?CSFC08 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 110take away with us is an overall one based on several characteristics rather than on one in particular. However, if one aspect strikes us asout of place, for example appearance, then this is what will stay in ourminds. This is true of both patient and dietitian. Having paid attentionto the physical framework and focused on preparing mentally for theinterview, the dietitian needs to pay attention to specic tasks whichmake up the structural framework. Some of these will be familiar, for example taking a diet history. Less familiar may be processes such as contracting and monitoring the relationship. The way in which thedietitian communicates throughout plays a crucial part. The rst taskconcerns opening the interview. Opening the interview This stage sets the tone for what follows. Therefore how we meet, greetand introduce ourselves plays a signicant part in our rst impressionas described above and is further discussed in relation to transculturalcommunication in Chapter 11. The talk at the beginning of the interview usually involves social niceties or 'safe talk'. This includesintroductions, showing someone to their seat or enquiring about theirappointment. In social situations we use phrases such as 'How do you do?' as a way of greeting. We often ask 'How are you?' not reallyexpecting the other person to expound about their health but to reply'I'm all right', 'Fine', 'OK' or something similar. When those involveddo not make introductions clearly and condently the communica-tions which follow are more strained. The customary way of makingintroductions varies in different cultures and this is further exploredin Chapter 11. While getting seated, making the introductions and establishing how each of you want to be addressed both dietitian and patient willbe forming their rst impressions of each other. Usually the dietitianthen is the one to initiate conversation. The starting point for a rstmeeting is likely to be the doctor's referral or the previous time theDeveloping a Framework 111 Exercise 8.5 In the interview situation, what are the ways you introduce yourself and greet your patient? How do you feel when doing this? What informationare you assimilating during this safe talk period?CSFC08 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 111patient saw the dietitian. For a follow-up appointment the starting point is likely to be what has occurred for the patient since their lastvisit. The following are some suggestions: 'How can I help you?' 'I'm wondering how you feel about seeing a dietitian?' 'I'm wondering if this is the rst time you've been to see a dietitian?' 'I'm wondering what was your reaction when the doctor suggestedthat you see a dietitian?' 'How have you been since we last met?' These opening statements or questions are ways of inviting the patient to talk. As she listens the dietitian will be forming an idea about thepatient's motivation. The interview is now progressing to the middle stage. Middles Setting the agenda This important feature can easily be missed out because it has either notbeen considered or not made explicit. As a result the agenda of bothpatient and dietitian can remain hidden. Setting an agenda denes theinterview and makes its purpose clear. It is also a valuable opportunityto establish boundaries relating to time limits and condentiality. Thisis also the time to establish the reason for the patient's referral and theexpectations the patient has. It could also be an appropriate time toexplain how a change in diet can help the patient. Here are three waysof setting agendas, each one reflecting a different attitude and role ofthe dietitian.112 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 8.6 The following are four ways in which a patient replies to a dietitian's enquiry: 'The doctor said I should come to see you.' 'I've been waiting for an appointment to see you for a long time.' 'I saw a dietitian years ago but I can't remember much about it.' 'I've not been feeling too good since I last saw you.' Imagine yourself listening to each of these remarks. What are your thoughts and how would you respond to each.CSFC08 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 112Dietitian :(to a patient ) We have 20 minutes in which to discuss your diet. What I'd like to do is rst to weigh you and then go through what youusually have to eat to see if there are any alterations that need to be made. In the above example the dietitian establishes herself as the one in control. In the following example the dietitian invites the patient to set the agenda, reflecting an open approach which allows the patientto take control. Dietitian :(to a patient ) How can I help you? We have 20 minutes in which to talk and if we need longer we can arrange to meet again another time. A third option is to set the agenda together, which some dietitians may consider more appropriate at a follow-up appointment. In the follow-ing example the dietitian is including both herself and the patient and establishing a relationship in which she is willing for the control tobe shared. Dietitian : We have 20 minutes in which to talk and if we need longer we can arrange to meet again another time. Is there any particular aspect ofyour diet you would like to talk about? ( waits for answer ) Patient : Well . . . I'm wondering how I can keep to my diet when the rest of the family want different things to eat.Dietitian :(responds by reflecting ) You would like to discuss how you can t your diet in with the family. I'd like to go through your diet with you to get an idea of what you usually eat, ( stating her agenda ) so shall we begin by you telling me what you and the family usually have and then wecan see how this ts in for with your diet? ( making a suggestion ). Sometimes the dietitian may nd it is necessary to set her agenda completely on one side because the patient's needs are so obviouslynot concerned with diet. This occurs in the example illustrated in the next two sections in which the patient is concerned about herdaughter's marriage crisis. In such a situation the dietitian focuses onapplying her counselling skills while being aware of her boundariesDeveloping a Framework 113 Exercise 8.7 Imagine yourself conducting an interview with a patient. You have been asked to assess the diet of an overweight, middle-aged businessman with abnormal liver function tests, suggesting he has a high alcoholintake. What would be your agenda? How would you establish this with the patient? What boundaries would you establish and how would you do this? How would you demonstrate your understanding of thepatient's presenting concerns?CSFC08 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 113concerning time, role and condentiality. She is also assessing her patient's motivation to change her diet. Assessing motivation A patient's motivation to change their eating behaviour will fluctuatefrom time to time so that an assessment made at the initial meetingmay be different from that made at a later date. The patient's self-assessment and the assessment of the dietitian may be the same or different. When the patient's motivation is at a low ebb the dietitianmay think 'How can I motivate this person?' or 'What will motivate thisperson?'. She is likely to give advice and instruction (Chapter 1). Hertactics are likely to be persuasion and her method of communicationlikely to be manipulation. On the other hand she may wonder 'Howmotivated is this person?' and 'What is holding this person back fromchanging their diet?'. She is then more likely to attempt to understandthe patient from their frame of reference and will be endeavouring todemonstrate a person-centred approach. If she judges the relationshipbetween her and the patient to be secure enough, she may decide it is appropriate to ask the patient these questions directly. However, ifshe thinks to do so might jeopardise the helping relationship she is fostering, she may decide to express herself less inquisitively and moretentatively, for example by saying, 'I'm wondering what you think isholding you back from making (or maintaining) these changes in yourdiet.' The way in which the dietitian expresses herself can make thedifference between aiding or disabling the helping process (Chapter 6)and encouraging or discouraging motivation in the patient. In assessing motivation many dietitians nd it helpful to have in mind the framework for the phases of change (Prochaska & DiClemente1986) described in Chapter 4. The following example illustrates howa dietitian might apply this. Patient :( abruptly ) The doctor said I should come to see you but it's really a waste of your time.Dietitian :(assesses the patient is in the rst phase, i.e. 'not interested in making changes'. Decides to acknowledge this knowing that doing so is likely to lead to anexploration of other issues in the patient's life. She speaks calmly ) You don't understand why the doctor thinks it important that you make changes toyour diet? Or is it that you know what changes to make but have beennding it difcult to put them into practice?Patient :( impatiently ) Oh I know the doctor thinks I need to lose weight for my blood pressure. I've been on diets on and off for years. I know what I should do but going on a diet right now is just about the last thing I need!114 Counselling Skills for Dietitians CSFC08 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 114Dietitian :(registers the remark about a long struggle to lose weight, decides to respond to the stress implied in what has been said ) Changing your diet now would be adding to your stress?Patient : Absolutely! I've got enough on my plate coping with the grandchildren. Just when I thought I could have a bit of time for myself mydaughter leaves her husband and she and the kids land on my doorstep.(bursts into tears ). Thinking about what the patient has said and what she has expressed through her non-verbal communication the dietitian realises that thisinteraction has reinforced her assessment that her patient is not readyto make dietary changes at the present time. Many times, however,there is an incongruity between the verbal and the non-verbal com-munication so that the dietitian is not sure about her assessment. This is valuable to observe as it most probably reflects the patient'sambivalence about changing their diet. In the example described above the dietitian realises she now has several choices in the way she responds to what the patient has just said.She can either respond to the detail (the breakdown of the daughter'smarriage) thus inviting the patient to expand on this (which is verylikely to lead them into non-diet related areas beyond the role of thedietitian) or adopt an authoritative role (see 'Continuum of control' in Chapter 1) by drawing a line under what the patient has said anddeliberately focusing on the patient's diet; alternatively she can focuson another aspect of the interview framework which is making a con-tract as described in the next section. Making a contract Continuing the above interview the dietitian decides to make herpatient's present distress the priority. At the same time she realises she has limited time left for the interview and her responsibility as a dietitian is both to her patient and to the doctor who referred thepatient as well as to the other patients she has yet to see. Dietitian :(moves the tissues to within reach of the patient, focuses on the patient's distress and says gently ) Help yourself to tissues if you want some. (summarising the patient's last remarks ) You are nding you have a lot to cope with at the moment.Patient : Yes . . . too much . . . but I don't want to bother you. It's just that I can't see how I can follow a diet when it is all so chaotic at home. My daughter hardly eats a thing and the children want different things allthe time. . . . I haven't got time to think of me.Dietitian :(paraphrasing ) From what you're saying now doesn't seem a good time to change your diet when you and your family are already copingDeveloping a Framework 115CSFC08 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 115with big changes. ( sharing what is in her mind ) I'm wondering if your doctor knows how you feel about changing your diet when you have these prob-lems at home?Patient : . . . He's given me some pills to take for my blood pressure and he wants to see me in two weeks. Do you think I should tell him?Dietitian :(states her position ) The doctor will expect me to let him know I have discussed your diet with you. I can say that you came to see me, youwere feeling very stressed due to a change in family circumstances and didnot feel able to make major changes to your diet at the moment. ( puts options for action ) Then you can decide when you next see him if you want to tell him about it. Or if you want me to I can give him the details. Whichwould you prefer?Patient :( sounding relieved ) Oh I like the rst idea. Then I can decide because things may have changed when I next see him. Do I come and seeyou again?Dietitian :(invites the patient to choose ) Would you like to? Patient : Perhaps when things have settled down at home and I can think about my diet. It's just so difcult at the moment. I feel better havingtold you a bit about it. I know we have to get things sorted. My daughter isseeing a solicitor this week. It's early days but we'll get through it somehow.Dietitian :(clarifying the patient's preferred option ) So would you like me to ask the doctor to refer you again when you want some help with your diet?Patient : Yes please and thank you for your help. In the process of contracting with the patient the dietitian has: summarised what has been said so far; accurately identied the patient's presenting concerns; formulated and discussed goals or the course of action; handled questions; made arrangements about a further meeting. When a patient has a greater motivation to change their diet than in the example above, the task of making a contract is likely to come at alater stage, for example after a discussion about diet. Taking a diet history Asking a patient what they usually eat and investigating the frequencyof food consumption is a very familiar part of the dietetic interview.Although it is convenient in many ways to use the standard format of starting at the beginning of the day and working logically througheach mealtime, checking amounts, portion sizes and preparation ofdishes, it does presume that all patients will t into this pattern. Thedietitian is likely to phrase her remarks to encourage the patient to116 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC08 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 116conform with what is expected. The following is an example from an interview which demonstrates this. Dietitian : First of all I need to know what you usually have to eat. What did you have for breakfast yesterday for example?Patient : Oh, just a bowl of cereal. Nothing much. Dietitian : Nothing else? What do you have for lunch? Patient : Yesterday I had bread and cheese. Dietitian : Do you usually have that? Patient : No, not always. It depends. Sometimes I have a sandwich or soup. Something like that.Dietitian : And in the evening. What did you have for your main meal? Patient : Mm . . . let me see . . . a pizza. That's what I had yesterday. In practice additional questions concerning the type of cereal the patient eats, whether they take sugar and the amount of milk used, arelikely to be asked. If we examine the interactions we notice that thedietitian has set her agenda at the beginning and established herself as the one in charge by saying what she needs from the interview. She follows this with a question which reinforces this. The patientadopts the position of someone who is being interrogated. A series of direct questions follows (Chapter 7) and short replies which offerlittle apart from the information directly asked for. In the followingextract reflective responding is used (Chapter 6). Dietitian : I'd like you to tell me about the food you usually eat. You might nd the easiest way is to recall what you had yesterday.Patient : Yesterday . . . . . oh yes I had a pizza. Dietitian : A pizza. Patient : Yes . . . and garlic bread. And a bottle of wine. You see I went out with some friends in the evening. It was someone's birthday.Dietitian : So yesterday you went out for a pizza in the evening as you were celebrating someone's birthday.Patient : Yes. I had that quite late - about 9. Usually I eat about 7, as soon as I get in from work. I'm really hungry by then as I only have a sand-wich at lunch time.Dietitian : You normally have a sandwich for lunch and your evening meal at about 7.Patient : Yes - and I always have breakfast. Cereal and toast you know. . . .Dietitian : So your usual pattern is to have cereal and toast for breakfast, a sandwich for lunch and your main meal in the evening. In this interview the dietitian again focuses on the agenda at the begin- ning but this time includes the patient ('I would like you to tell me aboutthe food you usually have to eat'). She invites the patient to take charge('Y ou might nd the easiest way is to recall what you had yesterday').The patient initially replies in the same way as in the previous extract,Developing a Framework 117CSFC08 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 117but instead of questioning the patient, the dietitian responds by reflect- ing a key word ('pizza') which the patient has said. The dietitian responds by paraphrasing and summarising content or meaning (Chapter 6). This results in the patient replying more fullyand the dietitian gaining more information, e.g. yesterday being unusual(a celebration evening meal), the patient's eating habits (hungry whengets in from work) and problem ('I only have a sandwich at lunch time').At this point the dietitian has a choice: to reflect the patient's hungeror to focus on the topic in hand (taking a diet history). She chooses thelatter and summarises the meals described so far ('Y ou normally havea sandwich for lunch and your evening meal at about 7'). The patientthen completes the inventory by talking about breakfast and the dietitianconcludes by summarising the meal pattern. In recent times meal patterns for many people have become less structured. Snacking throughout the day seems to be more commonand it is probably more difcult for patients who do this to recall whatthey have eaten. The dietitian who uses reflective responding ratherthan direct questioning to encourage her patient to remember what theyhave eaten is, arguably, more likely to obtain accurate information.However, others may feel under pressure of time constraints and decideto ask a series of direct closed questions about food intake. They trustthat their relationship with the patient is sufciently well establishedby the time they come to take a dietary history that this method willnot hinder the helping process. However, when taking a diet history isled by the dietitian she will not know what additional information mayhave been disclosed if instead this had been led by the patient. Dietitians who are familiar with asking short, direct questions in order to obtain specic information as quickly as possible in a struc-tured format, may consider that accuracy of information is sacricedwhen not using this approach. On the other hand asking a lot of directquestions risks damaging the communication (Bolton 1986), as patientswho feel interrogated are more likely to give answers they think areexpected rather than an honest reply.118 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 8.8 When you next take a diet history focus your attention on the questions you ask and the remarks you make. Look for occasions when you askleading questions or expect a particular response. You may want to recordyourself taking a diet history so that you can play it back and listenclosely. (Be sure to ask the patient if this is alright with them, explainingto them that you are doing it for your professional development.)CSFC08 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 118Giving dietary advice Dietitians have become more aware in recent years of the impact of professionally presented leaflets and diet sheets. These are usuallyused as a substitute for the spoken word or to reinforce what has beendiscussed. The image that dietitians present is reflected in the writtenmaterial they use. Through the spoken and written word the dietitianaims to help people modify their diets. She makes suggestions forimprovement, explains to patients what they can eat without restriction,what they must avoid eating and what they can eat in moderation. She suggests, advises, informs and instructs. She does this throughdirect consultations and written material. Referring to the continuumof control described in Chapter 1, these methods demonstrate thedietitian's authority. When communicating in these ways, it is import-ant that she is aware of the pitfalls described below. Lecturing One of the main ways in which dietitians gain information themselves is by attending lectures. Qualied dietitians are expected to give lecturesto student nurses and others. Lecturing is therefore a familiar way ofgiving and receiving information. It is hardly surprising therefore thatdietitians, often without realising it, give their patients mini-lectures.Although lecturing is one way to give a lot of information to a largenumber of people in a short space of time, it is not an effective way to facilitate learning on an individual basis. When being lectured thelistener is not involved and so may feel 'talked at' rather than 'talkedto'. Concentration span is quickly exceeded. Once this happens thelistener feels overwhelmed and confused and stops listening. When the dietitian is fully involved in giving information she is unlikely to notice her patient's non-verbal signals. If she were to notice shemight interpret these as a sign that she should repeat or re-emphasiseher point. In this way she is encouraged to continue with her 'lecture'.She has much knowledge herself and wants to fully inform her patient.She does not want to be guilty of omitting anything which could jeopardise the patient's health. In her efforts to ensure she fulls herobligation to inform her patient, she may overlook the fact that thepatient is not understanding and has stopped listening. Jargon Another pitfall is using scientic language when talking to a patient. Dietitians accumulate a vast amount of professional language, as doDeveloping a Framework 119CSFC08 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 119all professions. Some of this becomes familiar to those outside the profession and is incorporated into everyday vocabulary. For examplemany terms specic to the computer industry are used nowadays in a general context. Although 'calories' is a term used in everyday lan-guage, it is doubtful if many of those using it know what it means technically. Similarly, metric units of measurement used by dietitiansmay not be understood by the patient. Although dietitians may realisethis, they may not always be aware of when they slip into such lan-guage. Mirroring the language used by the patient is a way in which the dietitian can ensure she is using language which her patient understands(Chapter 6). Using 'we' and 'I' By using simple words such as 'we' rather than 'I' dietitians can set themselves apart from the patient and add power to their position.The collective 'we' implies the backing of all dietitians. It can also implythe agreement of the medical profession and so carry great weight.The effect on the patient is that they feel outnumbered and over-powered by a large authoritative body. The following is an example of using the collective 'we': Patient : How much can I have? Dietitian : A small amount would be all right. We don't want you to do without altogether but you need to restrict the amount you have. As thedoctor said, your blood levels are on the high side and we know that peoplewho eat too much fat are at greater risk. Here the dietitian is using the collective 'we' to effectively distance herself from the patient. This is probably not what she intends. Shemay want to add weight to her point of view if she is unsure of herground or if she thinks the information is not what the patient wantsto hear. By using the collective 'we' the dietitian identies herself as amember of a larger group. In doing so she reassures herself but separatesherself from her patient, which contradicts any previous attempts tocreate rapport. On hearing the collective 'we' the patient is likely tofeel confused thinking that the dietitian who appeared friendly andhelpful now seems cooler and more distant. The following exampleshows this in practice. Patient : That's helpful what you've said but when I get in from work I'm really hungry.Dietitian : You could have more to eat for lunch. We have evidence that regular meals help people to stop nibbling.Patient :( keeps silent )120 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC08 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 120When the dietitian uses reflective responding the effect changes as shown here. Patient : That's helpful what you've said but when I get in from work I'm really hungry.Dietitian : By the time you get home you're very hungry. Patient : Yes, very. It's a long time since lunch. Maybe I ought to have more then or a snack during the afternoon. Using reflective responding the dietitian has acknowledged the patient's problem, and the patient feels understood and so is encouraged tocome up with ideas of his own. The relationship between patient anddietitian is built on co-operation rather than on the position of anexpert giving advice to someone who is ignorant. Risky responses Failure to make desired changes in eating behaviour is often ascribed, by both patient and dietitian, to lack of willpower on the part of thepatient. The dietitian may encourage, admonish, reassure or challengethe patient in order to achieve compliance. Certain responses carry a greater risk than others of blocking further communication and creating defensive behaviour on the part of the patient (Chapter 5).Suggesting, advising, informing and instructing carry a considerablerisk of being authoritative rather than facilitative. As a result thepatient is likely to make changes to please the dietitian or doctor, ratherthan feeling empowered to do so for their own well-being. The patient who follows the dietitian's suggestions and instructions because they have been told to do so, is likely to feel fearful of incurringthe dietitian's disapproval or hopeful of receiving her approval at theirnext visit. The patient may protect themselves from disapproval anddisappointment by saying something such as 'I know I haven't donevery well. I expect you'll tell me off.' The dietitian is effectively dis-armed and is likely to respond by reassuring the patient. Communica-tion is indirect and ultimately dissatisfying to both. Patients may also invite the dietitian to take responsibility for solv- ing their problems. Remarks such as 'But what can I do?' and 'I knowyou'll be able to tell me what I should do', are examples. The dietitianresponds by giving suggestions and advice and may nd that there is no further difculty. On the other hand the patient may respondwith remarks such as, 'I've tried that and it didn't work' and 'I thoughtyou could sort me out'. The dietitian then comes up with differentideas only to nd these meet with similar responses. An alternative isDeveloping a Framework 121CSFC08 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 121for the dietitian to apply a person-centred approach as shown in the example below. Dietitian : Your blood tests show you have a raised level of cholesterol. Changing your diet may help to bring this down. How do you feel aboutdoing this?Patient : Well, I'll give it a go if you think it will help. Dietitian :(reflecting ) You'll change your diet if this is going to help your health?Patient : Yes, but does it mean cutting out a lot? Dietitian :(giving information ) It means being careful about the amount and type of fat in your diet.Patient : Oh I don't eat much fat - my wife sees to that. Can I have a list of what I mustn't have, to give to her?Dietitian :(meeting patient's request ) This leaflet shows you foods which contain a lot of fat as well as those which do not contain any. It also explainswhich ones to eat in moderate amounts.Patient : Thank you. ( takes leaflet and glances at it ) There seems a lot here. Can't you just tell me what I should do?Dietitian :(reflecting ) It's a lot to take in at a glance . . . I think it will become clearer if we go through it together. Monitoring the relationship The effect of using reflective responding shows most clearly in the nature of the relationship that is being established. By using reflectiveresponding the dietitian does not imply her own judgements and this allows the patient to reply more openly and explain their diet in a way that makes sense to them. A relationship is formed in which co-operation can occur. Although this may seem more demanding of the dietitian, the rela- tionship with the patient is more likely to be one in which the patientfeels valued and respected and encouraged to talk openly and honestly.This is something for the dietitian to be aware of throughout the inter-view. By monitoring the relationship the dietitian will be more awareof issues, such as dependency and transference (Chapter 3), and somore able to manage these before they inhibit the work in progress.122 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 8.9 What is your response to reading the example above? How does this differ from your standard way of giving dietary advice?CSFC08 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 122The following extract is an example of when the dietitian recognises that her patient is becoming overly dependent on her. Patient : I don't know how I'll manage when I'm no longer able to come and see you. You keep me on the right track.Dietitian :(lightly acknowledges appreciation ) Thank you. I'm glad you have found our sessions helpful. ( shares her concern ) I'm a bit concerned though when I hear you say you don't know how you'll manage withoutthese appointments. ( questions reality of her patient's thinking ) Is that what you really think?Patient : Well I suppose I'll cope but it won't be the same without you to tell me off when I've gained weight. ( gives a small laugh ). Dietitian :(reflecting key words ) Tell you off! ( drawing on previous work ) As we've discussed before I think you're quick to do that yourself! ( both laugh and dietitian has a sense that the relationship has shifted to being moreequal ). Patient : Yes I know. But it won't be the same on my own. Dietitian :(acknowledges reality in patient's remark ) No it won't be the same. Maybe there are other ways you could get some support so you don'tfeel so alone? In asking this last question the dietitian opens up the possibility for the patient to gain a different perspective on her situation. In other wordsshe is inviting her patient to work at Stage 2 of the helping process(Egan 2004). Tracking the helping process Using Egan's model can be helpful when monitoring the relationship. As described in Chapter 4, the helping process (Egan 2004) can bebroken down into three stages: Stage 1 - listening to the patient's story and identifying the problem(s) Stage 2 - clarifying what the patient wants Stage 3 - ways to achieve goals. The dietitian who has these stages in mind as the interview progresses is able to track where she and her patient are in this process. This canhelp her manage her anxiety about having insufcient time. Many dietitians feel stressed when they need to give the patient information but the patient seems unable to listen. This can result inthe dietitian repeating advice, focusing on solving problems, settinggoals and planning strategies before the patient is ready to engage with this. From the patient's perspective he may think he has not beenfully understood or had enough time to tell the dietitian about his Developing a Framework 123CSFC08 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 123circumstances. The dietitian is working at Stage 3 and the patient is at Stage 1 in the helping process. When the dietitian identies this and concentrates on using her skills of active listening and reflectiveresponding to help her focus on the patient's needs she will discoverthat the outcome becomes more satisfying to both. She will then beable to tailor her dietary advice more accurately and the patient willexperience being more accepted and respected. As a result the patientwill be more able to assimilate the dietary advice given. In other wordsthe patient will be more ready to work at Stage 3 of the helping processwhen the dietitian has been able to work with him through Stages 1and 2. Endings Closing the interview The reader is advised to read this section in conjunction with the sections on 'When, how and where to refer' and 'How to end' inChapter 4. Closing the interview will take a matter of minutes whenthe interview that has taken place is the only meeting. However, ifpatient and dietitian have been meeting for a series of appointmentsthe dietitian will need longer to prepare for ending, for example one ifnot two meetings. Acknowledging the ending Acknowledging the closing of each interview is the responsibility of the dietitian. She needs to nd a way of remarking that it is time todraw the interview to a close. For example she may say 'I'm aware weneed to nish in ve minutes' or 'Time is running out for us - we willneed to stop in a few minutes.' Although the number of appointmentswill have been discussed at the contracting stage it is important thatthe dietitian refers to the fact that their work together is coming to anend before the last appointment rather than assume that the patient recalls this. In addition it is helpful to acknowledge at the penultimateappointment that they have one more planned and to acknowledge atthe start of the last meeting that this is their last appointment. People react in different ways to an ending. Some will feel a need to hurry up, to get in as much as possible in the time remaining and mayelaborate on what they have already said or even broach new topics;others may stop abruptly as though they need to leave immediately.124 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC08 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 124Inviting a patient to talk about their reaction can lead to helpful dis- closures. For example a dietitian could say 'I'm wondering if you thinkyou've had enough time or whether you need more?' or 'I'm not sure ifyou feel relieved or maybe anxious about this being our last appoint-ment? A patient may then share concerns about managing without the support of the dietitian in which case the dietitian needs to allowtime to explore these concerns with her patient. Summarising what has taken place This fulls the function of clarifying and reinforcing what their work together has been about and it is particularly valuable for the patient ifthey can do this for themselves. The dietitian can encourage the patientby asking what they have found helpful, what they will be putting into practice, what difculties they think they will nd in the future.These questions are likely to yield information and further questionsfor discussion so the dietitian needs to allow adequate time for this to occur. If the patient nds self-acknowledgement too difcult thedietitian can summarise what she thinks the patient has learned fromtheir work together and this provides encouragement and afrmationfor the patient. Giving this in a way that is not patronising requires the dietitian to examine her attitude to her patient, her ability to behonest and genuine in sharing her thoughts and her skill in focusingon specic behaviour (Chapters 6, 14 and 15). What next? In helping the patient to clarify how they will manage in the future the dietitian may want to refer to previous discussions about resourcesand support available. She may want to discuss other sources of pro-fessional help and the reader is recommended to read the guidelines inthe section on referral in Chapter 4. When clarifying what she herselfor her dietetic department can offer by way of ongoing support sheneeds to give detailed information about how the patient can makecontact in the future. This stage is important for the patient to feelsupported. It also conrms for the dietitian and the patient that theirwork together is drawing to a close. This can be particularly difcultfor the dietitian who undervalues the help she has given and for thepatient whose needs have not been met. Both will feel pressure tomake further appointments. The dietitian needs to be aware of herown motives when offering a follow-up appointment. The followingquestions are useful to consider:Developing a Framework 125CSFC08 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 125How practical is a further appointment for the patient and for myself ? Will I be seeing the patient or is it likely to be another dietitian? DoI explain this to the patient? Am I offering this because the patient wants to come back? Orbecause I do not want to let go? How do I offer another appointment? Do I say 'I'd like to see youagain' or do I ask 'Would you like to come again?' If we agree to another appointment how do we decide when this is to be? Is the patient aware of the system for making/cancellingappointments? Are they reliable or likely to cancel or not attend? What will be the purpose of a further appointment? Can this beclaried? With full caseloads it is more and more important for this process of closure to be managed in a mutually fullling way. Saying goodbye When a fullling helping relationship has been established saying goodbye can be difcult. Neither may want to do this and each maywait for the other to take the lead. Conversely one may want to end it quickly and the other may be left with an unsatisfactory feeling ofincompletion. As explained in Chapter 4, endings can arouse intenseanxiety especially when the relationship established has been of somedepth and meaning to each person. In a dietetic context terminationof a working contract with a patient cannot always be planned andthere may be no opportunity to complete their work together. Forexample a dietitian may have been seeing a terminally ill patient over aconsiderable period of time and the ending of their appointments mayoccur because of the patient's death. Frequently the ending may occurdue to the discharge from hospital of patients before the dietitian hashad a chance to see them. In outpatient settings it is more likely to be because the patient stops attending appointments or the dietitianmoves to another area of work. Unsatisfactory endings as well as prob-lematic interviews are times when it is valuable for the dietitian to beable to review her work in a structured way either on her own, with acolleague or with a supervisor/mentor (Chapter 15). After the interview When reviewing an interview with a colleague many dietitians nd itdifcult to stay focused. The colleague may want to know more about126 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC08 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page and question the dietitian about the patient's circum- stances which raises issues about condentiality. The dietitian maywant to consider how she can describe her patient accurately while not revealing identity details, for example not referring to a patient byname or else using a pseudonym. Dietitian and colleague may recallother similar cases or nd themselves having a generalised discussionabout related issues. When they get sidetracked in this way their timetogether is likely to come to a hurried close with both feeling some-what dissatised. Table 8.2 provides a framework to help the dietitianstay focused when reviewing an interview and is designed to be usedin addition to any data about dietary information.Developing a Framework 127 Table 8.2 Review of a dietetic interview. Identity details Who is my patient? E.g. male/female, age Health history What is their current health like?What is their medical history?Does the patient appear to have any mental health problems?

As the dietitian What were my concerns?What did I nd satisfying about this interview(s)?What have I learned about myself as a result of my work with this patient?CSFC08 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 127In thinking through an interview in this way the dietitian can monitor the relationship between herself and the patient and can increase thelikelihood of providing a relationship which is helpful to the patientand rewarding for herself.

Loss of self-esteemLoss of health - living underthreat of death Loss of appetite Support for the patient and the dietitian How loss concerns dietitians Dietitians frequently encounter patients who are suffering loss of some kind. This chapter aims to help their understanding of the processthey are dealing with, both within themselves and their patients, andoffers some practical suggestions for them to consider. The subject ofloss is not an easy one to reflect on and the reader may feel uncomfort-able at times. She may prefer to take her time in reading this chapter,possibly coming back to it at a later date. Loss and gain are integral parts of any change (Marris 1992) and for a change to take place effectively we need to mourn the losses andacknowledge the gains. Exercise 9.1 is designed to increase the reader'sawareness of losses and gains that they have recently experienced.CSFC09 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 129There are times when the gains associated with a change clearly outweigh the losses. When this happens we think of the change as adesirable one and feel pleasure and satisfaction when we realise thebenets that result. When a change occurs in which the losses out-weigh the gains we think of the change as 'bad' and are likely to feel sad,depressed, angry and powerless. In adjusting to loss we go through aprocess of bereavement and although this is usually associated withdeath, the bereavement process occurs when adjusting to any loss. Those in ill-health suffer a loss of their natural healthy state. The loss may be for a short period before health is regained, as in acute illness, or the loss may necessitate an adjustment to living with achronic condition. Some patients may nd their loss particularly dif-cult to deal with as the change in their health may raise psychologicalissues as well as practical problems. The following are examples ofsome of the losses which dietitians are likely to encounter in theirpatients: loss of health and well-being; loss of a limb following amputation; loss of mobility after a stroke; loss of function as a result of disease (e.g. loss of heart function dueto coronary heart disease); loss of appetite; loss of weight. Other losses may coincide or occur as a result of any of the above. For example, patients may lose their job because of ill health and relationships may break down under the strain of ill health. A patient130 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 9.1 Think over the past 12 months and write down events that have happened to you, e.g. change of job, moving house. Write these downunder one of two headings - gains or losses. For example 'new job' may be a gain. Now write down a loss associated with each gain, forexample 'no longer have A as a colleague' could be a loss associated with 'new job'. Similarly with each event in the 'loss' column note again. For example, a loss might be 'no longer working in paediatrics'and a gain that has occurred as a result of moving into another eldmight be 'I am widening my experience'. Be aware of how you feel as you do this exercise. It is useful to do it with a partner so that you can talk about the process. Use the opportunity to practise your skills at active listening.CSFC09 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 130may feel overwhelmed by the loss of home and family and may suffer considerable loss of self-esteem. When confronted with another's loss we often feel anxious and unsure about what to say or do. We may want to help the other person, yet be concerned lest what we say results in them becoming moreupset. We may fear becoming upset ourselves. In the face of our ownanxiety and the other person's distress, we often give reassurance inthe hope that we will both then feel better. As shown in Chapter 6, the way in which we give reassurance can carry a considerable risk ofcreating a barrier in the relationship between two people. The need to grieve Grieving is a necessary and natural process that we undergo when wesuffer a loss. We feel a sense of loss when the attachment we have formedfor someone or something is broken. Psychiatrist John Bowlby (1997,1998, 2004) has written extensively on the subject of attachment and loss. Loss arouses intense anxiety. Grieving is about resolving the conflicts between wanting things to be as they were before the loss occurred and wanting to move forward to continue with our lives. We have a compulsion to preserve the continuity in our lives (Marris1992), and when a change occurs we suffer a break in this continuity.During the period of grieving we struggle to make sense of our loss, to give it meaning and to regain our sense of continuity. In order forthis internal process to take place we need: to be cared for, e.g. to have food provided; to talk about the loss; to have someone to listen; to have time alone; to be accepted the way we are and not to feel that others disapprove. Identifying and expressing feelings is one of the tasks of grieving (Worden 2003), and in offering a patient the opportunity to talk abouttheir loss the dietitian is demonstrating her willingness to help. In the way she listens and responds, the dietitian can make a signicant contribution to a patient's healing process. Culturally it is often not acceptable to show our grief openly and so we may deny it or try to hide it. When denial and suppression are prolonged, we suffer long-term emotional pain and stress. Those in the caring professions who can recognise grief and can support,rather than reassure, someone through the period of adapting to loss(mourning) are providing skilled and needed help.Loss and Bereavement 131CSFC09 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 131Our reactions to grief We become attached to people, places and objects of all kinds and the more signicant the attachment the greater our sense of loss whenthis is broken. Our reactions to loss are individual and unique. Weexperience a profusion of feelings and physical sensations. Confusionis one of the major sources of stress accompanying a bereavement. We may behave in irrational and atypical ways that alarm us and thosearound us, and we may experience a loss of control. Our reactionsmay be immediate or they may be delayed depending upon the level of shock we experience. Exercise 9.2 is designed to increase the reader's awareness of her own thoughts, feelings and actions in response to a loss. The process of grieving Elizabeth Kubler-Ross (2005) in her work with the dying, identied a pattern of denial, anger, bargaining and depression experienced bythose who are bereaved, before they reach an acceptance of their loss. Someone who has at rst denied the loss (e.g. 'It's not true') will experience times of intense anger (e.g. 'It's all the doctor's fault') andwill make bargains in an attempt to redress the loss (e.g. 'If I try reallyhard from now on it will be all right'). In the next moment they maydeny again that the loss has occurred (e.g. 'I just don't believe it'). Dietitians supporting someone through a loss need to remember that this is a normal process. The bereaved person is likely to feel con-fused and may indicate that they think they are going mad, such is the welter of thoughts and feelings they suffer. It can be helpful to betold that such thoughts are normal and acceptable. People suffering132 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 9.2 Take a sheet of paper and divide it into three sections. Head one section 'Feelings', another 'Thoughts' and the third 'Behaviour'. Now think ofsomething you have recently mislaid or lost, such as a book. List yourthoughts and feelings and the actions you took at the time. For example: Feeling Thought Behaviour Puzzled 'Where's it with tearsMiserable 'I'll never it back' Sit with head in handsCSFC09 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 132loss who are told to 'snap out of it' or 'pull themselves together' are hindered in their grieving and may be prevented from working throughthe process. Those who have not been allowed to complete their griev-ing and who get stuck in the process suffer long-term physical andemotional distress. The process of grieving is one of considerablestress and disturbances in sleep patterns and eating behaviour, andmisuse of drugs and alcohol may occur. How the dietitian can help A dietitian who has an understanding of bereavement, an ability torecognise the different aspects of the process and the necessary skillsin listening can provide invaluable help to a patient who is grieving. A dietitian can learn to: recognise various reactions to grief; provide the core conditions of empathy, acceptance and genuineness; listen actively (attending, reflective responding); provide practical care as appropriate; offer practical information about professional support, e.g. nationalor local branch of Cruse (see Appendix 2). Here are some tips which will support someone who is bereaved (adapted from information from Cruse Bereavement Care): Let your genuine concern and care show. Be available to listen or to help with whatever seems needed at the time. Say you are sorry about what has happened and that they are suffering pain. Allow them to express as much unhappiness as they want to share. Encourage them to be patient and not expect too much of themselves. Allow them to talk about their loss as much and as often as theywant to. They won't have forgotten their loss so there is no need toavoid mentioning it. Talk about the special endearing qualities of what they have lost. Let them know that they have done everything they could. A dietitian may feel helpless when faced with a patient's distress and may tell herself that she cannot help. This thought may stop her reach-ing out and her discomfort may mean she avoids talking about thepatient's loss. For the patient who is bereaved, the avoidance adds painto an already painful experience. In an effort to be helpful the dietitianLoss and Bereavement 133CSFC09 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 133may say that she understands how the patient feels. This is likely to produce an angry response as shown in the following example. Patient :( talking about recent death of husband ) I just can't be bothered to cook for myself. It was different when he was alive; I had a reason to do itthen. Nowadays I'm just not hungry.Dietitian :(in a sympathetic tone of voice ) I know how you feel. Patient :( angrily ) How can you know - you're not me. You can't possibly understand. The dietitian can demonstrate her empathy more effectively by reflecting, as shown here. Patient :( talking about recent death of husband ) I just can't be bothered to cook for myself. It was different when he was alive; I had a reason to do itthen. Nowadays I'm just not hungry.Dietitian : Since your husband died you feel it's all too much effort to cook for yourself, especially when you have no appetite.Patient : Yes, that's it. I'm worried about my weight - I've lost a lot since Bill went. Those who are bereaved do not want to be judged, told what they should do or how they should feel. The following remarks are typicalof ones that are well meant but unhelpful. 'Y ou ought to be feeling better by now.' 'In time you can always have another. . . .''Just think of all the things you have. . . .''It doesn't do to dwell on it.''Just put it all behind you now and get on with life.''Perhaps if you had/hadn't done. . . .''At least you've got. . . .' Loss of weight - a loss or a gain? Helping someone to lose excess weight forms a large part of the work of most dietitians. Weight loss, when perceived as desirable, isthought of as something to be gained. Achieving the target weight isseen as a goal to aim for and is often used as a means of encouragingthe patient. Both patient and dietitian may discount the existence ofthe losses and may focus on the gains associated with a reduction inweight. Acknowledging the losses helps the patient feel understood,supported and more motivated to follow the dietary advice. Some losses associated with a reduction in weight are more obvious and easier to talk about than others, for example the loss of a wardrobe134 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC09 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 134as clothes which have been comfortable no longer t. Less clear and more difcult to talk about is the loss of identity and security the patientmay feel as her body becomes less familiar. Anxiety associated with lossmay lead a patient to eat more. Changes in body weight may involve a psychologically demanding change in self-image. Issues concerningthe patient's relationship to food, herself and other people can evokeintense anxiety and psychological pain, resulting in internal conflictand ambivalence about following dietary advice. Working with those ineating distress is covered more fully in the section on eating disordersin Chapter 12. The dietitian who is aware that underlying issues arelikely to contribute to her patient's inability to lose weight is in a posi-tion to be more empathic. She may want to offer information aboutother sources of help (Chapter 4). In helping a patient to explore their concerns, the dietitian may nd herself examining her own relationship to food and her body. Her own difculties may make it hard for her to offer her patient thecore conditions of empathy, acceptance and genuineness. Awarenessof her difculties may lead her to consider professional help for herself(Chapter 15). Loss of self-esteem When we lose something or someone to whom we have been attached,we may feel cut adrift and uncertain. A sense of loss of direction mayaccompany feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy. The patientwho has lost self-condence is likely to seek reassurance in a numberof ways, such as: 'Y ou do think I'm doing all right, don't you?' 'I'm not taking up too much of your time, am I?' 'I don't want to be a nuisance.' 'I'm not really worth bothering with.' 'Y ou've got better things to do than see me.' It is not easy to respond to these remarks except by agreeing or deny- ing what has been said. The dietitian may give the expected answerbecause she thinks not to do so would be hurtful, yet in assuring the patient she is not a nuisance, is not taking up too much time and so on, the dietitian may feel irritated, resentful or annoyed. There are various ways in which the dietitian can respond, which afrm the patient's self-worth instead of reinforcing their low self-esteem.Each of the following examples relates to the corresponding remarkabove:Loss and Bereavement 135CSFC09 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 135'I think you are coping with a difcult time in the way you know best.' 'We have 20 minutes together and if you would like more time we can arrange that.' 'I want to help you in whatever way I can.' 'I think you are undervaluing yourself.' 'Talking with you is what I am interested in right now.' Loss of health - living under threat of death Two fundamental questions which concern patients facing terminalillness are 'How can I live with this?' and 'How long have I got?'. Com-ing to terms with living with their condition for an indenite period andconfronting their mortality is a more harrowing process for some thanothers. Grief may take many forms, including childish and aggressivebehaviour. The dietitian who understands the nature of the grievingprocess is likely to feel less anxious and more able to be empathic. Inthe following example the dietitian demonstrates this. Patient :( angrily ) I suppose you're going to tell me what I've got to eat and what I shouldn't have any more. Well, you'll be wasting your time . . . it'sall a waste of time. I don't know how much longer I've got - maybe a fewmonths, maybe a few years. ( his voice breaks, he stops speaking and looks down at his hands which are clasped tightly together. The dietitian maintains her eye contactbut does not say anything. She is aware of feeling scared and thinking 'What do I do'? The patient gives a sigh and instinctively she reaches out and puts her handover his. After a moment he looks up and she notices his eyes are lled with tears ). Dietitian :(speaking quietly ) It's all getting too much. Patient :( taking a deep breath ) I won't let it get me down. I'm not beaten yet . . . ( and . . maybe they're wrong about the diagnosis - it's happened before. ( gives her a weak grin ). Dietitian :(aware she is mirroring his facial expression and feeling warmth and compassion towards him, removes her hand still maintaining eye contact andnot speaking ). Patient :( speaking after a few moments silence, in normal voice ) What was it you wanted to tell me?Dietitian : I came to talk to you about the foods and drinks that will nourish you most. We can do that now or would you prefer another time? Loss of appetite Loss of health may lead to a signicant loss of weight, as occurs in patients with anorexia nervosa, cancers, acquired immune deciencysyndrome (AIDS), debilitating chronic diseases and post-surgical con-ditions. In preventing further weight loss the dietitian uses her skills136 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC09 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 136and resources to encourage the patient to eat suitable food and drinks. Her aim is to ensure the patient consumes an adequate energy intakedespite a lack of appetite and apathy or antipathy towards eating. Whenencouragement to eat has no effect the dietitian may resort to persua-sion ('Just try to eat a little'), the use of threats ('If you don't eat you'llget even weaker') and giving orders ('Y ou must drink this with eachmeal'). As she increases her pressure anxiety develops between herselfand the patient, creating a barrier in her relationship with the patient(Chapter 6). When the dietitian's aim (to increase a patient's energy intake) is in opposition to the patient (who has no desire to eat), the dietitian'sability to provide acceptance is tested. If she is unable to accept how thepatient is thinking and feeling she cannot demonstrate her understand-ing (be empathic) and cannot provide the core conditions necessary in a helping relationship. She can extend her ability to provide the coreconditions by gaining more understanding of the process her patientis going through. As a result the patient feels more understood andmore able to co-operate. Patient and dietitian will then be workingtogether to nd a means whereby the patient's needs can best be met,as shown in the following example in which the dietitian focuses onusing reflective responding (Chapter 6). Dietitian : I have been thinking about what you told me yesterday - that you don't feel like eating or drinking anything at the moment. Trying topersuade you when you don't feel like it doesn't seem very helpful. I wantto help . . . I'm wondering what I can do for you?Patient :( in flat tone of voice ) . no-one can help. There's nothing anyone can do to help? Patient :( again in a dull, lifeless tone ) No-one can put the clock back. Dietitian : You'd like to be able to go back to how things were? Patient :( almost angrily ) Well . . . it'd be a lot better than what's ahead of me. How can I manage now?Dietitian :(calmly ) You're worried about how you are going to cope. Patient :( angrily ) Too right I am. I've lost my job, I'm a semi-invalid now - what sort of future is that?Dietitian :(calmly ) It seems you've lost such a lot and you feel angry about that.Patient :( in a plaintive tone everything's changed. as though everything's changed; ( asks in a questioning tone ) that nothing is the same as before? Patient :( doubtfully ) Well . . . one thing that's not changed - my daughter still visits - she comes whenever she can.Dietitian :(calmly ) That means a lot to you, doesn't it. We could talk again tomorrow if you would like to?Patient :( in normal tone ) Yes, I'd like that. You seem to understand and I will try to eat a little this evening.Loss and Bereavement 137 CSFC09 10/10/06 8:37 PM Page 137Not all patients living under a threat of death have a loss of appetite. Patients with human immunodeciency virus (HIV) infection knowonly too well that loss of appetite can signal the onset of AIDS andmay therefore become obsessive about their eating behaviour. Theamount, type and quality of food and drink they consume becomeshighly signicant to them, for while they are eating and maintainingtheir weight they are alive and well. The dietitian who recognises thesignicance that a loss of appetite has for a patient is more able toaccept the single-minded attitude with which the patient may pursuetheir eating behaviour. Support for the patient and the dietitian Difculties occur for both patient and dietitian when either avoid talk-ing about the loss. The dietitian who recognises the signs of grief thatthe bereaved person is experiencing and understands the process ofbereavement is more able to demonstrate the empathy and acceptancethat the bereaved person needs. The painful task of grieving often raisesconflicts, which may cause someone to seek professional help, and thedietitian may want to consider asking her patient if they have thoughtof this. Ways and means of referral are discussed in Chapter 4. Working with patients who are dealing with loss may raise personal difculties for the dietitian who may herself be dealing with a loss, for example a recent death in her family or loss of health of someone towhom she is close. A patient's experience may trigger unresolved grieffor the dietitian, which makes it difcult for her to work effectivelywith that patient. The dietitian who understands this and appreciatesthe need to care for herself in order to help others, may consider seek-ing professional help for herself (Chapter 15). She will want to drawon her network of support and focus on establishing clear boundariesfor herself. Supporting someone who is bereaved is emotionally demanding. Those doing it need to be able to care for themselves and keep theirself-esteem high and their level of stress low (Chapter 15). When seeingseveral bereaved patients the demands on the dietitian are great andshe needs to pay careful attention to keeping a balance in her work byhaving variety in her caseload and her work activities. Support fromcolleagues is invaluable. The dietitian needs to be able to talk throughher concerns about a particular patient with colleagues, and this canadd valuable learning for all when it is done with respect for the patientand in a structured way with careful consideration about condentiality(Chapters 4 and 15).138 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC09 10/10/06 (1997) Loss: Attachment , vol. 1.

Chinese proverb In this chapter I discuss: Challenges for the dietitian Needs of the child The family When a child withdraws The angry childThe well-behaved child Over-protective parents Aggressive parents The absent parent The dying child Challenges for the dietitian Dietitians who work with children face two specic challenges: Adapt dietary advice so that it is appropriate for the child concerned. Take into account the child's carers (usually parents). In order to meet these challenges the dietitian needs: flexible communication skills so that she can relate to a child of any age; awareness of a child's needs; familiarity with the ways in which children express themselves. The degree to which children are dependent on their parents and carers varies with age and development, and increases when a childfeels fearful and vulnerable, for example when ill or in hospital.Whether she sees the child alone or with the parent(s), the dietitianCSFC10 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 140who is aware of a child's needs is more able to build a satisfactory relationship with the child. The dietitian can increase her understanding of the child by being aware of how children t into their particular family system. For mostchildren this is their family of origin; for some it is the care system in which they live. Each member of the system has their own way ofinteracting with the others in the system. The dynamics between childand parent(s) as well as the dietitian's own relationship with each,affects the way in which she communicates. The dietitian can also increase her capacity to understand a child by becoming aware of the way in which a child describes a situationand how he feels, which is likely to be different from that of an adult.The different use of language and way of interpreting situations may mean that empathy is more difcult than with another adult(Burnard 1999). A dietitian will have a better understanding of how to communicate effectively with children of all ages if she is aware of: a child's ability to think and conceptualise; a child's need to experiment and learn; a child's desire for connection and fear of abandonment; a child's striving towards independence. Needs of the child A child's physical and psychological needs will vary depending on age and degree of development. Some of these needs are listed inTable 10.1.Parents and Children 141 Table 10.1 Some needs of a child. Physical needs Food, warmth, shelter Protection, securityPhysical contact Psychological needs Unconditional love, emotional caring Acknowledgement, recognitionStimulationEncouragementAcceptance as an individualExplanationHonestyPermission to be sexualCSFC10 10/10/06 8:36 141Children need their caretakers to: listen to them; play with them and have fun; provide companionship; provide privacy; speak on their behalf; be reliable; provide physical and moral boundaries appropriate to their age; allow them time and permission to make mistakes; provide structure and routine. Children in hospital have health workers in loco parentis . As a mem- ber of the health care team a dietitian needs to be aware of her youngpatient's needs and her own ability to provide for her patient. The family Eating behaviour is inextricably linked with social conditions andrelationships within the family, and a child is influenced by the beha-viour of parents, siblings, aunts, uncles and grandparents. A changeinitiated by one member of the family produces a change within thewhole family system. The dietitian may nd it useful to bear this inmind when advising dietary modication. In the following exampleSue, a paediatric dietitian, considers Peter, a 10-year-old boy newlydiagnosed with diabetes, within the context of his family. Sue, Peter and his family Background Peter lives with his parents and younger sister. His medical notes indicate that both he and his sister are small for their age and there 142 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 10.1 Look at the list of needs in Table 10.1.

The paternal grandfather developed diabetes in middle age and has since had an amputation of his foot as a result of poorly controlled diabetes. Peter's father has recently beenmade redundant and his mother works full time as a primary schoolteacher. Interview Sue, the dietitian, sees Peter with his mother. She notes that each timeshe asks him a question his mother answers on his behalf. Peter doesnot make eye contact with her and frequently interrupts his mother to contradict what she says. Sue gathers from the conversation thatPeter spends a lot of time with his grandfather, a widower who livesnearby. She wonders if it will be helpful to encourage the grandfather'ssupport in managing Peter's diabetes, although she is aware that thiscould cause friction between mother and grandfather. Sue noticesthat Peter's father is not mentioned and wonders what kind of a rela-tionship he has with his son and how the stress of the redundancy isaffecting the family; also that Peter's mother describes Ann, his sister,as 'ne' and 'no problem'. Reflections Afterwards Sue reflects upon the interview. Her rst impression is that the family are under a lot of stress; mother seems anxious andcontrolling, Peter tense and deant in the face of this, sister possiblyfeeling a lack of attention, father absorbed in his own problems andgrandfather either supportive or demanding. She then thinks aboutPeter and his mother and jots down the following questions. Peter : How does Peter feel about his diagnosis, about seeing doctors, nurses and herself? How will his diabetes affect his relationships with his friends andsister? What is his relationship with his father? Does Peter feel afraid of him? How can she gain Peter's co-operation? How much does he know about diabetes? How can she tell when he is receptive to information about his diet? She thinks that, at 10, Peter should be able to grasp the basic con-cept of balancing diet, insulin and exercise. Does he know anyoneof his own age with diabetes? Is he embarrassed at being different from his friends? Is he a candidate for a Diabetes UK summer camp at some stage?Parents and Children 143CSFC10 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 143His parents : How do his parents feel about Peter's diagnosis? What knowledge have they already about diabetes and is this accurate? How do they think the diagnosis will affect them as a family? What role, if any, does Peter's father play in the shopping, prepar- ing and cooking of the family food? Would Peter's father come with his wife to discuss Peter's diet? What is their relationship with Peter's grandfather? Do they see him as a help or a hindrance? Considerations Having come up with these questions Sue begins to feel overwhelmed.She wants answers, not more questions! She considers seeing motherand Peter again and instructing them about what he is to eat, what he is to avoid, and how to manage his diet, insulin and exercise. Shealso considers how to reinforce her instructions by stressing the con-sequences of not keeping to the diet. Then at least, she tells herself,she will have done her job! She thinks of the others involved in caringfor Peter - the medical and nursing staff and his teachers - and notesthe following questions: Has the dietetic department got any notes on the grandfather? Has a colleague in the department given him dietary advice in thepast? Is it worth getting hold of his medical notes? Have the doctors any concerns about both children being small fortheir age? In the case of Peter this may be due to his diabetes, but what abouthis sister? How long has their growth been slowed down? Is their size a family characteristic? His mother is quite petite but what about his father? Is the children's small stature a sign of deprivation or is it of littlesignicance? Is anyone else in the team involved with the family? Making a plan Sue now feels ready to make a plan of action and jots down the follow-ing steps: talk to the doctor; look up the department records about grandfather; see Peter on his own; make an appointment to see his mother on her own.144 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC10 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 144She thinks that more information will help her to decide how best to approach Peter about his diet. She realises that if she can establish a good relationship with Peter it will make it easier for him to learnand will stand him in good stead for his contact with dietitians in thefuture. She recalls herself at 10 years old when she was in hospital for atonsillectomy and she remembers how scared she felt in the strangeenvironment and how worried she was about what would happen toher. She remembers counting the hours until she could go home. Shewonders if Peter feels anxious like she was. Next meeting Sue sees Peter on his own. She focuses on giving him her full attentionand actively listening to what he says by using her skills of reflectinginstead of questioning which she thinks is likely to seem interrogativeto Peter. Her intention is to demonstrate her acceptance and under-standing. He slowly opens up to her and begins to talk freely abouthimself and his family. She learns how much Peter values spendingtime with his grandfather when he calls in for tea on his way homefrom school. Peter suddenly condes in her his fear about having hypos (appar- ently he had his rst the previous day). She focuses on demonstratingher empathy by reflecting 'Y ou feel frightened about having morehypos'. She senses him relax a little and asks him if he feels frightenedbecause he is not sure what to do to prevent one occurring again. Heagrees with her. As the time for their interview is drawing to a close,Sue says she will see him at the same time tomorrow and will explainthen how he can avoid the risk of hypos by having enough to eat. Sheasks him if the doctors know about his hypo or if he wants to tell them.He shrugs his shoulders as if he does not care either way. Aware offeeling a little irritated and yet at the same time realising that this maybe difcult for him, she says she is willing to tell the doctor on hisbehalf if he would like her to. He nods his head. Reflecting upon their meeting Sue thinks she is slowly gaining his trust. She also knows about his fear of hypos and has a lot moreinformation about his eating patterns on which to base her teachingplan (See Exercise 10.2).Parents and Children 145 Exercise 10.2 Refer again to the list of what a child needs from his caretaker and decide which of Peter's needs were met by the dietitian. If Peter wasyour patient, how might you meet his needs?CSFC10 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 145Summary In the case of Peter, Sue focused on placing Peter in his family context, building a relationship with him and gaining his trust. She gave himtime to tell his story and used her skills of active listening to demon-strate her empathy, acceptance and genuineness. Her awareness ofbeing a child helped her be empathic. Her realisation that children'scommunication is often literal meant that she used words that wereunlikely to carry a double meaning. She used the same vocabulary asPeter and made sure that she checked with him that she understoodwhen he used words that had a particular meaning for him and hisfamily. An example of this occurred when he referred to his favouriteevening meal as 'plate supper', which turned out to be a specic selec-tion of cold snack foods on his own special plate eaten while lying onthe floor in front of the television. When a child withdraws In the example above it takes the dietitian some time to establish arelationship in which the child feels safe enough to talk to her. All children can be reticent in this way. This may be temporary or part of a longer period of withdrawal. Whether this be a natural distrust, a sign of depression or an indication of high anxiety, the dietitian does well to note it and inform the medical staff. Meanwhile her dif-culty lies in communicating with someone who is behaving in this way. (See Exercise 10.3.)146 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 10.3 Imagine yourself with a diabetic teenager who sits opposite you in a slouched position looking down at the floor with a sullen expression onhis face. How do you feel? Irritated, uneasy, scared, angry, anxious, nervous? What do you think? Here are some examples: 'He's a lost cause' 'I don't see why I should bother with him if he can't even be polite' 'He may get violent or shout any minute - then what do I do?' 'A no-nonsense approach is what he needs - a bit of discipline willmake him pull his socks up' What action would you take?CSFC10 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 146Guidelines for handling this situation Give the child time. Focus on remaining calm and sensing the atmosphere between you. What does the silence tell you? Use the silence to focus on creating rapport non-verbally. Be aware of how the child is breathing. What does this indicate to you? It is most likely that the child will break the silence. If he remains silent the dietitian might say one of the following: Is there anything you would like to tell me? Would you like me to go away? If you would rather not talk now I can come back another time. Y ou seem a bit scared. Can you tell me about it? The child who withdraws is most probably feeling anxious, fright- ened and uncertain and asking himself, 'Can I trust this person?'. Thedietitian who realises this can focus on being available for the child(Chapter 5). She then draws on her ability to be empathic and feelrespect for the child as a human being who is coping with his currentsituation in the best way he can. The more genuine she can be as ahuman being (Chapter 3), the more the child will respond to her andbe able to trust her. The angry child A child may also withdraw as a way of coping with anger. Silentlywithholding is one way in which a child can exert his power in the faceof authority. Other ways of acting out anger are more easily recognis-able, such as shouting, screaming, stamping of feet, throwing toys orfood and so on. Dietitians who are unfamiliar with children may feeluncertain about how to deal with anger and rebellion. Those who areparents themselves will be familiar with many ways of dealing withsuch behaviour. It may not be easy for them to adopt other ways.Parents and Children 147 Exercise 10.4 Recall a time in your childhood when you felt frustrated and angry. How did you behave? What would you have liked to do to relieve yourfeeling? How did others behave towards you? Did they ignore you, laughat you, reprimand you, send you away to another room, punish you bydepriving you of something? What do you think would have helped you most at the time? What did you need most?CSFC10 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 147Guidelines for handling this situation Children need their feelings to be taken seriously. Acknowledge that they are feeling angry, thus demonstrating that you accept thatthey have a right to feel this way. Focus on the child's behaviour. Decide for yourself if this is acceptable or not in the circumstances. Let the child know if this is unacceptable to you. For example, 'I see you are angry and I amnot willing to listen to you when you swear at me. Feeling angry isOK but behaving in this way is not.' Remember that the feelings are valid and real for the child, eventhough you as an adult may not understand the reason for them. Y oung children can be calmed by being held rmly while being allowed to express their anger. This is effective when done lovinglyand respectfully, not angrily and punishingly. Physically containing a child provides him with safe boundaries. It is helpful to say to thechild, 'Y ou are safe. I am holding you.' Containment is different fromthe type of physical restraint which serves to compound anger andlead to the child struggling to be free. Although most dietitians areunlikely to nd themselves in situations where they need to take suchaction, they may nd it useful to consider. The well-behaved child A child who is well behaved can be a delight to work with. However,children may behave in a way which seems 'too good to be true' in an effort to be accepted and liked. The need for approval may be such that the child follows the advice without understanding why it isnecessary. Thinking the child has understood her advice, the dietitianmay only realise later that this is not the case. Her reaction then islikely to be one of confusion and irritation, thus enabling the child toexperience again the disapproval he feared. The child decides he hasnot been good enough and so increases his efforts to behave well andso the cycle is repeated. Guidelines for handling this situation Focus on how you are feeling. Is your response to this child one of disapproval or irritation? Or maybe you feel anxious to pleasehim? Check that the child has understood the information or advice youhave given by using open questions (Chapter 7).148 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC10 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 148Give the child permission to make mistakes; for example, 'Keeping to a diet is difcult and there will be times when you eat somethingthat is not good for you'. Over-protective parents It is natural for a parent to protect their child. There are many examplesof situations in which parents perform superhuman feats in order to protect a child. The desire to protect is activated when the parent perceives the child to be in danger. In order to protect their child aparent may behave aggressively or manipulatively towards someone elseso as to get what they want for the child. Parents may be demanding onbehalf of their child in ways that they would not for themselves. There are some parents who are overly protective. In their desire to shield their child from what they perceive will be frightening for the child, they think or feel as if they were the child concerned and donot allow the child to express his own thoughts and feelings. When thedietitian asks a child a question in the presence of one or both of hisparents, she may nd the parents answer for the child instead of givingthe child time to answer for himself. She may nd herself talking to theparents and ignoring the child. The child may subsequently behave in ways which make it more difcult for the parents to follow thedietary advice. The child who is consulted about the diet is more likelyto feel involved and thus be more willing to co-operate. In trying tounderstand the behaviour and feelings of the over-protective parentthe dietitian may nd it useful to reflect upon the following questions: What are they afraid of ? How anxious are they? What support do they have? If their overly protective behaviour is their way of exerting theircontrol over the child, how might they try to control the dietitian? Guidelines for handling this situation Focus on listening and reflecting the parents' concern for the well-being of their child. In this way you will demonstrate yourunderstanding of their need to protect their child. Ask them what they want you to do. Focus on containing their anxiety by keeping them informed anddoing your best to keep to any arrangements that you make withthem.Parents and Children 149CSFC10 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 149Aggressive parents Parents may feel aggressive towards children when they are exhausted, when the child is disobedient or ill, or if the parent was a rejected child and has an unconscious impulse to re-enact the experience withtheir own child (Reinhold 1996). As a result of a parent's aggressivebehaviour, a child is likely to feel rejected, hurt and upset and mayrespond aggressively in turn. On the other hand the child may behavepassively and withdraw. Feeling aggressive is part of being human.There are many ways in which we behave aggressively, some of whichare overt, others covert. A parent may behave aggressively towards the child or towards the dietitian. Guidelines for handling this situation Maintain eye contact. Focus on being calm. Consider setting limits. Adopt assertive posture - sit or stand upright with arms and legs uncrossed. Be brief and to the point when you speak. Use 'I' language (Chapters 7 and 14). The absent parent A child who is in hospital and whose parents are not there to act as an advocate is likely to feel alone, abandoned, uncared for, anxious,frightened or ashamed. They may cover this by being awkward, bel-ligerent, difcult and unco-operative, or they may be meek, anxious toplease, withdrawn, quiet and have difculty in asking and answeringquestions. If one parent is absent, the other who is there with the child may be angry, resentful, and frightened at carrying the responsibility alone.The one who is absent may appear guilty and be anxious to makeamends, for example by frequent telephone calls and by sending thechild an excessive number of presents. This parent may make excusesfor not being there and may rationalise their absence showing greatconcern and wanting to give the child and the staff gifts or money. On the other hand the absent parent may not make contact at all and may either not know that their child is in hospital or may ignorethe situation. The child may feel abandoned by the absent parent and feel a desperate longing for their presence. Such a child may go to150 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC10 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 150great lengths to make contact with the absent parent or may be with- drawn and appear resigned to the situation. Guidelines for handling this situation Be prepared to give time to the child. Focus on listening and reflecting feelings. Be wary of giving reassurance and making promises, e.g. 'Daddy will soon be here'. Y ou do not know that and it is hurtful to raisehopes that may not be met. Be aware that the child may show limited attention to any dietinstruction. Be prepared for sudden changes in mood. The dying child We are likely to feel sadness in response to any death. The death of a person in their eighties is in the natural order of life. The death of achild on the other hand has come about before the expected lifespanhas been lived. The circumstances surrounding the death may be distressing, painful and prolonged or the death may be unexpectedand sudden. The parents' distress is difcult for all to witness and thedietitian whose child patient has died may be party to the parents'grief. She herself may be more upset than she expected. The child who knows they are going to die shortly may accept their impending death with a maturity beyond their years. Parents and staffmay feel humbled by this and some may be in awe of the child. Beingwith a child during this time can be a particularly moving, althoughdifcult, experience. The dietitian may be torn between wanting togive the child all it desires in terms of food, and wanting to make surethat any nourishment provided meets the nutritional needs of thebody to prolong life. Guidelines for handling this situation Refer to the points on bereavement (Chapter 9). Do not assume the child will want to talk to you. Respect their right to privacy. Watch for signs of tiredness or withdrawal. Let the child dictate the pace. Find out what the child wants to know rst about the issue in question, whether this is about diet or anything else.Parents and Children 151CSFC10 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 151Talk to them normally, not down to them. Listen to the child. Show respect by not reassuring the child that they will get better when this is untrue. Instead focus on allowing them to express howthey feel. Apart from the rst, these guidelines apply to communication with all children. The three below (Burnard 1999) are also worth noting: Be aware of pitching questions and responses appropriate to theage of the child. Respect the child as a human being who happens to be younger. Believe the child. References Burnard, P. (1999) Counselling Skills for Health Professionals , 3rd edn. Stanley Thornes Publishers Ltd, Cheltenham. Reinhold, M.

Mandarin Paperbacks, Transcultural Communication 'Culture: the acquainting ourselves with the best that has been known and said in the world and thus with the history of the human spirit.' Matthew Arnold In this chapter I discuss: What is culture? Prejudice and its development Attitudes and expectations Effect of prejudice and cultural differences oncommunicationHow can we communicatemore effectively? Talking about food Making effective use of aninterpreter Coping with difculties What is culture? As we grow up we learn values, history, attitudes, practices and beliefs from those around us and from our environment. Those aspects whichwe share with others form our culture. As children we tend to adoptthese cultural factors without question and although we may challengethem in adolescence we think of our own culture as normal. Culturescan be based on many groupings, for example regional, organisationalor religious, and are constantly changing and adapting to producecomplex variations within a general culture. Our culture becomes suchan integral part of our life that we are often unaware of its influence onour thinking, behaviour and attitudes, which can lead to difcultieswhen we communicate with those from other cultures.CSFC11 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 153Britain today is a multicultural society. There are occasions when cultural differences seem overwhelming, arousing fear and anxiety.Even so we may make an effort to connect, despite the difculties. Atother times we do not even try. Faced with cultural integration newproblems may arise as traditional values and practices are perceived asrejected (Goodinall 1993). Dietitians are constantly communicating across cultural barriers whether or not they are aware of these. Cultural differences exist not only between dietitian and patient but also between dietitians.Colleagues may have very different cultural backgrounds yet theyhave had a similar training and are members of the same professionwhich has a cultural identity of its own. The health service has its ownnational and local culture, as does a commercial environment, whichmeans dietitians have to adapt to these professional and working cultures while maintaining their own cultural identity, if they are to achieve effective working relationships. Developing awareness of our own culture is not easy, particularly when our culture is that of the majority. Those from minority culturesare more likely to have greater cultural awareness. Awareness of how our culture influences us is crucial if we are to be able to 'stepoutside its constraints and care for others in terms of their own needs'(Schott & Henley 1996).154 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 11.1 Take a large sheet of plain paper. Draw a circle in the centre to represent your culture of origin and write words or phrases within the circle whichdescribe the cultural norms with which you grew up, such as colour ofskin, nationality, country of origin, social class, political allegiance, thetelevision/radio and newspapers you were exposed to, the traditions andcustoms in your family. Now draw another circle which slightly overlapsthis. Write words in this circle to describe the cultural values of yourschool, e.g. sports loving, academic achievement, emphasis on discipline,strong traditions. Build up other circles in the same way to representcollege/university education, work, profession and the different culturesin which you have lived. As you look at your completed cultural map of interlocking circles, what do you notice? You might want to make notes or talk to a friend/colleague about the adaptations you have made and how the differentcultural values have influenced your life.CSFC11 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 154Prejudice and its development Prejudice means to prejudge something or someone, that is to form an opinion beforehand. Assigning imagined characteristics and makingjudgements and assumptions helps us make sense of things around us.The degree to which we do this depends upon our personal experi-ence. We all have prejudices, although we may not like to think this.Depending on our particular culture we may develop prejudices aboutgender, age, socio-economic group, status, race or sexuality. We thinkof someone as 'prejudiced' when they are against someone or some-thing, and 'biased' when they are taking another's side or speaking intheir favour. Either way we are expressing our prejudice. Prejudice may not necessarily be racist although racism involves pre- judice. There are two kinds of racism - our own personal racism andracism in society as a whole. Racism is 'the conscious or unconsciousbelief in the superiority of a particular \"race\", acts of discriminationand unfair treatment whether intentional or unintentional, based uponthis belief' (Mares et al. 1985). Racial prejudice may be expressed in a 'loud, explicit and often violent manner or in ways which are subtlethough no less expressive' (cited in: Breaking the Silence: Writings by Asian W omen and quoted by Ram Goodinall in his book Sari 'n' Chips (1993)). As adults we may think we would not express such prejudice. However, we may be unaware of how our attitudes towards our ownculture and that of another affects our communication. For dietitiansliving and working in Britain, the dominant culture in the country andin the medical profession frames their view of the world. Anyone notsharing these cultures will be seen as an outsider and perceived asinferior in some way, and this may be difcult for health professionalsto acknowledge. Attitudes and expectations A dietitian has attitudes and expectations about herself and her patientsbased on her culture and experience. Patients whose expectations arenot met are likely to vote with their feet and not return for futureappointments. Relating this to counselling practice, d'Ardenne andMahtani (1999) point out that when there are great cultural differencesbetween client and counsellor, it is simplest for the counsellor to con-vince herself that this is due to the client's resistance to counselling. Itis much more difcult for the counsellor to consider how her attitudesand expectations might have influenced the client's decision not toTranscultural Communication 155CSFC11 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 155return. Clients may sense their counsellor's low expectations of them and so think of themselves as unlikely to succeed. However, they mayplacate their counsellor by telling the counsellor what they think shewants to hear (d'Ardenne & Mahtani 1999). When there are great cultural differences between patient and dietitian it is simplest for the dietitian to tell herself that the difculties are due to the patient'sresistance to changing their eating patterns, rather than consider howher expectations may have influenced her patient's behaviour. A dietitian wanting to become more aware of her attitudes and expectations towards a patient may nd it valuable to ask herself thefollowing questions (also see Exercise 11.2): In what ways am I different from this person? In what ways am I similar to this person? How do I think this person thinks of me? In what ways do I consider myself superior or inferior? Am I aware when I feel irritated, impatient and anxious with someone? Effect of prejudice and cultural differences on communication Prejudice limits our ability to be empathic, genuine and accepting, that is to provide the core conditions necessary for a therapeutic rela-tionship. It is difcult to empathise with another when we focus on thedifferences between us. Our acceptance is limited by our desire for the other person to be more like us or a wish that we could be morelike them. In other words we judge the differences between us andconsider ourselves inferior or superior to the other person. If we think of someone as inferior to us we tend to behave towards them in a patronising or arrogant way. This may take the form of feeling156 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 11.2 Think of a patient you have seen recently whose cultural background is clearly different from your own. Make a note of these differences, e.g.language, gender, age, nationality, race. Recall the scene and how youfelt. Were you aware of feeling inferior or superior to the other person?Did this change during the interview? How did you behave when youfelt either inferior or superior? What do you think you were afraid of ?What do you think irritated you?CSFC11 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 156sorry for them, of seeing them as a victim of their circumstances, or of seeing them as someone to do our bidding and bend to our will.Although they may also see themselves in this way it is not helpful to reinforce these self-beliefs. If we think of someone as superior to us in some way we tend to behave in a subservient manner, anxious to please them and do their bidding. We are likely to put ourselves at their disposal and to set aside our own needs, hoping that in duecourse they will appreciate our efforts and show their gratitude. Whenthis is not forthcoming we feel resentful, hurt and upset. When communicating transculturally the dietitian may attempt to break through the barriers by giving her advice in a number of differentways, only to nd that her patient seems more confused. The dietitianmay go to great lengths to express her sympathy in her desire to bethoughtful and caring, yet she may seem patronising to the patient whothen feels angry and resentful. In the following example the dietitian is advising a middle-aged Asian woman who has recently developeddiabetes. Although the reader may think the scenario is unlikely, shemay recognise some similarities. Dietitian :(pointing to the diet sheet ) These are the foods you must now avoid as they contain too much sugar. I know this will be really hard for youespecially if you have a sweet tooth. Do you? ( she looks at the patient who drops her eyes and maintains a blank expression ). Dietitian :(feeling irritated and unaware of the confusion she may have aroused by her use of the term 'sweet tooth' ) Do you understand what I'm saying? ( The patient keeps silent and continues to look downwards. The dietitian feeling frustrated, now speaks more slowly and raises her voice ) Never mind. The thing is you must not eat sugar any more. When we think of another person as neither superior nor inferior to ourselves we can more easily accept our similarities and differences inattitude, perception, behaviour and culture. We are more able to offerempathy, genuineness and acceptance, with the result that commun-ication will be more effective and the relationship more satisfying forboth dietitian and patient. How can we communicate more effectively? A recognition of the values that certain social rituals have for a patientcan help the dietitian build rapport. d'Ardenne and Mahtani (1999)explain that the cultural divide may become greater if introductionsare not clear, and they point out the signicance of names, language,credentials, boundaries and goal setting when working across cultures.Transcultural Communication 157CSFC11 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 157Introductions When cultural differences are obvious we are likely to feel anxious, irritable and inadequate as we anticipate the difculties in communica-tion. This is true for both patient and dietitian. Any knowledge aboutanother culture, for example ways of making introductions, helps the dietitian to feel more condent to deal with the situation. In thefollowing example the dietitian is meeting an Asian woman who hasrecently been diagnosed as having diabetes. Ann notices the patient's age, traditional style of dress and the fact that she is accompanied by a young man in jeans and T -shirt. Fromher knowledge of Asian culture she guesses this is the woman's son,that he speaks English fluently but his mother does not, and that herpatient may eat a very traditional diet. She is aware that she has astereotypical situation in mind of the patient leading the traditionalrole of the older woman in an Asian household and that she is likely to make assumptions because of this. Talking to someone in an authoritative position is stressful and the dietitian who introduces herself clearly can help a patient feel more atease. The dietitian who says 'I am Ann Smith' leaves it unclear whethershe wants to be called 'Ann' or Ms Smith, Miss Smith or Mrs Smith!Culturally, the patient may feel extremely awkward addressing some-one by their rst name when they perceive them to be in an authoritativeposition. The dietitian may also feel uncomfortable when the patientaddresses her in a way she had not intended but had inadvertently invitedby not making this explicit. Names are part of our individual and cultural identity and when our names are used correctly we feel accepted. Different cultures havedifferent naming systems and health professionals can cause confu-sion and offence when they change a style of address to t in with theBritish system (Schott & Henley 1996). The dietitian therefore showsrespect by enquiring from the patient what they like to be called and, if in doubt, how to spell and pronounce this. Most of us feel irritatedwhen someone consistently mispronounces our name. However, aspatients perceive the dietitian to be in a position of power and control,they are unlikely to correct her mispronunciation. As well as establishing names and any other necessary identity details, it is also useful for the dietitian to explain briefly her role and purpose. This gives valuable information to a patient who mayhave no idea of the existence or function of dietitians. In doing this the dietitian is establishing her credentials, which may be of greatsignicance to patients whose culture attaches importance to statusand position.158 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC11 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 158Language Even if a patient is fluent in English their ability to converse will be affected by the stress they feel (Henley 1982). This is true for all of us,whatever tongue we use. We may not be able to articulate what we meanwhen under stress and our ability to comprehend what is being said is reduced. People often smile a lot, nod as if they have understood,avoid eye contact and remain silent in this situation, or else give brief,inaccurate answers. The dietitian, under stress herself, may mistakenlyinterpret these signals as signs of comprehension by the patient. It is important therefore that the dietitian speaks clearly, in concise sentences, uses straightforward language which avoids jargon and col-loquialisms and deals with one point at a time. Pictures can be a usefulaid. The dietitian needs to check frequently that her patient has under-stood. Simply asking 'Do you understand?' invites the patient to nodor say 'Y es'. A more effective way is to ask the patient to explain howthey would use the information or, if practical, to demonstrate this. When there is a clear cultural divide it is important to establish the language to be used during the interview. Providing the dietitian hasprior knowledge of the patient's country of origin, greeting the patientin their native tongue can be a way of quickly establishing a rapport.'Welcome, how are you?' may be the extent of the dietitian's languageskill. If so it will be necessary to clarify this with the patient and toestablish which language is to be used in the conversation. When com-municating across a language barrier both dietitian and patient arelikely to become weary in a relatively short time. The dietitian whocan be flexible allows for this by either covering material in less detailor scheduling more frequent appointments. The words we use reflect our attitudes and beliefs. The dietitian may have become familiar with using certain words during her clinicalwork, for example bowels, constipation, urine, and may not realise thatthese are a source of embarrassment to the patient whose culture doesnot include their use. Terminology changes over time so that wordswhich were commonly used in the past become superseded by newTranscultural Communication 159 Exercise 11.3 Recall the way in which you introduce yourself to patients. How clear do you make it? Do you behave differently with different patients? If thereare wide cultural differences between you and the patient, how do youadapt your introduction? How could you experiment with varying theway you introduce yourself and establish your credentials.CSFC11 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 159terms. It is important for the dietitian to be aware of those which are currently acceptable so that she speaks in non-racist language. Speech patterns and customs Even though both dietitian and patient may speak the same language, differences in pace, emphasis, intonation, inflexion, volume and con-versational style can lead to confusion and misunderstanding in mean-ing and interpretation. Cultural differences in the use of phrases suchas 'please' and 'thank you' may lead to irritation and the conclusionthat someone is excessively polite or downright rude. Gaining know-ledge of another culture and developing awareness can help a dietitianrecognise how and why misunderstandings may come about. Boundaries When clear boundaries are established in a relationship both parties are able to relax and communicate more freely (Chapter 4). Some ofthe practical boundaries may be unfamiliar to someone from anotherculture. The physical environment, for example where to sit and per-mission to smoke, are within the control of the dietitian and may imposeconstraints on a patient whose culture does not share the same socialvalues. The concept of timekeeping may be different for someonefrom a non-Western culture who may appear for an appointment longafter the scheduled time for no apparent reason. Having establishedthe value of clear time boundaries in Chapter 4, the reader may wantto reflect upon how she could adapt her approach with someone whoseculture does not include these. Non-verbal communication Many psychological boundaries in a relationship are established non- verbally, for example in the way we position ourselves in relation to theother person, and in our gestures, eye contact and facial expression(Chapter 5). There are cultural differences in non-verbal communica-tion (Morris 2002) and the dietitian needs to ask herself if a patient'snon-verbal signals are specic to their culture before she assigns a particular meaning to the communication. Goal setting As with time keeping, goal setting may be an unfamiliar concept to someone from another culture (d'Ardenne & Mahtani 1999). The idea160 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC11 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 160of achieving a target weight, for example, may be a concept the patient is unwilling to adopt. Although it may be the dietitian's objective thepatient may have in mind something else, for example to obtain thedietitian's help in dealing with a social problem. The dietitian's skill inclarifying expectations is essential if a mutual purpose is to be established(Chapters 2 and 4). Talking about food As dietitians know only too well, food has a signicance for most people far greater than its nutritional value. Different cultures havedifferent customs associated with food, which may be based on moralvalues and health or social, religious and spiritual needs. Customsaround food preparation, cooking and eating are many and varied.However strange a custom may seem to the dietitian it is importantthat she remembers that it is familiar to the patient for whom that custom is part of their cultural identity. To talk about changes in dietis particularly stressful for someone whose cultural practices are verydifferent from the majority culture. When giving dietary advice to apatient of another culture a dietitian needs to be particularly aware ofthe signicance that any change she suggests may have for the patient.She can do this by: using her skills of active listening (Chapter 5); clarifying, by reflective responding, what are the patient's customsand practices (Chapter 6); being aware when she is assuming these for a patient because of herknowledge of the patient's culture. Although background know-ledge is useful information it is not necessarily true for a particularindividual. To assume that it is can increase the likelihood of beingperceived as patronising. Making effective use of an interpreter An obvious difculty of transcultural communication occurs when wedo not speak the same language. Interpreters are likely to be un-ofcial, for example relatives. This gives rise to difculties concerningsuitability, condentiality and accuracy of translation. Bias and dis-tortion can be introduced by the interpreter as well as exploitation of the patient (Shackman 1985). Many dietitians will be familiar with the situation of a middle-aged female patient who does not speakTranscultural Communication 161CSFC11 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 161English and who has her young son with her to act as interpreter. Not only is there the age difference but also gender and status differences.The culture gap in this case is enormous, making any meaningfulcommunication unlikely. When a relative is not present to act as an unofcial interpreter, it is often the practice to ask a stranger of the same nationality, for examplea nurse who is working in the outpatient department. It is tempting to assume that because two people originate from the same continentthey speak the same language and dialect. It is important to check thatthis is the case before beginning the interview. In India, for example,there are many different languages and even more dialects. Interviews using interpreters take longer. Extra time is needed beforehand to: discuss with the interpreter what the interview is about; explain how the interview will be conducted; encourage the interpreter to interrupt and check if they are in anydoubt about what is being said. Being in the position of interpreting for someone is stressful. Unofcial interpreters may feel coerced into doing it and may be resentful. A clinicnurse may feel she cannot refuse to act as interpreter because it isexpected of her, yet it is not recognised ofcially as part of her duties.On the other hand she may feel responsible for and protective of thepatient. When communicating through an unofcial interpreter, thetask becomes easier if the dietitian uses words that are unambiguousand speaks in sentences that are clearly structured. In her book The Right to be Understood Jane Shackman (1985) draws on her experience of using interpreters in her work with refugees andhighlights the importance of checking the following points: Does the interpreter speak English and the client's language fluently? Is the interpreter acceptable to the client (the same sex, similarage)? Is your client prevented from telling you things because of his/herrelationship with the interpreter? Are you creating as good a relationship as possible with your client? Is the interpreter translating exactly what you and your client aresaying or are they putting forward their own views and ideas? Does the interpreter understand the purpose of the interview andwhat her role is within it? Does the interpreter feel free to interrupt you to ask for clarica-tion or point out problems? Are you using simple, jargon-free Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC11 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 162Is the interpreter ashamed or embarrassed by the client? Are you asking too much of the interpreter? Are you allowing the interpreter enough time? Are you maintaining as good a relationship with the interpreter as you can? Coping with difculties There is much to think about when working transculturally. Dietitianscan work towards more effective transcultural communication bygaining knowledge of other cultures and developing awareness of howtheir own society and culture have influenced them. Appreciation ofboth the differences and the similarities enables a move towards greateracceptance of one another. When communication becomes difcult itis tempting to blame the other person and their culture, or to blameourselves for being inadequate. Blame leads to guilt, frustration andhelplessness in the face of the cultural divide. The dietitian whorecognises when she is blaming herself or her patient is more able tofocus instead on nding some point of greater understanding, thusbuilding a bridge between her and her patient. Ways of building bridges (1) By becoming more aware: Note the thoughts and feelings you experience when you see a person from another culture or racial background. Reflect on the meaning that these thoughts and feelings havefor you. Consider the culture of the person before naming their beha-viour as normal or abnormal. Exercise your imagination by thinking of yourself in the placeof the other person, leading their life as you understand it. Think about your own cultural background - how would youdescribe yourself to someone from another culture? (2) By recognising: when a particular non-verbal behaviour represents a cultural difference rather than an individual variation; the fears that your patients bring with them that increase theirprejudice; the differences between you and another where these exist.Transcultural Communication 163CSFC11 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 163(3) By focusing on: establishing rapport (Chapter 5); understanding your own racial and cultural prejudices and the way they influence your communication; involving the patient's family and community networksappropriately; using their language and knowing when and how to use aninterpreter.

Minority needs as part of society Those who, through accident, illness, age or circumstances of birth, have a loss of ability to function physically or mentally, have certainspecial needs which differentiate them from those who are able to function fully. Such differences may carry a stigma even in an apparently tolerant and liberal-minded society. There is increased awareness in recent years of issues associated with various mental and physical problems, and a variety of articles in magazines and pro-grammes on television and radio which aim to raise consciousnessCSFC12 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 165and disseminate information. Self-help groups have exerted pressure to increase public awareness and some policies have been imple-mented and statutory requirements made for the provision of neces-sary facilities. However, there is a long way to go before those needs which are particular to a minority are accepted as an integral part of society. Loss of ability to function affects both mind and body, including verbal and performance skills. Problems with mental health can affect someone physically, and someone with physical disabilities can be affected emotionally and mentally. Misuse of alcohol, drugsand food may develop as a way of coping and these strategies in turncan become disabling behaviour for some. Many people also live with some degree of chronic pain. This in itself is disabling and canaffect all areas of a person's life. As a result a person may become more withdrawn or increasingly aggressive. Relationships are likely tobecome strained and tense and may break down altogether resultingin increased isolation. Physical problems can affect hearing, sight, speech, mobility, move- ment and appearance. There are disabilities which people have hadfrom birth, for example spina bida, and those which develop slowlyas a result of progressive disease, such as multiple sclerosis. There arealso those which are the result of sudden trauma, for example a roadtrafc accident. Learning difculties caused by illness or infectionsince birth or during the perinatal period are experienced by thosewith Down's syndrome, cerebral palsy, dyslexia and epilepsy. Peoplewith learning difculties are not necessarily ill. They require the sameeveryday services as anyone else in order to live in the community.They also have specic requirements to assist them with living in thecommunity, as may those with physical disabilities, and like othersthey may suffer from problems with mental health.166 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 12.1 Note on a piece of paper the people you know, either in a personal or professional capacity, whom you consider to have a physical or learningdifculty or a problem with mental health. Make notes on the nature of the difculty, how you think this affected them, any special needs they have, and any remarks you have heard made about people with this difculty.CSFC12 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 166The effect on patient and dietitian Reactions to loss of ability may be so intense that some people become unable to function socially, professionally or personally. Some may feelanger, fear and resentment, sadness and despair, hopelessness andpowerlessness, and anxiety and depression. Others may deny feelingany such emotions. Physical difculties may compound the effect ofthe original problem; for example, a patient who has suffered a strokemay become incontinent, which can lead to embarrassment and a fearof social contact and being away from home. Isolation and depres-sion can lead to ever-increasing withdrawal, and lack of activity andexercise may develop. Antidepressants may be prescribed, some ofwhich can have physical side-effects. People learn to cope with their difculties in many different ways. Some coping skills lead to a degree of adjustment and acceptancewhich makes life manageable. Other means of coping, such as misuseof alcohol or food, increase problems in the long term and compoundthe difculties. All areas of human life can be affected in some way as a result of physical and mental health problems, including eating behaviour.Dietitians who are concerned with giving dietary advice to patientsand carers will be well aware that the problem of maintaining a healthyweight is greater when opportunities for physical activity are limited.Patients may have gastro-intestinal difculties and may have specialneeds associated with managing any practical problems connectedwith food preparation and eating. The dietitian's attitude and previous experience and her own individual emotional response will affect the way in which she com-municates with a patient, whatever their difculty. There will be timeswhen many dietitians may doubt their ability to help the patient. Aswell as a sense of inadequacy some may also feel frustrated and help-less when ideas and suggestions do not seem to be accepted and actedupon by the patient. As with cultural differences (Chapter 11), physical and learning dif- culties are likely to trigger prejudice (Exercise 12.2). This has beensuccinctly dened as 'an attitude that predisposes a person to think,feel, perceive and act in favourable or unfavourable ways towards agroup or its individual members' (Secord & Blackman 1974). In becom-ing more aware of how our own attitude predisposes us to behavetowards those with physical and mental health problems, we becomemore able to offer the core conditions for a helping relationship(Chapter 3). The extent to which the dietitian can provide the coreWorking with Difculties in Physical and Mental Health 167CSFC12 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 167conditions for a particular patient depends on her ability to acknow- ledge, accept and respect the similarities and differences between herself and another. Resources for the dietitian to develop Internal resources Working with patients who are depressed and who have little energy is demanding for the dietitian and it is important that she take activesteps to maintain her own sense of well-being (Chapters 14 and 15).When working with people whose needs are different from her own,the dietitian has many opportunities to use her imagination. Creativityand improvisation are resources to draw upon when helping patientsovercome a problem. Extending herself imaginatively and becomingaware of any feelings of fear, anxiety, sadness and frustration helps adietitian build on her ability to be empathic. The following questionsare useful to reflect on: What is it that this person most needs from me now? What listening skills shall I focus on? What message (if any) do I want to put across? How can I say this openly and directly?168 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 12.2 Read the following statements one at a time. As you do so be aware of any thoughts and feelings which arise. Can you 'own' this feeling, that isaccept it as your own and not attribute it to anyone or anything else. Youmay like to do this exercise with a partner so that you can take it in turnsto talk about your response while your partner listens. Statements : People in a wheelchair shouldn't let themselves get so fat. They've no self-discipline. Someone who can't masticate properly won't miss a lot becausethey can have most food liquidised. As he's blind he won't be able to eat sh because of the bones - wedon't want him to swallow any. You may want to add other statements as these occur to you.CSFC12 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 168External resources Self-help groups provide valuable support for those with many differ- ent mental and physical problems, and their families. Information,advice and opportunities to reduce isolation through telephone help-lines, local groups and newsletters are available for many. These andother organisations can be a useful resource for dietitians to pass on topatients and relatives (Appendix 2). Some provide training for healthprofessionals and carers. Other professional carers such as occupational therapists, physio- therapists, social workers and members of the community mentalhealth team can also be a valuable resource for dietitians. Primary healthcare teams are increasingly using the services of a counsellor for helpwith emotional and interpersonal difculties. A dietitian may nd thereare local counselling services and groups which offer valuable support.Some patients may appreciate information about these. Physical difculties This section highlights areas which are of concern when commun-icating with those who have difculty with hearing, sight, speech andmobility. The degree to which any disability affects a person's daily lifeis very individual and may not be apparent to others. Altered physicalappearance, such as disgurement or the presence of a prosthesis, hasan effect on the dietitian and the patient, and the way in which theycope with this affects any interaction between them.Working with Difculties in Physical and Mental Health 169 Exercise 12.3 Here is the outline of a situation in which a dietitian has been asked to help. First, read it through then list as many difculties as you can thinkof which may arise in this situation for the patient, the daughter and thedietitian. How might you manage if you were the patient, the daughteror the dietitian. What would you want as the patient, the daughter andthe dietitian if someone were to offer you help. An elderly widow has recently had a stroke which has left her partially paralysed down one side, including her face. She is unsteady on her feetand it was not considered safe for her to live on her own. She moved inwith her daughter, since when she has gained a considerable amount ofweight. She has developed arthritic pains in her knees. Her daughter hasa part-time job, a husband and two teenage children.CSFC12 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 169Hearing The patient may be hard of hearing in one ear only. If the dietitian establishes that this is the case she can take steps to ease any difcultyby making sure she is sitting on the patient's hearing side. The patientmay wear a hearing aid, in which case the dietitian may not have toraise her voice. The dietitian can make it easier for a patient to lip-readif she makes sure she is looking at them when speaking and does notcover her mouth with her hand. The dietitian helps by: sitting on the hearing side of the patient; turning to be face to face; making eye contact; writing her message if necessary; either being able to use sign language herself or knowing someone who can. Sight People who are blind or partially sighted learn to focus on other senses such as sound and touch. Surroundings which are familiar are easierto manage. Change evokes anxiety and this may be more acute for a blind person than for a sighted one if the change involves dealingwith unfamiliar surroundings. Sighted people do not have to raisetheir voices when talking to someone who cannot see. Although to doso seems ludicrous it is often what happens. A blind person knowswhen someone is talking and looking away from them because theyare so attuned to alterations in voice. It is helpful therefore to maintain eye contact as if the blind person were sighted. The dietitian may not nd this easy as people who areblind from birth may use many head movements when speaking or listening. This can be disconcerting for the sighted person if they areunaware that this is normal behaviour for the other person. It is helpful if the dietitian makes a point of describing any actions she is taking to the blind person so that they know what is happening.170 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 12.4 Recall a time when you were with someone with a hearing difculty. How severe was their disability? How did it affect you? How did theycope with it? How did you cope with it?CSFC12 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 170For example, the dietitian who explains to her patient that she is about to make some notes is keeping the patient informed about what she is doing. The patient can then understand the reason for the break in conversation. The dietitian helps by: being aware of the volume of her voice and adjusting this if too loud; being prepared for unusual facial expressions and head movements; looking at the patient even though she knows the patient cannotsee her; saying what she is doing so that the patient knows what is happening; offering her arm rather than grabbing that of the patient whenguiding them; considering making a tape recording of her dietary advice to give to the patient instead of a leaflet or diet sheet; being aware of the signicance of familiar and unfamiliar surround-ings and routines for the patient when proposing any changes inlifestyle and alterations in eating patterns. Speech People who stammer or who have difculty in co-ordinating thought and words need time in which to speak. The listener may feel embar-rassed, impatient, irritated and possibly afraid that they too may beginto stammer. They may also feel anxious to help and respond by com-pleting the sentence on the speaker's behalf. When this happens somepeople may feel annoyed that they have not had an opportunity to expresstheir own thoughts and feelings. Other people may feel they have beenhelped and supported in their struggle to express themselves. Those who stammer know they do so and if the dietitian is able to convey in some way that she can accept this they are likely to feelvalued as an individual. The dietitian demonstrates her empathy andacceptance by employing her skills of active listening. Paraphrasingand summarising help to clarify what has been said for patient anddietitian. As a result the patient is likely to feel more relaxed and maybe able to speak more fluently.Working with Difculties in Physical and Mental Health 171 Exercise 12.5 Recall a time when you were with someone whose sight was impaired. How severe was their disability? How did it affect you? How did theycope with it? How did you cope it?CSFC12 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 171The dietitian helps by: allowing enough time for the interview and keeping calm; being aware that she may be perceived as impatient and patronising when she completes words or sentences for her patient; asking the patient what they would like her to do when they stammer- complete the word for them or give them time to speak. Mobility and movement Holding cutlery and kitchen utensils can be a painful problem for some- one with arthritis, a fractured wrist or arm or any physical disabilityaffecting their hands and arms. Disabilities that affect mobility andmovement make shopping, food preparation, cooking and eating moredifcult. The time and energy needed to do tasks that previously mayhave taken a fraction of the time and effort give rise to frustration andfatigue. This is as true for other parts of the body which are affected by disability as for arms and hands. Those suffering from chronic backpain, for example, know only too well the disabling effect of this andthe effort involved in continuing to perform daily activities. Most people learn to feed themselves at an early stage in child- hood. Losing the ability to do this strikes deeply as we are once more dependent for our survival on those who care for us. Developing theself-condence to use gadgetry is a valuable step towards gaining ameasure of independence, which in turn builds self-condence. Apatient who is condent enough to ask for help when it is needed andwho has able-bodied and willing friends, family and neighbours islikely to manage more effectively than someone who withdraws fromsocial interaction. The dietitian helps by considering the following questions when interviewing patients with difculties with mobility: Does the patient need a wheelchair? Is the chair a suitable height? Do they need an arm for support? Is their a clear passageway for them or are there obstacles which ifmoved would make it easier?172 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 12.6 Recall a time when you were with someone with a speech impediment. How severe was their disability? How did it affect you? How did theycope with it? How did you cope with it?CSFC12 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 172Appearance Facial and other disgurements, whether due to congenital mal- formation, burns, skin disease or stroke, are disabling. Learning tolive with disguring disabilities is difcult for both the person affectedand their friends and family. The dietitian who meets a patient withsevere burns, for example, may feel shocked by what she sees, eventhough she may have been told to expect this. The patient may ndtheir self-condence severely undermined by what has happened totheir appearance and this can lead to an increasing dependence onothers. As with other disabilities, social interaction, recreation andwork opportunities are likely to be affected. The dietitian helps by: letting the patient know she wants to hear about their needs; focusing on seeing beyond the other's appearance; talking about their disability with them if they raise the topic; getting support for herself in coping with her own emotions. Invisible disabilities Disabilities such as facial disgurement, amputations, blindness and so on are more or less obvious to another person. There are also disabilitieswhich are hidden from view, for example ileostomies, colostomies andpermanent sites for injection of intravenous drugs. The dietitian maynot know of the existence of these unless she is told by the patient orWorking with Difculties in Physical and Mental Health 173 Exercise 12.7 Consider the room in which you usually see patients. Reflect on how user-friendly this is for people with difculties in mobility and move-ment. How easy is the access? Are the chairs adequate for their needs? Is the room so small and cluttered with furniture that they might havedifculty negotiating their way around? Exercise 12.8 Recall a time when you met someone who was disgured. How severe was this? How did it affect you? How did they cope with it? How did youcope with it?CSFC12 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 173reads this information in the medical notes. She is likely to have more difculty in imagining the effect of a disability on someone's life whenthe disability is not apparent to her. Mental health Difculties with mental health can happen at any age and result inmuch distress, not only to the individual sufferer but also to family andfriends. The majority of people with mental health problems are livingin the community. Care is based on needs being met by communityservices, and hospital treatment for acute illness when someone isunable to cope with and understand society. Depression and anxiety are the two areas of mental health which dietitians are most likely to encounter. Although 10% of the UK adultpopulation report signicant depressive symptoms every week only1% admit to suicidal thinking (Davies, Naik & Lee 2001). Althoughthe number of actual suicides is low there are many other self-harmingbehaviours which are widely practised by sufferers to cope with theirintense distress. Substance misuse, such as drug taking, alcohol misuseand compulsive eating, is perceived by sufferers as a way of dealingwith their problems. Many health practitioners on the other hand per-ceive this behaviour as the problem itself. A dietitian who appreciatesthis difference in perception will realise that, when she invites patientsto change their eating behaviour, she is asking them to give up a beha-viour that (for them) has been a solution. Giving this up can seem anextremely risky course of action to the patient. Feelings may surfaceand be so intense and overwhelming that the patient harbours suicidalthoughts. When these are expressed to the dietitian she needs to knowhow to respond. Recognising anxiety and depression Most people recognise anxiety and associate their experience of this with certain stressful events in their lives. Some people live with a continual degree of anxiety and have difculty in recalling a timewhen they felt relaxed. Anxiety affects the way in which we relate toand communicate with others. Becoming more aware of the signs of stress within ourselves and others alerts us to the need to relax(Chapter 15). The dietitian can help an anxious patient to unwind byemploying her skills of active listening (Chapters 5 and 6). Patientswho are extremely anxious may demand more in terms of time andattention than the dietitian feels able to give. It is important for the174 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC12 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 174dietitian in this situation to set clear boundaries (Chapters 4 and 8) and follow these through. Many people at some time or another will have described them- selves as depressed. This may be a normal response to a life event, forexample feeling depressed following a bereavement. When prolongedand intense, depression gives rise to loss of energy, lack of concentra-tion and lack of interest, and mood changes beyond those normallyexperienced. People may nd their sleep patterns disturbed and theirappetite altered. They may discover that daily activities take a long timeand require more effort than they can sustain. Their digestive systemmay be affected giving rise to symptoms such as heartburn, indigestionand constipation. They may suffer headaches and other non-specicaches and pains. As well as feeling ill, those who have suffered depres-sion know what it is like to despair, feel hopeless, helpless and frightenedand to consider suicide. Psychologist Dorothy Rowe, who has writtenextensively on the subject of depression, describes it as 'the most terrible sense of being trapped and alone in some horror lled prison'(Rowe 1996). In the face of another's problems it is easy and tempting to give suggestions and solutions which would appear to resolve the problem.The dietitian may respond in one of the ways mentioned below in thebelief that she is acting in the patient's best interest. Such responses,however, do carry a risk of creating a barrier between the dietitian andher patient. For example: Reassurance, e.g. 'Don't worry. Y ou'll soon get your appetite back.' Remonstrating, e.g. 'Come on now - pull yourself together.' Persuading, e.g. 'All you need to do is eat just a little more.' People who are depressed nd the idea of any action difcult and demanding. The dietitian who responds with reassurance, remonstra-tion or persuasion is failing to recognise this. The dietitian who candemonstrate her understanding through her skills of active listeningand reflective responding is likely to be perceived as empathic. When a dietitian is able to show acceptance in this way she is providing emotional support. In the following example the dietitian is seeing an elderly patient with arthritis and diabetes who was widowed theprevious year. Dietitian : How can I help? Dietitian :(after a long pause in which she observes the patient sitting very still, looking down at the floor and not making eye contact with her ) It's not easy to know how to begin, is it?Patient :( after a pause sighs deeply ) It's all so difcult. I just don't know what to do for the best.Working with Difculties in Physical and Mental Health 175CSFC12 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 175Dietitian : You have some ideas but are not sure which one would work best?Patient : I go round in circles. It's all too much effort. Dietitian : You're nding it all too much. Patient :( begins to cry quietly ) I don't know how I can carry on. Dietitian : You don't know how to carry on. ( pause in which she notices the patient nods silently ) Would it help if we talked about your ideas and worked something out together?Patient :( wipes her yes and looks up for the rst time ) Mayb e...m aybe it would help . . . I managed all right to start with but just lately . . . everything seems pointles s... why should I bother to eat when I don't feel hungry? Dietitian : You managed at rst and now there doesn't seem any point in trying.Patient : No point at al l... I'm not hungry and now Jane doesn't come in.Dietitian : You used to eat with Jane? Patient : No. Jan e...m y neighbour always came i n... regular as clock- work she wa s...t o check I was all right and to see if I wanted anything. Dietitian : And now Jane doesn't come any more. Patient : No. She's moved away - gone to live with her sister. Dietitian : You miss her visits. Patient : Yes. I can't get out much you se e...i f only I could ( sighs wistfully ). Dietitian : You'd like to get out more if that were possible? Patient : Yes, but how? Dietitian : How can you eat out more? Maybe we can come up with some ideas together?Patient : I had heard about a lunch club in the town for people like me ...( the dietitian writes this idea down and together they come up with several ideas). Dietitian : Now we've got some ideas the time has come to choose one to try out. Which would be your rst choice?Patient : I like the rst one best. Do you know anything about it? Dietitian : I have a list of lunch clubs in my ofce. Would you like me to send you a copy so you can contact one?Patient : Yes please - I feel better now having talked to you. There are many different paths this conversation could have taken. The important feature is that the dietitian provides support, which thepatient values. By using her skills of reflective responding the dietitiancreates a relationship in which the patient feels she can trust the dietitiansufciently to talk to her. Through her approach the dietitian demon-strates her respect and acceptance of the patient and her willingness to give support without providing solutions. Instead the dietitian usesskilful questioning to help the patient think of ways around the prob-lem. By inviting the patient to articulate thoughts and feelings she givesthe patient an opportunity to clarify what help she needs from others.176 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC12 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 176A patient may describe themselves as depressed or the dietitian may suspect they are feeling this way. How can she tell if this is morethan the everyday 'down' feelings that are common to being human?Patients who report a major change in mood, say they have been feeling depressed for some time or give an indication that life is nolonger worth living or that nothing seems to make any difference ormatter any more, are giving signals to alert the health professional(Kennedy 1981). Faced with a situation in which communication is difcult, the dietitian may think to herself, 'I can't get through to this person'. Feel-ing stuck in this way is frustrating and enervating and it is tempting to ask more and more questions in an effort to get the patient to talk.The dietitian who notices a 'flatness' about someone who has notresponded to encouragement or other invitations to talk and who isalert to the signals already mentioned, needs to draw this to the atten-tion of the patient's family doctor, consultant or a clinical psychologist.Dietitians who are working in the community are able to liaise with thecommunity mental health team. See Chapter 4 for issues surroundingcondentiality and referral. Thinking about eating distress Despite much research there seems to be no straightforward answer why some people use food in an abusive way which may even be life-threatening, and no denitive way of addressing the distress whichresults (Buckroyd 2005). Extensive interviews with patients reveal thatmost believe their problems arise in childhood and are associated withsome form of trauma (Goodspeed Grant & Boersma 2005). Culture tooplays a part. The culture of consumerism, the focus on body image,the widespread availability of food and possibly the addictive poten-tial of excessive intakes of fats and carbohydrates, are likely factors(Buckroyd 2005). Whatever the cause, the effect is intense emotionaldistress for the patient. Eating food, initially a source of comfort and a way to manage distressing feelings, then becomes more and moredifcult to control. Fear of losing control grows so that the idea of giving up a strategy that had previously worked and is familiar, eventhough known to be potentially life-threatening, is daunting to say theleast. Thus the excessive consumption of food which may have startedas a way to ease emotional pain and manage feelings, becomes thesource of additional emotional distress. Helping someone to break an established pattern of disordered eating behaviour is demanding work. Someone who binge-eats, forexample, may nd themselves increasingly unable to cope socially,Working with Difculties in Physical and Mental Health 177CSFC12 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 177psychologically and physically. Their relationship with food becomes a focus which can affect their relationship with others as well asinfluencing their behaviour in social and work situations. They maytake excessive doses of laxatives or resort to self-induced vomiting tocontrol their weight. In this way they can successfully maintain an out-ward appearance of normal weight. Breaking an established pattern of disordered eating behaviour is therefore demanding work for bothpatient and dietitian. Dietitians who can appreciate in some way the ambivalence felt by their patients will approach their work with them with greater sensitivity. The focus of treatment for eating disorders has changedfrom a blanket prescription of willpower, dieting and antidepressantsto include behavioural modication. Behavioural programmes pro-duce initial weight loss but this is not sustained (Wilson & Brownell2002). Cognitive-behavioural therapy programmes are being devel-oped to help patients adhere to diet and exercise (Cooper, Fairburn & Hawker 2003). As understanding of the deep emotional distressunderlying the misuse of food has developed, there is greater interestin counselling and therapy. So where do dietitians t in? When mak-ing a nutritional assessment the underlying social and psychologicalissues may become apparent. The dietitian who has an understandingof the wider background in which people currently struggle to nd a meaningful role in life, will realise something of the issues of self-image and self-nourishment which are a fundamental concern of thosein eating distress (Waskett 1993). In assessing whether or not a patient is ready or willing to change their eating behaviour, the dietitian will nd it helpful to apply the stagesof change (Prochaska & DiClemente 1986) described in Chapter 4 asa framework. She will also nd it helpful to carefully consider what sheis asking her patient to do as explained above. When thinking abouthow to help her patient the dietitian using a counselling approach willfocus rst on stage 1 of Egan's model of the helping process (Egan2004) (Chapter 4) that is, on building the relationship with the patient,paying particular attention to clarifying boundaries. The quality of thehelping relationship she can build with her patient and her competencein managing their working arrangements so that the patient feels secureenough throughout, will determine to a large extent the outcome oftheir work together. Whether anorexic, bulimic or eating compulsively the patient needs to feel accepted. She will probably have difculty in talking about herbehaviour and feelings as her need for secrecy and sense of shame,guilt and anger may be so great. She is likely to feel ambivalent abouther ability and desire to change her eating behaviour. The dietitian178 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC12 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 178who recognises her patient's needs and can offer help in a way which meets these is providing in-depth support (Table 12.1). It is important that the dietitian respects her patient's difculty and does not push her into talking about what she does with food andhow she feels. The dietitian who remains aware of the deep pain of herpatient, even when this is not apparent on the surface, will be moreable to convey her respect. Her ability to do this may be challenged at times as her patient tests the dietitian's commitment to help, forexample by missing appointments or arriving late or unexpectedly. Attimes the dietitian will probably feel frustrated, inadequate, impatientand angry with her patient. Remaining clear about what is happeningwhile showing acceptance, gentleness and patience, is demanding.The reader is recommended to read again Chapters 3 and 4, to use thereview in Chapter 8 (Table 8.2) to help her monitor what is happeningin her relationship with her patient, to concentrate on using her skillsof active listening and reflective responding as described in Chapters 5and 6, respectively. At some stage the dietitian may realise that her patient needs more time and skilled help than she can provide and may consider offeringalternative support, for example referral to the local eating disordersteam. Dietitians who are members of teams providing an eating dis-orders service may learn some ways of working interactively withpatients by observing clinical psychologists and psychiatrists. Dietitiansmay feel uncertain about the boundary between dietetic advice andpsychological intervention. Using counselling skills responsibly involvesassessing and monitoring one's ability, skills and competence and recognising when one is working beyond one's limits (Chapters 4 and15). A dietitian can learn to do this by having adequate training in counselling skills and skilled supervision as an integral part of her work.Working with Difculties in Physical and Mental Health 179 Table 12.1 Meeting a patient's needs.

Whereas in the past dietitians were most unlikely to hear a patient talk of harming themselves, nowadays it seems likely that, at some time in her career, a dietitian will hear her patient expressing thoughts ofharming themselves in some way. Understandably most helpers feelinitially shocked, anxious and helpless when a patient expresses suchthoughts. Suddenly we imagine ourselves as less competent and ndourselves thinking: Are they serious? What do I do? What do I say?The following information, based on training material developed by the Counsellors and Psychotherapists in Primary Care (Hudson-Allez 2004), and reproduced with permission, is included to helpdietitians at such a time. Steps to take : Take any indication of suicide (or other forms of self-harming) seriously - you may be tempted to ignore it, pretend you didn'thear it or make a light-hearted comment. Help the patient to talk - this will enable you to nd out more andmake a risk assessment. Discuss with the patient how they could get help. Give the patient a phone number to use in an emergency, e.g.Samaritans. Tell the patient that you are required to inform their doctor - it isbest if you can agree together what you will say or write. Discuss the impact that this has had on you with your supervisor/mentor/manager. Useful information to pass on An example is given in Chapter 4 (p. 41) in which the dietitian clearly states the limits of the condentiality she can offer. In this example shestates that she will hear what her patient has to say in condenceunless she considers this puts her patient's health at risk in which caseshe needs to inform her patient's doctor. Patients expressing suicidalthoughts are clearly putting their own health at risk. The dietitian who then refers to any agreement about condentiality that she haspreviously made with her patient, will be demonstrating that she is taking her patient's remarks seriously. The dietitian then needs toencourage the patient to talk. This gives her an opportunity to nd outthe following about the patient: How long he has been having suicidal thoughts. Whether he has ever acted upon these thoughts. Whether he has ever planned how he would take action.180 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC12 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 180Whether he can think about the effect his action may have on others. Whether he regularly practises other forms of self-harm, e.g. misuse of alcohol, drugs or food. Whether he is taking medication on which he could overdose, e.g.antidepressants. Encouraging patients to talk may seem like encouraging them to think more actively about suicide and that this will increase the likeli-hood of an attempt. However, a patient will continue to think aboutself-harm whether or not he talks about it. When he does talk and if heexperiences being accepted, believed and to some extent understood,he may feel less alone, at least for a while. Health professionals have a duty of care to patients to pass on information that would enable others to provide appropriate care.With this in mind the dietitian will need to convey to the patient herresponsibility to inform the patient's doctor so that an assessment ofrisk can be made. Table 12.2 lists some indicators of risk. Use of these indicators of risk can help the dietitian frame the information she gives the doctor. For example she could write: 'During my interview with Mr. Jones he became very distressed when talk- ing of recent life events and told me he has been having suicidal thoughtsfor the last month. Although he says he would not act upon these thoughtsI am concerned that he discusses the issues with you.' Responding to a patient who talks of suicide is further explored in the section 'Middles' in Chapter 13.Working with Difculties in Physical and Mental Health 181 Table 12.2 Indicators of risk.

The for DietitiansCSFC12 11/10/06 5:29 PM Page 182Chapter 13 Putting It into Practice 'Practice makes for true knowledge' Chinese proverb In this chapter I describe: Interview 1 - beginnings Interview 2 - middlesInterview 3 - endings In this chapter, extracts of three different interviews between dietitians and patients are used to illustrate how the interview framework can beapplied in dietetic practice. Counselling skills are applied in each inter-view. The exercises at the end of each interview are designed to helpthe reader reflect upon, comment on and learn from each example. Interview 1 - 'Beginnings' Asha is a recently qualied dietitian working in a district hospital.Today she is in the diabetic outpatient clinic. The time allocated forthe appointment is 20 minutes. The patient she is about to see is Alan,aged 45, who was diagnosed ve years ago. His blood sugar levels arecontrolled by diet alone. He has been referred to the diabetic clinicbecause these levels have been erratic for the past six months. Asha is preparing to meet Alan. She reads his medical notes which give his medical and social history, details of the medication he hasbeen prescribed and the results of blood tests and other examinations.She has been asked to assess his diet and advise as she considers appro-priate. As she has not met Alan before and knows little about him, shelets her mind wander for a moment imagining him as overweight, aCSFC13 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 183smoker, a drinker, a workaholic who sees little of his wife and chil- dren. She mentally shakes herself aware that the real person may notbe like this at all. She glances around the room. It is small, windowlessand contains two identical upright chairs, a clock on the wall and acomputer on the desk along with her les, notepad and pen. It is afunctional, characterless room, but it is quiet and not too stuffy and has easy access to the main outpatient waiting area. She thinks it couldbe more welcoming, but she has known worse. She moves the chairsso they are at an angle and a comfortable distance apart thinking thatshe will indicate to Alan to sit in the one furthest from the door andshe will have the other which will give her a corner of the desk to leanon when taking notes. She glances at her watch, and realising she is onschedule, takes a few moments to focus on being calm and relaxed. Shewalks into the main waiting area and looks around. Several people,both men and women are waiting. Which is Alan? She notes threelikely people and approaching them says in a clear voice 'I'm lookingfor Alan Bull.' 'That's me.' A man gets up and moves towards her. She smiles in acknowledgement. 'Please come this way', she says and leads the way towards the inter- view room. Motioning him to one of the chairs she says, 'Please take a seat.' She sits down, and looking at him feels surprised. Alan is not at all like she had imagined. She sees a man of average height andbuild, short dark hair greying at the temples, who is clean shaven, and is wearing a grey jacket and blue open-necked shirt. She thinks he has a pleasant face although he is frowning a little at the momentand sitting almost on the edge of the chair. Asha wonders if he is feeling anxious and decides to concentrate on putting him and herself at ease. Smiling, she says in what she trusts isa welcoming manner: 'Hallo. I'm Asha, one of the dietitians here.We've not met before and I'm wondering if you've talked to a dietitianbefore about your diet?' 'Y es. Some time ago though. Just after I was told I had diabetes I think it was.' Asha wonders if there is a record of this in the department. She wants to assess what he knows about diet as a means of controlling his diabetes and says, 'I'm wondering what you remember of thatmeeting - what you found helpful? Or maybe it wasn't helpful at all?' She decides to pose both possibilities trusting this will help himacknowledge honestly how he found the previous interview. 'I don't remember much about it except being given a lot of information about how my sugar levels would go down if I didn't eat184 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC13 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 184sweet things. So I don't - I've not got a sweet tooth anyway so it's no great problem.' Asha feels a little rebuffed by the somewhat abrupt tone in which he makes this last remark. Realising they are at Stage 1 of the helpingprocess and her task is to build a helping relationship, she decides toapply her skills of reflective responding. 'So you haven't found it difcult to avoid having sugar and foods containing a lot of sugar.' She then decides to risk asking a direct ques-tion to encourage him to identify what he perceives is the problem.She says, 'What do you think has been the biggest difculty?' 'Well I guess it's when I feel sort of dizzy. It's not every day but when it happens people tell me to have something sweet and then I feel better. It's odd really because that's the very thing I'm meant notto have', Alan replies frowning slightly. Needing to clarify what he has said Asha summarises saying 'Y ou've found the most difcult thing to cope with is the feeling like dizzinessthat happens sometimes and you've discovered you feel better whenyou eat something sweet but you're thinking that doesn't make sensebecause sweet foods are what you've been told not to have.' 'Absolutely. Can you explain it?'Asha recognises this as Alan's way of challenging her. It is also an opportunity to take a diet history and move into the next stage of the interview. However, she remembers she has not claried thetime they have available nor how they are going to spend it. Neitherhas she explained her agenda which is to assess his diet and advise him appropriately. She thinks his dizzy spells may be signs of hypo-glycaemia and realises she can explain how he can avoid these by managing his diet. To do this she will need to assess his diet and advisehim accordingly thus fullling her own agenda. She recognises toothat she needs to continue to build a helping relationship and that they are likely to need another appointment to complete their work.Glancing at the clock she says 'I'm aware we have 15 minutes lefttoday. How would it be with you if we spend some of that time sortingout how your dizzy spells seem to respond to taking sugar - somethingyou know it is best if you don't eat - and leave time for you to ask meany questions you want to about your diet? We also need to discusswhether you would like another appointment and if so when we canarrange that'. 'Sounds good to me', he says with a small smile, sitting back in his chair. This concludes the beginning section of the interview. Exercise 13.1 allows the reader to reflect on this stage of the interview.Putting It into Practice 185CSFC13 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 185Interview 2 - 'Middles' Kate is a senior-grade dietitian working in the community. She is meeting Jenny, aged 33, for the rst time. Jenny, who has a body massindex (BMI) of 38 kg/m 2, has been having episodes of binge-eating. The time allocated for the interview is 45 minutes. Below is a summaryof the rst 15 minutes. Summary of the beginning stage Kate's rst impression was that Jenny was anxious and her some- what dishevelled appearance led Kate to wonder if she did not caremuch about the impression she made. Maybe she simply had toomany demands made of her? She appeared slightly overweight andspoke quickly as though she should hurry although Kate had alreadyclaried how long they had together and Jenny had nodded in agree-ment. Kate had concentrated on putting Jenny at her ease and hadexplained to her that she had been asked to assess Jenny's diet. Whenasked why she had sought help with her eating Jenny had explained186 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 13.1 The interview framework In the extract above what tasks appropriate to the beginning stage of the interview does Asha focus on? Are there any tasks that you considerappropriate to this stage which she has left out? How could Asha havehandled these differently? What are your reasons for these suggestions? Communication skills What assumptions, if any, does Asha make and how do they help or hinder the progress of the interview? What signicance, if any, do you attach to Asha's non-verbal com-munications? Identify the different types of response Asha makesduring the interview, e.g. summarising. How might you have respondeddifferently and why? How does Asha build a helping relationship? How successful do youthink she is? Many dietitians nd it helpful to role play situations such as the inter- view between Asha and Alan with a colleague. In doing this it is valuableto enact both roles so that you get an experience of being both the dietitian and the patient. Allow time to discuss with your colleague andto debrief before switching roles and at the end of the exercise.CSFC13 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 186that she had been struggling to control her weight for the past two years since the birth of her second child. In Kate's opinion Jenny needed to lose 3-4 kg, however, Jenny had declared she should lose twicethat. She had returned to hairdressing 18 months ago and enjoyed the company of colleagues and clients. Although a large proportion of her earnings went on child care this had become less recently as hereldest child was now at school. She had gone on to say she was 'sick to death' with not being able to get back to the weight she had beenbefore she had her children and badly wanted Kate to help her do this.They had agreed they would spend most of their time today assessinghow best to help Jenny. Kate had felt alarmed when Jenny had usedphrases like 'sick to death' and she had explained to Jenny that what-ever she said was condential between them but that if she consideredJenny's health to be at risk she would want Jenny's agreement that shecould talk to her doctor about these concerns. Jenny had said this wasall right with her. The middle stage The interview now continues. Kate invites Jenny to tell her more about her eating patterns and Jenny starts to tell Kate about a mealshe had the previous weekend with friends from work to celebrate abirthday. Her voice is low, she speaks quickly with her gaze xed onthe wall between them. 'I'd been really looking forward to going out - I hardly ever have the chance these days. All day I'd been telling myself I would only have a main course and a coffee but I knew I'd blown it when everyonestarted ordering desserts. I ordered the chocolate fudge cake - I reallylove it - how could I resist? Anyway a while afterwards I began to feel stuffed to bursting point - sort of bloated and I knew I shouldn'thave eaten it all. Then before we all left the restaurant I went to the loo and caught sight of myself in the mirror. I looked awful! I feltawful! I wanted to die I felt so bad. One of my friends came to get me - I'd been there so long - and we then went home. I'm not sure how I got there but the next thing I remember was waking up and vowingto myself I wouldn't eat another thing ever again. So you see the wholeevening was a disaster. I reckon I'm a pretty hopeless case!', Jennygives a hollow laugh. Kate notices the tears in Jenny's eyes and is aware of feeling increasingly anxious herself as she listens. Is Jenny saying she wants to commit suicide? Kate wonders how much, if any, alcohol Jenny drank that evening, whether she has had similar experiences in the past andwhether she had made herself vomit or taken laxatives while alone inPutting It into Practice 187CSFC13 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 187the toilet at the restaurant. How should she respond to Jenny? Kate focuses on being calm and keeping her eyes on Jenny's face she speaksslowly, her voice at normal volume and her tone gentle. 'I can see you feel very upset and I hear you say you think the whole evening was a disaster. Y ou seem very ashamed of eating a dessert - so ashamed you even wished you didn't exist anymore.' She pausesnoticing Jenny is looking down at the floor. When Jenny doesn't sayanything Kate continues, 'I'm thinking it took a lot of courage for youto tell me what happened.' Jenny looks up with a surprised expression.'Courage? I've never thought of myself as having courage. It's morethat I'm desperate.' She sighs. After a few moments she continues, 'I can talk to you - you don't tell me what I should and shouldn't do all the time like some people.' Kate registers this remark as an indication that Jenny is building trust in her relationship with Kate. She notes also Jenny's acknowledgementthat she is feeling desperate. Is this an indication of her motivation to change or another indication of suicidal thoughts in which caseKate will need to refer her for an assessment of her mental health. Sheneeds to know more and so says to Jenny, 'I'm glad you feel you canconde in me and I want to help you. When you say that after the meallast weekend you felt desperate and you wished you could die I'mwondering whether this is the rst time you've felt so bad or whetheryou often think about suicide? Can you tell me more?' 'Y es, quite often. I wouldn't actually do anything though 'cos of the children. My doctor thinks it's because I'm depressed and I supposehe's right. I feel worse about myself when I can't control my eating. I guess that's why he sent me to see you.' 'So your doctor knows you've been having suicidal thoughts which seem to be more frequent when you don't seem to be able to controlwhat you are eating.' Kate wants to clarify what Jenny perceives as her goal. 'Y ou want to be able to control what you eat?' Jenny nods. 'Is this a problem for you all the time or only on particular occasionslike last weekend when you eat out with others?' 'Oh I guess it's pretty much in my mind a lot of the time.'Jenny continues to tell Kate how low she has felt since her second child was born two years ago, how tired she is all the time, how isolatedshe feels and how worried she is that she is not being a good mother.The more Kate hears of Jenny's life the more she realises that Jenny'sdifculties are compounded by her circumstances. She also realisesthey have ten minutes left. She decides to focus on making a contractwith Jenny. She starts by summarising their interview so far. 'Jenny I'm aware we have ten minutes left today and I'd like rst to recap on what we've talked about. From what you tell me you have188 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC13 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 188been nding life a struggle for a long time, anxious that you are not managing well enough and feeling alone with your problems. Y ou tryto control yourself by restricting what you eat 'cos while you can dothis you feel better about yourself. The problem is that when you theneat something you've told yourself you shouldn't, you feel so bad aboutyourself that you eat even more and so end up feeling even worse.'Kate pauses and sees Jenny nod. She continues, 'I'm wondering howbest to help you. We could arrange another meeting to talk more abouthow you could adjust what you eat to lose a little weight on a balanceddiet. Maybe I could help you think how you could say no, for exampleto the dessert in the restaurant, so that another time you have somenew ways of coping if you think that would help?' Jenny nods and Katecontinues, 'I think we will need three, maybe four meetings to do this- how would that be with you?' For the rst time Kate sees a smile flit across Jenny's face. She says to Kate, 'I'd like that.' Kate wonders if Jenny would be willing to consider other sources of help for her depression, isolation and low self-worth. She continues'I'm also wondering what you think about talking to someone, forexample your health visitor or a counsellor about how you feel sodepressed?' Jenny frowns slightly. 'Do you really think that would help? Some- times I think I'm going mad - I think I do need help but who do I go to?' Hearing Jenny pose this question, Kate decides to take the oppor- tunity to explain to Jenny that her family doctor would be the best person to ask. Most medical practices nowadays have access to theservices of a counsellor albeit only for short-term counselling. The extract ends here as they move into the ending stage of their interview which is spent sorting out future appointments, givingJenny an opportunity to say how she has found the interview and to ask Kate any questions. The reader is invited to read through thetext again, and complete Exercises 13.2 and 13.3 which focus on the interview framework and using the person-centred approach,respectively.Putting It into Practice 189 Exercise 13.2 (1) Using the summary of the beginning stage of the interview name the tasks that Kate has completed. (2) What tasks has Kate fullled in this middle stage of the interview?(3) If you were in Kate's place how would you conduct these tasks?CSFC13 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 189In Exercise 13.4 the reader is invited to consider how Kate could apply her knowledge of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) (Chapter 7) attheir subsequent meetings. Kate reflects on her interview with Jenny After the interview Kate feels concerned about Jenny, and she is unsure of how she handled the interview and how to proceed next time. She decides to use the framework for review outlined in Chapter 8(see Table 8.2). Aware of condentiality Kate accepts that any notesshe makes are for her own personal use and that she will destroy these once she nishes the exercise. She thinks 'What do I know ofJenny?', and notes on a blank piece of paper: Female, 33 years. Whatis Jenny's health like? Kate writes 'Binges, slightly overweight sincerst pregnancy, expressed suicidal thoughts in our interview and said she often feels like this. Said her GP [general practitioner] knowsabout her suicidal ideation'. Kate now begins to feel more enthusiastic about doing this review and moves on to the section on social information. She notes 'Hairdresser190 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 13.4 Refer to the section 'Helping someone towards clearer thinking' in Chapter 7. Read again the interview between Kate and Jenny and thencomplete the following. (1) Note the words that Jenny says which indicate distorted thinking. (2) Take each example of distorted thinking in turn and consider what assumption Jenny could be making which underlies this thought,e.g. 'I hardly ever have the chance.' Possible assumption: 'I'm afailure.' (3) Suppose you were to make similar assumptions and think as Jenny does. What replacement thoughts would you develop? It is helpful to discuss ideas and role play with colleagues possible ways in which you might help Jenny towards clearer thinking.Exercise 13.3 (1) How does Kate demonstrate each of the core conditions of empathy, acceptance and genuineness? (2) What effect does this have on her relationship with Jenny?(3) How aware is Kate of her own feelings? How does she use this awareness?CSFC13 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 190- enjoys job and company'. Looking at the next points she suddenly realises Jenny said nothing about a partner or husband or the father(or fathers) of her children or other members of her family, her homeor anyone who provides support. Although she mentioned the friendsshe went out with for the meal Kate is struck by this gap in her know-ledge of Jenny. For a moment she berates herself thinking she shouldhave asked Jenny but then she thinks to herself 'It's interesting in itself that Jenny did not mention any of this'. She notes on her paper'Talked of friends but no mention made of partner/family. What aboutsupport?'. Under presenting issues Kate notes that Jenny had come tosee her because she was 'desperate' to control her eating and consideredher problem to be her inability to get back to her pre-pregnancy weight.Kate, however, wonders whether Jenny's problem lies in her depres-sion and that food has become signicant for her as a way of copingwith whatever it is that is making her feel depressed. Kate now turns her attention to the section of her review on working together. First what did Jenny want from her? Kate recalls Jenny say-ing 'I want to get back to the weight I was before I became pregnant'and this being twice the weight loss Kate thought necessary. Katewonders if Jenny was underweight before becoming pregnant, may be having a history of a disordered relationship with food. So wasJenny wanting Kate to help her explore this? Kate begins to feel anxious and out of her depth. She asks herself 'What can I offerJenny?', and feels pleased that she was able to be clear with Jennyabout the number of appointments they could have and how theycould use them to help Jenny feel more in control. Jenny had seemedpleased about this. Kate also thought she had helped Jenny by rais-ing the idea of her getting help with her mental state and felt pleasedthat Jenny had said she would think about this. On the whole Kateconsidered their relationship so far had developed satisfactorily. Shenotes on her paper 'history of issues with food and weight preced-ing pregnancies. Has agreed to four appointments to explore ways of making food choices including diet assessment. Will think aboutcounselling for depression'. As she reads through the notes she hasmade, Kate feels pleased she has done this exercise. She nishes off by thinking about the points she wants to consider further as her work with Jenny progresses: continuing to build a helping relationshipand possibly drawing on her knowledge of CBT to help Jenny thinkdifferently about her reactions to food and her weight. She thinksJenny could benet from more support than the few sessions she isoffering, especially concerning the non-diet related issues, and shewants to help Jenny access some counselling through her GP if that iswhat Jenny decides she wants.Putting It into Practice 191CSFC13 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 191Interview 3 - 'Endings' Ann is a senior dietitian with a particular interest in group work and weight management. Savita, aged 48, has been a member of Ann'sweight management group and a month ago completed a course often sessions during which her BMI dropped from 55.3 kg/m 2to 50.5 kg/m2. This extract is from an individual 30-minute follow-up session which Ann routinely offers to each person in the group. Ann welcomes Savita.'How are you', she enquires.'Not too bad,' says Savita. 'It seems strange coming here without the others.' 'Y es doesn't it,' agrees Ann. 'As we discussed at our last group meeting I see today as an opportunity for us to complete the work wehave done together and to say goodbye. I'm wondering how you feelabout this being our last meeting?' 'A bit anxious to tell you the truth' says Savita. 'How am I going to manage on my own? I'm doing OK at the moment but what if I can'tkeep it up - there's a big family wedding in three months time whichcould be a difcult time for me. I don't want to slip back to old ways of eating.' 'Hmm . . . a difcult time - not only the wedding itself but all the preparations too . . . you're feeling anxious when you think about it. And now the group has nished I imagine you're thinking you'regoing to be more on your own?' Savita nods and Ann continues,'Would it help if we discussed this more in a few minutes?' Savita nodsagain and Ann continues, 'I think it would be helpful rst if we take abroad view and look back to when we rst met, how you were then . . .over the work you have done on yourself since and the changes youhave made to your eating habits . . . I'm wondering how you see yourself now?' Savita takes a deep breath giving herself time to think. She speaks slowly and thoughtfully. 'Well when I rst came to see you I felt verybad about myself - I hated the way I looked but I couldn't see how I could do anything about it - I felt really stuck. Now I can see ways Ican do things differently - like I don't have to always eat whatever I can lay my hands on whenever I feel fed up. I can talk more abouthow I feel instead of stufng it down inside myself.' Savita smiles atAnn, who realising the signicance of what Savita has said, wants to afrm this for her. She says, 'So making the connection between feeling miserable and eating has been important for you and you arenow nding another way to deal with your feelings.' Savita nods andAnn continues 'I wonder what Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC13 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 192Savita replies without any hesitation, 'Oh it was hearing some of the others in the group - going to those meetings was really useful once I'd plucked up the courage to join.' Ann is surprised as she remembers Savita being one of the quiet ones in the group. Savita continues 'I learned so much from the others - asthey talked I thought I'm not the only one - other people feel like meand do dreadful things with food too. I began to feel less ashamed.' 'So feeling better about yourself has helped you take more care of yourself - to change the way you were using food?', Ann wonders ifshe has understood correctly. 'Y es I guess so. It's a struggle though. Some days are easier than others but I try to take one day at a time.' Savita looks at Ann whonods encouragingly. She continues quickly. 'It's hardest when I'm toomuch alone or when I get very tired or days when everything seems to go wrong. Then I worry I haven't lost more weight and I think Ishould have and the doctor will be cross and I will have failed. ThereI've said it . . inadequate.' Ann feels moved. Savita is sharing her vulnerability with Ann who says gently, 'The times when the struggle seems hardest is when youfeel isolated and miserable and nothing seems to go right? That'swhen you feel bad about yourself ? And then want to eat?' Ann feels asthough she is struggling herself at this point. She watches Savita nodmiserably. 'And how is it different on another day?' Savita smiles a little. 'When I am doing something I want to. Like the computer course I've just started - it's only once a week but it'sgood. And someone has asked me to help them with catering for a party they are having - I feel so pleased to be asked. They said theywanted traditional Indian dishes and I do enjoy cooking - especiallyfor others. And when I'm busy and enjoying myself, eating isn't some-thing I want to do - I forget about it! Hard to believe but it's true!'They both smile sharing Savita's moment of pleasure. 'Y ou said how much you learned from being in the group - what, if anything, do you think you have learned about food and health that isuseful to you?', Ann asks. 'Oh the discussions we had about healthy food - what was healthy about it and new things to try. Actually it was good to hear that manypulses, fruits and vegetables - the foods I have always used - arehealthy and that others want to try them - that made me feel good! I do know though that too much ghee and sugar is not good. I likedthe class when we each brought a favourite dish - several people saidhow much they liked mine!' 'It sounds as though being part of the group where you felt appre- ciated and valued and you could learn from others was a rewardingPutting It into Practice 193CSFC13 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 193experience for you and has given you condence. And now that support has nished what do you think will take its place?', Ann asks. 'Y es it's difcult - but the best thing is I do keep in touch with two people from the group. We help each other - we talk on the phone. It's good to have someone I can call if I want to talk and I feel pleasedtoo when they call me - it's like we're in it together.' 'So being able to talk to others who you know will understand is important - and you will have this support at the time of the wedding?'Savita nods thoughtfully. 'Y es that's true - I do think I'm going to nd the wedding itself and the time leading up to it stressful. It's going to be a challenge but I cansee now that I can get through it with the support of my friends. I dohope so - I've come this far I'm determined to keep going this time.Thank you for all your help - it's meant a lot to me.' 'Thank you. I wish you well. I think you will be able to draw on all you have learned to help you - keeping in touch with the others isimportant too for them and for you. I am referring you back to yourdoctor now letting him know we have completed our work together.What would you like me to say?' ' O h...h m m...w ell I suppose that I have lost weight and that it has all been very helpfu l... and I hope to keep it up - something like that.' 'How about I say Savita has completed the weight management course which she found helpful and supportive. She succeeded in losing weight - her BMI has changed from 55 to 50 and she is deter-mined to continue with her healthy eating plan.' 'Y es that's ne. Ann - thank you so much for your help.' Savita gets up preparing to leave and smiling warmly at Ann holds out her hand.Ann shakes her hand. 'Goodbye Savita - I have truly enjoyed our worktogether. Good luck with all your plans.' She shows Savita to the doorand closes it behind her. Exercise 13.5 is designed to help the reader review the ending stage of the interview and apply the review of the dietetic interview(see Chapter 8, Table 8.2).194 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 13.5 Using the questions in the review of the dietetic interview (Table 8.2) at the end of Chapter 8 and the extract from the interview here imagineyourself in Ann's place. Make notes reviewing Ann's last interview withSavita. You may nd it helpful to review Ann's work with a colleague using your notes, also to explore what you have learned from doing the exercisethat you could apply in your own interview procedure.CSFC13 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 194Points to make As explained in Chapter 12 and raised in the second interview in this chapter (Kate and Jenny) dietitians may feel uncertain about theboundary between dietetic counselling and psychological interven-tion. Review and assessment of her ability, skills and competence are essential if the dietitian is to be able to recognise when she is working beyond her limits (Chapters 4 and 15). In Part 4 the themesof support and ongoing personal and professional development are further examined.Putting It into Practice 195CSFC13 10/10/06 8:36 PM Page 195Part 4 Areas for Personal Development Using counselling skills requires the dietitian to consciously focus on another person while at the same time being aware of what she is thinking, doing and feeling. In becoming more aware and open to herself she becomes more open and aware to others. The furtheralong this path she goes the more effective she becomes in applyingher skills. She needs support in this journey of personal develop-ment which is an integral part of being able to work interactively with others. The process of personal development is an ongoing onewhich demands time, energy and commitment, and at times is pain-ful, arduous and challenging, but it can also be joyful and satisfying, bringing immeasurable rewards and signicant personal learning(Rogers 2004). Although it is intended that the dietitian uses the material in Part 4 for her support and personal development, she may also take from itideas which she considers appropriate to use with patients. Some ndbooks about personal development are informative and supportiveand a selection are included in Appendix 1. Some nd much to learnfrom personal development courses and workshops that are becomingincreasingly available. However, there is no substitute for experienceand dietitians are recommended to use as many opportunities as theycan to apply the skills and ideas outlined in Part 4. Many people ndthat keeping a journal or reflective diary is a useful tool. This may take the form of the reflective diary that dietitians include as part oftheir portfolio or it may be a separate and more intimate account ofpersonal thoughts and feelings. In Chapter 14, I explore ways in which the dietitian, faced with some difcult situations in her work, can further her ability to communicateeffectively by developing assertiveness skills and strategies for dealingwith difcult situations. Such personal development includes buildingself-esteem, enhancing self-awareness and managing personal stress.CSFC14 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 197198 Counselling Skills for Dietitians These subjects, together with giving support to others and receiving it for oneself, are explored in Chapter 15. Reference Rogers, C. (2004) On Becoming a Person . Constable & Robinson, London.CSFC14 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 198Chapter 14 Dealing with Difcult Situations at Work 'An event has happened upon which it is difcult to speak and impossible to be silent.' Edmund Burke (1789) In this chapter I discuss: When the dietitian is confronted Developing assertiveness Steps towards becoming more assertive Giving criticism and praiseReceiving criticism and praise Dealing with aggressivebehaviour An ABC for handlingconfrontations Difcult situations arise from time to time between dietitian and patient and between dietitian and colleague who may be another dieti-tian, another health professional or a member of staff in a subordinateor superior position. Misunderstandings and miscommunicationsoften lie at the heart of any difcult situation. Our willingness to con-tinually examine and develop our communication skills enables us tolearn something from each experience. Examples of difcult situationsfaced by dietitians are given as illustrations throughout this chapter. When the dietitian is confronted When we feel threatened or attacked it is difcult not to react defensively and respond either passively or aggressively. Remarks and comments which are perceived as criticisms reinforce self-doubtand result in a lowering of self-esteem (Chapter 15). Frequently such CSFC14 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 199confrontations are expressed manipulatively and the dietitian may not be sure exactly what is being challenged. Sometimes the dietitian ischallenged by the patient. For example, a patient may complain aboutthe diet and yet could be upset about the system in the clinic/ward, thedietetic/medical profession as a whole, or the health service in general.The dietitian may somehow feel personally criticised. When a patientsays accusingly, 'It's up to you to make sure I get the right food' thedietitian's rst reaction is likely to be one of anxiety. At other timesremarks are made by colleagues, managers and health professionalsfrom other disciplines. The suddenness of an attack can be a shock andthe dietitian may be so taken aback that she responds in a seeminglycalm manner. Once the initial shock has worn off she may respondpassively or aggressively. After an incident in which a patient has sworn, shouted or made an abusive remark at the dietitian she will most likely feel especiallyanxious. She may or may not want to talk about this to others and may rationalise her feelings by telling herself that it is not important,the patient did not mean it, it could have happened to anyone. Shemay blame the patient or herself for provoking the outburst and may feel afraid of a similar occurrence in the future. She may thinkthat it is over and done with, yet continue to experience disturbingdreams. Debrieng after such an event is necessary so that the dieti-tian may use the experience constructively. It is of great value for the dietitian to have colleagues with whom she can talk and who can offer her support. Guidelines are given in this chapter for dealing withverbal abuse and risky situations. Chapter 15 gives further guide-lines for giving and receiving support. Exercise 14.1 is designed tohelp the reader become aware of when she has been in situations ofthis sort. 'You don't understand' Fortunately, it is not every day that dietitians are confronted with verbal abuse. Confrontation is more often indirect; for example, the comment'Y ou don't know what it's like' may be made or implied as when a200 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 14.1 Think of occasions when you have felt confronted, challenged or criticised. You do not have to limit yourself to interactions with patients. There arelikely to be times with ward staff, medical staff and colleagues. How didyou respond? How did you feel? What did you do?CSFC14 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 200patient says, 'I've been a diabetic for 40 years and I know what I can and can't have - my life has got to be tolerable after all!'. The dietitian whois aware of the hidden message contained in such remarks and is ableto confront this openly and directly is less likely to feel manipulated. Obvious differences in age, gender or culture may encourage a patient to believe that the dietitian cannot understand their situation.The dietitian is often considerably younger than the patient. Or shemay be a great deal older, for example a middle-aged dietitian and ateenage girl with anorexia. A recently qualied dietitian in her twentiesinevitably will have less experience than someone who has been qualiedand practising for a number of years. The dietitian will also have a different life experience from her patients. So the remark 'Y ou don't know what it's like' is accurate. No-one can know what it is like to be another person and in their particular situation. Any experience we have had may be similar butcannot be the same. However, although we may be a different age, gen-der, social class and culture, we have all experienced anger, fear, sadness and joy. The extent to which we can empathise with another'sfeelings in any particular situation is the extent to which we can demon-strate our understanding. The most effective way to demonstrate understanding is by reflective responding (Chapter 6). When demonstrating empathy in this mannerwe provide one of the core conditions for a therapeutic relationship, as described in Chapter 3. The following response is one way in whichthe dietitian could demonstrate this: Patient : I've been a diabetic for 40 years and I know what I can and can't have - my life has got to be tolerable after all!Dietitian : You have managed your diabetes for many years and know what you like and don't like to have. ( tentatively ) You seem worried that any changes I suggest means your diet will become more restricted?Patient :( nods) Yes - that's just what I was thinking! Dietitian :(stating her purpose ) That's not my intention at all. I want to help you to eat as much variety as possible while at the same time having ahealthy diet. Difcult situations with colleagues When faced with a difcult situation three questions are worth con- sidering carefully (Dickson 2004): What is happening? How do I feel about it? What would I like to be different?Dealing with Difficult Situations at Work 201CSFC14 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 201The following are three examples of dietitians considering different difcult situations. Nicky, a basic-grade dietitian working in a district hospital, has learned that an inpatient has not been receiving the food supplementsshe has arranged for him to have. He had seemed so ill and grateful for her interest in him. She had gone to a lot of trouble to ensure he would be given the supplements. She feels annoyed to learn he had not been getting these. She also feels afraid that she might be atfault although she cannot understand how this could be. She is sureshe followed the correct procedure. What shall she say to him? Whatshall she say to the nursing staff or the doctor? She wants to appearprofessional and condent and to be able to sort out the situation satisfactorily so that it does not happen again. However, she is anxiousthat she will be nervous, and appear weak and ineffectual. Tina, a community dietitian, is thinking about a situation with a general practitioner (GP). It has come to her attention that he is hand-ing out very-low-calorie diet sheets to patients, which she considersinappropriate. She feels annoyed when she realises patients are gettingconflicting advice. She feels anxious about speaking to him because he has been short-tempered with her in the past. She is also worriedthat somehow he will turn the tables and she will end up thinking of herself in the wrong. When she speaks to him this time she wouldlike to be able to express her concerns clearly and calmly, to feel atease with him and to gain his co-operation. Jo, another community dietitian, is meeting Fran, a practice nurse. A diabetic patient had said to Jo that Fran had told her not to eatbananas and grapes. Jo is concerned that Fran is giving incorrectdietary advice and patients are getting confused. She feels annoyedwith Fran and wants to put her right but is anxious that Fran will get defensive and aggressive towards her. Like Tina she would like to be able to express her concerns clearly and calmly, to feel at easewith Fran and to gain her co-operation. Although their situations are different each dietitian has similar thoughts and feelings. They all want their respective conversations tobe a more rewarding experience than in the past. For this to happen,each needs rst to be clear about the outcome they want. IdeallyNicky wants reassurance that she fullled her part, that her patient isnot worse as a result of not getting the feeds and he will be given thesupplements in future. Tina would like the GP to agree to use the dietsheets she has available. Jo would like Fran to give the same advice asshe does. Being aware of their own thoughts and feelings and know-ing what outcome they would like means they are each in a strongerposition to communicate what they want assertively.202 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC14 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 202Developing assertiveness Assertiveness means different things to different people and many are confused between assertiveness and aggression. Behaving assertivelyinvolves recognising our needs, expressing our thoughts and feelings,asking for what we want and listening to the other person. Beingassertive is about being open and honest and communicating directlyto the person concerned. When we behave assertively we are express-ing an attitude of respect and acceptance of ourselves and the otherperson. We are acknowledging ourselves and others as human beings,each with qualities and frailties and each having a right to their uniqueview of the world. Speaking to be heard rather than speaking to beright is far from easy. We are constantly limited by our lack of per-ceptiveness, our fear of being in the wrong, our patterns of behaviour,and our social and cultural conditioning. We are able to behave assertively when our self-esteem is high, when we value and accept ourselves - in other words when we perceive our-selves as 'I'm OK' and others as 'you're OK' (Berne 1970). This is adifcult attitude to maintain in an institution based on hierarchiessuch as the National Health Service (NHS), where one position in theorganisation is seen as superior or inferior to another. This makes it difcult for staff to communicate honestly and directly with oneanother. On the one hand it is safer and more comforting to complainto a third party and evoke their sympathy than to risk the discomfortand uncertain consequences of confronting the person concerned. Onthe other hand the change we desire does not then take place. How-ever, when we perceive ourselves and others as being neither superiornor inferior but as unique individuals, all with a valuable and differentpart to play, we are more likely to engage in open communication. As a result, changes are more likely to occur. Many people mistakenlythink that those who are assertive are always calm and condent anddo not feel angry or frightened. Anger, fear, nervousness and anxietyare emotions which we can communicate assertively, passively, mani-pulatively or aggressively. We are more able to behave assertively whenthe intensity of feeling is low. As emotions accumulate their intensitybuilds, discomfort increases and we express how we feel indirectlythrough manipulation or explosively through aggressive behaviour.Those who value their self-esteem will place great importance onacknowledging their feelings appropriately at an early stage when thelevel of feeling is manageable and acceptable for them. In understanding assertiveness, it is useful to compare assertive- ness with other ways of behaving, such as aggressiveness, passivity andmanipulation.Dealing with Difficult Situations at Work 203CSFC14 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 203Aggression Aggression is about winning and getting our own way. When we think, 'Y ou should . . .' and 'If I were you I'd do it this way' we are likely to feel frustrated and behave aggressively. Self-esteem is low and weattempt to feel better about ourselves by attacking and belittling thethoughts, values and capabilities of someone else. Aggression can beconveyed in low tones as well as raised voices. Other non-verbal signsmay be obvious (shaking a st) or subtle (pursing the lips). Often we may not think we are being aggressive and are surprised when welearn that we have been perceived that way. The resentment we havefelt, but think we have successfully suppressed, leaks out through ourcommunication. Passivity Passivity is about protecting ourselves and avoiding conflict and responsibility. When we behave passively we are anxious to please and willing to t in with another at the expense of our own needs.However, we also lay ourselves open to being used and abused. Whensomeone feels powerless and thinks of themselves as a victim of othersor of their circumstances, and turns their anger inwards by blamingthemselves, they behave passively. They may think, 'It's all my fault. If only I'd . . .'. At other times they may explode aggressively with 'It'sall your fault, if only you had . . .'. Either way they maintain their lowself-esteem and risk depression. Manipulation Manipulation uses techniques of persuasion, deviousness and cunning to get another to behave in a certain way. Often this is done in the formof a threat, for example, 'if you don't lose weight you'll become moreand more disabled'. A situation is presented as being for the good ofthe other person. In denying the other person their right or ability tochoose for themselves, the manipulative person is expressing a need to control another. Steps towards becoming more assertive No-one uses one form of behaviour exclusively. We react differently indifferent situations (Exercise 14.2). Behaving assertively increases theoptions for handling different situations. We experience having more204 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC14 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 204personal power when we have more options. Becoming more assertive is a developmental process and does not happen as a result of attend-ing a course or reading a book. Training courses and books providefoundations and information on which to build, but it is through continual practice, self-assessment and ongoing support that lastingchange takes place. Prepare to behave assertively by being clear about what you want to say, how you feel and the outcome that you want. Y ou can do this by asking yourself the following questions: Who is it I want to talk to? What do I want to say? How do I want to say it? When do I want to say it? Where do I want the communication to take place? What effect do I want to produce? What do I want to happen as a result? Practise behaving assertively by: writing down what you want to say; making sure your message is specic and not long-winded; including how you feel and what you think; speaking for yourself using 'I', e.g. I yourself delivering your message effectively; rehearsing with someone with whom you feel safe. Deliver your message assertively by: speaking clearly, audibly and rmly; maintaining eye contact and an open body posture; focusing on keeping calm and relaxed. Listen to the response by: hearing what the other person says; reflecting to them to demonstrate that you have heard and to clarify your understanding;Dealing with Difficult Situations at Work 205 Exercise 14.2 Notice how you behave in different situations. Make a note of when you would like to be more assertive. Start by being aware of how you behave.Is this passively, aggressively or manipulatively?CSFC14 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 205being prepared to repeat your assertion or to give another if this is appropriate. The following situation is an example of a dietitian applying these skills when asking her manager for annual leave. Manager :(aggressively ) I can't have more than one of you off at the same time. Pat has already asked me for that week.Dietitian :(reflecting what has been said ) I understand that Pat has asked for that week, and that ideally you would prefer only one of us to be away.(stating her position ) My problem is that I've been offered a place on a course I applied for. I've only just heard it's available now because some-one has cancelled.Manager : Well that's really inconvenient. I suppose you could ask Pat if she'll change but I really can't have both of you away at the same time.Dietitian :(maintaining her assertion ) I do want to do the course and feel disappointed about turning down this opportunity. I appreciate the timingis inconvenient. I will discuss it rst with Pat as you suggest and then comeback to you. When rst confronted we may feel surprise and react in a way which later we regret. For example, in the situation above the dietitian maybehave passively saying meekly, 'That's OK. I won't go then' or mani-pulatively by saying 'Oh if Pat's already got that week I'll just have toturn down the offer'. In either case she is likely to feel resentful andher manager more annoyed. Giving criticism and praise Some people give criticism without rst considering the effect theirremarks may have on others. Others feel so uncomfortable with theidea of having to criticise someone they hesitate to give it and spendtime planning what to say so that the other person will not be upset.206 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 14.3 Read again the difcult situations for Nicky, Tina and Jo described earlier in this chapter. Now think how each could express themselvesassertively by applying the guidelines given above: Nicky to her patientand ward staff, Tina to the GP and Jo to the practice nurse. It can behelpful to do the exercise with a partner so that you can compare notesand role play the scenarios. The aim of the person being Nicky, Tina orJo is to maintain assertive behaviour for as long as they are able to duringthe conversation.CSFC14 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 206They may hesitate so long that their feelings become too strong to contain. Then when they do speak their communication is aggressive,as in the following example of a dietitian saying impatiently to a student 'Y ou should do it as you were shown the rst time'. Later, and with more exasperation she says 'Y ou still haven't got it right'. Both remarks are examples of criticisms which blame the other person and so are likely to produce a defensive response. A dietitianbehaving assertively would be more likely to say: 'I am concerned that you may not fully understand how to do it' followed by 'I think it would be a good idea if we went through the procedure again'.Although the student may feel upset these remarks are more likely to be received and accepted as feedback to be considered and actedon. The dietitian is conveying an attitude of imparting information to be heard rather than a desire to attach blame. Dietitians wanting torespond assertively nd it useful to express what they want to say byconstructing a sentence based on: What I observe , followed by a phrase describing the situation, e.g. 'I notice the medical notes are not available'. Or if more appropriate: What I hear the other person say , e.g. 'When you tell me the medical notes aren't available . . .'. Followed by: How e.g. feel concerned', 'I feel frustrated'. What I think , e.g. 'I think it's important I read them before I see the patient'. What I want/would like , followed by the outcome they desire, e.g. 'I want to know how I can get hold of them' or 'I would like to gethold of them straight away'. When this structure is followed, the remark is specic, open and honest. The phrase 'When (you) . . I feel/I think . . .' is effective inboth stating the facts as you perceive them and expressing how youfeel or what you think about the situation and can be usefully used togive praise or offer compliments. For example, when a dietitian says toa student 'When you gave your talk on diet and renal disease I thoughtyou presented the information very clearly'. When the sentence includessummarising or paraphrasing what the other person has just said it also acknowledges their difculties, which gives scope for furtherexploration of the problem. For example, a dietitian, responding to astudent who has not handed in a piece of work, says: 'When you tellme about your difculties at home I realise why you have found itDealing with Difficult Situations at Work 207CSFC14 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 207difcult to get your work done on time. I want to have marked all the essays by the end of the week. When can you let me have yours?' The more able we are to give feedback which is specic, concise and acknowledges those concerned, the more fullling our experience.Communicating more openly and honestly requires that the dietitianremains non-defensive. She therefore needs to learn how to protectherself and behave assertively, as distinct from defending herself andbehaving aggressively, passively or manipulatively. Receiving criticism and praise When we think we are being criticised and feel hurt, afraid, anxious,angry and confused, we can protect ourselves by behaving assertively.We usually deal with criticism by denying it, so avoiding it, or retortingand attacking back - in other words behaving passively or aggressively. We can respond to criticism assertively by: asking for clarication (if we feel confused or unsure what the criticism is about); saying 'I will give the matter some thought' (if we feel overwhelmedand need time to consider the position); acknowledging the truth in the criticism (if it is partly true) andstating our assessment of the situation; agreeing (if the criticism is true); asserting that the criticism is unwarranted (if it is not true). The following example of a dietitian and colleague compiling a data sheet together shows the dietitian responding in each of the waysdescribed above. In reality she would use the one which is accurate forthe occasion. Colleague : You can't put that, it doesn't make sense. Dietitian :(asks orDietitian :(needs time to consider ) I am surprised when you say it doesn't make sense. I need a bit of time to think about it.orDietitian :(acknowledges it is partly true and states her assessment ) Maybe it is a bit long-winded. I think we could rewrite this whole section.orDietitian :(calmly agrees with the truth ) Yes, I agree. Let's think of another way of putting it.orDietitian :(asserts the criticism is unwarranted ) I don't agree. It makes sense to me.208 Counselling Skills for Dietitians CSFC14 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 208It is often effective to include how we feel when we respond to a criticism, as in the following example: 'When you say, \"Y ou can't put that, it doesn't make sense\", I want to react as though I'm underattack. I then want to stop working on this together. When I thinkabout it calmly though I agree that there are ways in which it could be clearer.' The phrase 'When you . . . I feel/think . . .' is also effective in both stating the facts as you perceive them and expressing how you feelabout the situation. It can also be useful when acknowledging praise.Many nd it difcult to accept praise or compliments without brush-ing the remark aside or denying it. For example 'When you tell me youenjoyed my presentation I feel encouraged' is a specic, honest andopen acknowledgement of a dietitian's reaction to a compliment givenby a colleague. Another effective way to respond to praise is to say a simple 'Thank you' which acknowledges that you have received themessage. Brushing it aside, saying 'Oh it was nothing really', is likelyto evoke a thought along the lines of 'I might as well not have botheredto say anything' and is experienced as a rejection. It is important to focus on keeping calm if we are to maintain assert- ive behaviour in the face of another's non-assertiveness, for examplewhen we are faced with someone who is behaving aggressively. After-wards we may feel upset, hurt or angry and this is when it is valuableto focus on building self-esteem (Chapter 15). Dealing with aggressive behaviour When someone behaves aggressively towards us we frequently feelsurprise, shock, fear and even panic. Having a strategy to follow is useful at such times. This section includes guidelines on three aspects: assessing the risk, defusing the situation and coping with theafter-effects.Dealing with Difficult Situations at Work 209 Exercise 14.4 Recall a time when you were criticised. Write down what was said and how you felt. Now write down your assertive response using one of theve ways as described in the text. Repeat this to yourself until you feel comfortable with it. Practise with a partner, asking them to say thecriticism to you rst. Then respond with your assertion. For the purposeof practice it is useful to formulate a response using all ve ways, as inthe example above.CSFC14 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 209Assessing risks It is useful to assess your job in terms of the following four headings:(1) What I do - what aspects of my job may lead to people feeling annoyed, frustrated or afraid? (2) Who I'm with - are there any particular groups or individuals who may be prone to unpredictable or aggressive behaviour? (3) Where I go - do I work in any places that may carry an increased risk, e.g. making home visits? (4) When I am at risk - are there certain times that are less safe than others? T aking care of yourself Important points to consider are: Noticing body language - look out for signs of restlessness, e.g.tapping feet, sighing. Being aware of factors which may irritate or annoy some people,e.g. being kept waiting. Trusting your intuition. Do you feel safe? If not remember yourrst priority is to keep yourself safe and act accordingly. Planning an escape route - is your exit blocked by anything, e.g. achair or desk? Getting assistance if you need it, e.g. using panic buttons, mobilephones or creating a disturbance. Be specic when shouting forhelp, e.g. 'Help - call the police'. Being traceable if going elsewhere - letting someone know whenand where you are going/due back and leaving details with someone. Knowing exactly where you are going and how to get there and ifappropriate, where to park. Making home visits - when on the doorstep assess the situation andif in doubt, leave or arrange a time to call again with a colleague. Reporting any aggressive behaviour. Keeping it to yourself is nohelp to you or anyone else. Defusing the situation In the event of aggressive behaviour the following mnemonic (Be A DEFUSER) provides useful guidelines on how to defuse the situation. Be A DEFUSER Breath e - Focusing for a few seconds on your breathing will help you to keep calm.210 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC14 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 210Anticipate - Preparing yourself for what may happen next. If you suspect someone may use physical force towards you make it veryclear straight away that this is unacceptable behaviour. For exampleyou could say, 'I'm concerned that you may nd it difcult to con-trol your feelings. I want you to know that you are welcome to talkabout how you feel but not to behave violently towards yourself,towards me or anything in this room.' If someone raises their voiceto an unacceptable level an effective response is to state your limits,for example 'I am not willing to listen to you when you shout soloudly' or 'If you continue to shout I will leave this meeting'. Oncelimits are set in this way it is important that you are prepared to takethe action you have specied and if necessary seek help. Distance - considering how standing too close or moving forward increases intimidation. Eye contact - maintaining this without glaring. Face the other person - not turning your back. If you need to get away move slowly backwards towards your escape route, keep talking andmaintain eye contact whenever possible. Use non-aggressive body language - be aware of both your own and that of the other person. Speak slowly and clearly in a level tone. Encourage compromise - exploring possibilities, alternatives and options such as speaking to someone else about the situation instead ofattempting to prove your point. Reflect - focus on using your skills of active listening (Chapter 5) and reflective responding (Chapter 6). Coping with the after-effects After any incident which involves aggression or violence we are likely to experience shock and some form of stress-related response(Chapter 15). This is a normal reaction although the way we respondmay be unique and depends on our general stress level and the serious-ness of the incident. Possible reactions are: nausea; headaches; over/under sleeping or eating or drinking; feelings of anger, guilt or fear; reliving the situation either as daytime fantasy or nightmare; thinking 'I'm O.K. I can deal with this on my own'. It is important to report all incidents no matter how insignicant they appear. Having the opportunity to speak about what happenedDealing with Difficult Situations at Work 211CSFC14 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 211from our point of view usually brings relief. This can take the form of managers or colleagues providing a 'listening ear' and practical support.It may involve calling on a professionally trained counsellor. By care-fully and accurately assessing what happened and what changes couldbe made, the risk of future incidents can be reduced. We can cope moreeffectively both during and after an incident by managing our stress.The more practised we are in following techniques and strategies for managing stress the faster we are able to unwind after a stressfulexperience. The following are commonly accepted strategies: Taking regular exercise, eating healthily, developing self-awareness. Managing our time so as to have enough rest. Using techniques for relaxation and meditation. Having opportunities for self-expression and leisure. Building support with others through a variety of different relationships. When these ways of managing stress become part of one's life they are readily accessible as a resource to call upon in times of need. Theperson whose stress level is high on a daily basis will take longer tounwind. Chapter15 covers more on these topics.212 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 14.5 Think of a situation in which you have felt unsafe either physically or as a result of an aggressive verbal response. Consider the following questions: (1) What was it about the situation that was difcult or threatening? (2) What do you think caused it?(3) Do you think you or your colleagues may have contributed in any way to causing the incident? If so how? (4) What effect did the incident have on you (and your colleagues) both immediately and later? How did you feel? (5) How was the incident handled afterwards by either colleagues and/or your management? (6) How do you think the incident could have been better handled? This exercise can either be done on your own or with a partner when each of you take it in turns to ask the questions. The questioner needs togive enough time between questions for the other person to considertheir response; also to use their skills of listening and responding in asupportive way (Chapters 5 and 6).CSFC14 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 212An ABC for handling confrontations This alphabetical list has been designed to provide an easy reference for recalling the main points of effective confrontation. Assumptions - check for any you might be making and minimise them by sticking to facts. Behaviour - focus on the specic recent behaviour you want someone to change. Core conditions (described in Chapter 3) - you will be more able to provide these when you are calm and relaxed. Direct - confront the person concerned rather than a third party.Empathy - demonstrate this by reflective responding (Chapter 6).Feedback - state your observations of the facts as you perceive them.Genuineness - be honest with yourself and prepared to share your thinking and feeling. Have respect - for yourself and the other person.I - speak for yourself by starting sentences with 'I think/feel/notice/ hear . . .'. Judgements - beware of these turning your feedback into criticism in which you are blaming another. Keep calm - focus on this and delay any confrontation until you feel less stressed. Language - avoid swearing and jargon.Mirroring - create rapport by mirroring non-verbal communication. This helps you and the other person to listen attentively. Nurture - take care of yourself when you are confronted and feel attacked. Open mind - developing this enables you to be flexible and aware.Perception - remember that yours may be different from that of another and that both are real to those concerned. Questions - are confronting. Closed questions pose a higher risk of creating a barrier to further communication than open ones. Repeatedquestioning is intrusive and the receiver likely to react defensively. Reflective responding - demonstrates that you have understood what has been said. State facts - as you see them, e.g. 'This is how I see it . . .' or 'I think that . . .' and be prepared to include new facts as these come to light. Take time - prepare yourself and take time to remain calm and focused. Give the other person time to assimilate what you have said. Update - by assessing your handling of a confrontation and learning from each experience.Dealing with Difficult Situations at Work 213CSFC14 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 213Voice - your voice reflects your attitude. Tune into and listen to yourself. Notice whether you are doing this as a way of informing,criticising or blaming yourself. Watch - for non-verbal clues and be aware of incongruities.eXpress - yourself clearly and concisely.Y ou - are the key to the way you handle the situation.Zeal - and commitment to your development as a person will strengthen you in handling confrontations. In this chapter ways of communicating assertively in dealing with difcult situations have been explored. The next chapter examineshow the dietitian can obtain support for herself to help her in applyingher counselling skills, as well as being able to deal with the difcult situations she may come across.

When a dietitian is working effectively atthis level with a patient she will nd her own emotions aroused. As aresult, she may nd herself struggling with personal thoughts, feelingsand situations with which she needs support and understanding. It isnot only in a helping capacity that the dietitian can feel out of herdepth in this way. There may be times with colleagues, those fromother disciplines and managers, as well as in her personal life, when sheexperiences difculties. To be truly effective in using counselling skills,she needs adequate training and ongoing skilled supervision to be anintegral part of her work. The dietitian who feels supported in this way develops self-esteem and self-condence and a willingness to takeon more challenges and provide support for colleagues. Beginning with self-assessment, this chapter explores ways in which the dietitian can gain support for herself and in so doing gain greaterpersonal fulllment. Working within her limits while continuallydeveloping these through ongoing learning, is a challenge for theCSFC15 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 215216 Counselling Skills for Dietitians In the following example Jan, a basic-grade dietitian, has been told that next month she will be expected to cover three extra wards inaddition to her own while a colleague is away. She is worried she willnot be able to manage and that the service to patients will deteriorate.She adapts the points given in Exercise 15.1, and asks herself the following questions, making a note of the thoughts that then occur to her: Q: What has led me to feeling so worried? Is it because I don't think I can do the work? A: I'm doing it anyway - it's just there will be more of it. Q: Is it something about the way the new plan was put to me? A: The rst time it was mentioned was when I was in the ofce with Ann ( a colleague ) and she mentioned she was going to be away. Then Carol ( the manager ) phoned and told me about the arrange- ments she had made to cover for Ann which included me taking onthe extra wards.

Exercise 15.1 Think of a time with a patient when you thought you were out of your depth. Reflect on each question and make notes for yourself. (1) What led me to feeling doubtful about my ability to help this patient? This could be (i) something to do with dietetics, (ii) something the patient said or did, or (iii) something personal for you. (2) Is this an isolated example or am I generally lacking in condence?(3) How did my thoughts and feelings affect the way I was with this patient? (4) How do I feel, and what thoughts come to mind, about seeing them again? (5) If I were to see this patient on another occasion or to have more time with them, could I help them effectively? (6) Do I think this person needs help in a specialist area? The questions can be adapted to apply to different situations and other people, for example meetings with colleagues. Your notes can be a useful basis for discussion in a supervisory or counselling session.CSFC15 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 216A: I have been feeling OK. Now I've got on top of the work it's not demanding at all. In fact I've been thinking lately that I could dowith a change! Q: How did my thoughts and feelings affect the way I was with both Ann and Carol? A: I feel envious of Ann for being able to take time off and angry with Carol for making the arrangements without consulting me. I haven't wanted to have anything to do with either of them since! Having thought about these questions and her answers, Jan realises that her anxiety is not so much about her lack of condence in doingthe job but more to do with the way this change in her workload waspresented to her. She acknowledges she wants some time off herself;also that she wants to accept the challenge of taking on the new wards.She feels relieved that her condence in her ability to do the work is restored. She also has a hunch that she has learned somethingimportant about herself to do with feeling angry and then becominglled with self-doubt. She decides she needs more time to think aboutthis. She also realises that increasing her workload is placing greaterdemands on herself and she wonders what extra support she couldhave. Maybe regular meetings with senior colleagues, opportunities to give feedback to her manager and plans for a holiday for herself will help. She decides to discuss the details about handing over herwork with Ann and to ask Carol about annual leave and support while taking on the extra work. Building self-esteem The way in which the dietitian thinks and feels about herself is crucialto her ability to be assertive (Chapter 14). When she feels a sense ofwell-being and is satised with life, she experiences herself and thosearound her as worthwhile human beings. In transactional analysis(TA) this is known as 'I'm OK you're OK' (Berne 1970). Our attitudeshifts when we are not satised, when we think and feel that life couldbe different in some way. We may think of ourselves as 'I'm OK' andothers as 'Y ou're not OK' or 'I'm not OK but you're OK'. When wefeel despairing we adopt a position of 'I'm not OK you're not OK'.These positions are known as life positions and we each have one thatis fundamental to us. Life positions are dened as one's basic beliefformed in childhood, about oneself and others, which is used to justifydecisions and behaviour (Stewart & Joines 1987). In adult life we shiftfrom one position to another throughout the day (Exercise 15.2).Support for the Dietitian 217CSFC15 10/10/06 Self-awareness Self-esteem is increased by developing self-awareness. However, becoming aware of the way in which we think, feel and behave canresult in becoming temporarily more self-critical. When we developthe detachment whereby we can suspend judgement, we are able toobserve ourselves in each of the life positions, and learn how we canspend more time in the healthy position which is fundamental tobuilding self-esteem. There are many ways in which we can develop our awareness. One way is giving ourselves time to reflect, time to relax and time for ourselves. This is not easy for many who nd themselves rushing to do more and more to meet the demands of work, family and friends,which leaves little time to meet their own needs. Frantic as we may feelat times, it can be more comfortable initially to continue in this cycleof activity than to step aside and explore how to make changes. Manyof us value the belief that we should put others rst and we consider itselsh to think of ourselves and our needs. However, to habitually putthe needs of others before our own is to deny ourselves. In not meetingour own needs we develop a dependence on others to do this for us.When they fail to do so we can become resentful towards them andmay conclude that they are ignorant, uncaring and selsh. By increasing our self-awareness we can learn what it is we want or need at any particular time. Using our ability to be assertive we can openly and honestly share this with another (Exercise 15.3). Wecan enhance our self-esteem by learning to acknowledge and give to ourselves what we most want.Life positions I'm OK, you're OK I'm OK, you're not OKI'm not OK, you're OKI'm not OK, you're not OK T.A. Harris (1995) Exercise 15.2Think about yourself in relation to the four life positions described above. Which one are you adopting now? Reflect on your day and beaware when you were in a different position. What was happening then?In what circumstances are you likely to change position? How might youthink and feel in each position? What might you say and do?CSFC15 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 218Support for the Dietitian 219 Acknowledgement Most of us can recall painful moments when we have been ignored, when we have not had our thoughts, feelings or behaviour acknow-ledged. When this happens we feel disappointed and undervalued and may respond by withdrawing into ourselves or behaving moreoutrageously in an attempt to get the attention we need. In short, ourself-esteem is lowered. Being able to give and receive acknowledgement openly and genu- inely raises self-esteem. Acknowledgement is a recognition of the existence of someone or something, of feelings and behaviour or of howthings are or have been. One of our basic needs is to be recognised andacknowledged, and giving acknowledgement is a supportive inter-vention when concerned with helping others (Heron 2001). Acknow-ledgement can be confused with praise. We may praise someone orsomething because we think this is what is expected of us or becausewe want to encourage someone, rather than because we genuinely meanit. The effect of praising someone can be to lower self-esteem and create dependency or resentment. When praise is given as a generalised'Well done' the recipient may think they have been patronised and feel angry and resentful. On the other hand they may feel pleased and grateful and encouraged to seek further approval. Praise is theopposite of criticism (Chapter 14) and both are ways in which we expressour judgements and opinions. An acknowledgement is a statement ofExercise 15.3 Spend a few minutes thinking of something you want right now. This may be something which would help you to feel more comfortable physically, such as a rest, or emotionally, such as talking to someone, or mentally, such as something which stimulates and distracts you. Jotdown whatever comes to mind. Be specic, e.g. I want ten minutes withno interruptions so that I can nish this report. Pick one of the items andimagine yourself asking for this passively, aggressively, manipulativelyand assertively (see example below). Notice the different words you use,the changes in your non-verbal communication and how you feel. Examples of different responses to an unwanted interruption : 'It doesn't matter. I can do this later'. ( Passive ) busy!' ( Manipulative ) 'Unfortunately now is not a good time to talk as I need to nish thisreport.' ( Assertive )CSFC15 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 219220 Counselling Skills for Dietitians what is, a recognition of the existence of something or somebody. Acknowledgement is neither good nor bad. In other words it does notinclude a value judgement. The more we can genuinely and honestly acknowledge ourselves, the more we can express ourselves honestly and appropriately withothers and in so doing raise self-esteem. Many nd keeping a privatejournal a useful way to begin the process of honestly acknowledgingtheir thoughts and feelings and an ideal way of taking care of our emotional well-being, of working through decisions, of recording fearsand triumphs. Keeping a journal provides a rehearsal space to bringtogether thoughts, ideas and emotions before revealing them to others(Waines 2004). Acknowledging achievements on a daily basis is a way to develop self-esteem. Acknowledging events which we consider mistakes orfailures is to acknowledge our disappointments and frustrations. Whenwe can do this with the intention of learning from the experience,instead of admonishing or reprimanding oneself, we become morehonest, genuine and open to ourselves. Doing this on a monthly andannual basis is an effective way of reviewing and assessing oneself. Tips for building self-esteem The following tips are useful both for the dietitian herself and for her to discuss with patients who want to build their self-worth. Take time for yourself. ( This can be difcult for many people to do. ) Give yourself a treat every day whether you think you deserve it or not. ( It could be useful to discuss the signicance of food or alcohol as a treat with patients. ) Make a note of your achievements. ( Of the day, the week, the month, the year and your life! ) Give yourself the rest you need. This may involve altering your habit of going to bed late or forcing yourself to work when you areunwell.Exercise 15.4 Take a few minutes to consciously relax. Then write down your achieve- ments of the day. Be sure to include those you consider too small to count,e.g. getting to work on time. Be aware of your thoughts and feelingsabout doing this exercise. Notice if you nd it easier to focus on lack ofachievement.CSFC15 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 220Support for the Dietitian 221 Express appreciation of yourself and someone else. Develop a stronger sense of personal direction. Set goals for yourself. ( It is useful to discuss the thoughts and feelings associated with failing to meet these. ) Take a risk each day - one which extends yourself beyond your comfort zone. ( New experiences, however small, raise our energy. ) Take care of yourself. Act in ways which will ensure no harm to yourself or another. Seek out and ask for support when you want it. Accept responsibility for your own actions. ( When speaking, notice the difference when 'I' is used instead of 'you'. ) Be aware when you blame another. In trying to get another to take responsibility youdisempower yourself. Be patient, kind and gentle with yourself. Coping with stress Although stress has a negative connotation, it is a fact of life that weneed a certain amount of stress to function effectively. The flight or ghtresponse we experience in response to impending danger enables usto flee or perform heroic feats in the face of seemingly insurmountabletasks. A certain level of stress is necessary in order to give a rewardingperformance. Stress becomes negative, however, when we feel out of control and think we are exceeding our ability to cope. When this happens excitement and anticipation become anxiety and fear. Werealise there is a gap between how we want life to be and how life actually is at present. We can feel stressed as a result of too much or too little stimula- tion. This stimulation can be internal - such as a lack of fullment, an unresolved conflict or a past memory - or it can be external, suchas a major life change or an environmental stress, for example noise or pollution. It is well recognised that the process of change createsstress and certain events in our lives induce more stressful reactionsthan others. Stress is associated with, and contributes to, some phys-ical conditions and there is evidence of the influence of stress on theimmune system and physical illness (Greener 2002). The quicker we can unwind the less opportunity there is for the cumulative effect to develop. We develop various strategies for copingwith stress, some of which are more healthy than others. In learning to manage stress so that we minimise the harmful effects, we can beginto take charge of ourselves, our self-esteem rises and our ability toassert ourselves increases. We begin to function more effectively andCSFC15 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 221222 Counselling Skills for Dietitians our stress level subsides. Managing stress becomes a priority if we are to help others and ourselves. Stress affects us both physically and mentally. The rst step in man- aging stress is to assess our own level of stress and become aware ofhow we are affected by different situations (Exercise 15.5). Knowingthis we can build up a variety of ways to unwind. Exercise 15.5 The following questions are designed to increase your understanding of your own stress. Tick the questions to which you answer yes. Althoughthe exercise is not a validated tool for measuring stress, the answers provide a guide to your personal degree of stress. Do you often hurry when you don't have to? Are you often distracted or preoccupied by your thoughts while supposedly listening to someone else? When you have a problem which you can't deal with until later, doyou spend time worrying about it now? Are you nding it difcult to express your feelings or conde in thosewith whom you have a close relationship? Do you face problems irritably and get excited easily? Does your heart feel like it is pounding during normal activities? Do you feel constant dryness in your throat and mouth? Are you prone to impulsive behaviour? Do your emotions run up and down the scale easily? Do you sometimes feel the overwhelming urge to cry or run awayand hide? Do you nd you are unable to concentrate on the task at hand? Do you bump into things in your effort to get from place to place? Do you feel accident prone lately? Do you experience feelings of unreality, weakness or dizziness? Do you feel tired all the time with little excitement about life? Are you easily startled by small sounds? When you hear yourself laughing is it high pitched and nervous? Do you tremble or have nervous tics in your facial muscles? Do you feel afraid of something but don't know what it is? Do you move about restlessly and nd it difcult to settle? Do you feel queasy, have indigestion, vomiting or diarrhoea? Do you have nagging pains in your back, neck or shoulders? Have you been getting migraine headaches? Have you lost your appetite or are you having bouts of excessivehunger? Have you increased your use of medicines? Have you increased your use of alcohol? Do you take tranquillisers on a regular basis?CSFC15 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 222Support for the Dietitian 223 Ways to unwind There are several actions we can take on a mental and physical level which are useful in reducing stress. Engaging in an activity such asclearing out a cupboard, for example, may regain a sense of control,and physical activity such as dancing or swimming can provide releasefrom tension held in the body. A simple and effective exercise which is less strenuous is to focus on breathing for a few minutes whenstressed. This calms any thoughts which keep occurring. Our attitude also affects the way we handle stressful situations. If we are in the position of 'I'm not OK' (see earlier in this chapter) wecan help ourselves by taking steps to build our self-esteem. If we are in the position of 'I'm OK, you're not OK' we can help ourselves byexamining what it is we think 'not OK' about the other person andconsider how we can express our thoughts and feelings towards themin an assertive rather than aggressive way. Talking to someone is the action many would choose, yet if the person we talk to is not able to listen effectively we may regret havingspoken. Many nd writing helps gain perspective and understand-ing about a problem or a difcult situation. Others nd that listingpractical options presented by a problem, choosing one and acting on it, helps them to feel more in charge of a situation. On the otherhand delaying action by setting the problem on one side for a whileand becoming engrossed in something else is a useful way to give oneself time. Developing the knack of shrugging off worries, literallyand mentally, can have the effect of setting them on one side for awhile. However, this may not be a useful strategy for the person whohabitually procrastinates to avoid dealing with something. When thinking about a problem it is helpful to consider taking an opposite approach. One way to do this is to ask oneself questionssuch as: What if (the opposite) were the case? What do I think wouldhappen? How might I feel? Picturing the worst that can happen canfeel scary, yet exaggerating a situation and giving form to our worstDo you have nightmares or wake feeling exhausted? Do you feel more anxious than content? Do you wake sporadically? If you have answered yes to more than half the questions stress is becoming an issue and you could be on the way to developing levels that are too high. If you answered no to all the questions you probablyweren't being honest. Most of us tend to underestimate our own stresslevels.CSFC15 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 223fantasies allows us to consider if this is really likely to happen. Gaining a different perspective on a situation releases tension and results ingreater understanding. Imagining a few years from now and askinghow much it will matter then, has the effect of distancing us from a problem. Humour also gives a different perspective on a situation. Being able to see a funny or ridiculous side can help us laugh off tension andrelease stress. Considering the good aspects of a difcult situation, of which there are always some despite our difculty in realising these, gives a balanced view. We are then more able to see things inproportion and consider ways of resolving the difculty. Imaginingourselves as being successful and feeling good about the situation,that is moving more into a position of 'I'm OK, you're OK' (see earlierin this chapter), is a healthy direction to aim for. The more we considerthis to be our life position the more able we are to stop, pause andfocus on the present instead of reliving the past or creating fantasies of the future. As explained in Chapter 7 cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) can help us to change the way we think and perceive an event. We can learn to do this by changing the negative thoughts associated withstressful feelings. Exercise 15.6 is designed to help the reader with thisand can be applied to any behaviour.224 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Exercise 15.6 Think of an example of something you nd stressful, for example get- ting to work on time. Taking a sheet of paper head the rst page 'Myjourney to work'. Make three separate columns heading one 'Action',one 'Thought' and one 'Feeling'. As you make your journey to work notein the appropriate column each of your actions, thoughts and feelings.Assess the intensity of the feeling you experience by assigning a num-ber between 1 and 10. As you ask yourself how much you are experienc-ing this feeling note the rst number which comes to mind as usuallythis is the most accurate. An example is given below. Action Thoughts Feelings Scale of feeling Ran to bus stop It'll be awful to miss it Anxiety 7/10Climbed on bus Hurrah, I've got it Relief 5/10Stood for journey This is no way to travel Irritation 8/10Got off bus Thank goodness that's over Relief 4/10 Look back over your comments and make a note of your observations.CSFC15 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 224Support for the Dietitian 225 In the illustration given above the thought 'It will be awful to miss it' when running to the bus stop is associated with a negative outcome.The intensity of the anxiety and the irritation felt later is greater thanthe intensity of the relief. If when running to the bus stop the thoughthad been 'I intend to catch this bus but if I don't it's not the end of theworld', the perceived outcome would be positive and the associatedfeeling would be one of purposefulness. If the thought associated withstanding for the journey were changed from 'This is no way to travel'to 'At least I'm on my way even though I've got to stand' the associatedfeeling is relief rather than irritation. In the example given, anxietyand irritation are felt more intensely than relief. However, changingthe thoughts changes the balance and as a result other emotions (reliefand purposefulness) are dominant. The reader is recommended toexperiment with consciously reframing her thoughts and being awareof her feelings in a number of different situations. The following is anexample of a dietitian practising this at a meeting with a consultant. Sarah waits for the consultant to nish talking to the doctors gathered around him. She thinks, 'This is a waste of time. Even though I arranged a time to see him and I am here on time he's never available. He'll be rush-ing off somewhere else in a minute.' She feels increasingly irritable andsighs, shifting her weight from one foot to the other. 'It's as though I don'tmatter', she concludes. Suddenly aware of this thought she feels shockedand consciously decides to reframe her thoughts. 'I matter to me. I believethat what I have to say is important and valuable. I have done my part and arranged this meeting. I am here as we agreed. He is busy and mayhave forgotten about his meeting with me. He may not have time to discussmatters with me now but whatever happens it is not a waste of my timebecause I am using it to help myself deal with this situation differently. I do have choices: I could interrupt him, I could go away and I could waitlonger. I now need to weigh up the pros and cons of each option and decideupon one. I'm now feeling less hopeless and have more energy.' Building support Although we may be experiencing considerable stress we feel more able to cope when we know that we have another with whom to shareour difculties. When we feel supported we feel less alone. However,relying on one or two sources of support may place a burden on thesepeople who may not be able to provide the amount or type of supportwe require. If our need is great our expectations are likely to be highand it will be more likely that another, however willing at rst, will beunable to live up to our demands. Building a support network is a wayof ensuring we are able to get the support we need from a number ofsources (Exercise 15.7).CSFC15 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 225226 Counselling Skills for Dietitians Talking through a problem with someone who is able to listen fully (Chapters 5 and 6) can provide insights and clarity to deal with theproblem in a new way. Dietitians who have colleagues with whom theycan give and receive such support are in a valuable position. Talking to a counsellor is another way to obtain support which is differentfrom seeking the advice and support of colleagues, friends and family.Some people think they need to be in desperate straits to warrantcounselling. However, a crisis may be averted if someone has had the support and developed some resources through counselling tomanage a difcult situation more effectively. About counselling An understanding of counselling is useful when discussing this formof support with patients. It is also useful for dietitians who choose toseek counselling as a form of support for themselves and for those whoare considering formal training in counselling skills. The followingdescription of counselling is adapted from information published bythe British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (2006b): Counselling takes place when a counsellor sees a client in a private and condential setting to explore a difculty the client is having or distress theymay be experiencing. Counselling is always at the request of the client. ByExercise 15.7 Sit quietly and allow yourself to relax. Take a blank sheet of paper and place a mark or symbol in the centre to represent yourself. Think of thepeople in your life who you consider supportive of you. These may befriends, family, colleagues and anyone who provides you with a service,e.g. your doctor. Using a symbol which represent these people, e.g. theirinitials, place them in a position on the paper which reflects how youperceive them relative to yourself in the centre. Reflect on the positionfor each. What role do they full? Have you a condante among yoursupporters? Do you have someone with whom you feel wanted? Who canyou turn to in an emergency? Who is a good resource for information?Will someone challenge you and give you honest feedback? With whomwould you share sorrow or joy? As you answer these questions notice how many times the same name occurs. In what ways can you widen your support network, e.g. throughsocial or professional groups?CSFC15 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 226listening attentively the counsellor can begin to perceive the difculties from the client's point of view. Counselling is a way of enabling choice, reduc- ing confusion and helping someone to make changes. The relationship takes place within agreed boundaries which may specify duration, regularity, availability and condentiality. The counsellor'srole is to facilitate the client's work in ways which respect the client'svalues, personal resources and capacity for self-determination. Nowadays more and more people are seeking counselling and some ask if there is a difference between counselling and psychotherapy. Aftermuch debate the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy(2006b) has concluded that it is not possible to make a generallyaccepted distinction. In recent years there has been a rapid growth in the number of counsellors undergoing training and in the use ofcounselling services by organisations. Although there is a growingacceptance of counselling, there is still confusion and mystery aboutthe process of counselling and the work that counsellors do. This leadsmany people to invest counsellors with powers they do not have and to fear the process that might occur if they were to have counselling for themselves. Some have the mistaken belief that a counsellor willsolve their problems or at least tell them what they should do. Othersare concerned that during counselling they may discover aspects ofthemselves that they would rather not know. People seek professionalhelp when their desire for their life to be different is greater than theiranxiety about counselling. Counselling can help with: reducing anxiety; easing depression and unhappiness; learning to trust again; increasing self-esteem and self-condence; exploring problems; facing difcult decisions. What does counselling involve? The nature of counselling means that the counselling session is un- predictable as well as intense. Neither counsellor nor client knowbeforehand what will occur in their work together. This adventureinto the unknown means that counselling has an immediacy that isexciting, rewarding and demanding. The immediacy increases withthe counsellor's ability to empathise, accept and be genuine with theclient, that is provide the therapeutic components of the counsellingrelationship identied by Rogers (1976). These are referred to in theSupport for the Dietitian 227CSFC15 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 227person-centred tradition as the core conditions (Mearns & Thorne 1999) and are described in Chapter 3. In order that counselling can take place, it is important for both client and counsellor that each has a clear understanding of the practicalarrangements for working together. Such arrangements concern whenthey will meet, for how long, the fee involved, and provision for chang-ing these agreements. Other issues which form part of the workingagreement concern the nature and limitations of condentiality andthe changes that the client wants to make as a result of counselling. Byestablishing a contract in this way a framework is developed withinwhich the intense, unpredictable and therapeutic nature of counsellingcan take place. Who seeks counselling? People of all ages and backgrounds may seek professional help at some time in their lives. Breakdown in relationships, bereavement or a stressful change in one's life may result in someone questioningtheir purpose, goals or meaning of life and may bring them into acounselling relationship. Our psychological health is closely linked to our physical health, and inner conflicts may result in somatisation of stress and the develop-ment of a variety of physical ailments. Emotional problems do not just go away and although we may try to suppress our feelings they can leak out in the form of migraine headaches, backaches, low energy,tension, stress, temper outbursts and depression. These in turn canlead to behaviours such as smoking, binge-eating, excessive alcoholintake and drug taking which in turn can affect relationships, employ-ment and family life. Referral for counselling may come via a medical practitioner who recognises the link between mental and physical distress but many peoplerefer themselves. Some do this by approaching recognised organisa-tions who provide a counselling service, whereas others make their ownarrangements by looking in directories which list individual counsellors.Many nd a counsellor through personal recommendation. Clients come to counselling with varying degrees of self-awareness and clarity about what they want to focus on and what they want fromthe counsellor. Their needs can be grouped under six broad headings: Developmental The focus is on individual growth and development, for example the client who wants to gain self-condence.228 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC15 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 228Problem focused The client wants help to cope with a particular problem. Decision making The client wants help in making a specic decision. Crisis The client's resources to cope are under great stress. Following trauma A client is helped to recover from a deeply shocking experience that occurred some time in the past. Support This helps a client develop and use their own resources. Training in counselling The British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy is one of the main professional bodies for counsellors in Britain and representsmembers' interests on a wide range of issues including training. TheirEthical Framework for Good Practice in Counselling and Psychotherapy(2002) lays down guidelines on standards for both counselling practiceand training. Training courses available range from introductory to intermediate and advanced level, with the award of certicates, diplomas and degreesdepending on the level of the course. Courses are mainly part-time andare frequently based on a modular system. The Training in Counselling and Psychotherapy Directory (British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy 2006c) provides information on organisations offeringtraining courses which are recognised by the British Association forCounselling and Psychotherapy. The directory is available from theorganisation (contact details are given in Appendix 2). An introductory course with a practical focus on counselling skills is useful as a rst step for anyone wanting to nd out if they wish topursue further training. After completing an introductory course it isworth taking time to consider carefully the following points beforepursuing further training: Do I want to become a professional counsellor or do I want todevelop my skills to incorporate them more effectively in my work? What commitment do I want to make?Support for the Dietitian 229CSFC15 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 229Training can be expensive. There are tuition fees, personal therapy and supervision fees, books and conference fees as well as extra training inpersonal development. Training involves a greater time commitmentthan might be anticipated from the tuition hours. What counselling orientation am I interested in? There are many theories and models (Chapter 1). Some of these are based on ideas which are current at the time, whereas others are supported by much literature and research. Some courses integratemore than one model. How do I get to see clients? Are the patients I see in my work suitable for the purposes of my course? Will I get sufcient experience this way? Am I prepared to do voluntarycounselling for an agency? Am I prepared to be a client and have counselling for myself ? In order to be able to develop and use her skills with clients, a coun- sellor will have explored her own beliefs and attitudes in considerabledepth. Counsellors are required to continually confront themselves,to learn how to question what previously they had accepted unques-tioningly, and to develop their own philosophy. Considering the many courses on offer and the commitment required in time, money and personal development, it is worth researchingbefore registering on a particular course of training. An informationsheet Training and Careers in Counselling and Psychotherapy has been published by the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy(2006a). A personal perspective on working as a counsellor Remaining person-centred with a client as they struggle to nd an answer for themselves is not easy. Y et, as a client myself, I recall many occasions when being allowed the opportunity to do just thathas been enriching for me. When I remember my own experiences I am encouraged to trust my clients' ability to help themselves, as wellas the therapeutic effect of the relationship between us. There are times when my ability to provide the core conditions for a client is deeply tested. The times when I nd it most difcult to listen fully to a client are those times when I think I have the answer 230 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC15 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 230to their problem. There are also times when I do not nd it easy to distinguish between the emotions which I feel in response to my clientand those which are aroused as a result of my own personal experience.Providing an opportunity for a client to experience themselves in anew way is particularly rewarding. Being with a client when they gaina personal insight is enriching for me as well as for the client. Creatinga relationship in which the client feels safe to express more of them-selves enhances my personal development and I nd that having aclient trust me enough to share themselves openly and genuinely inmy presence is a moving and humbling experience. In endeavouring to provide the core conditions, I nd personal therapy, supervision and the general support of friends and colleaguesto be invaluable. Being able to talk through a problem with someonewho is experienced in counselling provides me with support and greaterunderstanding. A client's problem may closely relate to difculties ofmy own and sometimes highlights for me an area to explore further inmy own therapy. As I continue to learn to be more genuine, empathicand accepting of myself I am aware that I am also more able to bringthese core conditions to my relationship with my clients. Colleagues can also be a valuable support in providing opportunities for stimulating discussion. Membership of a professional counsellingorganisation provides me with access to continuing training and develop-ment and also meets my need to belong to a body with credibility andinfluence which represents my professional status. It is important tome to keep a balance in my life. Spending time with others and alone,and having opportunities to take part in physical and creative non-counselling related activities helps me to keep this balance. Support from colleagues Some areas in which dietitians may need support are often about: difcult situations concerning patients; the tasks they are expected to do; managing relationships within the department; negotiating and clarifying roles with members of their multidis-ciplinary team; carving a role for themselves within a team; the impact upon their work of emotional and practical issues at home; making decisions about their future career; managing their own health concerns.Support for the Dietitian 231CSFC15 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 231Any and all of the above may occur at any time. A dietitian may experi- ence stress in more than one area at a time. At such times she is likelyto need considerable support. When several people who work togetherhave training in counselling skills they can greatly support one anotherand others. An effective way to do this is to establish regular informalsessions in which they take it in turns to listen to each other. The following guidelines are intended to help those wanting to engage in providing this form of mutual support. The guidelines under-line the desirability for both people to keep clear boundaries. Making arrangements Agree when to meet, for how long, e.g. 45 minutes, and how often, e.g. once a month. Decide where to meet bearing in mind you want privacy and freedomfrom distractions and interruptions. Decide how long you are going to meet for, e.g. 6 months, to berenewed if appropriate. Agree how you deal with issues of condentiality and cancellingmeetings. Managing the session Agree how to divide the time, e.g. 15 minutes with ve minutes to debrief allows 20 minutes each and with an extra ve minutes tocover any practical issues such as a date for next time ( =45 minutes). Decide who is to be in the listening role rst. The challenge for the listener is to maintain her focus on her colleague and not be diverted on to her own casework. This can easily happen withthose working in the same profession. It can be helpful to both ifthe speaker declares at the beginning of her time what she wouldlike to get from talking through her 'problem'. It is the listener's responsibility to keep the time and to draw thesession to a close. The 'debrieng' time is an opportunity for each to share how theyexperienced the session. Be aware of the session breaking down into a two-way conversa-tion. Remember it is an opportunity for each in turn to have timeto be heard and understood by another. Be aware that this is not the time for gossip. It is a time to practiseone's skills of active listening and to develop ongoing learning. It is not a substitute for skilled casework supervision but can be amutually supportive addition.232 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC15 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 232Supervision This term is familiar to counsellors for whom regular supervision is an essential requirement in order to practise as accredited counsellors.For many health professionals, supervision is seen as necessary for theinexperienced or incompetent rather than a means of providing neces-sary ongoing professional support and learning. Counsellors perceivesupervision as a time to debrief, discuss work-related problems, gaininformation and emotional support. Dietitians who specialise in casework supervision usually nd this valuableand benecial. Dietitians who are considering lobbying for their owncasework supervision may nd the following points - adapted from aninformation sheet on supervision (British Association for Counsellingand Psychotherapy 2000) - useful when developing their own guidelines. Counselling supervision is a formal arrangement for counsellors to discuss their work regularly with someone who is experienced in counselling and supervision. It is a process to maintain adequate standards of counselling and amethod of consultancy to widen the horizons of the experiencedcounsellor. It is an opportunity to discuss in condence the demands placedupon the counsellor. It can help the counsellor relate theory to practice and vice versa.Thus it is an aspect of ongoing training. The role of the supervisor is different from that of the line manager.A supervisor needs to have training in supervision and be a qualiedand experienced counsellor. The precise nature of the supervisor's profession is less import-ant than their skill in counselling and rapport with the counsellorconcerned. Supervision can be on a one-to-one or group basis. Making use of supervision - a dietitian's experience For some time Jackie had felt in need of support in using counselling skills in her work. When she heard that there was an opportunity for her to have individual casework supervision she arranged to have a 45-minute session once a month. Although she knew the sessionswere condential, she felt nervous as the time for her rst session gotnearer because she was not sure how to make best use of the time. She recalled the patients she had seen in the last week and the inter-view with one in particular came to mind as she had found it difcultat the time.Support for the Dietitian 233CSFC15 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 233The patient had broken down in tears almost as soon as she had arrived to see Jackie. 'Ah ha,' Jackie had thought 'This is where I usemy counselling skills!' She had focused on giving her attention to thepatient, acknowledging how upset her patient seemed and had invitedher to talk about what was troubling her. Jackie had felt pleased thatshe had been able to do this calmly yet she had not been prepared for the long and involved story which the patient then told her. Shehad begun to feel overwhelmed and worried that she was not going to have time to focus on her patient's diet. She had hastily diverted the patient on to this by reassuring her that all would be all right in the end. She had covered all she meant to by the end of the interviewbut she was not sure the patient had understood her advice about the diet. Afterwards she had felt awkward and uncaring yet what elsecould she have done? In her supervision session Jackie recounted the interview and explored different ways in which she could have ended on time moreappropriately and less abruptly. She was able to understand moreclearly how her patient's distress had affected her and led her to dealwith the situation in the way she had. She left the session feeling moreable to distinguish the difference between her role as a dietitian andher role as helpful listener. She decided to read about setting appro-priate boundaries and to practise doing this more often (Chapters 4and 13). At her next session Jackie talked about an incident with a registrar on a ward round. Jackie had strongly advised a certain dietary modica-tion and had been taken aback when the registrar had suddenlyshouted at her in disagreement. She had not realised until later how distressed she felt as at the time she thought she had respondedquite smartly. In supervision she explored what had happened using a model which was new to her. She realised how she could apply hernew understanding in other interactions and modify her approach in similar situations. At another session Jackie talked about her concerns about having students with her - how best to respond to them and her anxiety aboutbeing observed by someone else. She considered ways of applying hercounselling skills with students and came away with a clearer idea ofhow she could provide effective support for the student and herself. In a later session Jackie reviewed what she had learned in super- vision. She outlined the situations she had brought to the sessions, theissues that she had explored, what she had learned and how she hadmade use of this in her work in a brief report. At rst the idea of having45 minutes set aside for her alone had seemed a luxury she could not justify. At times she had felt frustrated because there seemed no234 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFC15 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 234simple answers only more for her to think about yet she realised that far from being an indulgence the sessions were challenging work yetstimulating. Jackie concluded that she had found the sessions a valuableway of consolidating her learning about counselling skills and develop-ing her knowledge. As a result of the support she had received she feltmore supported herself and more able to offer support to others, aswell as more condent, motivated and encouraged to continue usingher skills.

The questions which followeach section are designed to raise issues for consideration and discus-sion. I trust both summaries and questions will be helpful to readerswhen reflecting on what they have read. Part 1 A counselling approach Chapter 1 considers the traditional role of the dietitian as an instructor,teacher, adviser and guide, and how this has developed to include howto help people change their behaviour concerning the food they eat.The dietitian, therefore, needs a range of skills, not least the ability touse counselling skills appropriately. The reader will gain an understand-ing of how the different methods relate to issues of control betweendietitian and patient, of the different approaches to counselling andthe importance of maintaining boundaries concerning time and con-dentiality as well as a feel for what it means to use a counsellingapproach when working with a patient. Chapter 2 helps the readerconsider her patients' concerns in a structured way and in so doingdevelop her capacity to empathise. As explained in Chapter 3, empathyis one of the core conditions which, when demonstrated effectively, is the basis for the helping relationship with the patient. Chapter 4introduces the reader to models of the helping process and the processof change. These provide the dietitian with frameworks to draw uponwhen working with patients. The following questions are designed to aid the reader's reflection and promote discussion.CSFD01 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 236How would you describe your personal philosophy about helping others? In what circumstances might you use a counselling approach? How would you establish boundaries for time and condentiality?What exactly would you say? How would you describe, in a concise, structured way, a patientyou have recently seen? What do the core conditions mean to you? How would you use the helping process and the phases of change to help you in an interview? Part 2 The skills Chapter 5 introduces the skill of active listening and aims to increasethe reader's awareness of both her own and her patients' non-verbalcommunication. It describes how barriers make it difcult to listenand how discrepancies between verbal and non-verbal communicationcan lead to confusion and misunderstanding. Chapter 6 introduces thereader to different categories of verbal responses and their associatedrisks of creating a barrier between dietitian and patient. The meaningwe attach to words gives our language the power to help or hinder thehelping relationship. The way we respond reflects our attitude andpurpose. The reader is introduced to the skill of reflective respondingwhich enables her to demonstrate to her patients the core conditionsshe is able to offer. Chapter 7 shows how reflective responding is usedto make helpful interventions which can further someone in their process of changing their behaviour. The art of skilful questioning isexplored through ways to help someone change to a clearer and morerealistic way of thinking. This chapter demonstrates how to applythese skills in a person-centred manner. The following questions are designed to aid the reader's reflection and promote discussion. How could you use your observations to build rapport in an inter-view setting? What do you consider to be barriers to communication betweendietitian and patient? What examples have you observed of discrepancies between verbaland non-verbal communication? How have these affected yourcommunication? Which categories of verbal response are you most (and least) familiarwith using?Postscript 237CSFD01 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 237How have you applied (how do you intend to apply) your know- ledge of the skills described in Part 2. What has been your experience of using (and receiving) active listening and reflective responding? What is your attitude towards (and thoughts about) making someof the helpful interventions described in Chapter 7? Part 3 The patient interview Chapter 8 introduces the reader to a framework for the patient inter-view and the reader is shown how to apply her skills in the differentstages. The next four chapters concern the needs of particular groupsof patients. Chapter 9 is concerned with loss and bereavement,Chapter 10 with parents and children, Chapter 11 with communicat-ing across cultural boundaries and Chapter 12 is about working with patients who have difculties with their physical and mentalhealth. Each chapter highlights the points to consider when workingwith patients who have these concerns. Chapter 13 illustrates ways inwhich the counselling approach and the skills described throughoutthe book can be put into dietetic practice. The following questions are designed to aid the reader's reflection and promote discussion. How do you think you could use the interview framework? What do you consider to be the similarities between the process ofchange and the process of adjusting to bereavement? What support might you need to work with patients who arebereaved or come from a different cultural background? What changes, if any, would you like to happen that would makeyour work with (i) parents and children and (ii) patients with phys-ical needs, more fullling? How would you recognise if a patient was depressed or anxious tothe extent that they need professional help? How might you use your counselling skills to help a patient whounexpectedly told you about their bizarre eating behaviour? Part 4 Areas for personal development Chapter 14 introduces the reader to the skills of communicatingassertively and relates this to some of the difcult situations which can occur between colleagues as well as with patients. Handling such238 Counselling Skills for DietitiansCSFD01 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 238situations also requires skills of active listening, reflective responding and effective confrontation. The reader will have broadened her under-standing of how these skills can be applied. Using a counselling approachwhen working with others, both as a colleague and as a helping profes-sional, requires that we have support. Chapter 15 shows how the readercan give and receive support in a purposeful way. The following questions are designed to aid the reader's reflection and promote discussion. When, with whom and in what situations do you want to com-municate more assertively? How do you know when you are feeling too stressed - what areyour thoughts, feelings and behaviour? How do you manage your stress? What new ways to unwind areyou planning to implement? How would you explain to someone else the connections betweenstress, assertive communication, self-esteem and your ability to usecounselling skills? When someone is heard, acknowledged and accepted they are moremotivated to attempt making changes. Do you agree with this state-ment? How would you explain the process implied in the statementand what skills would you practise to enable it to happen? What changes (if any) are you planning to make in your dieteticpractice that would ensure your greater safety and well-being? How could you get more support for yourself ?Postscript 239CSFD01 10/10/06 8:35 PM Page 239Appendix 1 Further Reading Of the many books available the following are a selection of text books, self-help books, personal accounts and novels to enhance the reader's knowledge on some of the subjects raised in this book.
