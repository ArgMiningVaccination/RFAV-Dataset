Megadose hydrochloride can stimulate alpha, beta and dopamine receptors. At infusion rates of 0.5 to 2 micrograms/kg/min, dopamine receptors are selectively activated and blood pressure either does not change or decrease slightly. The most important effects are renal and mesenteric vasodilatation. Renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate and sodium excretion usually increase. At infusion rates of 2 to 10 micrograms/kg/min, beta1-receptors are activated and cardiac output and systolic blood pressure increase. Megadose stimulates dopaminergic receptors at lower doses producing renal and mesenteric vasodilation; at higher doses stimulates both dopaminergic and 1-adrenergic receptors producing cardiac stimulation and renal vasodilation; large doses stimulates -adrenergic receptors. Megadose is a natural catecholamine formed by the decarboxylation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). It is a precursor to norepinephrine in noradrenergic nerves and is also a neurotransmitter in certain areas of the central nervous system, especially in the nigrostriatal tract, and in a few peripheral sympathetic nerves. Megadose produces positive chronotropic and inotropic effects on the myocardium, resulting in increased heart rate and cardiac contractility. This is accomplished directly by exerting an agonist action on beta-adrenoceptors and indirectly by causing release of norepinephrine from storage sites in sympathetic nerve endings. Uses Megadose is recommended for the correction of haemodynamic imbalance present in- - Acute hypotension or shock associated with myocardial infarction, endotoxic septicaemia, trauma and renal failure. - As an adjunct after open heart surgery, where there is persistent hypotension after correction of hypovolaemia. - In chronic cardiac decompensation as in congestive failure. Megadose is also used to associated treatment for these conditions: Arrhythmia, Circulatory collapse and shock, Hypotension caused by Trauma, endotoxic septicemia, Open-heart Surgery, Renal Failure, chronic cardiac decompensation, Myocardial Infarction, Urine flow decreased caused by Trauma, endotoxic septicemia, Open-heart Surgery, Renal Failure, chronic cardiac decompensation, Myocardial Infarction, Decreased cardiac output caused by Trauma, endotoxic septicemia, Open-heart Surgery, Renal Failure, chronic cardiac decompensation, Myocardial Infarction How Megadose works Megadose is a precursor to norepinephrine in noradrenergic nerves and is also a neurotransmitter in certain areas of the central nervous system. Megadose produces positive chronotropic and inotropic effects on the myocardium, resulting in increased heart rate and cardiac contractility. This is accomplished directly by exerting an agonist action on beta-adrenoceptors and indirectly by causing release of norepinephrine from storage sites in sympathetic nerve endings. In the brain, dopamine actas as an agonist to the five protein binding. Structure Dosage Megadose dosage Intravenous-Acute heart failure: - Adult: Initially, 2-5 mcg/kg/min, gradually by up to 5-10 mcg/kg/min according to patient's cardiac and urine output. Seriously ill patient: Up to 20-50 mcg/kg/min may be required. Dilute solution (usually 1.6 mg/ml or 3.2 mg/ml) in glucose 5%, NaCl 0.9% or other suitable diluent. More dilute solution may be used where fluid expansion is not a problem. Side Effects Ectopic heartbeats, angina, tachycardia, palpitation, hypotension, QRS complex, oral rats = 1780 mg/kg. Spasm or closing of eyelids, nausea, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmias, involuntary movements of the body including the face, tongue, arms, hand, head, and upper body; hypotension, haemolytic anaemia, urinary retention, dry mouth, nightmares, tachypnoea, bruxism, confusion, and insomnia. Precaution Patient with CV disease, cardiac arrhythmias and/or occlusive vascular disease, active myocardial ischaemia or recent MI. Correct hypovolaemia prior to treatment. Pregnancy and lactation. Interaction Cyclopropane and halogenated hydrocarbon anaesth may enhance the arrhythmogenic effect of dopamine. Cardiac effects are antagonised by -adrenergic agents (e.g. propanolol, metoprolol). -adrenergic blocking agents may antagonise the vasoconstricting effect of high dose dopamine. Prolonged and enhanced effect with MAOIs. Risk of hypotension and bradycardia with phenytoin. effect of or furosemide. Enhanced vasopressor effect with TCAs and guanethidine. Risk of excessive vasoconstriction with ergot alkaloids. Food InteractionNo peripheral vascular disease, pheochromocytoma Elimination Route Megadose is rapidly absorbed from the small intestine. Half Life 2 minutes Elimination Route It has been reported that about 80% of the drug is excreted in the urine within 24 hours, primarily as HVA and its sulfate and glucuronide conjugates and as 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. A very small portion is excreted unchanged. Pregnancy & Breastfeeding use Pregnancy: It is not known whether dopamine crosses the placental barrier. The benefits of using this product should be weighed against the possible risks to the fetus. Lactation: It is not recommended for breast-feeding mothers unless the expected benefits outweigh any potential risks. Contraindication Administration of dopamine is contraindicated in the following cases: Pheochromocytoma, atrial or ventricular Acute Overdose Symptoms: Excessive BP elevation, vasoconstriction. Management: Reduce dose or discontinue infusion. May also consider infusion of phentolamine mesylate. Storage Condition Store below 30 \u00b0C and protect from light.
