Smith*..", "sitename": "Journal of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine", "date": "2022-12-12", "cleaned_text": "(2022)Volume 5, Issue 11 Vaccines reduce the risk of contracting disease by working with the body's natural immune system to build defense. Vaccines train the [immune system](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immune-system-8102.html) to make antibodies, just like exposure to disease. However, vaccines contain only killed or attenuated forms of bacteria, such as [viruses](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/viruses-25440.html) and bacteria, so they do not cause disease or put you at risk for complications. Vaccines are [drugs](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/drugs-3667.html) used to give people [immunity](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immunity-12162.html) against certain diseases. They contain disease-causing bacteria and viruses, or parts of bacteria and virus. As vaccines contain bacteria and viruses, the [immune system](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immune-system-8102.html) can be trained to recognize them and make antibodies against them when exposed naturally without experiencing symptoms of illness or distress [ [1](#1)]. The main types of vaccines that work in different ways are: live attenuated vaccines, inactivated vaccines, subunit, recombinant, conjugate and polysaccharide vaccines, toxoid vaccines, mRNA vaccines and viral vector vaccines. Types of vaccine used nowadays Live attenuated vaccines: Live attenuated vaccines inject into the body a live version of the pathogen or [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) that causes the disease. Bacteria are living specimens, but weakened versions that do not cause any signs of infection as they cannot multiply inside the body. These vaccines closely mimic the natural infections they prevent, thus generating strong and long-lasting immune responses. Most live vaccines give only for one or two doses and provide the patient with lifelong protection from the bacteria and the disease it causes. A live attenuated vaccine induces an [immune response](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immune-response-27143.html) similar to a natural infection, but the person cannot pass the [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) to others and cannot get the disease caused by the virus. Live attenuated vaccines must be kept cool during storage and may not be suitable for use in environments where refrigeration is rarely available. Inactivated vaccines: Inactivated vaccines use strains of bacteria or [viruses](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/viruses-25440.html) that have been killed by heat or chemicals. This dead version of the [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) or bacterium is then injected into the body. Inactivated vaccines are the earliest vaccines produced and do not elicit as strong an [immune response](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immune-response-27143.html) as live attenuated vaccines. Inactivated vaccines do not provide lifelong [immunity](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immunity-12162.html) and must be replenished over time, but may have fewer side effects than live attenuated vaccines. Subunit vaccines: Subunit vaccines use specific parts of bacteria or viruses. Because they use specific parts of bacteria, they can provoke a very strong [immune response](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immune-response-27143.html) in the body. This may be suitable for people with weakened immune systems or long-term health problems. Antigens from the surface of bacteria or [viruses](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/viruses-25440.html) are responsible for triggering an [immune response](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immune-response-27143.html) in the body [ [2](#2)]. Subunit vaccines isolate specific antigens from bacteria or [viruses](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/viruses-25440.html) for use in vaccines. These antigens are specifically selected according to the strength of the [immune response](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immune-response-27143.html) they generate. Subunit vaccines are targeted and do not cause many side effects. Recombinant vaccines: Recombinant vaccines are genetically engineered. A gene that makes a bacterial or viral protein is isolated and placed in another cell gene. When this cell replicates, it produces the vaccine protein. This means that the [immune system](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immune-system-8102.html) recognizes the protein and protects the body from it. Combination vaccines: Combination vaccines use two different components. Conjugate vaccines use parts of the antigenic outer envelope of bacteria and [viruses](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/viruses-25440.html) that are not potent enough to cause disease or elicit an [immune response](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immune-response-27143.html) in the body. These weaker antigen envelopes are chemically bound to stronger carrier proteins, and the combination of this weaker antigenic envelope and stronger carrier proteins makes the [immune system](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immune-system-8102.html) more aggressive against weaker antigens. Polysaccharide vaccines: Polysaccharide vaccines use sugar molecules (known as polysaccharides) from the outer layer of bacteria or viruses. These sugar molecules are chemically attached to carrier proteins and function in a manner similar to vaccines. Toxoid vaccines: Toxoid vaccines use toxins produced by bacteria or [viruses](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/viruses-25440.html) to create [immunity](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immunity-12162.html) against specific parts of the disease-causing bacteria or virus, rather than the whole bacteria or virus. The [immune response](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immune-response-27143.html) is focused on this specific toxin. Toxoid vaccine does not provide lifelong [immunity](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immunity-12162.html) and must be replenished over time. Toxoid vaccine is used to provide [immunity](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immunity-12162.html) against diphtheria and tetanus. mRNA vaccines: This technology has been in development for decades. mRNA vaccines have advantages such as short manufacturing time and low manufacturing cost. However, mRNA is fragile and must be stored at low temperatures. mRNA vaccines work by inducing an [immune response](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immune-response-27143.html) from synthesized proteins. They induce both cellular and humoral [immunity](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immunity-12162.html) [ [3](#3)]. Viral vector: Viral vector vaccines modify another [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) and use it as a vector to protect against the [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) of interest. [Viruses](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/viruses-25440.html) used as vectors include [measles](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/measles-7979.html) virus, and Vesicular Stomatitis [Virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) (VSV). Viral vector vaccines use a modified version of another [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) as a vector to provide protection. Several different [viruses](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/viruses-25440.html) have been used as vectors, including influenza, vesicular stomatitis [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) (VSV), [measles](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/measles-7979.html) virus, and the adenovirus that causes the common cold [ [4](#4), [5](#5)].Adenovirus is one of the viral vectors used in some COVID-19 vaccines being studied in clinical trials. DNA vaccines contain DNA that produces specific antigens from bacteria. Once injected into the body, the bacterial DNA is replicated in the body and recognized by the immune system. The [immune response](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immune-response-27143.html) protects the body from further infections and keeps it safe for the future. Recombinant vector vaccines act like natural infections and are great at training the immune system to recognize and attack bacteria. It works by replicating a live [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) designed to work. Latest research about vaccine includes: Improve manufacturing processes to deliver vaccine doses faster. Facilitate transport and storage of vaccines to reduce waste and improve access to hard-to-reach communities. Vaccines have led to the eradication of several diseases in developed countries, including polio and measles, but many of these diseases remain endemic in developing countries where vaccines are not available to the poor. Vaccines have dramatically reduced the incidence of infectious diseases that have killed hundreds of millions of people in the past, making a significant contribution to life expectancy. Life expectancy has increased from about 47 years in the developed world to 80 years in the last century. Citation: Smith ER (2022) Different Types of Vaccine and its Characteristics.
