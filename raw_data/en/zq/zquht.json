Mark Gordon signed the first ban explicitly targeting abortion pills, making it a felony to prescribe, sell, and to use \"any drug\" for the purpose of performing an abortion. He also allowed new abortion restrictions to become law. [ AP: Wyoming Governor Signs Measure Prohibiting Abortion Pills ](https://apnews.com/article/wyoming-medication-abortion-ban-gordon-8120493afa25f7a2d4233192dc612cb3) Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon has signed into law the nation's first explicit ban on abortion pills since they became the predominant choice for abortion in the U.S. in recent years. Gordon, a Republican, signed the bill Friday night while allowing a separate measure restricting abortion to become law without his signature. (Gruver, 3/18) [ CNN: Wyoming Outlaws Abortion Pills ](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/18/us/wyoming-bans-abortion-pills/index.html) Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a bill making it a felony to prescribe, sell, or use \"any drug for the purpose of procuring or performing an abortion.\" Violators could face up to six months in prison and a $9,000 fine.The legislation takes effect July 1. A leading abortion-rights advocate said Wyoming's explicit prohibition of the pills is unique. \"There's no stone that anti-choice extremists will leave unturned as they seek to do everything they can to ensure that abortion is banned across the nation,\" NARAL Pro-Choice America President Mini Timmaraju said in a statement Saturday. \"This first-of-its-kind ban on medication abortion, as well as the total ban, are just the latest proof.\" (Croft, 3/18) [ Vox: Wyoming Banned The Abortion Pill And Some States Want To Go Further. ](https://www.vox.com/2023/3/19/23647123/wyoming-abortion-pill-ban-south-carolina-texas) Wyoming has attempted to enact anti-abortion legislation since before Dobbs was decided; Gov. Mark Gordon signed the contested abortion ban into law last March. That law, still held up by the courts, would ban all abortion except in the case of rape or incest, or if the pregnancy posed a serious risk to the mother's health. In issuing a preliminary injunction, the judge in the case found the law to be too vague, and that it likely violates the state's constitutional right to healthcare. Wyoming's ban on mifepristone depends on the Life is a Human Right act, which goes into effect Sunday and circumvents the constitution by claiming abortion isn't actually medical care \u2014 otherwise, it would be subject to the same constitutional critique as last year's trigger ban.

The lawsuit focuses on the Food and Drug Administration's approval of mifepristone, an abortion-inducing drug. But lawyers for the Alliance Defending Freedom took the opportunity to appeal to a higher power \u2014 U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk \u2014 to resurrect a long-dormant law that would upend abortion access in the United States. (Klibanoff, 3/20) [ NPR: Read The Transcript: What Happened Inside The Federal Hearing On Abortion Pills ](https://www.npr.org/2023/03/17/1164112268/abortion-pill-drug-hearing-amarillo-texas-federal-judge-kacsmaryk) Only a few dozen members of the public and the media were allowed inside the small courtroom on Wednesday presided over by U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who has longstanding ties to conservative groups. The judge heard four hours of testimony from lawyers for a coalition of anti-abortion-rights groups called the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, which is challenging the drug's approval, and from government lawyers representing the Food and Drug Administration. Recording also was prohibited in the courtroom, so this transcript is the first chance for most members of the public to learn directly what was said. (McCammon, 3/17) [ KHN: Judge Signals He Could Rule To Halt Sales Of Common Abortion Pill ](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/mifepristone-federal-court-hearing-analysis-amarillo-abortion/) During a four-hour hearing last week that could eliminate nationwide access to a common and widely used abortion pill, federal Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, of the Northern District of Texas, signaled his conservative Christian beliefs early and often. Speaking from the bench in a courtroom in Amarillo, Texas, Kacsmaryk repeatedly used language that mimicked the vocabulary of anti-abortion activists. It also reflected the wording of the lawyers seeking to overturn the FDA's two-decade-old approval of mifepristone, one of the drugs in the two-pill regimen approved for early pregnancy termination.

If a state passes a law, and that law is challenged in court, we should act as if that law is still in effect while the case works its way through the court system. That changes only if a judge issues a \"preliminary injunction\" blocking the law while the lawsuit plays out or a \"permanent injunction\" to strike the law down. In that case, we all act as if the law is not in effect. But in recent years, an aggressive wing of the anti-abortion movement has been working to challenge this broadly held idea of legality \u2014 a push that has attracted little notice, but is further complicating the debate over abortion access.

Meanwhile, Vermont and New Mexico make legal moves to protect abortion providers. [ Fox News: Idaho Hospital Blames Abortion Politics For Closing Of Labor And Delivery Department ](https://www.foxnews.com/us/idaho-hospital-blames-abortion-politics-closing-labor-delivery-department) An Idaho hospital made the decision to axe its labor and delivery department, saying the \"political climate\" made it too difficult to keep it staffed. \"Highly respected, talented physicians are leaving. Recruiting replacements will be extraordinarily difficult,\" Bonner General Health, located in Sandpoint, Idaho, said in a social media post Friday. \"The Idaho Legislature continues to introduce and pass bills that criminalize physicians for medical care nationally recognized as the standard of care.

Idaho has one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the country, with affirmative defenses in court only for documented instances of rape, incest or to save the pregnant person's life. Physicians are subject to felony charges and the revocation of their medical license for violating the statute, which the Idaho Supreme Court determined is constitutional in January. (Moseley-Morris, 3/17) [ Bonner County Daily Bee: BGH Shutters Labor, Delivery Services ](https://bonnercountydailybee.com/news/2023/mar/18/bgh-shutters-labor-delivery-services/) The hospital will be unable to provide pediatrician coverage to manage neonatal resuscitations and perinatal care on a consistent basis as of May. That makes it unsafe and unethical to offer routine labor and delivery services. The hospital has reached out to active and retired providers for help with pediatric call coverage, but has been unable to come up with a long-term, sustainable solution. With an aging population, the number of deliveries at Bonner General has steadily declined. In 2022, the BFH delivered 265 babies and admitted fewer than 10 pediatric patients.

Republicans in the legislative minority raised a series of objections during a House floor debate to a bill that aims to protect abortion providers and patients from out-of-state interference, prosecution or extradition attempts.

Now a political debate over how to change the law is centered on questions that would have been considered unthinkable before last June's reversal of Roe v Wade: like how close to death a woman must be before a doctor may legally treat her if it means terminating her pregnancy, and whether women should be forced to carry embryos with fatal anomalies to term. (Kirchgaessner, 3/20) [ ABC News: Texas Abortion Law Means Woman Has To Continue Pregnancy Despite Fatal Anomaly ](https://abcnews.go.com/US/texas-abortion-law-means-woman-continue-pregnancy-despite/story?id=97918340) Kylie Beaton was looking forward to having her second child later this year. Now, she's faced with carrying an unviable pregnancy to its end due to Texas' highly restrictive abortion ban. According to a report from her doctor, Beaton's baby has a rare, severe condition impacting the development of its brain, but she is unable to access abortion care in her home state.

But in the early days of the 2024 presidential contest, no Republican has worked harder to avoid the issue than the former president. Far more than his GOP rivals, Trump is sidestepping the issue just nine months after he and his party celebrated the Supreme Court's decision to strip away women's constitutional right to abortion. Look no further than Trump's trip to Iowa last week for evidence of his delicate balancing act. (Peoples, 3/20) [ Politico: Abortion On The Ballot?

New sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as additional genomic data based on samples taken from a live animal market in Wuhan, China in 2020 were briefly uploaded to the open access GISAID database by Chinese scientists earlier this year, allowing them to be viewed by researchers in other countries, according to a Saturday statement from the WHO's Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO).

It's the Chinese government \u2014 and that, more than any other fact, is why it looks increasingly unlikely that we'll ever find an answer that all parties can agree on to the question of what caused the worst pandemic in a century. That's one main takeaway from several media reports published over the past day about a new analysis of genetic data taken from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China, where the first human cases of Covid-19 emerged more than three years ago. The analysis, first reported by the Atlantic, shows that raccoon dogs that were being illegally sold in the market may have been carrying the novel coronavirus at the end of 2019.(Walsh, 3/18) [ The New York Times: Lab Leak Or Not? How Politics Shaped The Battle Over Covid's Origin ](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/19/us/politics/covid-origins-lab-leak-politics.html) The story of the hunt for Covid's origin is partly about the stonewalling by China that has left scientists with incomplete evidence, all of it about a virus that is constantly changing. For all the data suggesting that the virus may have jumped into people from wild animals at a Chinese market, conclusive proof remains out of reach, as it does for the competing hypothesis that the virus leaked from a lab. But the story is also about politics and how both Democrats and Republicans have filtered the available evidence through their partisan lenses.
