Key facts - It's common to get mild headaches in the first few months of pregnancy because of hormonal changes. - If you usually suffer from migraines, they may get better, worse, change or stay the same when you're pregnant. - Headaches during pregnancy may be triggered by poor sleep, stress, dehydration, low blood sugar or eye strain. - If your headache doesn't settle with simple measures (for example, rest and rehydration), you can take paracetamol. - A headache after 20 weeks can be a sign of pre-eclampsia, which is a serious pregnancy condition that needs medical attention - see your doctor or midwife. Does pregnancy cause headaches? Many people get mild headaches when they are pregnant. Headaches can often be triggered by a change in hormones. They are more common in the first few months of pregnancy. If you usually suffer from [migraines](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/migraine), you might notice a change when you're pregnant. There's a good chance that your migraines will improve after the [first](/first-trimester) trimester. This may be because your [oestrogen](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/oestrogen ) level starts to stabilise. However, some people don't notice a change, or may get worse migraines during pregnancy. You also might notice different changes from one pregnancy to the next. Headaches can develop for many different reasons \u2014 it's not always because of pregnancy hormones. Why else might I get headaches during pregnancy? Besides hormonal changes, there are many triggers that cause [headaches](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/headaches) in general, but might occur more often when you're pregnant, such as: - not getting enough [sleep](/sleep-during-pregnancy) - withdrawal from [caffeine](/caffeine-during-pregnancy)\u2014 such as in coffee, tea or cola drinks [low blood sugar](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/hypoglycaemia-low-blood-sugar)from not eating [depressed](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/depression ) [eye strain](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/eye-strain)\u2014 especially as your eye muscles relax during pregnancy Many of these triggers can cause [tension headaches](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/tension-headache), which are very common. The pain is usually mild and on both sides of your head. Some of these triggers can cause [migraines](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/migraine), which are more severe and mostly occur on one side of your head. If you have migraines, you might also feel sick or vomit and be sensitive to light or sound. Pre-eclampsia If you start getting frequent headaches after 20 weeks of pregnancy, this could be a sign of a more serious pregnancy condition called [pre-eclampsia](/pre-eclampsia). Pre-eclampsia is when you have high blood pressure that affects your kidneys and sometimes other parts of your body. If you have a pre-eclampsia headache, you may find that simple pain-relieving medicines like [paracetamol](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/paracetamol) don't help. It's very important to tell your doctor or midwife if you are getting headaches in the second half of pregnancy, or if your headaches are very severe. If you have a severe headache during pregnancy, call your doctor or midwife. It could be something more serious. Health conditions Just like when you're not pregnant, a headache can sometimes be a sign of other health conditions, including: - infections, such as an [ear infection](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/ear-infection)or [flu](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/flu) [sinusitis](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/sinusitis) - problems with your teeth - an [aneurysm](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/brain-aneurysm)or [stroke](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/stroke) What can I do to treat a headache when I'm pregnant? If you have a headache, you could try: - having a nap, or resting with your eyes closed - drinking water - having something to eat - putting a cold or heat pack on your forehead or the back of your neck - asking someone to give you a gentle neck massage If you need to take medicine for pain relief, paracetamol is safe during pregnancy. Pain-relieving medicines can actually cause headaches if you take them too often, so don't take paracetamol more than 3 times a week. When you're pregnant, avoid anti-inflammatories such as [ibuprofen](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/ibuprofen) or [aspirin](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/medicines/medicinal-product/aht,10203/aspirin) and medicines that contain caffeine. What can I do to prevent headaches during pregnancy? If you find you are getting mild headaches often, it's a good idea to: - getting more sleep - drink at least 8 cups of water a day - go to [pregnancy yoga](/yoga-and-pilates-during-pregnancy)classes or do some other type of [exercise](/exercising-during-pregnancy) - learn relaxation or stress management techniques - don't go more than 4 hours without eating - avoid processed foods - see an optometrist for an eye check What can I do if I suffer from migraines during pregnancy? If you suffer from migraines, try to avoid things that may trigger migraines for you. People have different triggers for migraines, so it's important to learn what your personal triggers are. Keep a headache diary, and see if your triggers include: - specific foods such as chocolate, or food additives such as caffeine or MSG - bright or flickering lights, strong smells and loud sounds - not enough sleep, or too much sleep - skipping meals - computer or movie screens - strenuous exercise - emotional triggers such as arguments or stress Check with your doctor, pharmacist or midwife before you take a [medicine](/medicines-during-pregnancy) for your migraine, to make sure it's safe during pregnancy. [Paracetamol](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/paracetamol) is the safest option for pain relief. If paracetamol doesn't help and you need something stronger, ask your doctor about if you can take codeine. Try not to take codeine often, as you could become dependent on it and your baby could have withdrawal symptoms after they are born. Most triptans (migraine medicines) are not considered safe in pregnancy. If you don't get relief from paracetamol and codeine, you may be able to take [sumatriptan](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/medicines/medicinal-product/aht,20632/sumatriptan) occasionally. This medicine is available from a pharmacist and requires a prescription. Speak with your doctor or pharmacist before using it to help you understand the risks and the benefits of this medicine during pregnancy. You can take [metoclopramide](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/medicines/medicinal-product/aht,20949/metoclopramide) if you suffer from nausea or vomiting with migraines. [Acupuncture](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/acupuncture) can help treat migraines. Talk to your doctor or midwife first to check it's safe for you. Make sure to tell your acupuncturist that you're pregnant, so they can avoid certain points that shouldn't be used in pregnancy. When should I see a doctor? See your doctor or midwife if you have symptoms of pre-eclampsia, including: - a headache that doesn't get better with paracetamol - severe pain below your ribs [heartburn](/indigestion-and-heartburn-in-pregnancy)that doesn't disappear after taking antacids - sudden [swelling](/swelling-during-pregnancy)in your face, hands or feet - blurred vision Headaches can sometimes be a sign of other serious health conditions. Contact your doctor straightaway if you have: - a sudden severe headache - a change in your usual headaches - your first-ever migraine - a headache together with fever, neck stiffness, sensitivity of your eyes to light, drowsiness or weakness of your arm or leg - a recent head injury [](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/symptom-checker) CHECK YOUR SYMPTOMS \u2014 If you are feeling unwell and not sure what to do next, check your symptoms using the healthdirect Symptom Checker tool.
