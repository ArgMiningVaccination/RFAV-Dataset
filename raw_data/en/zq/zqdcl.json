Not every patient will think about spiritual matters, but most of us probably do, either alone, or when talking with close family or friends. This spiritual questioning may never have a satisfactory conclusion. Loved ones aware of the struggle can be left question - ing why important support was absent during the last weeks of life. The need for spiritual support is readily identified in palliative care. It represents a problem for clinical and care professionals - they can be asked the questions but are not trained to help find answers. Handing the problem over to ministers of religion is not a solution. Many patients reject a particular brand, or any brand, of faith. Spirituality is not an issue of religion. The questions often start with the sim - ple \"why me?\" The answer of course is \"why not you?\" - cancer does not discriminate between the good and the bad, and it does not spare someone just because there are people who depend on them. Such answers will challenge those who believe in an all-powerful god. The search for a miraculous cure can be based on religious belief. What does \"suc - cessful prayer\" depend on? The quantity of faith built up over a lifetime? The earnest - ness of those praying? Feelings of inade -quacy and personal guilt about having cancer are quite common. Then there is the journey to heaven. In some faiths heaven seems to be a promot - able destination. For someone with cancer, doubts can cause the 'brochure' to look less glossy. There is no website to consult and heaven is a bit short of bloggers. Those who belong to no faith may ask the same questions but in a different way. Is there such a thing as god? Where do I go when I die? The question for the cancer community is how we put support in place. It must help people identify the questions they need to address and find their personal answers. Ministers of religion may help someone from their own tradition. A psychologist may pro - vide counselling in a dispassionate manner, but if the counsellor has little relevant life experience it will be shallow. This is not an area for earnest young people. Perhaps we should seek older people to train as spiritual counsellors. However, whether old or young, we have no training resources, no curriculum, no assess - ment criteria and no practice guidance to ensure counsellors work within boundaries, which themselves have yet to be defined. What we do have is a lot of words in a lot of reports about the need for spiritual support. There is certainly a body of work to be undertaken. nP Roger Wilson is the President of the advocacy group Sarcoma Patients EuronetCOVERSTORY4 I CancerWorld I January-Feburary 2014Roger Stupp: What's so ethical about strangling research? SIMON CROMPTON Patients are losing out because the rules governing research are designed to restrain rather than facilitate. It's got to change, says Roger Stupp, who is frustrated that 10 years after helping set a new standard of care for glioblastoma, patients are still waiting for something better. The story behind the breakthrough is one of luck, people coming together at the right place at the right time, professional commitment, and a young oncologist prepared to make the most of what seemed the most unpromising opportunity. He was Roger Stupp, today the President of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), Profes-sor at the University of Zurich, and Director of both the Department of Oncology and the Zurich Cancer Centre at the University Hospi - tal Zurich. This year Stupp won both ESMO's distinguished Hamilton Fairley Award for life - time achievements in cancer science and clini - cal/laboratory research, and the US Society for NeuroOncology's Victor Levin award. The implications of his discovery continue to ntil ten years ago, the average life expectancy for someone diagnosed with the most common brain tumour, glioblastoma, was one year. The route for patients was radiation therapy to hospice. But the discovery in Switzerland of a new therapy combining radiotherapy and chem - otherapy changed all that. The new treatment increased survival rates at two years from 10.9% to 27.2%, and has become the international standard. For people with pri - mary brain tumours - often younger men and women with young families for whom every extra day is precious - the impact has been enormous. Around 5% of cancer diagnoses are primary brain tumours, and they are still usually fatal: but they are no longer seen as hopeless cases.U COVERSTORYJanuary-February 2014 I CancerWorld I 5 JORGE NOGUEIRAreverberate. Stupp has presided over the devel- opment of molecular characterisation in brain tumours, which helps target the right treatment to the right patient, with all the benefits that can bring for quality of life. He has seen neuro-oncology develop from an unpopular speciality defined by a sense of hopelessness to one which now holds its own in the programme of interna - tional cancer conferences. But today, as one of cancer's leading opin - ion-formers, he looks back at how the leaps in research and treatment have happened in the past, and wonders if they could ever occur now. Regulation is obstructing advance at every turning, Stupp believes, and he is angry about it. \"We have this world of mistrust, no one wanting to take responsibility any more, everyone being defensive.\" \"The effort required to make progress has increased exponentially,\" he says. \"I know that many clinical trials that need to be done are not done because regulation systems make them too complex and too expensive,\" he says. What amazes him is how, less than 20 years ago, so much was achieved in very little time, with almost no money. Born, bred and medically trained in Swit - zerland, Stupp arrived at the multidisciplinary oncology centre at the University of Lausanne in 1996. He had just qualified in haematol - ogy/oncology after spending three years at the Department of Medicine at the University of Chicago in the United States, where he gained experience in haematological malignancy, head and neck cancer and lung cancer. \"But in Laus- anne, I was put on what other people didn't want to do, and that included brain tumours.\" It wasn't long before the head of the oncol - ogy department asked him to look into a new pre-market chemotherapy drug called temozolo-mide. The hospital had stocks of it, available on a compassionate use basis - they had trialled it for melanoma, and trials had also been planned for brain tumours, but patients had never been recruited. Early research into the drug in the UK, reported in 1997, had indicated that it brought some benefit to those with brain tumours. \"It was simply for me to evaluate. Here I was, I had the drug, I used it and had been lucky enough to COVERSTORY6 I CancerWorld I January-February 2014the data for the first time, he became aware of its significance. \"It was a very special feeling, no question,\" he says. A phase III trial, in collabo- ration with EORTC and NCIC (National Can-cer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group), recruited 573 patients in 15 months - an indi - cation of the demand for a new treatment. After the results were presented at ASCO in 2004, the treatment became the international standard. But this original breakthrough led to another, which was equally significant. Looking at the trial data, Stupp wanted to know why some patients benefited from the chemotherapy/radi - ation combination and some did not. So the laboratory research team, led by Monika Hegi, looked at what might be leading to temozolo - mide resistance on a molecular level. They dis - covered that survival was best in those patients who carried an inactivated MGMT gene, which meant that testing tumours for methylation of the gene would allow patients to be selected for this aggressive treatment. For the remainder, who were unlikely to benefit, supportive care could be made the priority. \"I remember when we did the first analysis of this data - it was in my crampy little office about 15% the size of this one\" - he waves his arm around his current airy room in the Uni - versity Hospital Zurich, its large windows open - ing onto parkland - \"so it shows you don't need big offices to do big work. Monika Hegi and I were looking at the computer, and I remember saying, do you know what this means? Coming from the lab side she didn't immediately realise why I was jumping up and down.\" The finding had an impact on all glioblas- toma patients, not just those who responded, because better molecular understanding not only allowed better targeting, but has raised the prospect of finding new targets. What is more, the speciality has taken off, as more researchers and oncologists have become interested in brain tumours. Up until the late see a couple of patients respond well to it - and when you've seen that for yourself, that makes a lot of difference. When you see young patients dying within a year or less, you have to try to do something more. \"It was a group of patients that had been neglected. There was nothing to offer them, so they were hardly even sent to medical oncolo - gists. They normally went from the radiation oncologist to hospice care.\" When deciding what to do next, his Ameri- can experience of combining different cancer treatment modalities came into play - it was a practice rarely considered in Switzerland. So he and his colleagues put together a protocol inves - tigating an early and aggressive combination of temozolomide chemotherapy with radiotherapy. He was criticised. Hadn't he considered the effects of late toxicity? \"My answer was, if you get late toxicity, then it's a success. With other treat- ments you would never see late toxicity because the patient died before effects would show.\" He collaborated with colleagues in radiation oncology and neurosurgery in Geneva and Laus - anne to ensure he could recruit enough patients for his phase II pilot trial, Schering-Plough pro - vided the drug free, and the whole project was funded from the department's own resources. \"Of course, everything was done according to the rules, and we made sure we did the phar - macovigilance, reported serious adverse effects, and we were very careful that patients took the correct doses. But in those days there were no unnecessary checks to be done, and we had the leeway we needed. My team and I did the data management, the research nurse put in the extra time to treat patients, we made the blis- ter packs of the drugs ourselves to ensure that patients got the right doses.\" The result of the long hours was something unexpected. Stupp saw from the reaction of radiation oncologists that patient outcomes were changing significantly. Double checking \"In those days there were no unnecessary checks to be done, and we had the leeway we needed\"COVERSTORYJanuary-February 2014 I CancerWorld I 7 JORGE NOGUEIRA1990s, there had been a few small collaborative groups interested in neuro-oncology, and ASCO meetings did not have a track devoted to the central nervous system. Today neuro-oncology conferences attract 1000 people or more. But it's not all good news. Stupp's description of past triumphs is tinged with regret. \"The sad part is that here we are in 2014 almost, and radio-therapy with temozolomide is still the standard of care. I would have loved that this protocol could have been replaced by something better.\" Currently the mood is again depressed when it comes to brain tumours. For the past decade, trials into new agents - chemotherapy, anti- angiogenics, EGFR inhibitors - have failed to fulfill early promise. Stupp, true to his America- induced enthusiasm for combination therapies, believes that part of the problem is that all these approaches are being looked at as single agents. \"We have competing companies developing molecules that probably inhibit one pathway in a clinical trial,\" he says. \"But of course, when you look at the complexity of the biology, it's logical there will be escape mechanisms. That doesn't mean that the agent isn't good, or that the target isn't good, but as a sole target it won't work.\" \"What we need is better predictive pre-clin - ical models, we need to learn more from early clinical trials before moving on to large trials. For example, using molecular imaging to show that an agent inhibits a target, finding ways to repeat biopsies of brain tissue to see what has been happening, being allowed to do early com - binations of therapies. While still paying utmost respect to ethics, we need innovative designs which can tell us much more than we are learn-ing at the moment. This is true of all oncology, not just brain tumours.\" A strong belief in translational medicine, a propensity for challenging orthodoxy, and the ability to find reward in virtually any field of activity lie at the heart of Stupp's story, taking him from office clerk at the age of 15 to head of one of cancer's most influential research bodies today. There was medicine in his family - his uncle was a doctor, his father worked in the pharma- ceutical industry - but it held no interest for Stupp when he left school early in the 1970s and qualified as a commercial clerk. He started work for a big Swiss food supplier, stacked shelves and quickly progressed into the company's pub - lic relations office. He learned a valuable lesson from his boss, who refused to sign letters that Stupp had composed on his behalf. \"You wrote the letter, you sign: you are responsible,\" the COVERSTORY8 I CancerWorld I January-February 2014 JORGE NOGUEIRAboss said. The belief in empowering people with responsibility has stayed with Stupp, and it is a lesson that he passes on to the students and jun - ior doctors he supervises today. He also edited a youth page in a weekly news - paper and considered a move into journalism. At age 18, despite plenty of job offers, he decided that university would give him more career options later in life, so went back to school to get his qualifications and took a medical degree at Zurich's Medical Faculty. Medicine, he says, simply seemed interesting. And, since he found it hard to learn facts by rote, he discovered he progressed fastest if he completely understood things: \"There was no end purpose apart from curiosity, and a refusal to accept that I couldn't do some things just because I didn't have a degree. I need my freedom.\" He wanted to go to the US so his mentor in Zurich pulled in contacts and found Stupp a placement in haemo-oncology at the University of Chicago. That was his introduction to can - cer: \"Up until then I'd been interested in the sexy things like cardiology and gastroenterology. But I thought, 'Okay, you take the opportunities when they come.' And I discovered a new world. Everything was research-driven, everything was protocol-driven, you questioned everything, you read original research not textbooks, the profes-sor's door was always open. This was not at all like germanic Switzerland. I thought haemo- oncology was great - being a doctor paired with research, biology and innovation, interaction with lots of people. I knew it was for me.\" Every day he started work at 7.30, left at 7.30pm to enjoy the nightlife of Chicago, returned at 11pm and worked until 2am. He returned to Zurich to finish medical school, went back to Chicago to complete his oncology training, came to the University of Lausanne Medical Centre in 1996, and stayed there for 17 years working in lung and head and neck tumours as well as brain tumours. \"At the beginning I had very low expectations of neuro-oncology. It wasn't popular because it was considered difficult. People like to go into something that is advancing, but this was not the case. It's very difficult when you have noth - ing to offer to the patient. But I take the chal - lenges as they come and very quickly things COVERSTORYJanuary-February 2014 I CancerWorld I 9 changed. I found it gratifying because I learned by collaborating with neurologists just how much you have to take care of toxicity, cogni- tive function and patient factors that perhaps were becoming neglected in the 1990s as we were giving higher and higher doses of therapy. So it opened my mind.\" He rose through the ranks, from head of the oncology clinic at Lausanne University Hospital to head of clinical research in oncology in 2001, then on to master of teaching and research at the university's biology and medicine faculty in 2006. In 2008 he became head of the Depart- ment of Oncology-Hematology at the hospitals of Vevey and Monthey, and head of neuro-oncology at the Department of Neurosurgery at Lausanne University Hospital. After 17 years in Lausanne, he needed to energise himself with a new environment, and last August he returned to University Hospital Zurich, where he had received his medical train - ing, to take up the positions of Director of the Department of Oncology, Director of the Zurich Cancer Centre and Professor at the University of Zurich. There's considerably more management for him here, as he tries to build a truly multidis - ciplinary cancer centre with patients at the heart of structures. Making sure that the young people around him can thrive is a priority: Stupp is keen to build strong teams, and pass on all those les - sons about taking responsibility and asking ques - tions that he learned in his medical education. He also wants junior doctors to have the free - dom to inquire that he has had. This is why one of his main priorities, in the midst of his three- year term as President of EORTC, is to speak out against the regulation that he believes is choking innovation and investigation at its very source. He is not just talking about the EU's Clinical Trials Directive - he wants to see an end to the complex mesh of inconsistent rules and protocols that entangle collaboration and progress in Europe. \"I'm not against regulation,\" he says, \"but it has to serve a purpose and currently regulation is just for the sake of regulation.\" An overwhelm- ing burden of paperwork prevents doctors from spending time on the business that makes them good doctors - interacting with patients, being curious, translating clinical practice into research. \"Apparently in clinical research we are all crooks, we all don't want the best for our patients and we all have conflicts of interest. That is the assumption. Of course I have potential conflicts of interest, but that doesn't mean that my work is influenced. If you think about it, as a doctor I'm making a living out of treating patients - so that's already a potential conflict of interest. So shall we have civil servants as doctors? \"You need people who are responsible, but in this world of mistrust you take away people's responsibility: everything that is not explicitly allowed is forbidden. Stupid. It should be the other way around - you regulate as much as is needed but as little as possible. \"Do you really think that researchers don't want the best for their patients? How do you think it feels when ethics committees tell us that something we are doing is unethical, when we have a protocol which we haven't just dis - cussed in my office, but in a collaborative group according to EORTC protocols involving up to 30 people, over many days? How do outside reg - ulators know better what is ethical? To me, as long as we don't cure this disease, as long as we are treating patients outside clinical trials when there are clinical trials to be run, that is what is unethical. We need to learn and make progress on every patient we treat.\" Stupp acknowledges that the subject makes him angry. It's borne as much out of contact with patients as professional pride. Many patients, he says, are prepared to take risks, to further sci - entific progress for their children's sake, if not for their own. Some patients have a different \"As long as we are treating patients outside clinical trials when there are trials to be run, that is what is unethical\"COVERSTORY10 I CancerWorld I January-February 2014tive enormity of organising multicentre trials - but also the flow of knowledge in the cancer community. A universal health system is too big a project, he acknowledges, but EU sup - port for the EORTC research structure, which can function effectively in most EU countries, would go a long way. \"Instead, you currently have all these national groups. There are too many presidents, too many clubs. The endeavour has become so complex that things are only going to move for - ward if we all pull on the same rope together - molecular biologists, pathologists, imaging, researchers, clinicians, computer technology, statistics, informatics...\" Stupp is restless for progress and the biggest frustration of his career has been the way that laws and people get in the way of new ideas: \"There are too many egos, who ask 'What do I get out of it?' when you come to them with a new idea. That's not the question: the question is, what does it bring to the patient, to science?\" Throughout our interview, Stupp returns to the image of the patient sitting in front of him. What can he tell the patient with a brain tumour? What messages of hope? What qual-ity of life? What expectation of cure or control? From the moment he was reluctantly pushed into neuro-oncology nearly 20 years ago, the politics, the research, the pursuit of academic and clinical freedom, have centred on that. The number of patients with brain tumours may be small compared with other cancers, he says, but that does not make the need to pur - sue new options for treatment and quality of life, the need to overcome all those unnecessary obstacles, any less urgent. \"We treat patients, not numbers,\" he says. \"Maybe when pharmaceutical companies are looking at the marketing potential for a new drug, the incidence is important. But when you are sitting in front of me, all that matters is you, a patient.\" napproach, and that also has to be honoured. He urges academics to get back into control, so that opportunities are not lost and new fund - ing models are found. It is ridiculous, he says, that if he wanted to conduct a randomised con-trolled trial of a drug already on the market to see whether a lower dose worked as well as the current standard of a high dose, he would sud - denly need new infrastructure, expensive trial insurance, stringent pharmacovigilance moni - toring - even though patients would be exposed to lower toxicities. What's more, he would have to find ways of getting the drug free, because health insurance companies would no longer reimburse it. \"Something is not right,\" he says. His other main worry as EORTC President is the fragmentary nature of the EU: every coun - try has its own healthcare system, its own sys - tems of funding, reimbursement and regulation. This affects not only research - the administra -\"There are too many egos, who ask 'What do I get out of it?' when you come to them with a new idea\" JORGE NOGUEIRA12 I CancerWorld I January-February 2014CUTTINGEDGE MARC BEISHON When new cancer therapies regularly become available more than half a year earlier in the US than in Europe, or get regulatory approval on one side of the Atlantic but not on the other, patients and clinicians want to know why. from the same clinical trials to both the EMA and FDA, the two regula - tors can arrive at different authorisa - tion decisions, both initially and when reviewing new data for an already authorised agent. In the past few years, a number of papers and editori- als in oncology journals have looked at the reasons for the different decisions, as the answers are not immediately apparent - and even when subject to close scrutiny, authors have not been able to find clear predictors of regula - tory outcomes. But they have detailed differences that can affect clinical practice. When in 2011 Francesco Trotta and Giovanni Tafuri at the Italian Medicines Agency, and colleagues elsewhere in Europe, looked at 100 indications for 42 can -ew issues in healthcare are as emotive as access to new can - cer drugs, as they are often seen by patient advocates, politicians and the wider public as lifesaving treatments. In Europe, the agencies in the frontline of recommending drugs for use in national healthcare systems, such as NICE for England and Wales, bear the brunt of criticism for turn - ing down drugs on cost-effectiveness grounds, and for slowness in consider - ing new agents. But in the European Union, no oncology drug can even make it to this stage without market - ing authorisation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Since November 2005, all new cancer agents have to be approved centrally for the EU by the EMA, and there has been a growing interest from various players - national medi - cines agencies, the pharmaceutical industry and patient groups - in its decision-making processes and how they compare with what many con- sider to be the 'gold standard' approval body, the Food and Drug Administra - tion (FDA) in the US. While new drugs are often availa - ble in clinical trials, and existing drugs are sometimes used 'off label' in indi-cations for which they have not been approved, widespread use and poten - tially massive financial returns to drug companies depend on precious mar - keting authorisations in Europe and North America, and increasingly in Asia. But despite the submission of identical drugs and supporting data FApproval rating: how do the EMA and FDA compare? January-February 2014 I CancerWorld I 13 CUTTINGEDGE cer drugs evaluated by the EMA and FDA between 1995 and 2008, they found that 19 indications were not approved by one of the agencies and 28 had different label wording, ten of which they said had significant clinical meaning (JCO 29:2266-72). Differ - ences noted range from use in treat - ment, as with Nexavar (sorafenib) - a drug approved for second-line treat - ment for kidney cancer in the EU but first-line in the US - to a decision that attracted considerable attention, when the FDA withdrew an authori - sation for using Avastin (bevacizumab) for advanced breast cancer following new data, while the EMA kept its use in combination with chemotherapy. \"The possibility that the two agencies come up with different decisions about the same drug appli - cation may generate confusion both at the level of health profession-als and in society at large. We felt this topic deserved a thorough investigation,\" says Tafuri. \"In particular, the defini - tion of a therapeutic indication is a criti- cal step in regulating medicinal products, and differences in the wording of indications can have a huge impact on clinical practice by including or excluding certain patient populations from the available therapies.\" Most if not all of the differences in authorisations in oncology are not about drugs with clear efficacy bene - fits compared with risk, but concern agents where there is highly complex detail about narrow therapeutic mar - gins between benefit and harm, so it may not be surprising that different committees of scientific advisors can in turn influence decision makers at the EMA and FDA to come down narrowly on one side or another. Differences can also arise because of timing and the options open to the regulator, in particular the FDA, which is often the first to receive an application for a drug, and also tends to implement more fast-track and con- ditional procedures than the EMA (in 2012 the FDA was mandated that it could apply a 'breakthrough therapy' designation for serious or life-threat-ening disease). So new data can also appear during the gap between decisions by the two agen - cies, and certainly approvals in the EU can take a lot longer than in the US. As Rashmi Shah and col - leagues report in a review published last September com- paring approval of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs, such as Glivec/ imatinib), approval times in the EU were on average twice as long as in the US - 205 days vs 410 days. Most of the delay was due to 'clock stops' arising from requests for clarification during the review pro - cess, and also the time lapse - about 90 days on average - between a new drug receiving a positive opinion from the EMA's key body, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) and final approval being granted by the European Com- mission (Br J Clin Pharmacol 2013, 76:369-411). The authors also consider that the delay has little impact on public health, as TKIs mostly have only small benefits. They do make suggestions for shortening the EU approval pro - cess, such as by using accelerated assessment, \"a procedure hardly ever used\", and note too that actually gain - ing reimbursement for these often very costly drugs at national level is often a source of much longer delay. Clinical relevance This is not a static field. The EMA, FDA and others need to develop new processes to cope with a pipeline of new agents, such as immunothera-pies, taking into account new science and different ways of quantifying and qualifying the benefit-risk balance. Relations with patient groups, as 14 I CancerWorld I January-February 2014 CUTTINGEDGE\"We try to communicate more transparently the data and justifications for the Agency's opinions\" well as health technology assessment (HTA) agencies are evolving - and the 'goalposts' for approving agents with only minor benefit may also be changing. As Markus Hartmann, of European Consulting and Contract- ing in Oncology, comments, it is just as important to be aware of how each regulatory agency is changing its own approach, rather than focusing purely on how their outcomes compare with those of their main counterparts. \"There is a big discussion about statistical significance versus clini - cal relevance, and it is now the case that, despite positive clinical trial out - comes, a drug company may not get marketing approval,\" he says. \"A good example at the EMA is with Tarceva (erlotinib), which was finally approved by the agency for pancreatic can- cer after a controversy about its very small but statistically significant gain of 0.3 months in overall survival. But then in 2009 the agency turned down Merck's Erbitux [cetuximab] for first-line metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer although there was similar sig - nificant survival data, from a phase III study including more than 1100 patients, demonstrating an overall sur - vival gain of 1.2 months.\" Hartmann, and colleagues from Merck, have since looked in detail at underlying parameters such as hazard ratios that could be a guide to when the EMA is likely to approve or not approve a new drug, and also when it could gain accelerated approval (Crit Rev Oncology/Hematol 2013, 87:112-121). Francesco Pignatti, head of the section keting authorisations for oncology products, says: \"A number of things have changed over the past 18 years or so since I came to the EMA. For example, the first assessment report produced by the Agency in 1999, for docetaxel, was only a few pages long. Now they typically run to hundreds of pages. I don't think the criteria for assessing oncology products have fun - damentally changed, but we try to communicate more transparently the data and justifications for the Agen - cy's opinions. This is continuing - we now have a proposal for making pub - lic, under certain conditions, the clini - cal trial data on which authorisations are based.\" Transatlantic differences There are important differences to note with the FDA, he says. One is that it issues investigational sta - tus (IND) for new drugs in clinical trials - this is managed by member states in the EU. \"A company can do all its development up until seek- ing authorisation without the EMA being actively involved,\" says Pig - natti, who adds though that com - panies do ask for scientific advice during development, such as about clinical studies that have to be sub - mitted, and about requirements for paediatric indications and orphan drugs. The EMA also manages a data- base of clinical trials. \"Another fundamental difference is after submission for authorisation - the FDA carries out its own analysis of patient-level data to replicate main analyses or to explore possible bias, sensitivity to assumptions and so on. We don't do that systematically - if we need to explore something, we gener - ally ask the company to submit more details. Some have criticised us, say - ing that we should do similar in-depth analysis ourselves, but I can't say that is necessarily better - and if we receive an application after the FDA has done this, the process is partly redundant anyway, at least when replicating anal - yses. But it is possible we will do more of such analyses in the future, as we do of course receive some drugs for authorisation first.\" There is a lot of collaboration between the agencies under a con-fidentiality arrangement. The EMA and FDA will give joint advice if requested by a company, and there are monthly teleconferences (also with Health Canada) in a so-called 'oncol- ogy cluster'. \"We discuss issues such as ongoing drug application reviews, advice on clinical trial design, and when early approval mechanisms are being considered,\" says Pignatti. One big difference between the EMA and the FDA is that the former is itself an exercise in collaboration. EMA's CHMP has members from all EU countries and is informed by stat - utory scientific advisory groups (made up of academic experts and patient representatives). With the expansion of the EU, inevitably it has a much more complex structure than the equivalent review group at the FDA. As Tafuri explains: \"The EMA is based on a network of national regu - latory agencies, which has certainly January-February 2014 Submission DAY 0 Filing/Planning meetingsFiling decisionValidation Day 14 Start date Da y 19 CHMP list of questions Day 12 0Clock star t (applicant's response) Day 12 1 CHMP list of outstanding issues Day 180 Clock star t (applicant'sresponse) Day 18 1 CHMP opinion* Da y 210 EU marketing authorisation granted Day 27 7 Rap/co-rap assessment reports Day 80 DAY 30 DAY 45 DAY 60 MONTH 8 MONTH 12DAY 80 Action date Action date Clock stop around 3 months Clock stop = Priority Review = Standard Review contributed to increasing the level of communication and harmonisa - tion across national agencies. How - ever, even between the EU member states, achieving harmonisation has often proved to be an onerous process, requiring legal referral and arbitration procedures for resolving disharmony.\" Tafuri and colleagues have also recently conducted a qualitative inter - view study concerning the assessment of cancer drugs as well as the reasons for regulatory divergence between the EMA and FDA, which he says will be published soon in Annals of Oncology. \"Interestingly, we found that although factors related to the data package of the drug application are the main driv - ers for regulatory decisions, the influ-ence of factors unrelated to the data, such as the level of interaction with external stakeholders (e.g. pharma - ceutical companies or patients), as well as sociocultural and behavioural aspects, play an important role in the drug evaluation process.\" EMA's Pignatti feels that, while cul - tural and political factors undoubtedly do play a part, given the diversity in Europe, \"just small changes in clinical judgement can make the difference in approving drugs that have very nar - row benefit-risk balance.\" As he says, weighing up multiple factors such as survival, symptom improvement, response, quality of life, toxicity and more is difficult, and expert judgment still comes into play. When opinions diverge Having said that, differences between the EMA and FDA, when they occur, can have a big impact and also result in heated debate. The decision on Avastin in breast cancer is one with major implications, given the prev- alence of the disease. Pignatti says that, in his view, although both agen-cies consider progression-free survival (PFS) as a reasonably likely surrogate endpoint, \"we considered that PFS could be a relevant clinical endpoint in its own right - this has been clear in our anticancer guideline for many years. It won't have the same weight as overall survival, but still some weight.\" The FDA, in contrast, when suffi - cient benefit in overall survival did not On average the EMA takes around six months more than the FDA to approve a new drug or new indication for a drug. This is mainly due to time lost to clock stop and the delay between getting a positive CHMP opinion and approval from the European Commission. Furthermore, in the US almost all cancer drugs are approved under priority review, whereas accelerated assessment is rarely used by the EMA Source: CDER 21st Century Review Process (www.fda.gov); User Guide for Micro, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (www.ema.europa.eu) *Day 150 for accelerated assessment; Rap I CancerWorld I January-February 2014 CUTTINGEDGEEngaging with HTAs And all patients and oncologists are concerned about the health tech- nology assessments and cost-ben- efit evaluations of drugs - because they are often approved only to be turned down by reimbursement and HTA agencies on the grounds of cost- effectiveness. As Olli Tenhunen, an oncology specialist at the Finnish Medicines Agency, comments: \"There is more to be done in terms of reim - bursement procedures and HTAs. These are not harmonised in Europe, and there seems to be a significant gap between the marketing authori - sation and national reimbursement.\" While it is not part of a medicine regulator's remit to consider cost-effectiveness, the EMA does engage HTA organisations in so-called par - allel scientific advice for drug devel - opment, and there is ongoing work, including pilots with the Euro - pean Network for Health Technol-ogy Assessment (EUnetHTA), to address concerns that \"sponsors are not sufficiently addressing the vary - ing evidence needs of payers and healthcare-guidance and HTA bod-ies in their medicine-development programmes\". Hartmann says that the need for them to do so is increasing follow - ing legal initiatives such as the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive (which came into force in October 2013, and has an HTA component informed by the EUnetHTA). There is also now a need, he adds, to include a relative effectiveness assessment in risk man - agement plans for drugs, which also materialise in further trials, and given the toxicity profile, took the view that Avastin should be withdrawn for the combination indication (with pacli - taxel) for metastatic breast cancer. But in another case the EMA did not approve Avastin, this time in recurrent glioblastoma, as it was not convinced by phase II trials and the efficacy data that led the FDA to grant accelerated approval. There have been outspoken views on this, with one US propo - nent having said the data is \"unchal - lengeable\", while European experts said there were too many unanswered questions and that accelerated assess - ment on uncontrolled trials could set bad examples for drug development. Both Pignatti and Hartmann com - ment that there is little evidence that one agency is more conservative than the other, given the diversity in judgements where there is a differ - ence, and that in most cases the deci - sions reached are the same. Everyone in oncology is grappling with how to assess clinical relevance, says Hart - mann, and there will be increasing pressure to introduce new drugs ear - lier in treatment lines for ethical rea - sons, but this will make overall survival harder to assess for a certain agent and puts more emphasis on wider quality-of-life benefits and surrogate meas - ures of possible success. At present, Pignatti says, the FDA does tend to look at PFS as a likely sur - rogate for overall survival and requires confirmation of this, as in the Avastin breast cancer case, unless the effect on PFS is very large. The EMA, however, takes a slightly different approach. \"Our scientific advisory groups, oncol - ogists and patients have said that it is valuable for a patient to delay disease progression and likely worsening of symptoms, and not to have the anxiety of a doctor telling them the tumour is progressing and maybe then having to switch to a less effective therapy. We don't put a limit in terms of minimum clinically relevant effect size for PFS, as this depends on the balance with the risks.\" Tafuri adds: \"It may be time for the oncology community and regulatory agencies to take a hard look at PFS and reflect on whether this can be used as a primary efficacy endpoint in a specific oncology setting.\" As Hartmann says, this can also be seen as part of a move to incor - porate patient groups much more in evaluating what factors are impor - tant in the benefit-risk assessment of drugs. The EMA will be adding an appendix on quality of life and patient-reported outcomes to its main guideline, 'Evaluation of anti - cancer medicinal products in man', and last summer the FDA started a series of public workshops on under - standing patient needs. In September, the EMA also held a workshop that explored ways to further involve patients in the ben - efit-risk assessment of medicines. Currently there are no patient repre - sentatives on the main committee (the CHMP), but Pignatti stresses they are on scientific advisory groups and on some committees, such as for phar - macovigilance risk assessment and orphan medicines.\"It may be time to take a hard look at whether PFS can be used as a primary efficacy endpoint in a specific setting\"January-February 2014 I CancerWorld I 17 CUTTINGEDGEalso points to such assessments being explained more fully in submissions to the EMA. He notes too that in the US there is now a legal basis for com - parative effectiveness research, and the FDA is empowered to enforce the conduct of post-marketing stud - ies and to assess effectiveness data after approval. Transparency and trust If the greater emphasis on HTA is one big point, another major move on both sides of the Atlantic is indeed to upgrade the frameworks for benefit-risk assessment for qualitative as well as quantitative approaches. Pignatti confirms this is the case for the EMA. \"We are piloting a new template on benefit-risk so that the CHMP can be more explicit about the reasons that matter for the evaluation, and about where there are value judge-ments,\" he says. Most important, says Pignatti, is the need for trust and transparency to be at the heart of regulation, which is why the EMA is pressing ahead with a draft policy on publishing the clin - ical study reports on which it bases its assessments. \"At present these are either not released or only with big redactions, and we feel we can address concerns about commercial confidentiality, inappropriate analy- sis and data protection. We think the release of these data can be managed so that it adequately addresses these concerns while allowing second - ary analysis to scrutinise the regula - tory process but, more importantly, to generate discovery about other fac - tors such as prognostics, which will move forward the development of new drugs. Industry will have a lot to benefit from this as well.\" Tenhunen, who has commented on 'how to assess assessments' in Annals of Oncology (2013, 24:1138-40), says that regulators will have diffi - culties achieving \"a delicate balance between transparency, legislation, interests of patients and healthcare professionals as well as those of the industry\". A 'one size fits all' regula - tory approach will not work, he adds, especially with complicated new products such as Glybera (alipogene tiparvovec), the first gene therapy approved in the EU. Tafuri's prescription for better com- munication of processes and opinions includes the attendance of EMA reg - ulators at FDA public hearings or of FDA staff at CHMP meetings. \"This would certainly help mutual under - standing of different regulatory sys-tems and improve harmonisation.\" \"With regard to transparency,\" he adds, \"all agencies should provide public access to the data and results from clinical trials on which regula - tory decisions are based, and to com-mittee minutes and public reports about the reasons why certain proce - dures for the approval of new active substances and indications result in either a successful or a failed applica - tion. Communicating the rationale of benefit-risk decisions to the public is crucial to promote trust in the regula - tory 149 c Dasatinib 312 (252) 182 c Erlotinib 389 (301) 111 c Gefitinib 414 (352) 273 c Imatinib 255 (147) 72 c Lapatinib 614 (434) 181 c Nilotinib 410 (350) 396 Pazopanib 472 (356) 304 Regorafenib n/a b153 c Ruxolitinib 449 (323) 166 c Sorafenib 315 (232) 166 c Sunitinib 323 (240) 168 c Vandetanib 535 (443) 273 c Vemurafenib 290 (226) 111 c Mean (range) 409.6 205.3 (167.1c)TIME TO APPROVAL (DAYS) FOR TKI s IN THE EU AND US a Numbers indicate time to final approval from the European Commission, with time to positive opinion from EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use given in parentheses; b under review at time of publication; c Priority review procedure used Source: Adapted from RR Shah, SA Roberts and DR Shah.

However, this prize-winning series nearly did not happen. Silberner, who reported for National Public Radio in Washington DC for 18 years, now freelances in Seattle and sees her mission as exploring neglected health topics. She has covered tropical dis-eases and mental health, but cancer almost got away. \"I saw a poster for a meeting at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Institute about cancer in the developing world. Seattle is very globally orientated; people think they can save the world. But when I saw this poster I thought this is crazy - nobody lives long enough in the developing world to get cancer, and even if they did, there is no way you can get the technology to treat them. So I went to this sympo - sium thinking they will have nothing to say. \"I was absolutely stunned to hear how many cases of cancer there are, and the lack of treatment, but also the possibility and ease of treatment. utside a cancer outpatient centre in Kampala, Uganda, the sound of women sweep - ing paths with brushes made of twigs; inside the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, the hum of a centrifuge. Journalist Joanne Silberner hears the soundscape as a metaphor for the technological gap between a state of the art centre and the basic service in a developing country, available only to the most fortunate of patients. But the story that Silberner tells is not only about contrasts. She has highlighted collaboration and a sense of optimism as the world starts to address cancer in low- and middle-income countries, where it causes more deaths than AIDS, malaria and TB combined, but receives a fraction of their funding. For her series entitled \"Cancer's New Battleground - the Developing World\", on Public Radio Internation - al, and for supporting pieces in the Seattle Times and on KUOWradio, Silberner was named one of the two joint winners of the European School of Oncology's Best Cancer Reporter Award for 2013.

She met Jackson Orem, who had studied in the United States but returned to pioneer cancer treatment and, for a while, was the only practising oncologist in this country of more than 30 million peo - ple. Even today, 20,000 of the 22,000 patients attending the Uganda Cancer Institute each year die within a year. Orem and his five new oncologist col - leagues have been able to offer mainly pain relief and care. An increasing priority That is changing through a link with the Hutchinson Center, which in- cludes exchange visits, research and training, and with a higher priority from the Ugandan government, which commissioned a 200-bed specialist hospital. Although some Ugandan languages still have no word for can - cer, awareness is growing and so are treatment options. \"The truth of the matter is that cancer is a disease of the African person just like any other person elsewhere in the world,\" Orem told her. \"People are much more re -ceptive to our messages than before.\" Silberner's visit provided the basis for the first of her PRI broadcasts in December 2012, entitled \"Cancer's Lonely Soldier\". She followed this up with a piece focused on viral cancers, including Burkitt's lymphoma - the most common childhood cancer in sub-Saharan Africa - and Kaposi's sarcoma, which is often found in people with HIV infection. She also highlighted the difficulty in access - ing morphine, although the drug is a cheap and effective way of control- ling pain. Silberner cited the chilling World Health Organization statistic that more than five million people with cancer die in pain each year. She wanted to do something different to show that something can be done if people get interested Wanted: a vaccine.

In pieces for radio, newspapers and the Internet, Silberner found the positive as well as the negative and focused on the role of the local health teams in leading the bid to diagnose and treat cancer, with support from partners in the US. Hundreds of public service radio stations broadcast The World from PRI, and Silberner's reports also ran on the BBC World Service website, where they received an enormous number of hits. Silberner has been very encouraged to see how much interest they have aroused. \"The way In Haiti, Silberner accompanied on-cologist Ruth Damuse from the lo - cal group Zanmi Lasante on Inter - national Women's Day as she spoke to women about the need to report symptoms in a country where 50% of women diagnosed with breast cancer present too late for their lives to be saved. We hear medical staff in Haiti consult colleagues at the Dana Far - ber Cancer Institute in Boston on a speaker phone, receiving advice that is tailored to available technology and chemotherapy.

She points out that AIDS drugs were once considered too costly and difficult to deliver in devel - oping countries, yet millions of peo - ple with HIV in Africa and Haiti are now routinely treated. In India, Silberner saw the use of acetic acid (vinegar) to test women for the early signs of cervical cancer, and heard how teams from the Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai and Walawalkar Hospital in Maharashtra have worked patiently with women and men in rural communities to overcome cultural obstacles to test - ing, setting up all-female teams and offering a range of other health tests as well as vaginal examination. After Silberner interviews oncologist Ruth Damuse about the breast cancer service she and her colleagues provide in a small town in Haiti Silberner's series on Cancer's New Battleground gave doctors and patients the chance to tell the story of the suffering that cancer causes in developing countries and the low-tech cost- effective ways they are finding to help tackle it.Cancer World, published by the European School of Oncology, promotes the need to address can- cer in low- and middle-income countries, as this is where almost two-thirds of cancer deaths occur. In a further recognition of the role of the media in making this health challenge a priority, ESO judges gave special merit awards to two African journalists: Esther Nakkazi from Uganda, who reported on in - novative ways to communicate health information, and Busani Bufana from Zimbabwe, who also high-lighted the desperate need for pain relief.

The series told people in the field that this is a subject people are learning about.\" Shining a light on unreported suffering For Silberner, the Best Cancer Re - porter Award was one of a clutch of prizes related to her work. Together with her producer and editor David Baron, she received the TV and radio award from the US National Acad- emy of Sciences, \"for shining a light on the hidden toll cancer takes in impoverished nations\". Silberner also shared the 2013 Victor Cohn Prize for Excellence in Medical Science Reporting from the Council for the Advancement of Science Writing for her consistent record in \"recognising new angles in important stories rather than offering stories that everyone else covers\". The World pieces were a major factor, cited for \"sparkling story- telling and the human dimensions\". Silberner came to journalism late and reluctantly. Her ambition was to be an endocrinologist and study the beauty of hormones. She studied at Johns Hopkins and was delighted that she did not have to write es - says to get in. \"I had no intention of writing ever,\" she says firmly. In her final year, she had to add one extra module and \"completely by accident\" added a course in scientific writing. Despite praise and support from her professor, her professional experience was limited to writing the labels on fish tanks during an internship at the Scripps aquarium in San Diego! After a spell analysing health and scientific bills for the California state govern - ment, she accepted her destiny and went to journalism school. After grad - uation, she reported on science for magazines before joining National Public Radio. Silberner is still commit - ted to neglected health top - ics, recently researching stories about diabetes and high blood pressure in Cambodia. So will she write further about cancer? \"I would love to. I just have to figure out a way to do it and for somewhere to publish my stories.\" The good news is that Silberner does not just write and broadcast. She also now teaches journalism at the University of Washington - inspiring others to find and tell neglected stories. n Joanne Silberner's series was broadcast over five programmes in December 2012 on Public Radio International's The World.

But who will champion innovation in cancer care and how? The European School of Oncology convened a Task Force to come up with some solutions. To broaden this discussion, the Euro- pean School of Oncology (ESO) initi - ated an Innovation Task Force, where experts in health economics and health technology assessment sit with patient advocates, clinical researchers, cancer nurses, and representatives from companies involved in develop - ing cancer drugs and diagnostics to learn from one another about how innovation is promoted, funded, eval-uated and brought into clinical use and to find points of consensus about how to improve the process. Towards an innovation-friendly cancer care system When the ESO Task Force met for the first time in full in October 2013, it started by defining what they were talking about. Innovations in can - cer care, they agreed, must address real unmet need in a measurable and sustainable way, or offer a cheaper f reimbursement authorities in Europe decline to invest in innovative treatments, they not only deny patients access to treat- ments that could benefit them, but risk seriously slowing the pace of progress in the fight against cancer. So claims the pharmaceutical industry, increas - ingly frustrated at obstacles in the way of getting new products accepted for reimbursement and adopted into clini - cal practice. Cancer is not the only serious or widespread health problem that requires innovative solutions, retort the payers, and medical therapies are not the only way to improve outcomes. The cost of new cancer therapies is rising faster than any other class of medicine, without a commensurate increase in benefit. We cannot justify putting money into new cancer drugs if the money can be spent to greater effect elsewhere.Both make valid points. In a future when health budgets will struggle to keep pace with rising demand, invest- ing in new and better ways to care for patients - and decommissioning interventions of poor value - is the only hope of improving outcomes. But ensuring that limited funds are put to best possible use requires making good choices about innova - tions and evaluating their true worth as they are developed and rolled out across health services. There is an important discussion to be had about how health systems can best combine value for money with the flexibility to foster innovations and evaluate what they can contribute. However, the pharmaceutical indus - try cannot have that dialogue alone. Everyone involved from early detec - tion and diagnosis, through planning and implementing treatment and care, to rehabilitation should be involved.I26 I CancerWorld I January-February 2014 SYSTEMS& SERVICES or faster way of providing equivalent benefit to a currently available alter - native, thereby freeing up resources that can be reinvested. Products can be innovative, but so can techniques and ways of organising and deliver - ing care. Their value is measured in terms of the overall benefit they bring to the lives of patients and the overall cost/savings to the health system and society. Understanding the priority needs of different groups of can- cer patients must be the starting point for any health system looking to improve outcomes through innova - tion, they agreed. Step 1: Research unmet needs Cancer patients need treat- ments that are accessible, effective, safe and give good quality of life. How well those needs are met, and where patients' priorities lie, vary between cancers and change over time as successful innovation meets the most pressing needs. Three decades ago, for instance, the priority in childhood cancer was improving survival. Today, when four out of five children with access to high-quality treatment survive, the pri - ority is to reduce toxicity and particu - larly the long-term effects. This was not fully appreciated until a group of researchers at a US children's hospital asked the right questions. Their study of more than 1700 survivors of child - hood cancers, published in JAMA this year (vol 309, pp 2371-81), revealed that 98% had at least one chronic health condition, and that by age 45 about 80% had at least one life-threat - ening, serious, or disabling condition. In breast cancer, by contrast, 25 years ago patients reported nausea and vomiting as their biggest prob - lem. Today, research done by the New South Wales Cancer Council in Aus- tralia, for instance, records access to car parking as the most frequently mentioned issue. This is not as silly as it may sound, says Paul Cornes, a clinical oncologist at the UK's Bristol Oncology Centre, with a special interest in health eco - nomics. \"You have a treatment [radio - therapy] that takes five or ten minutes, and needs to be done daily for many weeks, and it's an imposition on peo - ple's lives.\" He points to a number of studies that have correlated accept - ance of radiotherapy for breast cancer with the time it takes to commute to and from that treatment (e.g. Cancer Causes Control 17:851-856). \"It's been done in different coun - tries, and we know that the effect is also higher in winter, when travel is harder. So you can demonstrate that something people may laughingly dis - miss, like car parks, has a real impact on patients.\" Health systems aspir - ing to get the best pos - sible outcomes must do more to encour - age systematic research into patients' priorities across all cancer types, says Cornes, and use those findings to inform their deci - sions. When evaluating the option of delivering radiotherapy over a shorter period or using medical therapies that can be delivered orally, for instance, the impact on convenience to patients should be taken into account. Step 2: Support an innovation culture Encouraging all professions in the patient pathway to look for better ways to do things as a standard part of their work, was seen as the next step for build - ing innovation into the system. Avoiding regula- tions that load unnecessary cost and bureaucracy onto even the most simple clini- cal studies was an obvious point here. As Matti Aapro, chair of the Task Force and Dean of the Multidiscipli - nary Oncology Institute in Genolier, Switzerland, commented, teams that want to try out potentially better ways of doing things, however innocuous, can quickly fall foul of the rules. \"If you call it a study, regulators make your life a misery,\" he said. Improving the coordination and plan - ning of trials was identified as impor - tant to reduce duplication, improve trial design and make it easier for patients to enrol. This is an issue that some European countries are already tack -Trials must seek to show clinically relevant benefit not just statistical significance Giampaolo Tortora Chair of ESMO's Translational Research Working Group Patients can advise on whether the innovation you are developing corresponds to real need Kathy Oliver Co-Director of the International Brain Tumour Alliance January-February 2014 I CancerWorld I 27 SYSTEMS& SERVICES ling, with national trials structures and networks. Giampaolo Tortora, chair of ESMO's Translational Research Working Group commented that trials don't always take into account the latest biolog - ical information and are often more concerned with showing statistical significance than meaningful clinical benefit. Kathy Oliver, a patient advo - cate who is Co-Director of the Inter - national Brain Tumour Alliance, said the latter problem could be avoided if trialists consulted patient groups at the design stage. \"So often people consult patients when it's already too late,\" she said. \"If you ask their views at the start, they can advise on whether what you are proposing corresponds to real need and how best to show that.\" Taking a broad view of where inno - vation can come from was seen as an important element of developing an innovation culture. Few people antici- pated that adding early palliative care to standard treatment in patients newly diagnosed with metastatic non-small- cell lung cancer would extend patients' lives by more than two months, until the Temel study asked the question (NEJM 2010, 363:733-742). This unexpected finding raises questions about whether other oppor - tunities are being missed to improve patient outcomes because of assump- tions about the relative value contrib-uted by the different professionals involved in caring for patients, includ - ing those working in a largely sup - portive role. As Birgitte Grube, past president of the European Oncology Nursing Society, pointed out, this in turn raises questions of whether the cuts in nursing posts that are happen - ing across Europe might be based on assumptions rather than real evidence about the value nurses contribute to patient outcomes. Peter Naredi, past president of the European Society of Surgical Oncol - ogy, pointed to another aspect of can - cer care whose potential for improving outcomes is often overlooked: namely the way care is organised and deliv - ered. Naredi knows about innova - tion: he pioneered new techniques in liver and pancreatic surgery and pro- moted the systematic uptake of new techniques in treating rectal can - cer in his home country of Sweden. But at the Task Force, he singled out tumour boards and multidisciplinary teams as having the greatest potential to improve outcomes, because they ensure that treatment decisions are not made by the first specialist who sees the patient, without input from other professionals. Working in multidisciplinary teams, it was noted, can also facilitate a patient-centred team approach to improv-ing patient outcomes. Though as Grube, speaking from the can - cer nursing perspective, pointed out, for this to work well, each profes - sion in the multidisci - plinary team must have knowledge and respect for others' roles and responsibilities. Cancer plans - which take a sys - tem-wide joined-up approach to assessing needs and delivering ser - vices - and registries - which provide information on outcomes - can be added to the list of concepts that have potential to yield substantial bene-fits for patients, as can guidelines to document and spread best practice, benchmarking, performance moni - toring and audit. Step 3: Introduce early and evaluate effectively Intuitively, it might make sense to evaluate first and introduce later, but the Task Force concluded that this is impractical in cancer because of the complex interplay between differ - ent contributions to patient care and the variety of costs and benefits to be taken into account. Innovations also typically evolve rather than emerg - ing fully fledged, so deciding at what point in their evolution they should be evaluated is a matter of judgement. Each profession in the multidisciplinary team must have knowledge and respect for the others' professions, roles and responsibilities Birgitte Grube Former president of the European Oncology Nursing Society Innovatory concepts and processes can also make a huge difference to patient outcomes, as multidisciplinary teams have shown Peter Naredi Former President of the European Society of Surgical Oncology 28 I CancerWorld I January-February 2014 SYSTEMS& SERVICES That is not to say that innovations should be introduced before they have been shown to be safe and effec - tive - something that the Task Force noted is currently mandatory only for medical therapies. However, the overall value can only become appar - ent when the new product, technique or process becomes fully integrated within the patient pathway, used in a non-selected patient population in a real-life setting, where the benefits and costs to patients and the health system can be measured against the alternative it may replace. As Aapro, chair of the Task Force, put it: \"Some- thing potentially innova- tive is introduced into a whole pathway, from diag - nosis through decision making and all the different modali- ties of treatment through to pallia - tive care, or rehabilitation and so on. Whether or not it actually turns out to be innovative depends on how it plays out within that whole context.\" How is the evidence gathered? Evidence to show how innovative therapies do \"play out\" in real-life set - tings is increasingly being demanded by payers in addition to data required by the regulators for marketing approval. Pharmaceutical companies have accordingly started to invest in registries to gather the required infor - mation from centres where their new product is in use. They are also trying to integrate the gathering of 'value' data into the devel-opment process to ensure it is availa - ble as soon as possible after a product gets regulatory approval. Joerg Adam-czewski, Project Head for Oncology Development at Sanofi, said that an increasing willingness by payers to interact with manufacturers early in development to provide guidance is very welcome. \"We hope this engage - ment will allow us to work with pay-ers to develop a definition of value that incorporates unmet need, the level of scientific innovation, and the impact that the drug has on the lives of patients and caregivers,\" he said. The problem is that getting Europe's various decision makers to agree on similar measures of costs and benefits is turning out to be a major challenge. This has big implications for the practicalities of demonstrating to pay - ers the value of an innovation, because every country - and sometimes each region or even individual hospitals - demand different sets of data relevant to their own needs. Agreeing on the seriousness of toxic side-effects from a medical perspective is more straightforward than assessing the cost to a patient of diarrhoea, bloat-ing, anxiety, or disruption to daily life. Though progress towards a common evaluation has been made, for instance with a variety of quality of life 'instru - ments' validated across many Euro - pean countries, these are too blunt to capture the level of detail for assessing the added value of most innovations. One innovative approach to gather - ing quality of life information, which is about to be piloted in conjunction with the UK national brain tumour registry, was men - tioned by Kathy Oliver. It involves an online Brain Tumour Patient Informa- tion Portal, where patients can access their own clinical and pathological records, but can also con - tribute information (www.nbtr.nhs.uk/patientportal.html). \"Patients can feed in information about side-effects and give feedback on what they think has been innovative about treatments. This is hopefully something that will be rolled out to other site-specific can - cers in the future,\" she said. The impact on cost/savings of intro - ducing an innovation will also play out differently, for instance, according to whether care is primarily delivered by doctors in a hospital setting, or greater use is made of specialist nurses in an outpatient or community setting, and according to the levels of sickness ben - We welcome greater dialogue with payers and want to work with them to develop a shared definition of value Joerg Adamczewski Project Head for Oncology Development at Sanofi Systems are already in place to coordinate certain aspects of health technology assessment, it is up to Member States to make better use of them Finn Kristensen Chair of EUnetHTA January-February 2014 I CancerWorld I 29 SYSTEMS& SERVICES efit, rights to social care and so on. One suggested solu- tion to reduce the pro - liferating demands for different types of data lies with greater coordi - nation in the analysis of new health technologies across Europe. The foundations for this have already been laid through EUnetHTA, a network of European health technology assessment (HTA) bodies, set up in 2009 with a mis-sion to develop reliable, timely, trans - parent and transferable information to contribute to health technology assessments in European countries. Finn Kristensen, chair of EUnetHTA, freely admitted that it will never be to HTA what the centralised proce - dures of EMA are to drug regula - tion, as there are obstacles even at the level of national legislation to getting countries to work together in HTA as closely as in drug licensing. How - ever, he felt that EUnetHTA is an underused resource that could play an important role in improving the way Europe evaluates innovation in health. \"There is a lot more that we can still agree on about how we assess quality of evidence from a scientific point of view. It is now up to the cancer com - munity to say to Member States: we have a problem, and you need to use this HTA network more!\" Greater investment in registries to gather real-life outcome data was also suggested as essential to improve capacity for evaluating the impact of innovations. There could be potential, for instance, for companies to collab - orate more in running multi-sponsor registries for particular disease groups. This is not just an issue for phar - maceutical companies, however, as Yolande Lievens, head of radiation oncology at Ghent University Hospi - tal in Belgium, pointed out. She and her colleagues are currently running a registry to evaluate which patients benefit from being treated with stere - otactic body radiotherapy, which uses advanced image guidance to pinpoint beams on the tumour. As this is more about techniques than equipment, manufacturers don't have an incentive to cover the cost of gathering evidence. To avoid delaying patient access to these promising techniques until they are included in formal reimbursement schemes, the Belgian government has therefore agreed on provisional financ - ing of the treatment and the registries for four years while further evidence is gathered and analysed. This pro - gramme is being run in collaboration with the Belgian health insurance and cancer registry. Lievens suggests a more strate - gic approach to developing registries - involving collaboration between industry, the academic world and pro - fessional societies - will be key to developing Europe's ability to evaluate and promote innovation. When is the evidence gathered? Given that innovation is a process that can take decades to mature, the ques- tion arises of when decisions are made. A decision made too early, before clin - ical researchers have time to learn how an innovation can best be integrated with other treatments and which patients derive the greatest value, could kill off something that would yield beneficial results. Wait too long and patients will be deprived of access to something that could benefit them. Lievens said that this was a prob - lem with the stereotactic radiotherapy techniques she is now evaluating in Belgium, because progress was incre-mental. \"If you look back you can say that from cobalt to linacs was a very important change. Or when we started to use CT scans to plan conformal treatment, that marked an enormous change. But at the time it was insidi- ous. It wasn't obvious. It's only years afterwards that you can look back and say that was really an innovation.\" One consequence, said Lievens, is that there is often a serious delay from the time the technology is developed at research centres to the point at which it is introduced and reimbursed in daily care. To ensure quicker patient access to new technologies, she sug - gests greater use of \"coverage with evidence development\" programmes like the one she is involved in for ste - reotactic body radiotherapy. Funding could come from government, indus - try or other sources, and should be made available to introduce the inno - vation into clinical practice - perhaps at selected cancer centres - at an early stage of technology development. \"In return, providers to whom the new technology is made available, should commit themselves to generating cost and outcome data, necessary for well- timed economic evaluation and health technology assessment.\" These sorts of approaches are A more strategic approach to developing registries is needed to facilitate gathering evidence on value in a real-life setting Yolande Lievens Head of radiation oncology, Ghent University Hospital 30 I CancerWorld I January-February 2014 SYSTEMS& SERVICES beginning to be used more widely in some European countries. In Germany, for instance, under the 2011 Reform of the Market for Medicinal Products law (AMNOG), reimbursement of a new medical therapy is guaranteed at the manufac- turer's price for 12 months from the day it gets approved by the EMA. A cost-benefit evalu - ation of the therapy is then done by an umbrella body of health insurance funds, in collaboration with the HTA body IQWiG. The final reimburse- ment price is negotiated at the end of the 12 months, according to the evidence on whether or not the ther - apy adds value in some way (and for which patients) compared to the cur - rently used alternative. The UK, meanwhile, has launched a Commissioning through Evalua- tion programme, that will allow cer - tain treatments that show \"significant promise in terms of improving qual - ity of life or potentially survival, but [are] not accessible through a for - mal research trial,\" to be funded in a small number of participating cen- tres, and within an explicit evaluation programme. Who decides, and how? Promoting innovation that bene - fits patients - and cutting spending on things that add no value - is about making informed judgements from a system-wide per - spective. In practice, as the Task Force heard from many participants, this is not always the way decisions are taken. Lack of understand- ing of the real issues was seen as a big problem, particu - larly when decisions are made by doc - tors with no background in health technology assessment and health economics. \"Typically decisions are often made on budget impact rather than clinical effectiveness or cost-benefit,\" said Daniel Schneider, Sen - ior Director EMEA [Europe Middle East and Africa] Sales and Marketing at the diagnostics company, Genomic Health. This is a particular issue for innovation in diagnostics, he added, because \"it is the physicians who drive the process, so in many countries we are reliant on the physicians to apply [for reimbursement] for us.\" Statistics from France, on the cost- benefit of screening lung cancer patients for the EGFR mutation illus - trate the dangers of focusing on costs alone - studies have shown that while the health system spends around \u20ac1.7 million a year on the diagnos - tic procedure, \u20ac 69 million is saved by ensuring that patients without mutated EGFR are not treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The Task Force also heard how sometimes even the more established HTA bodies fail to grasp, for instance, the way statistical significance works. \"They say 'We will look at the 25% of patients who interest us from this trial.' But when it is only 25%, the effect is no longer statistically significant, as the number of events becomes too small! So they conclude 'You have not demonstrated anything relevant from the trial.'\" Lack of understanding about cancer among many decision makers was felt to be an equally serious problem. Pro-gress over past decades has tended to result from incremental advances in every part of the treatment pathway, as clinicians learn to combine them to greatest effect and in the right patients. People who are not familiar with this may be less inclined to give new prod - ucts and processes the chance to prove themselves. People who are not familiar with cancer can also underes - timate the difference seemingly \"little things\" can make to quality of life and/ or adherence, or what a difference a few additional weeks of life can make to some people. They may adopt a more defeatist attitude; a greater ten - dency to assume that cancer is a 'hope - less case' and that investing in things that are not clearly 'breakthroughs' is a waste of resources. Greater consistency and streamlining of deci-sion making was also seen as an issue. Task Force chair Matti Aapro ques - tioned whether treat- ments for other dis-eases have to fulfil the same stringent criteria as new drugs for cancer. We are asked to show evidence of overall survival benefit, but is the same demand being made in other areas of health spending? Matti Aapro Chair of the Innovation Task Force Typically decisions are made on budget impact rather than cost-benefit Daniel Schneider Director, EMEA Sales and Marketing, at Genomic Health January-February 2014 I CancerWorld I 31 SYSTEMS& SERVICES \"We need to remember that cancer is part of wider health spending. We face demands to show increased survival which we can't always meet. But are the evaluators using the same criteria for other areas?\" Even within cancer, there are anomalies in the way deci - sions are taken, as Bengt J\u00f6nsson, a health economist from the Stockholm School of Economics, pointed out. \"In Sweden we have one system for decid -ing on oral cancer drugs and another for deciding on infused drugs. We need more consistency in how we make decisions,\" he said. Centralising evaluation and deci - sion making was strongly felt to result in a better quality of analysis, with decisions more likely to reflect the best interests of the health system or society as a whole, rather than being driven by a local perspective. Pere Gasc\u00f3n, head of the medical oncol - ogy department at the Hospital Cl\u00ednic of Barcelona, gave as an example the way hospitals in Spain tend to weigh up the pros and cons of epoietin, used as an alternative to transfusion to treat anaemia. \"Epoietin is expensive, but it's about half the price of transfu - sion. However the government pays for transfusions, so it costs the hospi - tal nothing.

There is no clear evi- dence to show that robotic surgery improves outcomes, he argued, \"It's probably just more fun for surgeons, or good for hospitals from a recruit - ment perspective.\" Step 4: Out with the old, in with the new Innovation won't pay off until patients get access, so the next step is ensur - ing that all health professionals who care for cancer patients incorporate innovative products and practices into their daily practice quickly and effectively. This can be a challenge, the Task Force participants agreed, as health systems can be resistant to change. Changing the practice you were brought up to believe was the gold standard can feel tantamount to \"being a traitor to ones training,\" was one comment. Another phrase that came up was \"ritualistic practice\" - we do it this way because that's how it's always been done. Implementing change is an area that the European Oncology Nursing Society pays great atten- tion to in its own train - ing courses, said Birgitte Grube. \"It is important to choose an implementa-tion strategy and accept - ance at every level of the process, to make sure that innovative think - ing is valid and has a real chance for success.\" At a national level, systems based on networks of specialist multidisci - plinary teams, working to regularly updated national guidelines, were rec - ognised as having an advantage when it comes to promoting rapid uptake of innovation. The ability to monitor uptake was also seen as important, but would require practitioners to co- operate with clinical registries - which record interventions as well as out - comes - or some other form of perfor - mance monitoring. The role of patients in driving uptake should not be overlooked, said Kathy Oliver, who made a plea for advocates to be given support and encourage-ment, including access to relevant information, to facilitate lobbying for the latest improvements. \"Patients often know about innovations before health professionals,\" she said. Paul Cornes, from the Bristol Oncology Centre, suggested that promoting uptake may be less of an issue where innovations are subject to more systematic and robust evalu - ation. \"The argument for NICE [the UK's HTA body] is that, although it might slow down the initial assess - ment, once they say 'yes', it does get taken up everywhere within 12 weeks.\" Patients might benefit if sur - gery and radiotherapy were to come under the NICE remit, he argued, \"because approval comes with budget and speedy uptake\". He cited total mesorectal excision, which has been shown to cut recur - rence in rectal cancer from 25% to 10%, as an example. Much of the work to spread the technique, nationally as well as internationally, was done by one surgeon, Bill Heald, from a dis- trict hospital in Basingstoke, England. He earned the nickname \"Saint Bill\" for the personal effort he put in, over many years, often having to scrabble around for money. Might the uptake have been quicker if the procedure had gone through NICE for formal evaluation, Cornes asked? Conducting thorough evaluations also has the advantage of forcing a reassessment of existing practices, which could free up resources cur - rently being wasted. J\u00f6nsson of the Stockholm School of Economics gave the example of a new drug for benign prostate hyperplasia, which the Ger - man payers initially argued was too Although NICE might slow down the initial assessment, once they say 'yes', it does get taken up everywhere within 12 weeks Paul Cornes Clinical oncologist at the Bristol Oncology Centre, and health economist Hospitals are on a fixed budget and they don't want to think about the broader picture Pere Gasc\u00f3n Head of the medical oncology department at the Hospital Cl\u00ednic of Barcelona January-February 2014 I CancerWorld I 33 SYSTEMS& SERVICES expensive. \"Then they noticed they spent mil- lions of euros a year on herbal medicines which had no effect. So they were paying for undoc - umented herbal medi- cine, but didn't want to pay for a drug with doc-umented effectiveness.\" One question was whether European health systems would benefit from a more systematic approach to cutting wasteful spend - ing, along the lines of ASCO's Choos - ing Wisely Campaign, which annually highlights five categories of proce - dures or treatments that are not sup - ported by available evidence. Something similar is currently under consideration in Italy, where the health ministry is exploring ways to introduce a requirement on clini - cians to actively screen what they do to identify obsolescence. Step 5: A vision and a will Step 5 is the step needed to trans - late steps 1 to 4 from a paper exer - cise and well-intentioned words into action that can make Europe's health systems work better for patients. This is the hard part, said Agn\u00e8s Buzyn, who heads up France's national can- cer institute, and participated in the Task Force. Appointed by former President Nicolas Sarkozy, Buzyn has strategic responsibility for both research and delivery of care, which makes her uniquely well placed to pro - mote innovation and fos - ter its uptake. But while there is much France can teach other countries about integrating research and care agendas, Buzyn insists that no single country can sort out this problem alone. \"You need vision at a European level to champion innovation as a goal,\" she said. The reason why pharmaceutical companies are dominating the innova- tion agenda is because of the complete absence of a strong vision and leader - ship championing a broad perspective of innovation on behalf of patients and citizens. \"On the one side you have industry, on the other we are split into agencies, regulators and countries. We need to pull the agencies together, not at a national but at a European level.\" This, she adds, requires political will that is painfully lacking at pre - sent. \"The problem with politicians now is the only contact they have with health is over scandals. Health sys - tems are mostly geared against innova - tion, because their only interest is the safety agenda.\" Finn Kristensen of EUnetHTA, suggested that a good start could be to expand the EU's cancer research agenda to incorporate some of the sys -tem-level issues raised at the Task Force, by assembling a European consortium involving scientists from relevant research disciplines to put in for funding from the Horizon 2020 EU research budget. \"Can- cer people probably think traditionally about what kind of research you can make proposals on, which would be clinical research, which is of course impor - tant. But you can also look at an area, say cancer, and say we have some problems across Europe in getting sys - tems to work better for patients and maybe encourage researchers to make a consortium to do research on that.\" This was supported by J\u00f6nsson, the health economist, who pointed out that focusing on developing a more consistent approach to the way invest - ment and spending decisions are taken would link to the EU agenda on transparency and accountability. \"The message that came out of the Innovation Task Force meeting,\" said Cornes, \"is that we spot innovation in treatment badly, we delay it com - ing through, we don't fund it and we must learn how to do better.\" Will oncologists be willing to step beyond their clinical responsibilities and get involved? We have to, said Cornes, who now spends half his time teach - ing health economics to oncologists. \"We have more people to treat with more treatments but potentially less resources in the future. If we abrogate the responsi - bility to lead on that, inev - itably we will be led by economists, administrators and politicians, and that would be a bad thing.\" nYou need vision at a European level to champion innovation as a goal Agn\u00e8s Buzyn Head of INCa, the French national cancer institute Conducting thorough evaluations of innovations forces you to reassess the value of what you are doing Bengt J\u00f6nsson Health economist at the Stockholm School of Economics e-GRANDROUNDJanuary-February 2014 I CancerWorld I 37 The European School of Oncology pre- sents weekly e-grandrounds that allow participants to discuss a range of cut- ting-edge issues with leading European experts. One of these is selected for pub - lication in each issue of Cancer World. In this issue Bhuey Sharma, Consultant Radiologist at the Royal Marsden in Lon - don, traces the evolution of oncological imaging from the invention of the X-ray in 1895 through to the hybrid anatomolecu - lar imaging techniques used today. The presentation is based on a paper pub - lished in Nature Reviews Clinical Oncol - ogy (9:728-737). Edited by Susan Mayor.Imaging in oncology - over a century of advances Imaging techniques used in staging and evaluation of response to treatment have improved dramatically over the past 120 years. The issue going forward will be learning to combine anatomical and functional imaging modalities to get a picture that is as close to the truth as possible. his e-grandround charts the evolution of pioneering imag - ing techniques. It describes their clinical applications in two tumour types - breast cancer and lym-phoma - and the impact they have had on the management of patients with these cancers, and looks ahead to cancer imaging aspects of the future. The timeline showing the develop - ment of different imaging techniques over the last 120 years is shown over - leaf, together with information on the key individuals involved in their design. A recurring theme is that the work leading to the development of most imaging modalities took place over many years, even decades, before the eventual invention. In addi - tion, a large number of people from a wide range of disciplines, includ - ing chemists, physicists, mathe - maticians, biologists and electrical engineers as well as physicians, were involved in these inventions.European School of Oncology e-grandround The recorded version of this and other e-grandrounds is available at www.e-eso.netT38 I CancerWorld I January-February 2014 e-GRANDROUND ing, significant work predated this particular invention. Allan Cormack, a South African physicist, described the fundamental mathematical phys- ics of CT in 1963, but Hounsfield was unaware of his work. Even ear - lier, the basic mathematics under - lying CT was described by Johann Radon in 1917, becoming known as the Radon transform, but Cormack and Hounsfield were both unaware of Radon's work. Subsequently, both Hounsfield and Cormack were rec - ognised for the discovery of CT, and awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiol - ogy or Medicine in 1979. CT is a fundamentally important technique in oncological imaging and has had huge impact. It remains the 'workhorse' modality in oncological imaging units across the world. Key X-rays X-rays were discovered in 1895 by the German physicist Wilhelm Conrad R\u00f6ntgen, who coined the term 'radi- ation X' for this previously unknown type of radiation. He resisted sugges - tions from colleagues to use the term 'R\u00f6ntgen rays' but this is sometimes used in some countries, including Germany. R\u00f6ntgen was awarded the first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901 for his discovery. The advantages of X-rays are that they are rapidly acquirable and easily reproducible. Disadvantages include exposing the patient to radiation and providing only limited oncological information. Over the last 100 years or so, X-ray imaging has been largely superseded by other oncological imaging techniques for a range of dif -ferent indications, but it remains an important technique to look for com - plications in cancer patients. Use of X-rays remains a mainstay in certain areas of oncological imaging, includ - ing mammography. This technique was first discovered by the German surgeon Albert Salomon in 1913, who observed the different appear - ance of tumour tissue compared to benign tissue in mastectomy sam - ples. It remains a very useful tech - nique, particularly for screening patients with fatty breasts and to look for microcalcification.

(2012) Nat Rev Clin Oncol 9: 728-737, reprinted with permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd \u00a9 2012advances in CT technology include the advent of helical CT in 1987 with multi-detector CT in 1998. An example of the way CT has changed clinical practice can be seen in lymphoma. Before CT, chest X-ray and lymphography were the main techniques used for patient work-up. Chest X-ray was used to look for mediastinal nodal involvement and lymphography was the crude tech-nique involving injection of dye into the web space in the feet to visualise involved lymph nodes. Staging lapa - rotomy was performed with splenec - tomy on patients to define whether the spleen was involved. CT changed all this by providing a whole-body imaging technique, which avoided the need for laparotomy and enabled imaging of the entire body to look for enlarged lymph nodes and extranodal sites of involvement. CT has also been very impor - tant in allowing the development of image-guided radiotherapy, and the development of response evaluation criteria is allied with the develop- ment of CT. The principal disadvan-tage of CT is the radiation dose, in addition to some clinical limitations discussed later. Magnetic resonance imaging Many individuals were involved in the development of MRI. Erwin Hahn described 'spin echoes' in the 1950s, for which he was subsequently awarded the Wolf Prize in physics. In the 1970s, Raymond Damadian reported that nuclear magnetic res- onance can distinguish cancer from normal tissue in vivo, and the Ameri - can chemist Paul Lauterbur produced the first MRI image of a mouse in 1974. Damadian went on to perform the first human MRI scan in 1977. British physicist Peter Mansfield was responsible for developing the math - ematical techniques leading to faster and clearer MRI imaging in 1977. Lauterbur and Mansfield were both awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiol - ogy or Medicine for their discoveries concerning MRI in 2003 but, contro- versially, Damadian was not recog-nised for his contribution. The advantages of MRI include the absence of radiation exposure; the technique provides good contrast resolution and has the ability to pro - vide multiplanar imaging. Limitations include the fact that patients with 40 I CancerWorld I January-February 2014 e-GRANDROUNDe-GRANDROUNDFour images demonstrating how the reso- lution and accuracy of lesion detection by PET imaging has increased over the past four decades.a) 1970s rectilinear 18F-fluouride scan - the pioneering rectilinear scanning tech - nique had been developed by Brownell and co-workers in 1953b) Non-attenuation-corrected whole-body PET imaging in the early 1990s, using fil- tered back projection rather than iterative reconstruction c) Attenuation-corrected (BGO crystal detector) FDG PET image from the late 1990s of a patient with breast cancer.

Nevertheless, MRI quickly gained clinical ground, hav - ing been invented from the outset as an oncological imaging technique. It was rapidly taken up for imaging of the central nervous system, particu - larly for brain tumour. There has also been considerable interest in MRI as a whole-body imaging technique. Positron emission tomography For many years we have used anatomi - cal techniques in oncological imaging, looking for anatomical changes. How - ever, in recent years interest has been growing in the use of functional imag - ing. Key individuals involved in the development of PET included Gor - don Brownell at the Massachusetts General Hospital in the 1950s and 1960s, and work from the Brookhaven National Institute in America in the 1960s. Michael Phelps, Michel Ter-Pogossian and Edward Hoffman pro-duced the first PET instrument in 1973, which enabled transaxial PET images to be obtained. PET is a functional technique that relies on the injection of a radioiso - tope, which is linked to a biologically active molecule that targets the site of interest in the body. The clinical tracer that has been in use for sev - eral decades is 18-fluorodeoxyglu- cose (FDG), discovered by Wolf and Fowler in 1978, which is comprised of glucose linked to a radioligand. The initial interest in PET was for neurological imaging, but in the late 1980s the focus moved to cardiac viability, looking at cardiac perfusion and hibernating myocardium. PET was found to be very useful in onco- logical imaging almost by chance, with the first oncological PET image being presented in 1991, using FDG as a radiotracer. To this day oncologi - cal imaging is by far the major use of PET in worldwide clinical practice. The advantages of PET include the capacity for whole-body imaging, lesion characterisation and accurate staging. Functional imaging provides an early response assessment in the sense that functional changes 'pre - date and predict' anatomical changes, so early response to a variety of treat - ments can be evaluated using func - tional techniques. Limitations include the drawback that FDG is not accurate across all tumour histologies and that tissue changes such as inflammation will also take up FDG, so it is not a truly tumour-specific ligand. The other key disadvantage of PET is that, unlike MRI, it involves a radiation dose. PET has made a stepwise change to clinical practice in lymphoma and a number of other tumour types, in a similar way to CT. In Hodgkin lym - phoma and high-grade lymphomas, PET leads to clinically significant stage migration at baseline staging (i.e. it picks up disease not detected by other imaging modalities, which January-February 2014 I CancerWorld I 41 e-GRANDROUNDe-GRANDROUNDBONE RESPONSE TO TREATMENThas an impact on the proposed treatment). It provides information for early response evaluation and in residual mass assessment, as to whether viable disease is still present or whether the residual mass reflects inactive fibrosis. PET-CT, which was originally envisaged by Townsend and Nutt in 1991, was invented in 1999, and led to a huge change in the use of PET across clinical practice, and widespread acceptance in the clinical community, by combining anatomical with functional information and ena - bling lesions to be precisely localised. The figure on the opposite page illus - trates the evolution of PET since the 1970s, with the first image demonstrat - ing a crude PET image from the 1970s through to the PET images that were produced in the early and late '90s, and then the stepwise further change with PET-CT in the last decade, leading to much more accurate anatomical locali- sation of sites of uptake. The figure above, right illustrates some of the strengths and weak - nesses of imaging science with PET-CT in images from a patient with breast cancer. Bone staging and response evaluation are real problems in oncological imaging. On anatomi - cal imaging (CT and MRI), 'increas - ing dense sclerosis' is one feature of bone response to treatment in a num - ber of different tumour types/situ- ations. However, in a proportion of oncology patients a point is reached where 'stable dense sclerosis' is pre-sent on CT/MRI, and it is not pos - sible to assess bone disease activity/ control. Functional imaging with PET can be very useful in a propor - tion of tumour histologies. The coronal CT images (on the right of the figure ) demon- strate diffuse heterogeneous sclero-sis throughout the axial and proximal appendicular skeleton imaged, which is stable compared with the previous scan (not shown). The colour-fused PET-CT image ( on the left) shows that the vast majority of the bone infiltra - tion in this patient with invasive ductal breast cancer is not FDG avid, rep - resenting a current complete macro- scopic metabolic response to systemic treatment. Abnormal 18FDG PET activity is shown only at L3 and the superior right ilium, reflecting sites of metabolically active bone disease. The PET findings implied that an ongoing maintenance (hormonal) treatment approach was suitable in this patient rather than re-institution of systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy. This was the subject of a large ret - rospective study of PET-CT in breast cancer, illustrating our philosophy regarding the importance of mul - tiparametric imaging for the optimal management of cancer patients (Ann Oncol 2011; 22:307-314). Looking to the future In terms of future directions, new techniques such as PET-MRI, which comprises a fusion of functional imaging and anatomical imaging, the use of novel targeted PET radio trac - ers, and the use of whole-body dif - fusion-weighted imaging are likely to make an important contribution. However, imaging history in oncology teaches us that no single technique is accurate across all tumour types, and in answering all specific tumour questions. Although these new tech - niques will likely come to the fore, each of them will have strengths and weaknesses and will not provide the universal answer to all of the prob - lems that we have in caring for can-cer patients. There are six fundamental hallmarks of cancer and these can be targeted in a specific way with radiotracers. Although we have been using FDG so far for the vast majority of clinical PET, more spe-cific radiotracers are increasingly being developed, with a number entering the clinical domain. As we develop radio-tracers targeted towards specific cell receptors and specific tumour recep - tors, then PET-CT and PET-MRI will become much more accurate.

The FDG PET images (middle column and bot-tom right; inverse grey scale, colour fused and maximum intensity pro - jection images respectively) demon - strate sites of increased metabolic activity in the right posterior cere - bral and cerebellar hemispheres in a patient with high-grade lymphoma with involvement of the central nerv - ous system (CNS). Note high physi - ological background CNS uptake on FDG PET imaging. The F-cho- line (novel radiotracer) PET imaging (left column and top right) demon- strates significantly higher accuracy than FDG PET for the detection of CNS lymphoma, revealing multifo - cal CNS lymphoma (which was con - cordant with IV contrast-enhanced MRI, images not shown ). F-choline is a specific substrate for choline kinase, an enzyme commonly overexpressed in malignant lesions due to its role in cell membrane synthesis. It is there - fore a measure of cellular proliferation rather than metabolic rate. To date, choline has found its most important PET application with prostate cancer, where FDG is not generally useful, as prostate cancers can have relatively low metabolic rates. Early work sug - gests that F-choline may be useful in the context of CNS lymphoma (one area of our current research). Diffusion-weighted imaging MRI is also likely to be important in oncolog - ical imaging in the coming years. The technique is being validated across a number of different tumour types in research, but shows significant prom - ise and is increasingly being used in oncology for brain and liver imag-ing. It also shows exciting promise for staging and response evaluation in bone marrow and in other problem areas such as assessment of perito - neal disease and brachial plexopathy. The concept of diffusion-weighted MRI relies on the difference in water movement in different tissues, with restricted water movement in areas of high cellularity contrasting with less restricted water diffusion in areas where tumour has been broken down to a less cellular structure. It is an MRI technique that provides whole-body imaging with no radiation exposure. Data can be quantified with the appar - ent diffusion coefficient (ADC), pro - viding an objective measure of tumour response (with PET, semi-quantitative analysis can be performed using the standard uptake value, or SUV).

After the phase I drug, the images at the bottom sug- gest bone disease is stable with no discernable differences on CT imag - ing; however, based on these images it is really impossible to define whether the patient is responding in the bony skeleton. The liver images demon - strate that there have been some slight changes in the liver metastases, although the liver status overall was considered stable according to the RECIST classification. The images on the right of the same figure are T2-weighted MRI images for the same patient. The top and bottom images show that the bony sclerosis looks stable - again impossible to define whether there has been a change in the patient's bone status. However, the liver images show marked widespread liver progression, so, in this particular case, MRI was more sensitive than CT in demonstrating liver disease progression. However, using diffusion-weighted MRI in the same patient, at the same time points, gives a different answer (see figure above, right). The left- hand images at the top and bottom of the figure show that the degree of restricted diffusion has reduced. The middle images show that the appar - ent diffusion coefficient (ADC) val - ues have reduced, with a shift on the ADC map, showing good bone response to treatment, which could not be defined from CT or 'stand- ard' MRI. Conversely, the diffusion- weighted MRI of the liver (right-hand images) demonstrates that there has been marked liver progression.

The patient asks, \"Should I be on an alka - line diet? I heard that alkalising the body kills cancer cells. I've also heard that sugar feeds cancer. Should I avoid sugar? How about graviola, a herb from the Amazon that is supposed to cure cancer? Can I get acupuncture during chemotherapy to reduce side effects?\" This not-uncommon scenario brings to mind pressing questions. What are these therapies and remedies that are not traditionally part of Western main - stream medical care? How do we, as oncologists, respond to questions about nontraditional therapies?Data on the use of adjunctive comple - mentary therapies for symptom con - trol is often confused by the use of the convenient acronym 'CAM' - comple - mentary and alternative medicine - in publications that fail to distinguish between alternative and complemen- tary modalities. The acronym is inher - ently imprecise. Some therapies, such as vitamins, are part of mainstream medical care when prescribed to patients with vitamin deficiencies or taken in appropriate amounts to main - tain general health. However, vita - mins are 'alternatives' when used in 'megadoses' as a treatment for cancer, sometimes in lieu of mainstream care. Similarly, 'prayer for health' might be a useful aid during mainstream cancer care in some regions of the world for some patients, but can be selected as a cancer 'treatment' in others. Thus, the terminology and its varying interpreta- tions interfere with accurate reporting and hinder the accurate understand - ing of survey data. The interest in therapies outside of mainstream oncology care is not lim-ited geographically or among particular segments of the population. In coun - tries in which modern medicine pre - dominates, 40-50% of patients with cancer use CAM therapies outside the mainstream. 1-6 Among cancer survivors in the US, up to 40% used comple - mentary or alternative therapies during the period following their treatment.7 The 2007 National Health Interview Survey showed that four in ten adults (38.3% of adults; 83 million individu - CLINICAL ONCOLOGYTwo practitioners of integrative oncology make the case for using non- traditional therapies alongside mainstream care - and for abandoning the term \"complementary and alternative medicine\" as unhelpful and misleading - in this comprehensive article, which first appeared in Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology.

As accurately stated in a recent publica - tion: \"the term 'integrative medicine' is fast replacing that of complementary and alternative medicine, or 'CAM.'\" 10 Another publication sums up the ter - minology problem well: \"this contro-versial term should be changed, since the words 'complementary' and 'alter - native' have different meanings and should not be connected by 'and'.\" 11 Complementary therapies are those used to complement or use along - side conventional methods of therapy, whereas alternative methods refer to those that are used instead of known conventional therapies. Accordingly, the term 'integrative therapies' accu - rately describes the complementary treatments being used in medical set-tings alongside conventional practices. Centres for integrative medicine are being established in many academic medical centres. 11 Indeed, the term CAM is rarely applied in legitimate settings, and virtually every National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated comprehensive cancer centre in the US has a programme or department using the term 'integrative medicine'. In addition, the US Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integra - tive Medicine has a membership of 55 esteemed academic medical centres with medical schools, all of which have integrative medicine programmes. In this article, we summarise the data on helpful complementary ther - apies and their appropriate incorpo - ration into cancer care (integrative oncology), discuss nonviable alterna - tive therapies and examine the patient interest in these therapies.

Acupuncture is used to treat a wide variety of ailments, although its effi - cacy has been evaluated with rigor - ous scientific research methodology only in the past few decades. Clinical trials have shown that the treatment is safe and effective for several symp - toms experienced by patients with cancer. 32 Indeed, a Cochrane review of 11 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) encompassing 1,247 patients - most using sham acupuncture as controls - concluded that acupunc-ture reduces chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. 33 The majority of acupuncture trials have been con-ducted to determine the efficacy of acupuncture in reducing pain. Recent systematic reviews of RCTs support the analgesic effects of acupuncture for certain types of pain (for example, musculoskeletal pain, osteoarthritis and chronic headache). 34, 35 Further - more, acupuncture has shown benefit in reducing radiation-induced xeros - tomia,36 but mixed results in reduc - ing hot flushes experienced by women with breast cancer. 37-39 The technique is possibly effective in reducing lym-phoedema in women with breast can- cer who had axillary dissection. 40 Both a systematic review of 46 RCTs and a Cochrane review showed that acu - puncture seems effective in treating insomnia, although larger, rigorously designed RCTs are warranted. 41 Acu- puncture has also been shown to relieve anxiety in a diverse patient population.42-44 Acupuncture is generally safe when performed by qualified practitioners. After 760,000 treatments in 97,733 patients receiving acupuncture in Germany, only six cases of treatment-related serious adverse events were reported. 45 The most common adverse effects (<5%) included minor bleeding Complementary approaches Mind-body therapies Mind-body modalities focus on inter - actions between the brain, mind, body and behaviour with the intention of reducing symptoms and promot-ing health. Some of these therapies, such as meditation, relaxation tech - niques, hypnotherapy, yoga, T'ai Chi, music therapy and qigong have ancient roots; others, more recently developed, include the likes of guided imagery. 12 The common goal of mind-body thera- pies is to reduce the effects of anxiety, fear, phobia, anger, resentment, depres - sion and pain on the patient while pro - moting a sense of emotional, physical and spiritual well-being. Mind-body therapies do not treat cancer per se. Numerous clinical trials of variable quality have been conducted to assess the benefits of these techniques. For example, systematic reviews and meta-analyses have consistently shown that mind-body techniques do reduce anxiety and stress, improve sleep quality and overall quality of life, especially when used with other treat - ments (such as drugs). 13-17 Among such therapies, mindfulness-based stress reduction is the best studied - an approach that focuses on devel - oping the patient's objective 'observer role' for emotions, - and creating a nonjudgmental 'mindful state' of conscious aware-ness. 18 Its meditative components of body scan, sitting meditation and mindful movement are taught over a period of weeks. 18 By contrast, yoga, T'ai Chi and qigong, which originated in Asia, are less well studied, despite being commonly used. They com-bine physical movement, postures and breath control with meditation. A few small trials (20-80 patients) have shown a reduction in anxiety, depres - sion and distress as well as improved emotional well-being in patients with cancer who practice these techniques, as measured by standard validated instruments. 19-21 Although mind-body therapies are generally safe, their effectiveness requires instructors skilled in convey - ing appropriate technique and regular practice by the patient. These help - ful complementary modalities can be used as part of a multidiscipli - nary approach to patient care. Major research studies are underway to elucidate the mechanisms by which mental activity exerts control over physiological function, 22-24 AcupunctureAcupuncture, an ancient technique with great contemporary interest, involves the placement of special needles at certain body points (acu-points) a few millimetres to a few centimetres into the skin, which can be followed by manual manipulation or the application of heat or electric pulses to the needles. 25 Historically, acupuncture was thought to exert its effect by regulating the flow of energy (called chi or qi) along merid - ians in the body when inserted into these acupoints. 25 Although anatomi- cal studies have shown that acupoints tend to be located over interstitial con - nective tissue planes,26 current evi- dence does not conclusively support the claim that acupuncture points or meridians are electrically distin - guishable. 27 However, substantial data from neuroscientific research suggest that the effects of acupuncture are mediated via modulation of nervous system activity. 28-31 Regulated as med - ical devices in the US, acupuncture needles are sterile, single-use, fili - form, 32-36 gauge and 30-40 mm in length.

Cases of serious adverse events - including cerebrovascular accidents, ureteral stent displacement, haematoma, nerve damage and posterior interosseous syndrome - have been reported, usually as a result of exotic types of mas - sage (such as application of very strong pressure not appropriate for the anatomical location) or massage delivered by laypeople. 49,50 When delivered appropriately, massage therapy is a valuable, soothing com - plementary therapy that aids symptom control in patients with cancer and on which many patients rely. Alternative therapies Patients might seek alternative therapies for a variety of reasons, including frustration with a lack of improvement using mainstream treatments. In the past, cancer was considered a dire disease with few effective treatments; accord- ingly, patients sought more-effec - tive, gentler treatments - real or imaginary. 51 Today, the primary danger of alternative therapies is that patients delay or forego altogether effec- tive cancer treatment. For exam-ple, instead of undergoing surgical resection of an early-stage breast cancer, a patient might opt for an alternative 'natural therapy'. By the time it becomes apparent to the patient that the therapy has not controlled the growth of her cancer, it has metastasised, ren - dering it incurable. Another risk to patients is that most alterna- tive therapies are very costly. And as these are rarely covered by or bruising and pain or unfamiliar sensations at the acupuncture sites. In patients with cancer, acupuncture should not be given to those with severe neutrope - nia or thrombocytopenia due to their higher risk of infection or bleed - ing, or at the site of primary or metastatic neoplasm. Acupuncture is not an opti- mum first-line treatment for symptom relief. Rather, it can be considered when standard treatment is not satisfactory or not tolerated. In patients with severe chemo - therapy-induced nausea, vomit- ing, pain, xerostomia or hot flushes in spite of optimal medical manage - ment, acupuncture can be included as part of a multimodal management plan. Although some insurance com-panies do cover acupuncture treat-ment provided by qualified therapists for certain indications, the cost- effectiveness of acupuncture remains to be determined. Manipulative and body-based practicesMassage therapy and other manual techniques - such as Swedish massage, shiatsu, tui na, reflexology, Thai mas - sage, Ayurvedic massage, lymphatic drainage and myofascial release - are provided by massage therapists, physi-cal therapists and occupational thera-pists. 46 These practices, which evolved from various cultures, focus primar - ily on the musculoskeletal system and connective tissues. For example, Swed - ish massage, the most commonly prac - tised massage therapy in the West, uses five styles of long, flowing strokes - effleurage (gliding), petrissage (knead - ing), tapotement (rhythmic tapping), friction and vibration/shaking - to manipulate soft tissues.Most cancer-related clinical trials of massage therapy focus on Swed - ish massage and reflexology (foot mas - sage using specified parts of the sole thought to relate to bodily organs or locations). Results have been summa-rised in two systematic reviews that incorporate 14 RCTs and 12 RCTs, respectively, with some overlap.47,48 The control interventions used in these trials include standard of care, attention (where patients received interpersonal interactions but not massage therapy) or low-inten- sity bodywork, such as light touch. Although the reviewers indicate that the research methodology of most trials included in both reviews was poor - for example, small sample sizes or the lack of any attempt to control for nonspecific effects - the data do support massage therapy as an effec- tive adjunct in cancer supportive care to reduce anxiety and pain. 47,48 Massage therapy in patients with cancer must be provided by certi - fied massage therapists who are also trained in working with patients with cancer, to minimise risk of injury. For example, only light-touch massage should be provided to frail patients. CURE for CANCERT'ai Chi50 I CancerWorld I January-February 2014 FOCUSof natural products. Furthermore, these therapies rely heavily on tes - timonials of purported users of the products; the promotional materi-als are often laden with specious scientific jargon that can appeal to laypersons, but their misleading nature is obvious to anyone versed in cancer biology. Other examples include 'oxygen therapy' (ingestion or injection of substance containing hydrogen peroxide or ozone) and variations of bioelectromagnetism (subjecting the body to electromag - netic field generated by a device), as are various 'energy therapies'. 58 The parties that stand to profit from these products use various tactics to circumvent laws and reg- ulations. They often use carefully worded statements or testimonials to create the impression that the products can cure cancer without literally saying so. Or, they disasso - ciate themselves from the promoters by engaging in multilevel market - ing or 'guerrilla marketing' schemes. Although the FDA (US regulatory body) has investigated numerous unsubstantiated claims and the Fed - eral Communications Commission (FCC) investigates such false adver - tisements, the resources required to gather evidence and initiate legal actions are such that they can only prosecute a small number of viola - tors. Physicians should educate their patients about why these therapies should be avoided. Anticancer diets A near-universal patient question concerns diet. Often patients are not satisfied with the usual dietary advice offered by dieticians, and seek 'anticancer' diets - an approach that has spawned its own category of self-help books.insurance schemes, patients must pay out of pocket for them, often depleting their resources with the false hope that they are receiving effective therapy. The subsequent financial havoc creates tremendous distress for the patient and family. A third risk is that these therapies make false promises to desperate patients - results that cannot be delivered, representing an act of deception and betrayal. As clini - cians, we have a moral obligation to dissuade patients from these use - less therapies. Miraculous cancer cures Proponents of alternative therapies claim to produce 'amazing' results in patients with cancer who have not responded to conventional therapy. The treatment can be as simple as a single product from an exotic source or derived from a 'breakthrough dis- covery' decades ago yet 'suppressed' by mainstream medicine thereafter. For example, amygdalin (also known as laetrile) is an extract from bitter apricot seeds that is not - despite its other moniker of vitamin B17 - a vitamin. Although clinical stud - ies have shown a lack of efficacy 52,53 and a risk of cyanide toxicity,54 some patients continue to seek and use it. In our own recent experience, one patient proudly displayed her vita - min B17 pill bottle during a consul - tation and claimed that someone told her it cured his cancer after he had been told he had only months to live. We are certain other oncologists have been faced with similar situations. Another touted miracle cure is caesium therapy, in which patients ingest caesium chloride (CsCl) to alkalinise the body. Proponents claim CsCl will kill the cancer cells because cancer cells \"perish in an alkaline, high-pH, environment.\" 55 Unfortunately, ingestion of CsCl can lead to torsade de pointes, a potentially lethal cardiac arrhyth-mia. 56,57 This alternative treatment can also include an elaborate regi - men of special diets, detoxifica - tion techniques and large doses n P oor prognosis and lack of effective treatment - willingness to try 'anything' n P atient activism - wishing to search for nonmainstream treatments perceived as unknown by oncologists n P atient empowerment - feeling like an active participant in self care n Cultur al values and belief systems - believing that anything 'natural' is good and 'synthetic chemicals' are bad n T radition of using indigenous medical systems - including traditional Chinese, Ayurvedic and Latin American folk medicine n Conspir acy theories - believing that pharmaceutical companies suppress cura - tive 'natural products' out of profit motive n The int ernet and search engine technology - providing quick access to a vast amount of information and misinformation n Dir ect-to-patient marketing - promotions by product manufacturers that include attractive packaging and specious 'scientific' jargon n V iral messages - medical myths, health tips and 'cancer cure secrets' propa - gated by friends, relatives and others; a patient's willingness to complyFACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO PATIENTS' INTERESTS IN ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES FOCUSJanuary-February 2014 I CancerWorld I 51 Sugar and cancer The notion that sugar 'feeds' cancer is frequently cited by concerned patients. Although not entirely without merit - glucose metabolism is an active area of research in anticancer drug develop- ment 68 - it is often exaggerated in pub- lic perception. Some patients become paranoid about all sugar-containing food, regardless of the amount. Such anxiety by itself is detrimental to the quality of life of patients and should be avoided. Instead, patients should be advised to keep things in perspec - tive: no definitive data have shown that sugar promotes cancer growth. How - ever, excessive intake of refined sugar is unhealthy for many reasons, espe - cially for its association with metabolic syndrome, and should accordingly be minimised. A small amount of refined sugar is not harmful. To meet caloric requirements, patients should con - sume complex, unrefined carbohy - drates and unsaturated fat (unless they have a digestive tract condition that precludes those foods) and avoid large amounts of foods with added sugar. 69 Natural product dietary supplements The use of supplements is among the most frequently questioned sub - jects by patients. Over-the-coun-ter dietary supplements available to patients with cancer include vitamins and trace-element formulations that have well-defined constituents. Addi- tionally, botanical extracts and herbal products that often contain complex compositions of many compounds, some of which are unidentified, are also available. Indeed, botanicals, fungi and marine organisms (such as sea sponges) are a rich source of ther - apeutic compounds that are used in cancer therapy; chemotherapeutic agents derived from natural sources - Alkaline dietsOne example that is frequently cited in this category is the so-called alka - line or pH diet. This diet is similar to the concept behind caesium ther - apy, that acidity promotes cancer and cancer cells cannot survive in an alkaline environment. By drinking 'alkaline water', distributed from an expensive device hooked up to a fau - cet [tap], and eating 'alkaline foods', which happen to be mainly fresh veg - etables, fruits, legumes and nuts, one can ward off cancer, arthritis, obesity and other diseases. These claims disregard the fact that the body maintains a tight pH range and eliminates excess acid or alkaline to preserve pH bal- ance. Treated water has lit - tle buffering capacity, there- fore, drinking so-called alkaline water will not significantly affect blood pH levels. Simi - larly, glorifying alkaline foods simply translates to eating food that is healthy, which provides essential nutrients and not an alkaline envi - ronment toxic to can-cer Many other anticancer diets with lit-tle scientific basis circulate among patients, including the Budwig diet, the Gerson diet, the raw food diet and many more. 58 In addition, 'detox' or 'mono' diets (such as those relying mainly on vegetable and fruit juice) can restrict or preclude important food categories that are necessary for a full range of nutrition. A high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet is another popular subject of inquiry. Animal studies suggest that ketogenic diets induce excessive oxidative stress and might enhance the therapeutic effects of radiotherapy.59 Clinical trials are underway to evaluate their benefits and risks.60-62 When responding to diet-related inquiries, oncologists might find it help-ful to point to the 'kernels' of truth in the marketing materials for these pro-grammes. The basic requirements for optimal health are to consume a variety of wholesome fresh foods and to reduce the intake of processed food. None of the radi- cal anticancer diets that employ restrictive regimens have been shown to significantly improve survival. As such, patients adher - ing to these schemes run the risk of mal - nutrition. Opti- mal caloric and nutrient intake is very impor - tant for patients to be able to with - stand their cancer thera- pies. Counselling patients who ask about these diets also provides a good opportunity to put dietary advice in the context of an overall healthy lifestyle, which also includes regular exercise. 63 The potential for physical activity to improve outcomes, 64,65 including benefits to patients receiving pallia- tive care,66,67 should be noted. Many leading cancer facilities have exercise programmes tailored to the needs of patients with cancer, with experienced fitness instructors who routinely work with patients across a broad range of abilities and disabilities.CURE for CANCERT'ai ChiFOCUS52 I CancerWorld I family (48%) and the media (21%),1,84 with additional information - as well as misinforma - tion - being delivered via the inter - net and social networks.85 The general interest in complementary modali- ties has increased in recent decades because of increasing supportive data on the value of complementary ther - apies, as well as growing professional and patient acceptance of the modali - ties used. Additionally, the emphasis on wellness and survivorship, which incorporates managing long-term adverse effects from cancer treatment and reducing risk of cancer recur - rence, has enhanced general interest in complementary modalities. Impediments to communication Optimal cancer care demands deal - ing with issues that are important to patients, including those that are likely to be detrimental if left unaddressed. Proper dialogue about the use and application of therapies is important. The majority of patients want to discuss the topic with their oncologists given the opportunity, yet nondisclosure remains a problem, in part because the opportunity fails to arise. 86 Addition- ally, patients have also reported being fearful of physician disapproval or dis- interest in what they do outside of con - ventional treatment, or assume that such information is not important or relevant to their cancer treatment. 87,88 By contrast, physicians believe that patient nondisclosure is attributable to patient fears of physician disapproval or lack of understanding. 89 As the preva- lence of complementary therapy use is high, initiating a discussion provides an excellent opportunity for the physician to demonstrate compassion, under - standing and humanity, in addition to providing high-quality care based on scientific data.so-called natural products in chemical jargon - include the taxanes (paclitaxel is isolated from the Pacific Yew tree), camptothecin (isolated from of C. acuminata, the Chinese 'happy C. roseus) and numerous microbial compounds. 70 However, decades of research are needed to ascertain the clinical safety and efficacy of compounds derived from natural sources in clinical stud-ies. Natural products available as die - tary supplements are not viable cancer treatments until their efficacy has been established in such studies. Patients with cancer often ask about natural products that have been shown to have activity against cancer in animal or in vitro studies, but unconfirmed in clinical trials. Many are readily available as dietary supplements, and patients can use them on their own, often with - out informing their physicians. In addi - tion, patients might pursue the use of natural products marketed with 'buzz-words' such as antioxidant, immune booster or detox. A comprehensive list of such supplements has been reported. 71 Patients view these prod- ucts as helpful during cancer treatment because of claims that the prod - ucts protect 'good' cells from damage, restore suppressed immune function or remove toxins 'left behind' by cancer treatment. Some of these agents might hold promise in cancer prevention or treatment; for example, early-phase clinical trials of polyphenols extracted from green tea have demonstrated ben - efit in the treatment of chronic lym-phocytic leukaemia (CLL) 72 and in the chemoprevention of breast cancer.73 Similarly, docosahexanoic acid (DHA, an 3-fatty acid) has demonstrated positive results in breast cancer preven - tion74 and treatment,75 as has curcumin in slowing progression from mono -clonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) to multiple mye-loma. 76 Nonetheless, the majority of the available supplements has not shown a reasonable possibility of meaningful clinical benefits when ingested orally. Many also carry the risk of interacting with prescription medicines or have their own detrimental effects. 77-80 For example, several herbs possess oestro - gen-like activity, the intake of which is not advisable for women with oestro - gen-receptor-positive cancers.81 Other supplements can alter drug metabo- lism, such as St John's wort, leading to serum drug levels higher or lower than intended. 82 Misconceptions held by patients after reading news reports or marketing materials need to be invali- dated in a language patients can under - stand (see Table opposite). Patient characteristics Surveys indicate that patients with cancer who use complementary or alternative approaches tend to be female as well as younger, better edu - cated and more affluent than those who do not, representing a health- conscious segment of the popula - tion that is proactive in its healthcare, that seeks health information and that has the means to pay for services not typically covered by insurance or public health schemes. 1-6 Given the increased sophistication of patients and physicians in recent years, patients and their oncologists increasingly pur - sue discussions of integrative oncol-ogy, alert to the fact that incorporating complementary (adjunctive) therapies into mainstream cancer treatment can decrease symptoms and improve over - all quality of life. Furthermore, such discussions facilitate patients in hav-ing an active role in their care. 83 Patients acquire information about complementary approaches primarily FOCUSJanuary-February 2014 I CancerWorld I 53 Dilemmas for clinicians Although most patients use natu - ral products (supplements) hoping to reduce the adverse effects of con - ventional treatment, support the body through cancer treatment or prevent cancer recurrence, other patients with few or no effective treatment options might want to try anything. This des - peration can lead the patient to use natural products that have shown some possible anticancer activity in early preliminary studies. Although the chances of efficacy might be extremely remote, these patients might come to the clinic with information about the benefits of various elaborate, so-called anticancer regimens. One example is the Bill Peeples cocktail, which is often asked about by patients with advanced-stage sar - coma. 90 This product contains more than a dozen dietary supplemental ingredients that the manufacturer claims have antiangiogenic or antiox-idant properties based on laboratory studies, plus a few prescription medi- cines used off-label. Such a scenario presents a dilemma for the oncologist faced with a patient for whom there is no effective treatment or appropriate clinical trial. How do we provide com - passionate care while safeguarding our patient's best interests?We believe that the answer lies in meeting patients where they are. We can affirm their perseverance not to give up, and tolerate their use of agents that are generally safe and have shown some preliminary evidence of antican - cer activity. At the same time, we also need to help the patient work towards accepting whatever outcome he or she will eventually face, despite their best efforts and those of the treating phy - sicians and caregivers. Palliative care often begins too late in clinical prac - tice. 91 Instead, patients' options, goals and preferences should be assessed early in the course of cancer treat - ment. Personalised care of patients COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS BY PATIENTS WITH CANCER AND EXAMPLE RESPONSES Question, belief or statement Possible responses Examples XYZ was reported to kill cancer cells in a laboratory experiment. Should I take it?What works in the test tube often does not work in humans because the concentration used in the laboratory is so high that you could never achieve that level in the tumour tissue by ingesting the herb.Many things kill cancer cells in the test tube, but what kills the cancer cells might also hurt the healthy cells.Paclitaxel is a drug derived from the yew tree. To get the equivalent of one dose, you would need to ingest >100 lbs of tree bark. Taking a few capsules of the tree bark will not do anything.If you add bleach to cancer cells, they will die. However, no one would drink bleach to treat cancer. Chemotherapeutic drugs are toxins. I want to detoxify my body.Some 'detox' therapies increase the activity of the enzymes in the liver to remove toxins. These enzymes can also remove chemotherapy drugs faster, meaning you are not getting the correct dose needed.St John's wort seems to reduce the adverse effects of chemotherapy, but was later found to also lower the level of the active metabolite of irinotecan in the blood. 77 I have so many adverse effects from my cancer treatment. Can I take XYZ to give me more energy or boost my immune system?Be careful\u2014some herbs have their own adverse effects or can fight against other medications you are taking.Some 'energy boosting' herbs can raise your heart rate and blood pressure. Others can make your blood thinner if you are taking anticoagulants. Some might contain oestrogen- like substances, which might reduce your hot flushes, but can reduce the effect of the hormonal therapy you are on. Some herbs elevate your liver enzymes. I heard that antioxidants have anticancer properties. Should I take them? Antioxidants can protect DNA from damage by harmful elements in the environment, but they will not revert already-mutated genes back to normal. Antioxidants might have a role in cancer prevention, but they will not treat cancer; their effects in cancer prevention have not been confirmed. A healthy diet is more important than taking individual supplements.Initial small studies suggested that vitamin E and selenium might prevent prostate cancer. Later, a randomized controlled study with tens of thousands of people showed no cancer preventive effects and even a harmful effect. 78,79 Antioxidants protect the body from damage caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy.For antioxidants to protect from chemotherapy and radiotherapy the antioxidants would need to distinguish between normal cells and cancer cells, otherwise they would protect the cancer cells as well.High-dose antioxidants given during radiotherapy have been shown to reduce adverse effects during treatment, but also might have made the cancer more likely to recur. 104FOCUS54 I CancerWorld I January-February 2014of methods for the of com - plementary modalities for oncolo - gists.94 Together, these works provided a framework for counselling patients with cancer on complementary or alternative therapies. At Memorial Sloan-Kettering Can - cer Center, each new patient receives an information packet that reminds them to discuss any self-prescribed supplements or medications with their physicians. All patients are asked at each visit to disclose any herbs and other dietary supplements they are tak - ing. Patients who raise questions about com-plementary or alter - native therapies that require discussion - and those who are on supplements at risk of interacting with pre - scription medicines - are referred to the Integrative Medicine Service for compre - hensive counselling. During the counselling (see Figure opposite), physicians well versed in both oncology and integrative medicine make a comprehensive assessment of the patient's needs and address the issues from both the overall cancer care perspective and the patient-spe - cific perspective. Practice models of integrative oncology vary according to the patient demographics and the societal envi- ronment of the medical facility. The integration is not always easy and can be hampered by a lack of awareness or perceived importance by oncologists, a lack of properly trained physicians knowledgeable in both cancer medi - cine and complementary therapies, a lack of trust between physicians and sources of facts and sound advice. These qualified personnel can serve as valuable resources for future ques-tions, to provide support for patients' efforts, and to divert energy away from useless and potentially harmful or expensive approaches. Furthermore, as patients gain information about additional symptom management techniques, they experience positive interactions with their physicians, improve self-care skills and enhance their physical, emotional and overall well-being. 95,96 A structured approach to discussing the use of complementary or alternative medicine with patients in general was described in 1997 and updated in 2002. 97,98 Although written for use in the primary care or inter - nal medicine settings, this approach might be helpful in the oncology set - ting as well. A similar report focused on discussing complementary or alter - native medicine with patients in the oncology care setting. 93 In 2010, a set of comprehensive communica - tion guidelines was proposed on the basis of a systematic literature review with advanced-stage cancer should be tailored to the diverse physical, psy - chological, social and spiritual conse - quences of cancer for the individual. 92 Using complementary or alternative therapies might help patients feel con - tent that they have explored every pos- sible option, help them to accept the futility of further treatment and facili - tate closure. Accordingly, the treating oncologist must take a compassion - ate approach in accepting these deci - sions by the patient. Similarly, an effort must be made to minimise the physical, emotional and financial bur - dens experienced by the patient, discuss and closely moni- tor adverse reactions and prepare the patient and family for end-of-life issues. Integrative oncology programmes Combining helpful complementary ther - apies with mainstream cancer care to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life constitutes the practice of integrative oncology. Many, if not most, cancer centres have established integrative oncology departments or programmes to pro - vide complementary therapies and to counsel patients about potentially problematic dietary supplements and alternative therapies. Counselling by trained and experienced physicians should include guiding patients away from potentially harmful therapies and addressing their underlying psychoso - cial or cultural needs. 93,94 Referring patients to qualified specialists, ther - apists, counsellors or instructors con - nects these individuals to appropriate T'ai Chi for FOCUSJanuary-February 2014 I CancerWorld I 55 complementary therapies practition - ers who are not medical doctors or insufficient funds. An investigation of six integrative oncology programmes across four continents identified sev - eral essential elements for a success- ful programme: location within the oncology department area, oncolo-gist referral to consultation with sufficient time for integrative oncologist-oncologist com-munication, that is evidence based, professional comple - mentary medicine practitioners and coverage of the cost for the integrative oncology service. 99 For busy oncologists, staying abreast of new complementary medi - cine research results and of the ever-expanding world of alternatives to mainstream cancer treatment is diffi - cult. However, many excellent contin - uing education materials are available from reputable sources. In addition, the knowledge and expertise available from integrative oncology colleagues can be extremely helpful, especially those dual-trained in mainstream oncology and integrative medicine. National-level and international-level can informa-tion to practising oncologists. A mul - tidisciplinary nonprofit organisation - the Society for Integrative Oncology - was formed by clinicians, research - ers and patient advocates to provide a platform for the advancement of evi - dence-based, comprehensive, integra - tive healthcare to improve the lives of people affected by cancer. 100 Using the standard methodology for devel - opment of a practice guideline, which consists of systematic review of cur - rent literature and multiple rounds of peer reviews, the group evaluated the strength of the evidence for com - mon complementary therapies, as well as any potential risks or burdens. The resulting recommendations were graded, peer-reviewed and adapted by the American College of Chest Phy - sicians 101,102 and the Society for Inte - grative Oncology.103 These guidelines represent an initial effort in giving cli - nicians who might not be familiar with complementary therapies evidence-based assessments of the therapies, and when and how to incorporate them into the care of patients with cancer. With time, these national and international efforts in raising the awareness of integrative oncol - ogy and its application in clinical care would improve the overall care of cancer patients. Conclusions Complementary or alternative medi - cine are topics that patients with can - cer are highly interested in and also find quite confusing. Safe and bene - ficial complementary therapies should be integrated into regular cancer care to improve patient quality of life and outcome. However, patients should be steered away from alternative cancer therapies that are risky and do not have clinical value. Integrative oncology combines complementary therapies with mainstream care, trying to opti- mise the patient's physical, psycho - logical and spiritual well-being, taking into consideration the individual's val- ues and priorities in life. A robust inte - grative oncology programme should be part of any high-quality cancer care institution, as is the case for virtually all NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centres. By understanding and addressing issues our patients feel are important, compassionate care can be tailored to each patient, and oncology will reach the noble goal of treating each patient as a person with cancer, rather than treating only the cancer in a patient. nAuthor affiliations Gary Deng and Barrie Cassileth, Integrative Medicine Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New YorkReferences Details of the references cited in this article can be found at www.cancerworld.com Steps in advising patients who are interested in complementary and alternative therapiesNEWSROUND58 I CancerWorld I January-February 2014newsround Selected reports edited by Janet Fricker Clinical trials lead to cost savings n British Journal of Cancer On average, non-commercial oncology clinical trials are associated with small excess treatment costs compared to the standard of care, while commercial trials are associated with high cost savings, concludes a UK study conducted in a single centre. Recruitment of patients to clinical trials was found to be associated overall with consid - erable cost savings. It has long been thought that conducting clinical trials incurs additional costs above the standard of care. Such perceptions remain a barrier to academic clinical trials being performed in many countries. In the current study, Pippa Corrie and colleagues, from the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation, explored the financial implications of conducting clinical trials. Between January 2009 and December 2010 the team undertook a retrospective cost attribution analysis to determine the treatment costs associated with oncology (non-haematology) clinical trials. At the centre, over the two-year period, 357 can-cer patients were recruited to 53 different interventional clinical trials, of which 40 were phase II, two randomised II/III and 11 phase II. Altogether 27 of the trials were academic, non-commercial sponsored trials, and 26 were commercial sponsored trials. For each protocol, the treatment cost dif- ference for the experimental arm(s) was calculated as the difference between the experimental arm treatment costs and standard of care costs. The costs for can - cer drugs were obtained from the British National Formulary (2010). Results show that, in comparison with the standard of care, the average treatment costs were an excess of \u00a3431 ( \u20ac520) for a non-commercial trial (range \u00a36393 excess to \u00a36005 savings) and a saving of \u00a39294 (\u20ac11,215) for a commercial trial (range \u00a30 to \u00a371,489). There was an overall treatment cost saving of \u00a3388,719 ( \u20ac469,000) in 2009 and \u00a3496,556 (\u20ac 599,100) in 2010, largely attributable to provision of free drug supplies from pharmaceutical companies. Overall, the treatment cost savings to the NHS were estimated to be approaching \u00a30.5 million (\u20ac0.6 million) per annum. Notably, seven of the non-commercial trials were associated with treatment cost savings. Two of these trials, SCOT (adjuvant chemotherapy in colorectal cancer) and PERSEPHONE (adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer), evaluated whether shorter durations of adjuvant treatment (which cost less) were as effective as the standard of care. Such studies, stress the authors, demonstrate the importance of academic trials, addressing questions that would not represent a priority for industry sponsors. \"In our view, this data provides overwhelm- ing evidence to refute any concern that clini-cal research generates a cost pressure for the health service. On the contrary, we have dem - onstrated significant financial gains,\" write the authors. A balanced portfolio of both commer - cial and non-commercial research, they add, should offer the greatest benefits to patients and the overall health economy. n E Liniker, M Harrison, JMJ Weaver et al.

While anthracycline chemotherapy has remained the cornerstone of breast can - cer treatment for four decades, efficacy has been undermined by its dose-depend - ent cardiotoxicity. In the current study, Paul Stoodley and colleagues, from Liver - pool Hospital, Liverpool, Australia, set out to establish whether strain imaging would reveal LV systolic dysfunction not discern - ible with LVEF in patients with HER2/neu-negative breast cancer up to 12 months after treatment with anthracyclines. Between October 2008 and March 2011, 78 consecutive anthracycline-naive breast cancer patients were studied prior to the commencement of anthracycline chemo-therapy (T1) and within seven days of com-pleting anthracycline therapy (T2). Then in the second part of the study patients found to be HER2/neu-negative were studied at six months (T3) and 12 months (T4) after the initial exam. At these time points LVEF was measured by Simpson's method accord - ing to recommendations of the European Association of Echocardiography, while LV longitudinal peak systolic strain (LPSS) was measured with 2D speckle tracking echocardiography. Altogether 28 of the original 78 par - ticipants (36%) were found to be HER2/neu-positive by in situ hybridisation, and therefore proceeded to trastuzumab ther - apy and were excluded from the analysis at T3 and T4. This left 50 HER2/neu-negative participants who were studied at four time points over 12 months. Results show that global systolic strain was significantly reduced from a baseline of -19.0\u00b12.3% to -17.5 \u00b1 2.3% immedi- ately to -18.2\u00b12.2% ( P=0.01). LVEF, on the other hand, remained largely unchanged at both T2 and T3. By 12 months (T4), global strain had nor - malised in 84% of patients, with persistent strain remaining in 16% ( n=8). A re-analysis of data from patients with persistent global strain showed that they had greater reduc - tions in strain at six months (-17.2%), and had received higher cumulative doses of anthracyclines. \"While HER2/neu positive patients treated with adjuvant trastuzumab are monitored closely, we have demonstrated subclinical LV dysfunction by strain analysis in HER2/neu negative patients, who comprise ~75% of all breast cancer patients,\" write the authors. Monitoring HER2/neu-negative patients who receive anthracycline therapy at base - line and six months, they add, would help identify patients with subclinical cardiac dysfunction who would benefit from addi- tional cardiac monitoring and treatment. n P Stoodley, D Richards, A Boyd et al.

Eur J Cancer November 2013, 49:3396-3403 Model predicts life expectancy in patients with metastatic cancer n Cancer The TEACHH model is able to divide patients receiving palliative radiotherapy into three distinct life expectancy groups. The approach, suggest the US authors, offers the promise to better tailor palliative thera - pies to the patient's outlook. Estimating prognosis is one of the most difficult tasks encountered by oncologists, particularly for patients with metastases whose life expectancy can vary between days and years. But predicting life expec - tancy has important clinical implications. In an earlier study, Edward Chow and col -leagues, from the University of Toronto, created and validated a prognostic model that categorised palliative cancer patients into one of three prognostic groups, using the cancer type (breast vs non-breast), Kar - nofsky performance status (<70 vs >70) and metastasis location (bone only vs other) (JCO 2008, 26:5863-69). In the current study Monica Krishnan and colleagues, from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, set out to build on the model created by Chow to identify patients at the extreme ends of the prognostic spectrum, i.e. those with short (<3 months) and long (>1 year) life spans. Between June 2008 and July 2011, the records of 862 patients with metastatic can - cer receiving palliative radiotherapy at the Dana-Farber Brigham and Women's Cancer Center were retrospectively reviewed. Results of a multivariate analysis showed that factors significantly associated with shorter life expectancy were cancer type (lung and other vs breast and prostate), older age (>60 years vs <60 years) liver metastases, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (2-4 vs 0-1), hospitalisations within three months before palliative radiotherapy (0 vs >1) and prior palliative chemotherapy courses (>2 vs 0-1). A further analysis showed that patients in group A who had 0-1 risk factors had a median overall survival of 19.9 months (95%CI, 13.9-31.1 months), that patients in group B who had 2-4 risk factors had a median overall survival of 5.0 months (95%CI 4.3-5.6 months), and that patients in group C who had 5-6 risk factors had a median overall survival of 1.7 months (95%CI 1.2-2.1 months). \"By providing LE estimates, this model may help clinicians provide quality palliative care to their patients with advanced cancer and their families,\" write the authors, adding that the number of prior palliative chemo - therapy courses and hospitalisations have not been reported previously as factors pre - dictive of life expectancy.NEWSROUND60 I CancerWorld I January-February 2014The TEACHH model can help identify those patients who are eligible for hospice care and guide end-of-life discussions with patients, it can be used to select hypofractionated RT regimens to avoid protracted courses of RT near death, and to identify those patients with longer life expectancies who may be candidates for dose escalation, which has been associated with improved local control for certain palliative disease sites. The model, they add, requires external validation to assess its accuracy in disparate settings of patients with advanced cancer presenting for palliative radiotherapy. n M Krishnan, Z Epstein-Peterson, Y Chen et al.

The vast majority of pancreatic cancer patients presenting with localised disease allowing surgical resection relapse within two years, leading to five-year survival rates of less than 25%. Although controlled trials have been conducted in the area of adjuvant therapy for almost three decades in such patients, no consensus has been reached on standard approaches to treatment. In the current CONKO-001 study, Helmut Oettle and colleagues, from the Charit\u00e9-Uni-versit\u00e4tsmedizin, Berlin, set out to compare adjuvant intravenous gemcitabine with obser - vation alone in patients undergoing complete, curative-intent resection of pancreatic cancer. The primary endpoint of the study, disease- free survival, has already been reported. Between July 1998 and December 2004, 368 patients from 88 centres in Germany and Austria were randomised to adjuvant gemcitabine treatment (1g/m 2 days 1, 8, 15, q 4 weeks) for six months ( n=186) or observation ( n=182). Altogether 179 patients from the gemcitabine arm and 175 patients from the observation arm were eligible for the intention-to-treat analyses of disease-free survival and over - all survival. At randomisation, patients were stratified according to tumour stage (T1-2 vs nodal (R0 vs R1), based on the TNM classification. By September 2012 (when 89.3% of patients had died), the median overall sur - vival was 22.8 months for the gemcitabine group versus 20.2 months for the obser - vation group (HR=0.76, 95%CI 0.61-0.95, P=0.01). As reported previously, median dis - ease-free survival was 13.4 months in the gemcitabine treatment group compared with 6.7 months in the observation group (HR=0.55, 95%CI 0.44-0.69, P<0.001). At five years, disease-free survival was in the gemcitabine group versus 7.0% in the obser - vation group, while at 10 years, disease-free survival was 14.3% in the gemcitabine group versus 5.8% in the observation group. The treatment effect was detected con- sistently across all the pre-stratification subgroups of tumour stage, nodal status, and resection status. \"The statistically significant differences in disease-free and overall survival between treatment groups support the use of gem - citabine as the backbone for future stud - ies of adjuvant therapy following R0/R1 resection of pancreatic cancer,\" write the authors. Since the study was designed to be applicable to community-based oncolo - gists (without uniform standards for surgery or centralised pathology review), as well as academic centres, they add, the results are likely to be representative of general clinical practice beyond the study countries. n H Oettle, P Neuhas, A Hochhaus et al.

START: 10-year data support hypofractionated for early breast cancer n Lancet Oncology Ten-year follow-up results for the START trials continue to support use of hypofrac - tionated schedules of radiotherapy contracting treatment from five to three weeks following primary surgery in early breast cancer. In the START studies, following primary surgery, chemotherapy and endocrine treat-ment, women with completely excised inva - sive breast cancer from 35 UK radiotherapy centres were randomly assigned, between 1999 and 2002 to different radiotherapy treatment regimens. The five-year results of the UK Stand - ardisation of Breast Radiotherapy (START) trials suggested that lower total doses of radiotherapy delivered in fewer, larger doses (fractions) were at least as safe and effective as the historical standard regimen (50 Gy in 25 fractions). While the results informed the National Institute for Health and Care Excel-lence (NICE) and American Society for Radi - ation Oncology (ASTRO) guidelines for breast radiotherapy fractionation, a 2010 Cochrane review concluded that longer follow-up was needed for a more complete assessment. In the current publication, John Yarnold and colleagues, from the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation, London, report on 10-year data.NEWSROUNDJanuary-February 2014 I CancerWorld I 61 In START-A, 2236 women were randomised to receive 50 Gy in 25 fractions (the his - torical standard), 41.6 Gy in 13 fractions, or 39 Gy in 13 fractions - all delivered over five weeks. The 10-year rates of local- regional relapse were 6.3% for the 50 Gy arm versus 7.4% for the 41.6 Gy arm (HR 0.9 1, P=0.65) and 8.8% for the 39 Gy arm (HR=1.18, P=0.41). In comparison to the 50 Gy group, women in the 39 Gy group had significantly less moderate or marked breast induration (P =0.034), telangiectasia (P=0.003), and oedema (0.001). No signifi- cant differences were found between the 41.6 Gy and 50 Gy groups. In START-B, 2215 women were allo- cated to receive 50 Gy in 25 fractions over five weeks or 40 Gy in 15 fractions over three weeks. The 10-year local-regional relapse rates were 5.5% for the 50 Gy versus 4.3% for the 40 Gy group (HR=0.77, P=0.21). In comparison to the 50 Gy group, women in the 40 Gy group had significantly less breast shrinkage (P=0.015), control sched - ules at 10 years remain similar to those at 5 years, confirming that appropriately dosed hypofractionated radiotherapy for women with early breast cancer is safe and effec- tive,\" write the authors. In an accompanying commentary, Bruce Haffty and Thomas Buchholz, from Rut - gers-Cancer Institute, New Jersey, write that widespread use of a three-week course of radiation might provide patients with more convenient treatment schedules, while reducing health-care costs without compro - mising patient outcomes. n J Haviland, J Owen, J Dewar et al.

Lancet October 2013, 14:1086-94Sentinel lymph nodes: high false-negative after neoadjuvant chemotherapy n JAMA Among women with clinically node-pos - itive (cN1) breast cancer receiving neo- adjuvant chemotherapy, who had two or more sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) exam- ined, the false-negative rate did not meet the predefined study criteria, the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACO - SOG) Z1071 trial has concluded. In the phase II trial, use of dual-agent mapping and sam-pling of at least three SLNs was associated with a lower likelihood of false-negative SLN findings. While for patients who initially present with node-negative breast cancer, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) has been replaced by SLN biopsy, the application of SLN for staging the axilla following chemo - therapy for women who initially had node-positive cN1 breast cancer remains unclear due to high false-negative rates reported in previous studies. In the ACOSOG Z1071 trial, Judy Boughey from the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, and colleagues, explored the false-nega - tive rates of SLN biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, in women who initially pre- sented with cN1 disease. Between July 2009 and June 2011, the investigators enrolled women from 136 institutions who had clinical T0 through T4, N1 through N2, M0 breast cancer and received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The study protocol was that all SLNs were excised and submitted prior to the ALND procedure. To maximise the like - lihood of SLN identification. SLN mapping with both blue dye and radiolabelled colloid mapping agents was recommended. Results showed that, of the 756 women enrolled, 649 underwent chemotherapy fol - lowed by both SLN surgery and ALND. The researchers found that the false-negative rate was 12.6%, which exceeded the pre-specified threshold of 10%. The researchers found that the false-neg - ative rate was 10.8% when a dual-agent mapping technique was used, versus 20.3% when a single agent mapping technique was used (P=0.05). Furthermore, the inves-tigators found that the false-negative rate was 9.1% when three or more SLNs were evaluated versus 21.1% when two SLNs were evaluated (P=0.007). \"Given this acceptability threshold, changes in approach and patient selection that result in greater sensitivity would be necessary to support the use of SLN surgery as an alternative to ALND in this patient population,\" conclude the authors, adding that after chemotherapy the axilla has more fibrosis, making evaluation of lymphatic drainage and surgical dissection more chal - lenging. Using two mapping agents with different molecular sizes and transit times, they suggest, might offer an important surgical standard for SLN surgery after chemotherapy. In an accompanying commentary, Mon - ica Morrow and Chau Dang, from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, write that as clinicians move away from the 'one size fits all' approach, prognostic infor - mation obtained from residual nodal dis - ease following neoadjuvant therapy is likely to become increasingly important in help - ing to determine the need for additional therapy. \"If that is true, research in ways to improve the performance of SLN biopsy after neoadjuvant therapy is needed for this approach to become a viable management strategy,\" they write. n J Boughey, V Suman, E Mittendorf et al.

WorldBettina Ryll is a patient advocate and founding member of the Independent Melanoma Community Advisory Board. A qualified doctor, with a PhD in molecular biology, she gained a deeper insight into the reality of cancer, and fighting cancer, when her husband Peter was diagnosed with advanced melanoma. She now uses that insight to help others. n Why I chose to be an advocate I didn't feel I had a choice. Going through the experience of advanced melanoma with Peter made me realise where things go wrong for patients, but also what can be done to make things better. Not doing it now would simply feel wrong. n What are the rewards? I've learnt so much, not just about mel - anoma, treatment options and their limitations, but also how details that seem insignificant in health make all the difference when you are ill, about trials and how to access them, the shortcomings of research with regard to patients' needs, how to function under huge psychological pressure, how to live despite having death as part of your life, how to deal with friends and family and their grief, how to tell your children that their father is dying... I wish I'd never had to learn this, but it is rewarding that I can now help others in a situation similar to ours. n What I find hardest The slow rate of progress. Melanoma patients don't have much time. The combination of slow progress with patients dying quickly is very hard.n What I've learnt about myself I am far more resilient and less willing to give up than I thought, and I can find something positive in any situation. Peter and I packed goodie bags for our children's birthday party in the radio - therapy waiting room. We celebrated his birthday, just two weeks before he died, with cake and champagne in hos - pital. It was probably pure defiance, but those were good moments. n I'll never forget... Our group of melanoma patients - Taron, Quentin, Petr, Patricia and Peter - who all died horrendous deaths but supported each other and made all the difference to the time we had together. n A high point in my advocacy work At the moment I'm content if I feel that we've come a babystep closer to better trials for melanoma patients! n I wish I were better at... Time-management. There is always so much to do and so little time! n What I value most in advocates The ability to turn adversity into strength, courage and compassion and use personal experience to help others.n The most significant innovation for patients in recent years The recognition that patients are not simply consumers of a service, but possess knowledge that can improve the situation for society as a whole. n Advances I would most like to see More efficient ways of developing, licensing and reimbursing drugs, to ensure that patients are not denied ac - cess to potentially life-saving therapies for the sake of extended risk evaluation (after all, the risk of untreated mela - noma is death). They should also not be submitted to inferior treatments or placebos solely to fulfill trial design criteria coming from an era when the exponential increases in efficacy seen in melanoma today were unthinkable. n What I wish health professionals would learn in their training I wish they were made aware that most of them are future patients and it is in their hands to influence how they themselves will get treated in the future! I would like medical students to get the chance to meet patients as persons, not only as medical cases, because I believe they would then be able to deliver better care. n "}
