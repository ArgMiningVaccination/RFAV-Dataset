Previously: Strategies to slow down the atrophy of the thymus can protect and preserve its function for long-term benefits. You may be amazed by how many types of immune cells your body has and how well they work together. You may also wonder where those immune cells are created and may be surprised to learn that they originate in the bone marrow. Picture a bustling city inside your bones, where billions of cells work tirelessly to create the building blocks of life, including blood. Welcome to the municipality of bone marrow! Bone marrow is a soft and vital tissue responsible for the continuous production of the blood cells that nourish and protect the body. It has essential functions and a remarkable structure, but surprising new research reveals there are alternative sources of blood production. Critical Role of Bone Marrow in Immunity and Blood Generation Constituting about 4 percent of our body weight, bone marrow is a [soft, jelly-like tissue](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/bone-marrow) built upon long trabeculae, which are beam-like structures. Although highly vascular like the spleen, another blood production organ, our bone marrow enjoys the protection of a hard outer shell of bone. Bone marrow can [regrow and regenerate](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12603699/#:~:text=Bone%20marrow%20stem%20cells%20(BMSC,cells%20of%20all%20blood%20lineages.), hinting at its critical role in [blood generation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2406826/) and immunity. There are two types of bone marrow: red and yellow. Red bone marrow is the \"active\" factory. Yellow blood marrow is mainly composed of fatty tissue and is normally dormant. At birth, all bone marrow is red. During early adulthood, red marrow decreases and is [replaced](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2018.00694/full#B10) by yellow marrow until [age 25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3529711/), when yellow marrow becomes more prevalent. The Roles of Red and Yellow Bone Marrow Red bone marrow ceaselessly produces almost all the various types of blood cells required by our body. A rich blood supply guarantees the smooth influx of nutrients and the outflow of mature blood and stromal cells capable of developing into multiple types of cells. Bone marrow stromal cells have the ability to differentiate into various connective tissues such as cartilage, bone, fat, muscle, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. This has potential applications in [regenerative medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3142445/). Red bone marrow is busy. Our blood cells die constantly. White blood cells, or lymphocytes, usually live for a few hours to a few days; platelets survive for about 10 days; and red blood cells hold out for approximately 120 days. Bone marrow continuously replaces these cells to maintain adequate levels. In adults, virtually all red blood cells and platelets are produced in the red bone marrow along with 60 to 70 percent of all lymphocytes, the rest of which reach maturity in the [thymus](https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/neither-shrunken-nor-useless-thymus-remains-essential-to-long-term-health_5247419.html), [spleen](https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/the-spike-proteins-assault-on-our-spleen_5214402.html), and [lymph nodes](https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/beyond-detox-unlocking-the-secret-healing-power-of-the-lymphatic-system_5177964.html). [Incredibly,](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749208105801275?via%3Dihub) more than 2.5 billion new red blood cells, 1 billion new granulocytes, and 2.5 billion new platelets per kilogram of body weight are released into the blood by the bone marrow on a daily basis. In adults, red marrow is predominantly located in bones such as the vertebrae, hips, sternum, ribs, and skull and the ends of long bones such as the humerus, femur, and tibia; yellow marrow fills the remaining spongy bone and central cavities of long bones. Yellow bone marrow serves as a storehouse for fats, supplying nutrients to the red marrow while maintaining an optimal environment for bone marrow function. Bone Marrow's Superstars The bone marrow houses stem cells, which possess the ability to turn into two main cell lineages: myeloid and lymphoid. The larger myeloid lineage forms most of the white blood cells (e.g., monocytes, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, and dendritic cells), red blood cells, and megakaryocytes, which are the source of platelets. The smaller lymphoid lineage gives rise to lymphocytes, including T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells\u2014key warriors of the immune system. Operatives of the Immune System There are a variety of powerful immune cells released from the bone marrow, including neutrophils, eosinophils, master cells, basophils, monocytes, natural killer cells, and B and T lymphocytes. Each cell is like a soldier possessing specialized skills to fight against viruses, germs, and cancer cells. Cells Derived From the Myeloid Lineage [Neutrophils](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570571/) are the most abundant type of white blood cell and are produced very quickly. They make up about 60 to 70 percent of white blood cells circulating throughout the body. They are the first responders to infections and play a police-like role in innate immunity. [Eosinophils](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560929/) are very effective in fighting against parasites. Parasites are multicellular organisms that immune cells have difficulty swallowing. However, rather than swallowing parasites, eosinophils attack them by releasing chemicals that penetrate their cell membranes. In addition, eosinophils trigger inflammatory reactions in the body by releasing chemicals. They are common factors in allergic reactions. While allergies are often a nuisance, in some cases they have beneficial effects and can protect the body from toxic substances and are [linked to lower cancer risk](https://www.allergycliniclondon.co.uk/allergy-benefits-serious-conditions/#:~:text=Can%20allergies%20protect%20us%20from%20disease%3F&text=Other%20findings%20have%20found%20that,than%20people%20without%20these%20conditions). [Mast cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499904/#:~:text=Mast%20cells%20are%20immune%20cells,into%20a%20mature%20mast%20cell.) play an important role in inducing the inflammatory cascade and releasing inflammatory mediators. After arising in the bone marrow, they circulate and reside in connective tissue in virtually every organ in the body. They cause the first wave of allergic reactions. [Basophils](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK535365/) serve as a secondary line of defense in allergic reactions, releasing inflammatory substances such as histamine. Along with mast cells, basophils are responsible for immediate hypersensitivity, causing discomfort of various kinds. [Monocytes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557618/) account for 5 percent of circulating nucleated cells in normal adult blood. They can differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells. Monocytes have two distinct roles, one of which is to regularly patrol the body for pathogens; the other is to orchestrate an immune response to infection and inflammation. Macrophages can engulf pathogens in large numbers and are better than neutrophils at attacking pathogens and can do so for longer. After macrophages and dendritic cells swallow a pathogen, they will analyze it and pass the relevant information to the acquired immune system for further action. They are the \"messengers\" between the innate and acquired immune systems. Although their functions are similar, they have their own strengths. Macrophages are stronger in phagocytosis (engulfing and digesting particles), and dendritic cells are better at analyzing and transmitting information, like \"signalers.\" [Natural killer cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK565844/) are also part of the advanced troops, the vanguard and front line of the natural immune system, mainly responsible for killing virus-infected cells and mutated cancer cells in the body. Cells Derived From the Lymphoid Lineage [T cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK535433/) are an important and diverse group of lymphocytes that play a key role in the adaptive immune response. Generally, there are two major types of T cells: helper and cytotoxic. The former aid other immune cells, and the latter kill virally-infected cells and tumors. T cells have many receptors on their surfaces and can bind only to one shape of antigen. An antigen is a substance capable of inducing an immune response found on normal cells in the body and on viruses, bacteria, and tumors. When a T cell receptor fits with its viral antigen on an infected cell, the cytotoxic T cell will release cytotoxins to kill that cell. Cytotoxic T cells can also kill foreign and cancer cells. [B cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560905/) are also lymphocytes. What makes B Cells unique is that they produce the potent and specialized weapons that the immune system has at its disposal: antibodies. They are like weapon factories. Antibodies are crab-like snipers. All of these special soldiers originate from bone marrow, demonstrating its critical role in the body. An Unexpected Blood Cell Factory One might naturally assume that the bone marrow is the sole site that generates blood cells, including the precursors of T and B cells before they mature in the thymus or spleen. However, this is only part of the picture, as emerging research has revealed a mind-boggling array of sometimes unexpected blood makers. We already know that before birth, the liver is the primary site for blood cell production until the [third trimester](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK544245/) of gestation, when the marrow takes over. We also know that the spleen creates blood cells during gestation. But in 2019, scientists from the Columbia Center for Translational Immunology at Columbia University, found a surprising new source of blood cells in the human body, as published in [Cell Stem Cell](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1934590918305435?via%3Dihub). During intestinal transplants, the researchers made an unexpected observation: The transplant recipients began to display the donor's blood cells in circulation. This phenomenon\u2014blood with two different sets of DNA\u2014is known as blood \"chimerism.\" The presence of donor lymphocyte phenotypes indicated the involvement of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Surprisingly, the researchers observed the presence of donor-derived HSPCs within the intestinal mucosa. It appears that the intestines have a unique ability to produce blood cells. This was demonstrated when the donor's blood-generating stem cells were discovered not just in the mucosa of the transplanted intestine, but also in various other parts of the recipient's body, including the small intestine, liver, and lymph nodes. The blood cells generated from the transplanted intestines were then distributed to the recipient's body. Furthermore, the blood cells derived from the donor tissue appeared to have been educated by the transplant recipient to not attack the recipient's body; likewise, the recipient's immune cells were also educated to be tolerant of the donor's tissues. This indicates communication between the two sets of blood cells to be friendly with one another. The patients with more donor blood cells had lower organ rejection rates. Both interesting innovative studies may shed light on a new strategy for managing rejection after organ transplantation. Gut Bacteria Help Generate Blood Cells Neutrophils, critical soldiers in the battle against harmful germs in our bodies, have traditionally been understood to be produced in the bone marrow. However, a recent [study](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2211230119) conducted by Japanese researchers at Hokkaido University uncovered a fascinating connection between our gut and the production of neutrophils; when levels of these essential blood cells are low, the complex ecosystem of gut bacteria steps in to help generate more. These findings uncover an interaction between the gut microbiota and the production of granulocytes (the most common type of white blood cell), suggesting a novel way to recover from neutropenia, an abnormally low level of neutrophils. Scientists have also summarized how our neutrophils and gut germs [talk to each other](https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/133/20/2168/273834/Cross-talk-between-neutrophils-and-the-microbiota) at a [molecular](https://jlb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/JLB.4RI0418-151R) level. The gut, once again, proves to be a remarkable source of potential health benefits, including blood generation for the body. Many people are aware of the fact that 70 percent of our immunity starts in the gut. This is because our gut is the source of nutrition, playing a key role in our immune function. This coincidentally corresponds to the recent studies showing a connection between our gut and the production of neutrophils. In summary, as one of the most protective organs in the immune system, bone marrow takes the lead in the production of all types of blood cells. However, the marrow is not alone, as it has secret support from the gut and its coexisting bacteria.
