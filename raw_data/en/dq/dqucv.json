Methods: A total of 160 gastric cancer patients receiving chemotherapy were randomly divided into the experimental (n=80) and control groups (n=80). Patients in the control group received conventional nursing care and their counterparts in the experimental group were administered with traditional Chinese medicine pattern-based clinical nursing care. Results: Patients in the experimental group yielded higher clinical efficacy compared with their counterparts in the control group. Relevant symptoms were significantly mitigated and considerably higher degree of satisfaction was obtained in the experimental group than those in the control group (all P<0.01). Conclusion: Clinical nursing care in the traditional Chinese medicine pattern is applicable for gastric cancer patients throughout the chemotherapy, which yields high clinical efficacy and ensured safety.Author(s): Xiaomin Hou, Xiaojun Luo, Lingying Ding, Yan Yao, Zhiyun Lao "}
