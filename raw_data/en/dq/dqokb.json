In order to tackle this question, we must examine what makes the universe and everything in it. The answer to this is energy - the Life Force, also called Chi. To understand the basics of life force, we need to first understand the three main levels of awareness, as energy is related to differently within these levels of awareness. What Beginners Should Know If you have little knowledge on the subject, I'm here to develop your understanding. Quite simply, the basics of energy, awareness, and spirituality, is known through experience. Ask yourself the following questions: Do you feel you have abundant life force within? Are you energized, lively and ready to take on the world? Or are you often tired, sickly and/or struggling physically, mentally and emotionally? Do you feel a flow of energy through your body? Or is it blocked, stuck within? Your answers to these questions above are dependent upon the level of flow of the life force vitality within your physical body in the conditioned world. This is the first level of awareness - contracted awareness. How about these questions: Do you feel the energy of nature, animals, forests, air and oceans - of Mother Earth? Do you feel more energized when you are outside? Can you connect with energy in a profound and more expanded way? Your answers to these questions allude to the second main level of awareness - expanded awareness. Finally, how do you feel in response to these questions: Have you meditated or do you meditate regularly? If you do, what type of meditation experience do you have? Do you feel guided? Do you feel euphoric or blissed out? Do you feel a great amount of love welling up within you? Can you transcend the physical, conditioned world? The answers you have to these questions refer to the third level of awareness - pure awareness. The Unpopular Opinion... To many people, the concept of energy regarding the body, the mind, and the levels of awareness sounds like spiritual hoopla. However, scientific research has proven that all things in the universe, including us, are composed of electrical, and magnetic energy alongside many other forms of energy such as gravity, and radio waves. Additionally, research has delved into understanding consciousness and has shown that there is more beyond our usual awareness - beyond what we can see with our eyes. Mindfulness Of Spiritual Energy and Awareness Levels If you have a pain, observe it happening in the body. If there is tightness or joy in your mind, observe that it is tight, sad, unhappy or happy. Just observe that you are not enjoying, and it is happening elsewhere, as though it is happening elsewhere. (... you are free the moment you see it's not in you.) ~ Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar We are living energy fields. Our physical bodies are composed of energy producing particles, each of which is in constant motion or are vibrating. For example, our heartbeat, breathing rates, and circadian rhythms are examples of physiological energy we can feel and measure. On a smaller scale, every cell, every atom, every \"part\" of us, vibrates at characteristic rates. Those different rates of vibration can speed up or slow down if conditions change. These vibrations generate electromagnetic energy waves. Researchers have found that vibrations and the electromagnetic energy associated with them cause changes in your cells, which can then affect how your body functions. This is life force, which is the element that animates all that seemingly exists in the world. Life force is considered to be the body's natural healing energy. It is thought to be responsible for maintaining all the physical functions of the body. If one's body is low in life force, then they could become physically or mentally unwell. However, when one's body has plenty of life force, then the person is usually in good health or in an optimal state of being at that time. In yogic tradition, life force is regarded as one of the two types of energies that are present in all beings. The second is mind or consciousness, which is awareness. What Are the Three Levels of Awareness? There are a multitude of levels of consciousness/awareness which vibrate, but there are three main levels. At a higher level of vibration, we become increasingly aware. Dependent upon your level of awareness, you will be more or less mindful of what is going on inside of yourself physically, mentally and emotionally and of your experience of the outside world. State of Contracted Awareness This is our usual state of awareness. We are controlled by our ego conditioning and believe that the conditioned thoughts, emotions, behaviors, and patterns are what we are and that the outside world is the only true reality. We feel small, isolated and separated from the world (even though we are always connected to the universe). We are at the mercy of emotions such as: fear, anger, guilt, shame, and desire, as well as negative thoughts. We have been conditioned to believe certain things which may be true or not. Life is a struggle and we often feel at a loss. This is the dream state regarding the outside world. State of Expanded Awareness In this level, what appeared to be threatening or a barrier are actually opportunities. We understand that everything that seems like an obstacle has a clear purpose as lessons. We can see the beauty in most things and the blessings in life. We begin to feel connected through a web of energy and consciousness to everyone and everything. We have a higher perspective which is accepting and more neutral and based on logic, reason and truth. In this state of awareness, we can be mindful of the present moment; in other words, know what is factually occurring inside and outside of one's self. This is the mindful state. State of Pure Awareness All is obvious. There are no problems, there is just what is and we accept what is. We feel the wholeness and unity within creation. One knows that all is the flow of the spiritual energy/creative force and consciousness filled with an abundance of all possibilities. We realize that we are The Source. There is no separation. This is the enlightened state which can lead to transcendence and further to accession. All experience is created in consciousness. The only way to explore this is through self awareness, self reflection, meditation and through questioning your perceptual reality. My Professional Tips As a shaman, I understand energy within these different levels of awareness and how energy interacts between these levels. I have discovered the following: All that there is, is energy and consciousness (awareness). There is a cause and effect of energy meeting within and between all levels of awareness. You can manifest consciously, in conjunction with The Source, within the higher levels of awareness. There is no right or wrong. Karma (energy still in action) brings what is necessary within each life to help you better understand your true self (soul consciousness) and The Source (Divine Consciousness) through your lessons and blessings. Your perception of energy fashions your life through your thoughts, emotions and the body. Mindfulness of Energy and Consciousness All experience is created in consciousness. The only way to explore this is through self awareness, self reflection, meditation and through questioning your perceptual reality. Mindfulness is the state of expanded awareness in which you focus on what you are sensing, thinking and feeling and your actions and reactions while the experiences of the outside world continue within contracted awareness. Through the practice of mindfulness we are able to reach states of awareness that allow you to observe all of this within the present moment without attachment and judgment. Practicing mindfulness can involve breathing methods, guided imagery, meditation and other methods which help you to relax the body, release stuck energies and clear the mind to reach a higher state of awareness. This reduces stress, releases stuck energy and conditioning, and brings balance and health in every way. Ultimately, the realization unfolds that there is only consciousness in which all that exists is within, and all, therefore, is a conscious perceptual experience. Being in this state of mindfulness is to awaken to the present moment experience of energy in action within awareness/consciousness, basically awareness of itself which can lead to the highest level - pure awareness.
