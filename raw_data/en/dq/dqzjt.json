The most common skincare ingredient of all. You can usually find it right in the very first spot of the ingredient list, meaning it's the biggest thing out of all the stuff that makes up the product. It's mainly a solvent for ingredients that do not like to dissolve in oils but rather in water. Once inside the skin, it hydrates, but not from the outside - putting pure water on the skin (hello long baths!) is drying. One more thing: the water used in cosmetics is purified and deionized (it means that almost all of the mineral ions inside it is removed). Like this, the products can stay more stable over time. [Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice](/ingredients/aloe-barbadensis-leaf-juice)- goodie [soothing](/ingredient-functions/soothing), [moisturizer/humectant](/ingredient-functions/moisturizer-humectant) Aloe Vera is one of today's magic plants. It does have some very nice properties indeed, though famous dermatologist Leslie Baumann warns us in her book that most of the evidence is anecdotal and the plant might be a bit overhyped. What research does confirm about Aloe is that it's a great moisturizer and has several anti-inflammatory (among others contains salicylates, polysaccharides, magnesium lactate and C-glucosyl chromone) as well as some antibacterial components. It also helps wound healing and skin regeneration in general. All in all definitely a fatty (the good, non-drying kind of) alcohol that does all kinds of things in a skincare product: it makes your skin feel smooth and nice (emollient), helps to thicken up products and also helps water and oil to blend (emulsifier). Can be derived from coconut or palm kernel oil. [antimicrobial/antibacterial](/ingredient-functions/antimicrobial-antibacterial), [emulsifying](/ingredient-functions/emulsifying), [preservative](/ingredient-functions/preservative), [surfactant/cleansing](/ingredient-functions/surfactant-cleansing) We don't have description for [Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed A goldish to dark yellow emollient plant oil coming from Sesame seeds. Similar to many other plant oils, it contains high amounts of nourishing and moisturizing fatty acids (about 38% of oleic and 48% of linoleic acid) and is a nice oil to repair and regenerate dry skin. It is rapidly absorbed and gives the skin a soft and gentle feel. [Glycerin](/ingredients/glycerin)- superstar [skin-identical ingredient](/ingredient-functions/skin-identical-ingredient), [moisturizer/humectant](/ingredient-functions/moisturizer-humectant)| Irritancy: 0 | Comedogenicity: 0 - A natural moisturizer that's also in our skin - A super common, safe, effective and cheap molecule used for more than 50 years - Not only a simple moisturizer but knows much more: keeps the skin lipids between our skin cells in a healthy (liquid crystal) state, protects against irritation, helps to restore barrier - Effective from as low as 3% with even more benefits for dry skin at higher concentrations up to 20-40% - High-glycerin moisturizers are awesome for treating severely dry skin [Read all the geeky details about is a really big, iconic tree native to Africa (here is a [nice image of it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adansonia#/media/File:Baobab_Adansonia_digitata.jpg)). It's the largest succulent plant in the world and almost all parts of it have traditional medicinal uses in Africa. The seed oil, similar to other plant oils, is loaded with things that are good-for-the-skin: it contains skin regenerating vitamin A, antioxidant vitamin E, and vitamin D3 that helps with calcium absorption. It's rich in nourishing fatty acids oleic (30-40%), linoleic (24-34%) and palmitic (18-30%). Its moisturizing benefits are impressive, it absorbed into the skin quickly and might even improve skin elasticity. A great oil for drier skin types and excellent for eczema and psoriasis. [soothing](/ingredient-functions/soothing), [emollient](/ingredient-functions/emollient), [astringent](/ingredient-functions/astringent) We don't have that has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Also, it has some anti-fungal and seborrhea regulation magic powers that make the ingredient especially useful for greasy and flaky skin and scalp. [Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Leaf Extract](/ingredients/urtica-dioica-leaf-extract)- goodie stinging nettle. [According to manufacturer ](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/eu/PersonalCare/Detail/1412/51019/Phytexcell-Nettle) [info](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/eu/PersonalCare/Detail/1412/51019/Phytexcell-Nettle), it's anti-allergenic and is loaded with several good-for-the-skin it contains firming and toning mineral salts, anti-irritant flavonoids, and astringent and anti-bacterial gallic acid. It's recommended for treatment of oily skin and even stimulation of hair growth. We don't have description for this ingredient yet. [perfuming](/ingredient-functions/perfuming) The essential oil coming from the peel of the mandarin orange or tangor. In general, the main component of citrus peel oils is [limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene) (77-86% for mandarin peel), a super common fragrant ingredient that makes everything smell nice (but counts as a frequent skin sensitizer). Apart from smelling nice (and thus being a popular natural fragrance alternative), Mandarin Orange Oil also has significant antioxidant properties that's comparable to synthetic antioxidant [BHT](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht) or oil-soluble antioxidant big shot [vitamin E](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tocopherol). On the con side, the fragrant components of citrus peels might irritate sensitive skin and citrus peels also contain the problematic compound called furanocoumarin that makes them (mildly) phototoxic. Orange mandarin peel contains less from it than some other citruses (like [bergamot](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citrus-aurantium-bergamia-peel-oil) or lime), but still, be careful with it especially if it's in a product for daytime use. [antimicrobial/antibacterial](/ingredient-functions/antimicrobial-antibacterial), [perfuming](/ingredient-functions/perfuming) We have to start by writing how fascinated we are by the amazing lavender fields of Provance and we do love pretty much everything about lavender: its look, its color, its scent.... but, when it comes to skincare, lavender is a questionable ingredient that you probably do not want in your skincare products. First, let us start with the pros: it has a lovely scent, so no wonder that it is popular as a fragrance ingredient in natural products wanting to be free from synthetic fragrances but still wanting to smell nice. The scent of lavender is famous for having calming and relaxing properties and some smallish scientific studies do support that. Inhaled volatile compounds seem to have a soothing effect on the central nervous system and studies have shown that lavender aromatherapy can improve patient's anxiety and experience in hospitals. Another pro is that lavender oil has some nice antimicrobial and antibacterial properties. It also has some local pain relieving and muscle relaxing magical powers. Lavender oil is also often claimed to have anti-inflammatory properties. We have found a study confirming this but it was the essential oil of the leaves and not the much more commonly used flowers and the two differ in their main chemical compounds very much. (The main components of the flower essential oil are linalyl acetate and linalool [around 80% the two together] while it is 1,8-Cineole [around 65%] in the essential oil of the leaves.) Now, let us look at the cons: similar to a bunch of other essential oils, the main components of lavender oil are potentially irritating fragrant components. The two main components are linalyl acetate (about 50%) and linalool (about 35%) and both autoxidise on exposure to the air forming strong contact allergens. To make things even worse, lavender oil seems to be cytotoxic from concentrations as low as 0.25% (concentration up to 0.125% were ok). There is also an often cited Japanese study that made patch tests with lavender oil for 9 years and found a huge increase in lavender oil sensitivity in 1997 (from 1.1% in 1990 to 8.7% in 1997 and 13.9% in 1998). This was the year when using dried lavender flowers in pillows, wardrobes, and elsewhere became fashionable in Japan, so it seems that increased exposure to lavender results in increased risk of sensitivity. Overall, it makes us sad to write bad things about such a lovely plant, but when it comes to skincare, you will be better off without lavender. We don't have description for this ingredient yet. [Tocopherol (Vitamin E)](/ingredients/tocopherol)- in our skin - Significant photoprotection against UVB rays - Vit C + Vit E work in synergy and provide great photoprotection - Has emollient properties - Easy to formulate, stable and relatively inexpensive [Read all the geeky details Comedogenicity: 0 We don't have description for this ingredient yet. [buffering](/ingredient-functions/buffering) Citric acid comes from citrus fruits and is an AHA. If these magic three letters don't tell you anything, [click here](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycolic-acid) and read our detailed description on glycolic acid, the most famous AHA. So citric acid is an exfoliant, that can - just like other AHAs - gently lift off the dead skin cells of your skin and make it more smooth and fresh. There is also some research showing that citric acid with regular use (think three months and 20% concentration) can help sun-damaged skin, increase skin thickness and some nice hydrating things called glycosaminoglycans in the skin. But according to a comparative study done in 1995, citric acid has less skin improving magic properties than glycolic or lactic acid. Probably that's why citric acid is usually not used as an exfoliant but more as a helper ingredient in small amounts to adjust the pH of a formulation. [preservative](/ingredient-functions/preservative) It's pretty much the current IT-preservative. It's safe and gentle, but even more importantly, it's not a feared-by-everyone-mostly-without-scientific-reason paraben. It's not something new: it was introduced around 1950 and today it can be used up to 1% worldwide. It can be found in nature - in green tea - but the version used in cosmetics is synthetic. Other than having a good safety profile and being quite gentle to the skin it has some other advantages too. It can be used in many types of formulations as it has great thermal stability (can be heated up to 85\u00b0C) and works on a wide range of pH levels (ph 3-10). It's often used together with ethylhexylglycerin as it nicely improves the preservative activity of phenoxyethanol. [preservative](/ingredient-functions/preservative), [perfuming](/ingredient-functions/perfuming), [solvent](/ingredient-functions/solvent), [viscosity controlling](/ingredient-functions/viscosity-controlling) It's one of those things that help your cosmetics not to go wrong too soon, aka a preservative. It can be naturally found in fruits and teas but can also be made synthetically. No matter the origin, in small amounts (up to 1%) it's a nice, gentle preservative. Has to be combined with some other nice preservatives, like [potassium sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate) to be broad spectrum enough. In high amounts, it can be a skin irritant, but don't worry, it's never used in high amounts. [Limonene*](/ingredients/limonene)- icky A super common and cheap fragrance ingredient. It's in many plants, e.g. rosemary, eucalyptus, lavender, lemongrass, peppermint and it's the main component (about 50-90%) of the peel oil of citrus fruits. It does smell nice but the problem is that it oxidizes on air exposure and the resulting stuff is not good for the skin. Oxidized limonene can cause allergic contact dermatitis and counts as a frequent skin sensitizer. Limonene's nr1 function is definitely being a fragrance component, but there are several studies showing that it's also a penetration enhancer, mainly for oil-loving components. All in all, limonene has some pros and cons, but - especially if your skin is sensitive - the cons probably outweigh the pros. [Linalool*](/ingredients/linalool)- icky Linalool is a super common fragrance ingredient. It's kind of everywhere - both in plants and in cosmetic products. It's part of 200 natural oils including lavender, ylang-ylang, bergamot, jasmine, geranium and it can be found in 90-95% of prestige perfumes on the market. The problem with linalool is, that just like [limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene) it oxidises on air exposure and becomes allergenic. That's why a product containing linalool that has been opened for several months is more likely to be allergenic than a fresh one. A study made in the UK with 483 people tested the allergic reaction to 3% oxidised linalool and 2.3% had positive test results. You may also want to take a look at... |whatitdoes|| "}
