The word Ayurveda is Sanskrit, based on two words, Ayur, which means \"life\" and Veda, which refers to knowledge. Also known as \"Ayurvedic Medicine,\" this ancient medical science can be traced to around 6000 BCE. It was most likely the ancient masters, [in the lineage of Babaji](/article/mahavatar-babaji-the-eternal-holy-master-of-kriya-yoga), who were the original teachers of Ayurveda's soul-expanding and holistic healing methods. Ayurveda is based on the premise that wellness depends on the balance and peacefulness of mind, heart, body, and spirit. By focusing on promoting wholeness and health (instead of fighting disease), Ayurvedic medicine is known to reinvigorate muscles, bones, cells, and souls through a variety of healing herbs and modalities. It is often called \"The Mother Of All Healing.\" The History of Ayurveda Compared to today's Western medicine, Ayurveda is [over 6000 years its senior. ](https://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/ayurvedic-treatments)Both spiritual and practical, Ayurvedic medicine was originally an oral tradition that was taught by masters from a variety of disciplines. The goal of Ayurveda is to bring the patient into harmony with the divine aspects of the Self and the Universe. The inception of Ayurveda is unknown, yet many believe that it was born in The Vedas, and originally composed in Sanskrit. These ancient Indian writings were considered to be \"Apaureseya\" or \"not of man; eternal, superhuman, and without authorship.\" The four Veda Veda. Ayurvedic medicine was first promoted in the United States in the early 1970s, most likely by the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi organization of Transcendental Meditation. It was eventually popularized by notable healers and doctors, including Dr. Vasant Lad, Dr. Andrew Weil, Robert Svoboda, Nancy Lonsdorf, John Douillard, and Dr. Jay Apte. While some of these luminaries have taught Ayurveda for more than 30 years, there are many highly qualified Ayurvedic counselors and practitioners in the United States and throughout the world. Today, in addition to local, state, and regional organizations, practitioners can join [The National Ayurvedic Medical Association](https://www.ayurvedanama.org/), which seeks to \"preserve, protect, promote and advance the consciousness-based philosophy, knowledge, science, and practice of Ayurveda for the benefit of all beings.\" Ayurveda's Three Doshas When Ayurvedic practitioners [prescribe healing herbs and modalities](/series/thrive-self-healing-ayurveda), they base their prognoses and treatments on an individual's doshas or doshic makeup. There are three doshas, Vta, Pitta, and Kapha, each of which refers to specific sets of physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual attributes. An individual may have one or any combination of these doshas. When our doshas are in alignment, we experience good health. When our doshas are out of balance, we might experience discomfort, pain, or disease. Vta Dosha contains the elements of ether and air. Vata is responsible for our vitality, energy, flow, movement, nerves, breath, speech, levels of anxiety, circulation, and digestion. Vata-dominant people are active, excitable, sometimes anxious, enthusiastic, creative, clever, and open to new adventures. If you're Vata, you might have problems sleeping, feel nervous regularly, and occasionally forget to eat. You might one day develop arthritis, and in the meantime, tend to be the life of the party. Pitta Dosha contains fire and water. Pitta is responsible for our hormones, hunger, intelligence, attitudes, and organizational abilities. If you're Pitta-dominant, you might be clear of mind and heart, competitive, practical, organized, a lover of teaching, and tend to feel immediately rejuvenated when spending time outdoors. You might even feel fits of anger or rage, most notably when you haven't eaten protein in a while. If you forget to relax, you might develop sleeping disorders. The order of the day for Pitta-folks is to relax, keep your environment cooler versus hotter, and avoid extremes, especially when exercising. Kapha Dosha is the embodiment of earth and water. Given these grounded elements, Kapha-folks tend to be heavy, slow, dense, sturdy, and lovers of routine. Kaphas are generally lovable, playful, and patient. If you're Kapha and you're having a bad week or month, you might eat or sleep too much, hold grudges, feel depressed for long periods, and gain too much weight. You also might develop diabetes. Regardless of the physical challenges that Kapha people tend to have, they gravitate toward a grounded life and financial abundance.

When I first met Dr. Lad over 30 years ago, he had just arrived in the United States. We sat comfortably on floor-pillows, and he described exactly how my body functions, and how it would develop and heal over time. Throughout our session, he was able to answer precise and personal questions about my mind, heart, attitudes, beliefs, and future. It was one of the most remarkable experiences of my life. I wish you a long and healthy life! Next Article Researchers Find Gut Microbiota and Mental Health Connection Groundbreaking new studies are revealing the connection between gut health and mental health. Researchers have known about the connection between the bacteria that live in your gut and the brain for some time, but when it comes to how closely they're connected science has just scratched the surface. Now in a [systematic analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33271426/) published in the journal Clinical Psychology Review researchers looked at 26 studies that assessed the role gut biology plays in anxiety and depression. The findings showed people with anxiety and depression had different levels and types of microbes in their gut, compared to people without anxiety and depression. The digestive tract of [people with anxiety and depression](/article/gut-bacteria-is-controlling-your-mood-should-you-fix-it) contained more pro-inflammatory bacteria species and had less of the type of bacteria that help regulate the central nervous system.
