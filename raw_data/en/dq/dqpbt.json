Here it is in its full beauty: Vaccines, together with health education, hygiene and adequate nutrition, are essential tools for preventing infectious diseases. Vaccines have saved countless lives over the last century; for example, they allowed the eradication of small pox and are currently allowing the world to approach the elimination of polio. Anthroposophic Medicine fully appreciates the contribution of vaccines to global health and firmly supports vaccination as an important measure to prevent life threatening diseases. Anthroposophic Medicine is not anti-vaccine and does not support anti-vaccine movements. Physicians with training in Anthroposophic Medicine are expected to act in accordance with national legislation and to carefully advise patients (or their caregivers) to help them understand the relevant scientific information and national vaccination recommendations. In countries where vaccination is not mandatory and informed consent is needed, this may include coming to agreement with the patient (or the caregivers) about an individualized vaccination schedule, for example by adapting the timing of vaccination during infancy. Taking into account ongoing research, local infectious disease patterns and socioeconomic risk factors, individual anthroposophic physicians are at times involved in the scientific discussion about specific vaccines and appropriate vaccine schedules. Anthroposophic Medicine is pro-science and continued scientific debate is more important than ever in today's polarized vaccine environment. Already in 2010, The European Council for Steiner Waldorf Education published a press release, implying a similar stance: We wish to state unequivocally that opposition to immunization per se, or resistance to national strategies for childhood immunization in general, forms no part of our specic educational objectives. We believe that a matter such as whether or not to innoculate a child against communicable disease should be a matter of parental choice. Consequently, we believe that families provide the proper context for such decisions to be made on the basis of medical, social and ethical considerations, and upon the perceived balance of risks. Insofar as schools have any role to play in these matters, we believe it is in making available a range of balanced information both from the appropriate national agencies and qualied health professionals with expertise in the led. Schools themselves are not, nor should they attempt to become, determiners of decisions regarding these matters. Such statements sound about right. Why then am I not convinced? Perhaps because there are hundreds of anthroposophic texts that seem to contradict this pro-vaccination stance (not least those [from Rudolf Steiner himself](https://neoanthroposophy.com/2018/03/01/rudolf-steiner-on-traditional-childhood-illnesses-and-vaccines/)). Today, anthroposophy enthusiasts are look at [this quote](http://www.anthromed.org/Article.aspx?artpk=764), for instance: ... anthroposophic and conventional medicine have dramatically different viewpoints as to what causes common childhood illnesses. Conventional medicine views childhood illnesses for which vaccines have been developed as a physical disease, inherently bad, to be prevented. Their main goal, therefore, is protection against contracting the disease making one free of illness. In contrast, these childhood illnesses are viewed by anthroposophic medicine as a necessary instrument in dealing with karma and, as discussed by Husemann, and Wolff, 6 the incarnation of the child. During childhood illnesses, anthroposophic medical practitioners administer medical remedies to assist the child in dealing with the illness not only as a disease affecting their physical body in the physical plane, but also for soul spiritual development, thereby promoting healing. In contrast, allopathic medicaments are aimed at suppression of symptoms and not necessarily the promotion of healing. In Manifestations of Karma, Rudolf Steiner states that humans may be able to influence their karma and remove the manifestation of certain conditions, i.e., disease, but they may not be liberated from the karmic effect which attempted to produce them. Says Steiner, \"...if the karmic reparation is escaped in one direction, it will have to be sought in another ... the souls in question would then be forced to seek another way for karmic compensation either in this or in another incarnation.\" 7 In his lecture, Karma of Higher Beings 8, Steiner poses the question, \"If someone seeks an opportunity of being infected in an epidemic, this is the result of the necessary reaction against an earlier karmic cause. Have we the right now to take hygienic or other measures?\" The answer to this question must be decided by each person and may vary. For example, some may accept the risk of disease but not of vaccine side effects, while others may accept the risk associated with vaccination but not with the disease. Anthroposophic medicine teaches that to prevent a disease in the physical body only postpones what will then be produced in another incarnation. Thus, when health measures are undertaken to eliminate the susceptibility to a disease, only the external nature of the illness is eliminated. To deal with the karmic activity from within, Anthroposphy states that spiritual education is required. This does not mean that one should automatically be opposed to vaccination. Steiner indicates that \"Vaccination will not be harmful if, subsequent to vaccination, a person receives a spiritual education.\" Or consider this little [statistic](https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/waldorf-association-schools-are-leading-vaccine-exemption-private-schools) from the US: Waldorf schools are the leading Nonmedical Exemption [of vaccinations] schools in various states, such as: - Waldorf School of Mendocino County (California) - 79.1% - Tucson Waldorf Schools (Arizona) - 69.6% - Cedar Springs Waldorf School (California) - 64.7% - Waldorf School of San Diego (California) - 63.6% - Orchard Valley Waldorf School (Vermont) - 59.4% - Whidbey Island Waldorf School (Washington) - 54.9% - Lake Champlain Waldorf School (Vermont) - 49.6% - Austin Waldorf School (Texas) - 48% Or what about [this quote](http://www.anthromed.org/Article.aspx?artpk=761)? Q: I am a mother who does not immunize my children. I feel as though I have to keep this a secret. I recently had to take my son to the ER for a tetanus shot when he got a fish hook in his foot, and I was so worried about the doctor asking if his shots were current. His grandmother also does not understand. What do you suggest? A: You didn't give your reasons for not vaccinating your children. Perhaps you feel intuitively that vaccinations just aren't good for children in the long run, but you can't explain why. If that's the case, I think your intuition is correct, but in today's contentious world it is best to understand the reasons for our decisions and actions. There are many good reasons today for not vaccinating children in the United States I recommend you consult the book, The Vaccination Dilemma edited by Christine Murphy, published by SteinerBooks. So, where is the evidence that anthroposophy-enthusiasts discourage vaccinations? It turns out, there is plenty of it! In 2011, I summarised some of it in a [review](https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00006454-201103000-00002) concluding that numerous reports from different countries about measles outbreaks centered around Steiner schools seem nevertheless to imply that a problem does exist. In the interest of public health, we should address it. All this begs a few questions: - Are anthroposophy-enthusiasts and their professional organisations generally for or against vaccinations? - Are the statements above honest or mere distractions from the truth? - Why are these professional organisations not going after their members who fail to conform with their published stance on vaccination? I suspect I know the answers. What "}
