If enough people receive a vaccine, likely at least 70% of the population, the disease will decline. But if not enough people get vaccinated, COVID-19 will persist. The urgency of reaching that vaccination goal has led some to wonder if there is a moral or religious obligation to get vaccinated. The Herald Times contacted religious leaders in Northern Michigan to ask about the ethical or religious implications of vaccine choice, and also sought perspective from a layperson with a background in philosophy and medical ethics. A majority of those responding to the request for comments believes there is a moral or spiritual imperative to receive the vaccine. Bishop Walter A. Hurley, administrator of the Diocese of Gaylord: \"There have been many questions regarding the ethical implications of the COVID-19 vaccine and what moral responsibility one has to get vaccinated. With significant matters like this, too often decisions are made based upon political views rather than moral responsibility. It's critical that we recognize that we each have a moral responsibility to care for one another and to further the common good. In the specific context of this global pandemic, we have a moral duty to lessen the suffering caused by COVID-19 in a manner that is safe and consistent with our faith. The COVID-19 vaccine is a legitimate means of preventing the spread of the disease, and taking the vaccine is both morally acceptable and encouraged. Vaccination should be a serious consideration for Catholics, and all people of good will, who seek to care for one another in this epidemic. If one chooses not to be vaccinated, one then has a moral responsibility to embrace the necessary precautions to avoid spreading the disease to others.\" Rabbi Maya Leibovich, Temple B'nai Israel in Petoskey: \"In Deuteronomy chapter 4, phrase 15 I find the answer to (the) question. I shall quote two different translations to the Hebrew: 1.Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves (Soncino translation), 2.For your own sake, therefore, be most careful (Plaut translation). This is taken from the portion we actually read this week, namely Va\"Etchanan. In its place in the Torah (Bible), it refers to being careful in guarding God's commandments, but along the Jewish history this phrase has been interpreted as relating to being careful for ourselves because we are not our own masters, we are servants of God. The caring can be understood on many levels such as not endangering ourselves, living a healthy life, guarding our bodies and souls. Judaism is a tradition of multi interpretations and each generation adds to the older ones. As a rabbi in the 21st century I certainly think that getting a vaccination that has been proven to save lives is within the command of guarding ourselves. I see it is both my moral as well as spiritual duty as Rabbi to encourage my congregants to get the jabs.\" The Rev. Jonathan David Mays, pastor of Greensky Hill Indian United Methodist Church in Charlevoix: \"As (a) pastor I want to be as clear as possible in my encouragement to everyone to get the COVID-19 vaccination as soon as possible. There has been a lot of misinformation \u2014 and outright lies \u2014 about the vaccination and much of it has been targeted to people who identify as Christian. This misinformation often includes the dysfunctional theology that trusting God means you shouldn't need a vaccination because God will protect you. That's like saying that God will protect you if you choose to throw yourself down from the pinnacle of the temple. If that sounds familiar it's because, according to the gospel of Matthew, that's one of the ways the devil tempted Jesus. Jesus said, \"It is written, 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.' Very recently, after more than a year of surviving the pandemic, we've had Greensky Hill relatives die from the virus. With rare exceptions, the only people being hospitalized or dying from COVID-19 are people who have not received the vaccination. Our council is committed to continue loving our neighbors as ourselves by following the most up-to-date science and guidelines. As with any medical decision, it is wise to consult with your own physician. I am not a doctor or a scientist. I am a pastor who loves you and wants the very best for you. What is abundantly clear is that risks from getting the vaccination are very rare and far less risky than getting the virus.\" The Rev. Jeff Grundmeier, pastor of Immanuel Lutheran Church in Sault Ste Marie: \"Our greatest moral/spiritual responsibility is to faithfully proclaim the salvation that Jesus Christ won for all people by his perfect life, sacrificial death, and victorious resurrection. This good news changes our entire perspective on life \u2014 including how we view moral/spiritual responsibilities. Trusting that Jesus has done everything to give us eternal life, we fulfill our responsibilities not out of forced obligation, but in willing freedom. The same Word of God which proclaims our salvation, also gives us a guide for how we are to live \u2014 summarized in the Ten Commandments. Basically: love God, and love fellow human beings. God's purpose was not to give us a rule book that covers every situation we might face, but principles that we apply using our best judgment. Many situations are not addressed in God's Word including the many different vaccines available today. This sinful, broken world is a complex place. In the choices we face, oftentimes we are forced to choose which principle to prioritize. We should never go against what our conscience says, but oftentimes, our conscience, being unreliable, is conflicted. Yet in all this, we know that our salvation does not depend on what we do or don't do. It depends on Christ. That frees us to show love to God and our neighbor as best we can, trusting that he has forgiven our sinful shortcomings, which taint even our best decisions. There are many things we could do to reduce our risk of harming others, but no one is able to do all of them \u2014 if we did, we would not be able to show to others at all. Getting a vaccine may be a way someone chooses to show love to others, but not everyone can, according to their own health situation or their trust in those who have made the vaccine. A key issue with any vaccine is trust and I have to understand if people have a hard time trusting other people. People are fallible and make mistakes. So in the end, it is such a blessing that our trust ultimately rests on God.\" The Rev. Dr. Kip Murphy, pastor of First Presbyterian Church in Harbor Springs: \"Prior to going to (the) seminary I was a biochemistry professor at the University of Iowa, so I have been following the pandemic from both a pastoral/theological and a scientific perspective. I think there are both moral and spiritual responsibilities to get vaccinated. Morally, followers of Jesus are called to love others as we have been loved which means with a servant heart. Getting vaccinated puts others ahead of ourselves by doing all we can to prevent the spread of the virus. As Christians, we also have a moral responsibility to use our minds (i.e. following the science) because Jesus tells us to love God with our minds and not just our hearts. We also have a spiritual responsibility as we are called to be good stewards of what God has entrusted to us. This includes our bodies and needlessly putting our bodies at risk is bad stewardship and dishonors the one who created us.\" Leonard Fleck, professor at the Center for Bioethics and Social Justice in the college of medicine at Michigan State University: \"We all have a moral responsibility to be vaccinated. This is a public health matter, not a matter of personal liberty. There are virtually no medical reasons that would justify not getting this vaccine (not pregnancy, not a compromised immune system, not any allergies). There is a very tiny chance that someone might have a significant reaction to the vaccine. Compared to the consequences associated with being infected with the Delta variant of COVID-19, the balance would tip very heavily in favor of being vaccinated. Why is it a moral responsibility? If it was just your life and health at risk, you would have the moral and political right to take that chance. However, if you become infected, you put at risk everyone with whom you come into contact: loved ones, friends, neighbors, other folks shopping. No one has the moral right to impose that harm on others. This is not a remote risk. We are at the beginning of a new surge because half the American population has not been vaccinated. (About) four weeks ago, the daily number of new COVID cases in the U.S. was below 10,000. (Recently) the daily case rate hit 57,000. If there is not a very rapid uptake in vaccination, the current predictions are we will see a daily rate in the U.S. of 200,000 new cases (soon). That is a lot of new hospitalizations and deaths. That will require lots of new restrictions. It is heartbreaking to see pictures of patients with COVID in the ICU pleading for the vaccine and doctors having to tell them that it is too late. Some vaccine hesitant individuals may express the concern that the vaccine was approved 'too quickly.' That concern might have made sense last January; but 150 million Americans have been vaccinated without significant incidents of awful side effects, except in a handful of very rare cases. "}
