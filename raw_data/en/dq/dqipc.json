CODE OF MARYLAND REGULATIONS (COMAR) COMAR is the official compilation of all regulations issued by agencies of the State of Maryland. The Maryland Register is COMAR's temporary supplement, printing all changes to regulations as soon as they occur. At lea st once annually, the changes to regulations printed in the Maryland Register are incorporated into COMAR by means of permanent supplements. CITATION TO COMAR REGULATIONS COMAR regulations are cited by title number, chapter number, and regulation number. Example: COMAR 10.08.01.03 refers to Title 10, Subtitle 08, Chapter 01, Regulation 03. DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE Incorporation by reference is a legal device by which a document is made part of COMAR simply by referring to i t. While the text of an incorporated document does not appear in COMAR, the provisions of the incorporated document are as fully enforceable as any other COMAR regulation. Each regulation that proposes to incorporate a document is identified in the Marylan d Register by an Editor's Note. The Cumulative Table of COMAR Regulations Adopted, Amended or Repealed, found online, also identifies each regulation incorporating a document. Documents incorporated by reference are available for inspection in various depo sitory libraries located throughout the State and at the Division of State Documents. These depositories are listed in the first issue of the Maryland Register published each year. For further information, call 410 -974-2486.

Statement of Purpose The purpose of this action is to add Amendment 1 to the Chesapeake Bay American Eel Fishery Management Plan and incorporate the amendment by reference. The action amends the 1991 Chesapeake Bay American Eel Fishery Management Plan ( FMP) to include a provision that recognizes the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission's (ASMFC) management measures and ensures flexibility when regulatory requirements change. Amendment 1 includes a provision for the adoption of current and future m anagement requirements established by ASMFC, an update of the current status of the eel resource, and a framework for managing and monitoring the eel fishery. The Fisheries Service's Plan Review Team reviewed the plan in 2014 and recommended that the 1991 American Eel FMP be amended to include a provision that recognizes ASMFC and ensures management flexibility when regulatory requirements change. Comparison to Federal Standards There is no corresponding federal standard to this proposed action. Estimate of Economic Impact The proposed action has no economic impact.

(text unchanged) MARK J. BELTON Secretary of Natural Resources Subtitle 02 FISHERIES SERVICE 08.02.01 General Authority: Natural Resources Article, \u00a74 -701, Annotated Code of M aryland Notice of Proposed Action [16-158-P] The Secretary of Natural Resources proposes to amend Regulation .02 under COMAR 08.02.01 General . Statement of Purpose The purpose of this action is to remove the fee for a replacement license and clarify the identification requirements for commercial vessels and vehicles. Specifically, the proposed action removes the replacement license provision. The Department has not charged a replacement license fee for approximately 2 years because the COMPASS licensing s ystem allows any licensee to print a license at any time without additional charges. In Regulation .02, it is unclear if the rules about the display of identification numbers apply to commercial gear as well as vehicles, vessels, and places of business. T he regulation is not intended for gear marking since placing a 4 -inch number on most gear is difficult or impossible. Other regulations specify how gear is to be marked. The size requirement should apply only to vessels and vehicles. The proposed action cl arifies the display of identification number for commercial vessels and vehicles and changes the minimum height requirement from 4 inches to 3 inches. Three -inch numbers are the standard size sold in stores as well as the standard used by the industry. Com parison to Federal Standards There is no corresponding federal standard to this proposed action. Estimate of Economic Impact The proposed action has no economic impact.

Statement of Purpose The purpose of this action is to reduce: (1) The application fee for annual day camps and public pools or spas; a nd (2) The plan review fee for food processing plants and food service facilities. Comparison to Federal Standards There is no corresponding federal standard to this proposed action. Estimate of Economic Impact I. Summary of Economic Impact. The reduction of fees for day camps, public pools or spas, and food processing plants will decrease General Fund revenues and decrease expenditures for the regulated industry. The application and plan review fees range from $50 to $900. However, the Department will col lect less revenue in the form of application and plan review fees totaling $46,870. The regulated industry is expected to benefit from the lower fees by reducing costs either to start a new business or continue operations. There is no economic impact on ot her State agencies or local governments. Revenue (R+/R -) II. Types of Economic Impact. Expenditure (E+/E -) Magnitude A. On issuing agency: (R-) $46,870 B. On other State agencies: NONE C. On local governments: NONE Benefit (+) Cost (-) Magnitude D. On regulated industries or trade groups: (+) $46,870 E. On other industries or trade groups: NONE F. Direct and indirect effects on public: NONE III. Assumptions. (Identified by Impact Letter and Number from Section II.) A. This estimate is based on fees collected in the previous fiscal year (2015), and assumes the same number and type of applicant when the regulations become effective. This includes a decrease in fee collections of $8,970 from the proposed 5 percent red uction in fees for day camps, $34,300 from the proposed $100 reduction in fees for plan reviews for 343 food processors, and $3,600 from the proposed $100 reduction in fees for plan reviews for 36 pool plan reviews. All fees collected are deposited into th e General Fund. D. There are benefits to certain day camps, public pools or spas, and food processing plants that include a savings of $8,970 from the proposed 5 percent reduction in fees for day camps, $34,300 from the proposed $100 reduction in fees for plan reviews for 343 food processors, and $3,600 from the proposed $100 reduction in fees for plan reviews for 36 pool plan reviews. The Department notes that of the 343 applications for food processors, 162 applications were for prototype retail food fac ilities, and would not be considered to be small businesses because they involve prototypes for food service facilities for a retail chain or a franchise operation planning to construct two or more facilities in the State from a single uniform set of plans . Economic Impact on Small Businesses The proposed action has a meaningful economic impact on small business. An analysis of this economic impact follows. Day camps will see a 5 percent decrease in the cost to apply for an operating certificate under the Department's day camp program. This will benefit smaller day camps by decreasing their costs to start or operate a day camp. Small businesses in food manufacturing and pool operators will experience a $100 decrease in the cost of submitting a plan for revi ew to the Department. The Department notes that of the 343 applications for food processors, 162 applications were for prototype retail food facilities, and would not be considered to be small businesses because they involve prototypes for food service facilities for a retail chain or a franchise operation planning to construct two or more facilities in the State from a single uniform set of plans.

Statement of Purpose The purpose of this action is to reduce from $24 to $10 the fee collected by the Department for issuance of a certified or abridged copy of a birth certificate, issuance of the first copy of a certified death certificate issued in a single transaction, a report that a search of the birth or death certificate files was made and the requested record was not on file, and for each change to a birth or death certificate made later than 1 year after the certificate was registered with the Department. In addition, the proposed regulation reduces from $20 to $10 the fee that is transferred to the General Fund for a birth or death certificate that is issued by a local health department. These changes are being made in accordance with Ch. 316, Acts of 2016. Comparison to Federal Standards There is no corresponding federal standard to this proposed action.

The reduction and elimination of the various fees proposed will accrue co st savings to various health care providers who are required to obtain initial and renewal licenses from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Specifically, the following provider types will receive annual fee decreases as listed below. Comprehe nsive care facilities $690,600 Health care staffing agencies $86,550 Residential treatment centers for emotionally disturbed children and adolescents $20 Freestanding medical facilities $1,000 Home health agencies $19,600 Assisted living faciliti es $357,980 Intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities $6,654 Hospice care program $2,700 Clinical laboratories $506,655 Public health HIV testing $900 Day care for elderly adults with medical disabilities $72,036 Forensic laboratories $5,480 Revenue (R+/R -) II.

On other industries or trade groups: NONE PROPOSED ACTION ON REGULATIONS 729 MARYLAND REGISTER, VOLUME 43, ISSUE 13, FRIDAY, JUNE 24, 2016 F. Direct and indirect effects on public: NONE III. Assumptions. (Identified by Impact Letter and Number from Section II.) A. and D. This estimate is based on elimination and reductions of fees collected for the 12 provider categories encompassed by the cited COMAR regulations in the previous fiscal year (2015), and assumes the same number and type of applicant when the regulatio ns become effective. This includes a decrease in annual fee collections of $357,980 from the proposed 75 percent reduction in fees for assisted living facilities, as well as a $1,000 annual decrease in fee collections from the proposed 33 percent reduction in fees for freestanding medical facilities. All other fees associated with provider types contemplated in this proposal will be eliminated. All fees collected are deposited into the General Fund. Economic Impact on Small Businesses The proposed action h as a meaningful economic impact on small business. An analysis of this economic impact follows. Assisted living facility operators will see a 75 percent decrease in initial and renewal license costs. As a large proportion of assisted living providers in Ma ryland are small businesses, this will result in a significant positive economic impact to the owners. Operators of freestanding medical facilities will see a reduction of $1,000 for 3 -year license renewals. The Department notes that the three freestandin g medical facilities in Maryland are associated with larger medical institutions and would not be considered small businesses. The elimination of all fees set forth in the remaining COMAR regulations listed in this proposal will have a significant positiv e impact on small businesses. Small business owners constitute varying percentages of the operators of facilities in the industries affected by the fee eliminations, and represent hundreds of individual businesses in the State of Maryland. Impact on Indivi duals with Disabilities The proposed action has no impact on individuals with disabilities.

MITCHELL Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene Subtitle 32 BOARD OF PHYSICIANS 10.32.21 Licensure, Regulation, and Discipline of Naturopathic Doctors Authority: Health Occupations Article, \u00a7\u00a714 -5F-1\u201414-5F-32, Annotated Code of Maryland Notice of Proposed Action [16-143-P] The Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene proposes to adopt new Regulations .01\u2014.20 under a new chapter, COMAR 10.32.21 Licensure, Regulation, and Discipline of Naturopathic Doctors . This action was considered by the Bo ard of Physicians at an emergency meeting held on February 16, 2016, notice of which was given on the Board of Physicians website on February 12, 2016. Other provisions of these regulations were approved at a public meeting held July 29, 2015, notice of which was given by publication on the Board of Physicians website, http://www.mbp.state.md.us/forms/jul15FULLagenda.pdf, from July 15, 2015, through July 29, 2015, pursuant to General Provisions Article, \u00a73 -302(c), Annotated Code of Maryland. Statement of Purpose The purpose of this action is to regulate how an individual becomes licensed as a naturopathic doctor and to regulate and discipline naturopathic doctors in general in accordance with Chs. 153 and 399, Acts of 2014. Comparison to Federal Standar ds There is no corresponding federal standard to this proposed action. Estimate of Economic Impact I. Summary of Economic Impact. The naturopathic doctor applicants will be assessed an initial licensure fee and thereafter a renewal fee. Revenue (R+/R -) II. Types of Economic Impact. Expenditure (E+/E -) Magnitude A. On issuing agency: Board of Physicians (E+) $103,905 B. On other State agencies: NONE C. On local governments: NONE Benefit (+) Cost ( -) Magnitude D. On regul ated industries or trade groups: (-) $20,540 PROPOSED ACTION ON REGULATIONS 733 MARYLAND REGISTER, VOLUME 43, ISSUE 13, FRIDAY, JUNE 24, 2016 E. On other industries or trade groups: NONE F. Direct and indirect effects on public: NONE III. Assumptions. (Identified by Impact Letter and Number from Section II.) A. and D. The revenue projected over 2 fiscal years is $124,445, and includes employee salaries, benefits, materials, equipment, technology, travel and other fees directly associated with the regulatory oversight of naturopathic doctors. If the estimated 26 naturopathic doctors were to pay al l expenses related to regulatory oversight by the Board, the cost would be $4,786 per licensee (Board expenses $124,445 divided by 26 projected licensees). However, the Board voted on February 16, 2016 to set the licensing fee at $790, which results in a t otal of $20,540 (26 projected licensees x $790) and the Board will absorb the expenses not covered by the lower fee. Economic Impact on Small Businesses The proposed action has a meaningful economic impact on small business. An analysis of this economic i mpact follows. An analysis of this economic impact follows. The Board of Physicians is not supported by the General Fund and therefore each health occupation is required to cover expenses related to regulation (Health Occupations Article, \u00a714 -205(a)(12), A nnotated Code of Maryland (Supp.2015)). The projected operating expenses for FY 15 and FY 16 is $124,445. With only 26 projected licensees, the initial licensure fee should be $4,786 per licensee. However, the Board voted a licensing fee of $790, and will absorb the expenses not covered by the new fee of $790. Impact on Individuals with Disabilities The proposed action has no impact on individuals with disabilities.

Statem ent of Purpose The purpose of this action is to eliminate or reduce four MVA fees, which will save Maryland residents money every year. The following fees are impacted: Shuttle permit; County sticker; Moped permit (issuance); and Moped permit (rene wal). MVA also proposes updating language to allow the Vehicle Emissions Inspection Program to use advanced testing methods. Comparison to Federal Standards There is no corresponding federal standard to this proposed action. Estimate of Economic Impact I. Summary of Economic Impact. The estimated economic impact to the Administration based on the proposed regulation is estimated to be an annual revenue decrease of $6,430. Assuming an implementation date of September 1, 2016, the proposed regulation is estim ated to be a revenue decrease of $5,358 in FY17. The decrease is the result of decreasing the fees for various motor vehicle fees. Based on the assumption and the information contained in this fiscal impact statement, the estimated economic impacts are as follows: (1) Moped Operator's License New (from $5 Shuttle -Annual to $25), 50% red uction.

Under the proposed regulation, the projected decrease in revenue resulting from the decrease in fees is as follows: Moped Operator's License - New Issuance FY15 Revenue = $ 7,740 Projected Revenue with Proposed fee change = $3,440 ($7,740 x 44% (fee reduced from $45 License - Renewal FY15 Revenue = $690 Projected Revenue with Proposed fee change = $345 ($690 x 50% (fee reduced from $30 to $15 = 50%) Revenue Decrease = $345 ($690 -$345) Vehicle Registration Fe es - Sales of County Stickers FY15 Revenue = $1,635 Projected Revenue with Proposed fee change = $0 ($1,635 revenue x 100% (fee reduced from $5 to = 100% reduction Revenue Decrease = $1,635 $1,635 -$0) Miscellaneous Fees - Shuttle Permit - Annual Fee FY15 Revenue = $300 Projected Revenue with Proposed fee change = $150 ($300 revenue x 50% (fee reduced from $50 to $25 - 50% fee) Revenue Decrease = $150 ($300 - $150) Total decrease in annual revenue = $6,430 FY 17 decrease (assuming September 1, 2016 eff ective date) = $5,358 F. The $5,358 decrease in cost to the public is based on the reduced fees and the fee elimination described above. Therefore, the annual benefit to the public is $5,358.

Statement of Purpose The purpose of this action is to reduce technician registration and hospital license fees to be paid to the State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners. Comparison to Fede ral Standards There is no corresponding federal standard to this proposed action. Estimate of Economic Impact I. Summary of Economic Impact. There will be a moderate impact on revenue received by the State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners and a modera te impact on regulated persons beginning with the 2017 fiscal year for the reduction of veterinary technician registration fees and veterinary hospital license fees. PROPOSED ACTION ON REGULATIONS 748 MARYLAND REGISTER, VOLUME 43, ISSUE 13, FRIDAY, JUNE 24, 2016 Revenue (R+/R -) II. Types of Economic Impact. Expenditure (E+/E -) Magnitude A. On issuing agency: (R-) $35,500 B. On other State agencies: NONE C. On local governments: NONE Benefit (+) Cost ( -) Magnitude D. On regulated industries or trade groups: (+) $35,500 E. On other industries or trade groups: NONE F. Direct and indirect effects on public: (+) Unknown III. Assumptions. (Identified by Impact Letter and Number from Section II.) A. The State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners registers 200 veterinary technicians and licenses 500 veterinary hospita ls. The Board proposes to reduce the registration fee by $65 (from $215 to $150). This results in a total revenue reduction of $35,500 (200 x 15 = $3,000; 500 x $65 = 32,500) $3,000 + 32,500 = $35,500). D. See II. A. above for magnitude of benefit to regu lated industries. F. Lower fees reduce the cost of doing business and may result in some unknown benefit to the public. Economic Impact on Small Businesses The proposed action has a meaningful economic impact on small business. An analysis of this econom ic impact follows. The $35,500 revenue not coming to the State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners will stay with individuals and small businesses. It is difficult to quantify the exact positive impact, but there is some. Impact on Individuals with Disab ilities The proposed action has no impact on individuals with disabilities.

Contact: Gwendolyn Joyner (410) 764 - 5996 [16-13-11] COMPTROLLER OF THE TREASURY/ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE Subject: Reinstatement of Bond Authorization Announcement Add'l. Info: Background: Reference is made to Secretary's Agenda Item 16.B Supplemental (11/12/2014),with respect to the Duvall Field Renovation Loan of 2007 in which the Board approved a recommendation to cancel this authorization in the amount of $1,026 and to decrease the State's spending authority in like amount. That recomm endation was made in error. The 2007 MCCBL (bond bill) required that the grant funds be expended or encumbered by the Board of Public Works no later than June 1, 2014. Under State Finance and Procurement Article, \u00a78 -128, Annotated Code of Maryland, autho rization for any funds unexpended or unencumbered after June 1, 2014, was ripe for cancellation. The Office of the Comptroller notified the grantee that it would be recommending cancellation of $1,026, the amount that the Office believed unencumbered. However, as to the Duvall Field Renovation funds, a relevant portion of the 2007 MCCBL was encumbered by June 1, 2014, for the Board of Public Works to expend it. As such the $513 should not have been canceled. Therefore, with Board of Public Works approval of item #3, dated June 8, 2016, we submit for publication the following reinstatement of bond authorization: To reinstate the following general obligation bond authorization in the amount of $513 and, at the same time, increase the State's spending a uthority as shown for the following capital project.
