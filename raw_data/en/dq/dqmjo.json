Horn Chiropractic uses this specialized form of laser therapy to promote cellular healing and provide natural pain relief. Our practice offers the only high-dosage class IV laser in Athens and the surrounding areas. We choose to use laser therapy as a natural approach to healthcare, rather than depending on surgery or drugs for treatment and relief. Find out more about how Class IV laser therapy works, and what you can expect when you visit our office for this type of treatment. Is Laser Therapy In Athens PA Safe? Our office uses safe and painless high dosage laser therapy to trigger a number of functions of healing at the cellular level. These include improving circulation, which boosts your immune response and stimulates healthy healing of injured or damaged tissue. Laser therapy uses a scientific method called photo-biomodulation to achieve these cell-level changes. Class IV laser therapy by Diowave is non-invasive. Furthermore, therapeutic treatment laser therapy does not burn or cut through the skin because the action is photochemical, not thermal like surgical lasers. In fact, most patients enjoy the mild heating of the laser. After a treatment, you will likely begin seeing positive effects almost instantaneously. However, we recommend more than one visit for long-term pain relief and injury healing. The Diowave Difference Diowave High Dose Laser Therapy delivers much more energy dosage than other cold lasers; this provides patients a much faster recovery with our treatments compared to other cold lasers results. Our Diowave 60-Watt Laser delivers 120 times more energy per minute than the strongest low-level cold laser. Patients also love the heating side effect that is generated from the high-power laser energy. Results can be seen and felt immediately! Joint and Muscle Pain Relief The most beneficial use for Class IV laser therapy is pain relief. Using laser treatments we can offer pain relief for inflammatory conditions, such as muscle spasms, plantar fasciitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, and bursitis. We also use this treatment for damaged ligament pain relief. If you suffer from a connective tissue disorder or injury, such as tendonitis, myofasciitis, radicular pain, sprains, or effusion, we can use laser treatments for tissue pain relief as well.
