Some consider back labor to be the most severe aspect of labor pain. Chiropractic care has been shown to substantially reduce both back pain during pregnancy and back labor. * 71.7% of women who had back pain during pregnancy also suffered with back labor * 84% of adjusted pregnant women reported relief of their back pain during their pregnancy. * Women adjusted from at least the tenth week of pregnancy through delivery had shorter labor times than national averages. * First time mothers had 24% shorter labors * Second time mothers and beyond had 39% shorter labors Chiropractic care for pregnant women is extremely safe for both mother and child. In contrast, pain medication affect both the baby and the mother, whether over-the-counter-medication or the stronger narcotic medications given during labor and delivery. Certainly women would be less likely to take pain medications during pregnancy if their back pain can be reduced, and even more important, if labor is shorter and far less painful, women would need less of the stronger pain medications. So Chiropractic care is not only safe for expecting mothers, it likely lowers risks associated with medications. If you experience back pain during pregnancy call Marshall Family Chiropractic at (810)329-6100 to set up an appointment. How Vaccines Can Damage Your Brain By Russell L. Blaylock, M.D., CCN It has been estimated that 14.8 million Americans suffer from major depressive disorder and of this number 6 million are elderly. If we include anxiety disorders, which commonly accompany depression, the number jumps to 40 million adults. Depression later in life tends to last longer and be more severe than at younger ages. It is also associated with a high rate of suicide. Previously, it was thought that major depression was secondary to a deficiency in certain neurotransmitters in the brain, particularly the monoamines, which include serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine. While alterations in these important mood-related neurotransmitters is found with major depression, growing evidence indicates that the primary culprit is low-grade, chronic brain inflammation. This exclusive article will review in detail the functions and impact of various agents on depression and neurodegeneration, including: | | The impact of MSG on your brain and mood | | The link between elevated brain glutamate and inflammation | | The connections between pesticides and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease | | How vaccinations cause brain inflammation | | The impact of an expanding vaccine schedule for the elderly | | The shocking truth, linking brain inflammation to neurodegenerative diseases | | How vaccine additives such as mercury and aluminum impact your brain health | | The real danger of live virus vaccines Current recommendations by the CDC for adult vaccinations include a total of 14 separate inoculations with infectious agents and powerful immune adjuvants. According to CDC recommendations, multiple vaccinations for a single disease are separated by no more than 4 weeks, which is close enough together to trigger a smoldering process of brain inflammation and excitotoxicity that can not only result in depression, anxiety and high suicide rates, but can increase your risk of developing one of the neurodegenerative diseases as well. We have also seen that in many cases a person will be injected with several vaccines during a single office visit and this means that their body is exposed to a very large dose of immune adjuvant. Compelling studies, using many animal species as well as humans, have shown that this overactivates brain inflammatory mechanisms that can last for years. Sweet Surprise Constantly craving snacks? High-fructose corn syrup may be to blame. Unlike other sugars, this sweetener - found in soft drinks, salad dressings, baked goods and cereals - interferes with your body's appetite-control center. Most foods (including those with cane sugar) trigger your stomach to release leptin, a protein that turns off hunger pangs. Not so with high-fructose corn syrup. \"Products that contain it make you hungry\", says Michael Roizen, M.D. co-author of You On a Diet (Free Press). \"Americans ate none of it in 1960 and now consume more than 63 pounds per person each year.\" Read food labels carefully. If high-fructose corn syrup is one of the first five ingredients, put the item back on the shelf. Flu Shot Anyone? According to Hugh Fudenberg, MD, the world's leading immunogeneticist and the 13th most quoted biologist of our times (nearly 850 papers in peer review journals): If an individual has had 5 consecutive flu shots between 1970 and 1980 (the years studied) his/her chances of getting Alzheimer's Disease is 10 times higher than if he/she had one, two or no shots. Dr Fudenberg said it was due to mercury and aluminum that is in every flu shot (and most childhood shots) . The gradual mercury and aluminum build-up in the brain causes cognitive dysfunction. Flu shots contain 25 micrograms of mercury. One microgram is considered toxic. New Flu Vaccine is Loaded with MERCURY GlaxoSmithKline's new flu vaccine Fluarix was approved for sale in the USA this past fall under an accelerated FDA approval process. Another flu vaccine manufacturer, Chiron, moved closer to getting their license back; it was suspended when their flu vaccine was found to be contaminated with bacteria. Chiron's license was suspended by British regulators in October, and the FDA barred U.S. distribution of the vaccine, cutting the nation's expected supply of flu vaccine in half. GlaxoSmithKline expects to distribute 8 million doses of Fluarix and will begin shipping immediately. Chiron, if its vaccine is re-approved, could supply 18 million to 26 million doses of Fluvirin. USA Today, August 31, 2005 --- Dr. Mercola's Comment: It has been six years since the American Academy of Pediatrics and the U.S. Public Health Service joined forces in requesting the removal of all mercury-containing the preservative thimerosal from vaccines. A quick surf on the net easily reveals that this new vaccine indeed contains mercury. How is it possible that they can approve vaccines that have a preservative that has been outlawed for six years? Last year I ran an article that documented that flu vaccines still contain mercury. How can the US Federal Government justify this morally reprehensible behavior and expose your children and you to this well documented neuro-toxic poison? The \"Mad Hatter\" from Alice in Wonderland wasn't just an idle fancy. In fact, hatters in England went insane with astonishing frequency a couple of hundred years ago, until \"mad hatter\" became a clich\u00e9. Why? Mercury salts were used to make felt for fancy hats. Mercury exposure can cause a devastating array of problems, including: Multiple Sclerosis Central Nervous System Disorders Autism Alzheimer's Disease Is this really something you want injected into yourself, and your children? Avoid mercury poisoning; don't eat fish, unless you are absolutely certain that is has been tested in a laboratory and shown not to contain detectable levels of mercury and other toxins. To get your vital omega-3 fatty acids, eat high quality fish oil instead. This will also, incidentally, help keep you from getting the flu. Chiropractic forecast: 'Clear' days ahead.... How many times have you gotten up from the table after an adjustment and felt more awake, or 'clear' like a fog just lifted? Happens a lot in offices across the country. That instant alert feeling you experience is a very powerful physiologic effect commonly felt after a chiropractic adjustment. It's like a fog's been lifted from your nerve system, clearing the wa for better function and healing. The next time you 'come out of a fog' after your adjustment ask yourself, how many police officers, teachers, and nurses are walking around in a fog because they've never been adjusted before? Do you ever wonder if the school bus driver that just took your kids to school might be driving in a fog because they've never been told the benefits of a 'clearing' chiropractic adjustment? It's important for EVERYONE to be checked and cleared of Subluxations so they can live their best lives. (First ones on the list should be your spouse and your kids!) Clearing the fog from a sick population is the real mission of ChiropracTIC. The 'TIC' stands for Teach Innate Chiropractic. You can help our mission by telling everyone how better their lives could be if they were 'clear' too. Imagine what a safer and healthier community it would be. "}
