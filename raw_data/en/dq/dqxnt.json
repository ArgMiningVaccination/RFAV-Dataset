When going through the detox process, you may hear the phrase, going \"cold turkey,\" which refers to ultimately stopping the use of the substance altogether in one go. While this is a method that some use, it is not always the best process to take. Going \"cold turkey\" might be acceptable if you are struggling with minor substance abuse and when there are minimal risks of health dangers. This is referred to as a sub-acute detox. It is important to know the difference between a [sub-acute and acute](https://www.northstartransitions.com/post/the-difference-between-sub-acute-acute-detox) detox. Although the idea of \"cold turkey\" may seem pleasing, it is best to keep in mind that just quitting is not advised. Even when going \"cold turkey,\" you should always try to work on other areas of a program, such as attending groups, therapy, and, if needed seeking medical and emotional help. Going cold turkey can truly take a toll on the body and your mental health, so when making that decision, always make sure you are going about it in a safe and healthy manner.

It is important to clarify that there are dangers to [detoxing alone,](https://www.northstartransitions.com/post/dangers-of-doing-an-alcohol-detox-alone) and you should know them before you start the process. One of the biggest struggles that people face when detoxing and reaching out for help is the feeling of being a failure or the feelings of shame and judgment. This is never the case, as the people there to help you would much rather provide you with the medical assistance you need versus seeing you try to do this alone and potentially causing harm to yourself. You may ask yourself, during the detox process, is it worth it? Is getting sober worth the pain and the sickness that comes with the detox process? The answer is simply yes. Living a sober life is the best thing you can do for yourself. It is not about just living a drug-free life; it is about getting the most out of life. You have to face challenges getting sober, so it is recommended that you seek out a [treatment program](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK424859/) that is right for you to help you face the potential issues that will come up once your mind is clear of substances.
