We all want to eat fresh foods, we don't want our foods highly processed, we want more organics and the whole farm-to-table movement is huge. I'm really fortunate to be working at a place like Hy-Vee when Americans are so focused on how and what we eat. At Hy-Vee, we're looking for the balance people want between quick-and-easy foods and meals made with ingredients that were just picked at a farm a few days ago. Part of my role is developing recipes. I love it. I'm working with the store dietitians to create dishes that are healthy and nutritious. A couple of my granolas are now being sold in the bulk food bins. I've also had the chance to show customers ways they can use Greek yogurt in recipes instead of sour cream. I like to contribute in this way. What I am doing is just a small example of how we at Hy-Vee interact with our customers. This is the annual Health issue of Hy-Vee Seasons, and we hope that you benefit from what you learn here. Concerns about diet and health are put into focus in \"Healthy Heart\" on page 40. As a chef, I highly recommend the story \"Pick a Peck of Peppers\" on page 16. And be sure to try some of the delicious dessert recipes in \"Fresh and Lovely\" on page 34. All these treats are made with good-for-you fresh fruit. Everyone at Hy-Vee is happy to serve you and we all wish you good health! Sincerely, Chef Andrew Kintigh Hy-Vee store #1 Ankeny, IowaAbout Our Editor: The most important fact about Chef Andrew Kintigh these days is that he and his wife have become parents. You can tell by his smile. A 2006 graduate of culinary school, he worked in restaurants and as a corporate chef before starting at Hy-Vee in Ankeny, Iowa, about four years ago.

PHOTOS Tobin BennettJUICY CITRUSIN SEASON GRAPEFRUIT Eating this sweet-tart fruit on its own can be highly satisfying, or toss it in salads, salsas and pan sauces to add juicy bright flavor notes. A twist of grapefruit zest makes a nice change from lemon or lime in drinks where a little bitterness is welcome. LEMONS The fragrant zest and tangy juice of lemons add spark to all kinds of dishes. Besides vitamin C, lemon juice contains citric acid, making it a natural for slowing the browning, or oxidation, of fresh raw foods, including apples, avocados and bananas. PUMMEL OS This giant citrus fruit is native to Southeast Asia and thought to be an ancestor to the grapefruit. Pummelos have a refreshingly sweet and mildly tart flavor. Use them to liven up the flavor of a basic fruit salad. For a snack, sprinkle segments with salt and chile powder; for a refreshing dessert, drizzle with a light, simple syrup. CLEMENTINES Among the more well-known members of the mandarin-orange family are clementines, which are small, seedless citrus that are very sweet and easy to peel. A ham, Swiss cheese and clementine wrap makes a welcome surprise in your child' s lunch box. A few clementine sections and lemonade ice cubes whirled in a blender make a healthy refresher. BLOOD ORANGES Slice open a blood orange and you' ll see a dramatic and beautiful bright red to deep maroon interior. Take a bite and you' ll become a fan of the intense orange taste with hints of fresh raspberry. Toss slices into salads, salsas or chutneys. The sweet-tart flavor is wonderful with roasted or grilled meat or poultry. NAVEL ORANGES These are easy to spot in your produce aisle. They' re the ones with the button indentation opposite the stem end. Considered the world' s finest eating oranges, navels are seedless and they peel and segment easily. One variety, Cara Cara, has reddish-pink flesh and an exceptionally sweet flavor with a tangy cranberrylike zing. Toss sections on your favorite cereal, pancakes and waffles. Add fresh-squeezed navel juice to beverages and vinaigrette salad dressings. These oranges also make healthy snacks that pack and travel well.

LIFE CHANGERS PHOTOS Tobin Bennett SEASONS | Health 2014 10 10-11 Our Best LO.indd 10 12/2/13 10:26 AMDietitian Kaitlin Anderson of Hy-Vee in Rochester, Minnesota, was on her second day back after maternity leave last September when she found out that she had won a major award from the company\u2014the Legendary Customer Service Award. She was one of only 10 Hy-Vee employees honored with the annual award. Dietitian Michelle Arasim-Diekmann was surprised in April when she was named one of the Best of Kansas City for Hy-Vee dietitians in the KC area. She works at the Lee's Summit West store in Missouri. Hy-Vee Seasons spoke with Kaitlin and Michelle about helping people make smart choices with food. Q: TELL US ABOUT YOUR CAREERS AS DIETITIANS. A: Kaitlin: I've been a dietitian since 2008. I did an internship at Mayo Clinic and as soon as I nished that, I came right to work at Hy-Vee. When I was an intern in a hospital setting, I thought I had chosen the wrong career and I would have to go back to school to start over. But once I started at Hy-Vee, I knew I had chosen right. In my whole time at the hospital, I could count on two hands the times I really helped somebody to change. But at the store, I help people every single day. Michelle: I graduated in 2006 and started at Hy-Vee two weeks later. If you ask me what my hobby is, I'd say that it's nutrition and health. I'm in a job where I can practice every day what I live and preach. I have a great tool, Hy-Vee grocery store, to make a difference in people's lives and it feels really good. I love it. Q: WHAT DO YOU DO DURING A TYPICAL DAY AT WORK? A: Kaitlin: No two days are ever the same. I do grocery store tours, I write a newspaper column, I speak in the community. I do health screenings for employees. I help write menus for Catering. I do a million different things and I love all of them. Michelle: I work in the HealthMarket section a lot of the time, educating people about eating and answering their questions. I might engage with 20 or 30 people a day there. Sometimes when I'm in the aisles, it is just one person after another who is looking for information. Typically, people ask about going gluten-free and I get a lot of questions about supplements. I give free shopping tours focused on how people can eat healthier foods. I work with a lot of people who have just come from their doctor with a diagnosis and they need help with a diet to address it. I also work with 130 employees in a healthy lifestyle program. Every day at work brings excitement and something different. Q: HOW DO CUSTOMER SHOPPING TOURS WORK? A: Kaitlin: Anyone can request a tour. We make an appointment and meet to walk through the store. I ask customers about what they eat and get an understanding of their budget so I can t my advice into how they already shop and eat. If they aren't familiar with it, I teach them how to use the NuVal system. We spend a lot of time in Produce talking about fruits and vegetables. Then we visit other parts of the store, always including the HealthMarket and the Pharmacy. The tour usually takes about an hour.Michelle: I would encourage everyone to do this. I get a clear picture of what customers eat and I can help them. It starts out with a customer guiding me through the aisles so I can see what they're eating. Funny, people think that they are doing really badly. But then I see it's not really that bad\u2014they just need some Anderson, Hy-Vee Dietitian, Rochester, Minnesota HEALTHY EATING TIP If you need to make better food choices, learn to use the NuVal Nutritional Scoring System. Thousands of foods have been analyzed for their nutritional values and have been given one to 100 points based on how good the foods are for you. You'll find the best-for-you foods by comparing NuVal points of like products\u2014the highest score is the most nutritious. For instance, pick the tomato soup scoring 80 instead of 55. You will find NuVal scores posted along with prices on shelf fronts at all Hy-Vee stores.

Make sure the pieces are uniform so they cook at the same rate. STEP 2: Marinate the chicken pieces in refrigerator for 30 minutes, turning once. Drain, reserving marinade. While the chicken is marinating, cut the vegetables. You'll want to have everything near the stove beforehand, as the cooking goes quickly.STEP 3: Heat a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Get your skillet as hot as possible before adding the oil. Add 3 tablespoons of canola oil and get the oil searing hot before adding the chicken. Once you've added the chicken, toss and stir it rapidly so it acquires a seared exterior. When done, remove it from skillet and keep the chicken warm. STEP 4: Before stir-frying the vegetables, a dd a little more oil to the skillet. Be sure to allow your skillet to fully reheat before adding the vegetables. Stir the vegetables fairly often so they cook through quickly in2 to 3 minutes. When vegetables are done, add the cooked chicken back into the skillet.STEP 6: Add the sauce mixture only after everything is more or less nished cooking. Continue to cook just long enough for the sauce to lightly coat the ingredients and thicken into a glaze. Serve over quinoa topped with sesame seeds.STEP 5: Prepare the sauce. Many stir-fry recipes call for adding cornstarch to a sauce for thickening. First, whisk the cornstarch into the broth in a small bowl until dissolved. Then whisk in the reserved marinade. STIR-FRYING BRINGS OUT THE CREATIVE CHEF HIDING WITHIN. IT'S A TECHNIQUE THAT REWARDS EXPERIMENTATION AND INSPIRATION. VEGETABLES4 cups = 4 servingsGood vegetables for stir-frying include fresh asparagus, bok choy, broccoli, cabbage, carrots, green onions, mushrooms, pea pods, sweet bell peppers, spinach, zucchini, and yellow, white or red onions. Frozen stir-fry vegetables are a good prechopped option for any stir-fry. MEAT, POULTRY AND SEAFOOD \u00be to 1 pound = 4 servings Choose tender, quick-cooking cuts of meat and chicken, such as lean boneless pork, sirloin steak, lean boneless lamb and skinless, boneless chicken breasts. For seafood, choose shrimp or scallops. MEATLESS A 14-ounce package of extra- rm tofu yields enough protein to serve ve. Adding more vegetables and scrambled eggs to the mix also boosts protein. OIL Canola oil is high in heart-healthy fats. Peanut oil is good too because it can reach a higher temperature than other oils before it starts smoking. High heat is the key to keeping the vegetables crisp and fl avorful. SAUCE For the most healthful sauce, make your own using minimal fat and low-sodium ingredients with fresh additions, such as minced garlic, fresh ginger and citrus. When crunched for time, use moderate amounts of purchased sauce. TOPPERS For extra fl avor and crunch, try herbs, such as chopped fresh basil or cilantro. Or sprinkle on peanuts, cashews, sliced or slivered almonds or toasted sesame seeds.

SOME ARE HOT, SOME ARE NOT, BUT EACH PUNCHES UP FLAVOR AND NUTRITION IN YOUR MEALS. OUR HANDY PEPPER GUIDE AND NEW RECIPES WILL HELP YOU MAKE THE MOST OF THIS DELICIOUS FRUIT. WORDS Lois White PHOTOS King AuPICK A PECK OF SEASONS | Health 2014 16 16-25 Peppers LO.indd 16 12/2/13 11:13 AMWith their glossy-smooth skins, curvy shapes and intense colors from deep green to bright orange and red, peppers are beautiful. But it's their range of flavors and heat levels that captivate cooks. While some varieties hit the palate like a bolt of lightening, others are mild-mannered and sweet, offering hints of spice and fruitiness. Health-conscious cooks have long embraced peppers for nutrients that help fight disease and, in some cases, aid in weight control. A HOST OF HE ALTH BENEFITS Beyond good looks, peppers are packed with vitamins and antioxidants. Yellow and red bells are a great go-to source of vitamin C, which is vital in maintaining healthy tissues and a strong immune system. A half cup of raw red sweet pepper contains 142 milligrams of vitamin C. \"That's more than twice the amount found in an orange,\" says Tonya Huenink, Hy-Vee dietitian. What about green won't as much vitamin C\u2014just 60 milligrams per half cup\u2014but one pepper provides enough dietary fiber to help you feel full without adding calories. All bell peppers start out green. As they continue to ripen on the vine and become yellow, then orange and red, they pack in more nutrients. Brighter bells contain high amounts of carotenoids, which help boost immunity, and fight cancer and heart disease. Two of the these, lutein and zeaxanthin, are powerful antioxidants that help protect eyes from damaging light that leads to cataracts and macular degeneration. The hotter chiles contain many of the same nutrients as bell peppers, but in smaller doses. They're terrific for boosting flavor in recipes without adding extra sodium or fat. The hot and spicy flavors also encourage slower eating, which can help dieters stay on track with their weight-loss goals. Capsaicin, the potent chemical responsible for their heat, even offers a few other health benefits. Eating hot peppers ramps up the metabolism, switching the body into fat-burning mode. Newer studies indicate that capsaicin may help lower triglyceride and cholesterol levels and may even stop the growth of cancer cells. PeppersWHICH PEPPERS TO PICK For many cooks, picking the right peppers is something of a mystery. Here's the key: You have to taste them to know them! \"Get one of each pepper, then start with the sweet bell pepper and work your way up to the hot,\" says Chef Tracy Tonning. The basic thing to know is that the hotter the pepper, the more capsaicin it has. Pepper heat is measured in Scoville Heat Units (SHU), with 0 units being the mildest and 2 million units the hottest. Sweet bell peppers and mini-sweets have no capsaicin and rate 0; the hottest pepper in the world, the Trinidad Scorpion, averages 1.2 million. Every year or two there's a new \"hottest\" pepper, and the competition is fierce among amateur and professional plant breeders to earn the title. If you want the chile flavor without the mouth-scorching fire, remove the seeds and ribs before cooking. Try blending a hotter pepper with a bell. \"You'll get a variety of heat levels, and your tolerance of heat will increase each time,\" says Chef Tracy. Always use rubber gloves and be careful to avoid touching your eyes. When sampling fiery flavors, stay within arm's reach of milk, yogurt or sour cream to soothe the chile afterburn. Other forms of chiles worth seeking out include canned smoky chipotles and dried chiles, which add complex flavor to dishes. Chipotle flavor is wildly popular, found in everything from snack chips to brownies. Vegetarians love the pepper for its rich meaty bacon flavor. Pickled peppers are a tasty condiment for adding extra zip to a sandwich or sub. But that's only half the pleasure. You can also use its vinegar to intensify flavors and add a nice amount of heat to salad dressings and marinades. Chef Tracy makes his own flavor-boosting seasoning blend by grinding dried guajillo chiles and blending them with kosher salt. He uses the pepper-salt combo to season pastas and salsas, and he rubs it on steaks before grilling. Tracy says, \"Vary the amount of peppers to whatever tastes good to you. It's about experimenting.\" SEASONS | hy-vee.com 17 16-25 Peppers LO.indd 17 12/2/13 11:13 AMRoas t A PEPPER Slow roasting in the oven is a great way to coax the most flavor from peppers, allowing their sharpness to fade and natural sugars to intensify. As peppers lose their crunch, they become juicy and develop a wonderful velvety texture. Place whole peppers on a rimmed baking sheet. Brush with oil and roast in a 450\u00b0F oven, turning occasionally until the skins blister on all sides. Transfer peppers to a bowl; cover tightly and let stand for 15 minutes. Steaming peppers helps the skin slip off easily. Discard the skin along with seeds and stems. Cut peppers in half; reserve juices. Use peppers and juices immediately. Store up to five days in the refrigerator or freeze for up to 6 months. * W/a.alttch pages 64-65 to download today. 2014 18 16-25 Peppers LO.indd 18 12/4/13 3:55 PMROASTED SWEET PEPPER, SAUSAGE AND GOAT CHEESE PIZZA Simple, fresh ingredients on a thin whole wheat crust make this a truly tasty pizza.

Store whole unwashed peppers in a plastic bag in the refrigerator for up to five days. Scoville Heat Units (SHU) are given in order of heat level for each pepper to help you choose what's hot enough for you. The heat of peppers ranges depending on weather conditions, soil, etc. BELL These come in a rainbow of colors and offer distinctive sweetness; they have no heat. They add sweet, juicy flavors to everything from pizza to sauces. Perfect for stuffing. SHU: 0 MINI SWEETS Served plain or stuffed with dip, mini sweets make a great low-calorie appetizer. They are very mild with a satisfying crunchy bite, and have only 25 calories. SHU: 0-100 ANAHEIM This long, narrow, pale-to-medium green chile hails from Southern California. It has a sweet, bell pepperlike flavor with a little bit of heat. Anaheims have thick outer walls good for stuffing and are a good heat level for chiles rellenos. Dice them for salsa or add them to a stir-fry for a little extra heat. SHU: 500-2,500 POBLANO Because of its naturally thick walls and relatively mild flavor, poblanos are excellent for stuffing with beef, chicken, rice, cheese and other ingredients for a full meal. When dried, the peppers become the wrinkled and dark brown ancho chiles, which add complex flavors to cooked sauces such as Mexican moles. SHU: 1,000-2,500 JALAPE\u00d1O This fleshy, thumb-sized fruit has a crisp outer shell and adds a bright, forward heat to any dish, particularly if the seeds are not removed during preparation. Add to salsa for an extra kick, slice and use as a topper for a sub or salad or add to baked, grilled or fried fish. When dried and smoked, jalape\u00f1os become the complex and flavorful chipotle. SHU: 2,500-8,000 YELLOW HUNGARIAN WAX Often mistaken for the banana pepper, this creamy yellow chile generally ranges from medium to hot. Serve it in salads and salsas. Use pickled as a tasty topper for burgers and subs. SHU: 5,000-15,000 YELLOW CARIBE Intensely hot, this chile is named after an Indian tribe who inhabited the Caribbean during the 15th century. Use it to add warmth to salads, soups, meat and saut\u00e9ed vegetables. SHU: 5,000-15,000 SERRANO These dark green and red peppers are about twice as hot as jalape\u00f1os. Commonly used in salsas and sauces.SHU: 10,000-25,000 THAI Slightly curvy, Thai peppers are typically bright red or deep green, and end in a sharp point. They're extremely hot! Chop them up for a spicy salsa, sauces or soups. SHU: 50,000-350,000 HABAN ERO A few slivers of this dazzling hot pepper add a splash of spectacular color and extremely spicy notes to fresh salsas and hot sauces.

SEAS ONS | 45 40-49 Heart Health LO3.indd 45 12/2/13 12:16 PMBENEFITS OF TOFU You don't have to be a vegetarian to enjoy the heart benefits of tofu. A good source of protein, tofu provides a low-fat alternative to meat a few nights a week. It 's made a bit like cheese. Soybeans are soaked, crushed to release milk and heated. Curds, which develop in the milk, are formed into tofu products that range from soft to extra firm. Soft and silken tofu works well in smoothies, pudding and dips, while extra-firm tofu is a great meat replacement in noodle bowls, stir-fries and casseroles. Tofu is bland and porous, so it easily absorbs flavors in recipes. Eating less animal protein, in itself, may help lower blood cholesterol. Beyond that, eating 25 grams of soy protein daily\u2014the amount in 1 \u00bd cups of tofu\u2014may help directly lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels by 3 to 6 percent. For those worried about cancer risks, the American Cancer Society says moderate amounts of tofu appear safe for the general population.

It may help prevent an attack. But the AHA also warns that this therapy is not for everyone. Aspirin should not be taken by those with an aspirin allergy or those at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding or hemorrhagic stroke. Also avoid if you drink alcohol regularly or are undergoing any simple medical or dental procedures. You should take a daily aspirin only if your doctor advises you to do so. Low-dose aspirin is available at all Hy-Vee pharmacies.

In a recent review of more than 300 studies on exercise and disease, scientists found that regular physical activity can work just as well as medications in battling heart disease. Though medications play a role in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, routinely getting your heart pumping can go a long way toward strengthening your ticker. The easiest exercise: a brisk walk daily. Good technique will help you get the most benefit. Keep your head up, your shoulders relaxed and your back straight. Swing your arms with a slight bend in the elbows, tighten your stomach muscles slightly and walk smoothly. Find a buddy to keep you motivated. You'll both feel happier and healthier.

By employing in-store registered dietitians, Hy-Vee has opened an important dialogue with its customers\u2014one that has lifelong effects. Dietitians are food experts, making them part clinician, part detective and part counselor. Each has gone through years of training and must keep current in their knowledge about nutrition. Providing benefits that go beyond nutrition education, they equip customers with knowledge that they can use throughout the store. To arm shoppers with information, Hy-Vee offers complimentary shopping tours aimed at teaching you about food labeling and new choices in the aisles. These walk-and-learn sessions give you about an hour with a store dietitian. They will address your specific health concerns, such as diabetes, food allergies or gluten restrictions, or teach you how to shop smarter and eat wiser. \"A large part of my job is correcting misinformation and demonstrating that having a special diet doesn't mean that you are confined to only eating certain foods,\" says Jennifer Dunavan, Hy-Vee dietitian. \"You can shop the whole store even if you have a restricted diet. It's about understanding how to make food work for you.\" In addition to free tours, Hy-Vee dietitians offer health screenings, which assess cholesterol, blood pressure, blood sugar, body fat and body mass index. Dietitians help you decipher what your test results mean and show you how to make food choices that will help correct health issues you may have. Or they may discover a condition that needs attention from your doctor. Working with a doctor is part of every dietitian' s mission. If you need a nutritional plan following a diagnosis, an individualized plan for nutrition therapy and counseling can be tailored for you. \"We help our customers take the information that they receive at the doctor's office and put it into practice in the aisles of our store,\" says Hy-Vee dietitian Alexandria Economy. \"We really set them up for success and empower them with information.\" In addition to in-store service, you can reap the benefits of your dietitian connection at home by visiting the Hy-Vee website.

BUT YOU SHOULD BUY THEM FOR THEIR TASTE, TOO, BECAUSE THESE FOODS HAVE BEEN GROWN WITH CARE. WORDS Lisa Waterman Gray PHOTOS Tobin Bennett SEASONS | Health 2014 60 60-63 Organics LO2.indd 60 12/2/13 12:38 PM irm, plump organic pears and oranges; vibrant-hued organic radishes, romaine and fennel; and dark-gilled caps\u2014 it's never been easier to find organics at your neighborhood Hy-Vee. We counted 134 organic produce items at one store, plus many additional organic products in the HealthMarket and more sprinkled throughout the store. \"It' s not really accurate to say that there' s been an arc of growth in customer interest in organics. Growth has been more of a rocket,\" says Tom Hobt, Hy-Vee vice president. \"That sounds dramatic, but you' ll find organics throughout the entire store in just about every aisle.\" THE ORGANIC ADVANT AGE All foods labeled organic must meet strict government standards. To be certified organic by the USDA, food must be produced with renewable resources while conserving soil and water. Use of most conventional pesticides is forbidden as is the use of synthetic fertilizers, irradiation and bioengineering. Buying organics also makes it likely you are supporting local and regional farmers. These farmers manage pests and diseases by utilizing safe natural pesticides, beneficial insects and birds. In addition to food safety, flavor is a big reason consumers choose organics. The robust, sweet flavor of an organic tomato from a small Midwestern farm may far surpass that of tomatoes grown on large farms using agricultural methods aimed first at maximizing production. \"Sources for organics are often closer to home,\" Tom says. \"For example, we work with Heavenly Organics in Fairfield, Iowa. Their products are terrific.\" MAKING EACH D OLLAR C OUNT While conventionally grown food may generally cost less, there are ways to work organics into your budget. Purchase seasonal products whenever possible, and ask your Hy-Vee produce manager what day organic produce arrives to assure maximum freshness for the price. There' s good news about price in the months and years ahead. \"As farmers gain more experience with growing methods and the demand for organics increases, the price gap is closing,\" Tom says. READING LABELS Get to know the words used on the labels of organic foods. 100 Percent Organic. All ingredients in the product are USDA-certified organic. Also, ingredients used in processing organic foods must be organic. Organic. At least 95 percent of all the ingredients must be certified organic by the USDA. The remaining ingredients are not available organically, but have been approved by the government. SEASONS | hy-vee.com 61 60-63 Organics LO2.indd 61 12/2/13 12:38 PMKEEP IT CLEAN Most fruits and vegetables need a good bath before they are eaten, whether they are grown organically or not. Here are proper handling and preparation steps recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CLEAN ALL SURFA CES AND UTENSILS. U sing soap and hot water, clean cutting boards, peelers, countertops and knives that will touch fresh produce. Wash hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling. RINSE WELL. All fresh fruits and vegetables, including produce with rinds or skins that are not eaten, should be cleaned under running water. Do not use detergents or bleach. R emove the outer leaves of leafy vegetables such as lettuce and cabbage before washing. R emoving soil from produce with firm skin such as potatoes may require scrubbing with a vegetable brush while rinsing under clean running water. DRY AFTER C LEANING. F ruits and vegetables should be dried with a clean paper towel before cooking or eating. AVOID CROSS-C ONTAM INATION. Keep produce separate from raw foods such as meat, poultry and seafood in your shopping cart, grocery bags and refrigerator. T hrow away any produce that will not be cooked if it has touched raw meat, poultry, seafood or eggs. Made with Organic Ingredients. At least 70 percent of the product must be USDA certified organic. These products do not bear the USDA Organic seal, but they may state \"Made with Organics\" and name up to three organic ingredients that were used. BEYON D PRODUCE Hy-Vee HealthMarket dairy cases stock organic yogurt, milk and cheeses. It's also easy to find organic soy milk and rice milk, as well as cereal and breakfast bars. Pick up organic meats, including ground beef and chicken, in the HealthMarket. There 's even a growing selection of organic wines. Bulk food sections in some Hy-Vee stores may include many organic options, from roasted sunflowers and popcorn to basmati rice, quinoa and almonds. Organic free-range chicken broth and marinara sauce are just a few prepared foods that fill the shelves. Organic laundry supplies and body care products are also available. Because \"all natural\" and organic items mingle on Hy-Vee shelves, check labels carefully. Adding organics to your life promotes good health, reduces exposure to toxins and treats the environment gently. It' s an easy change\u2014and the pay-offs are all positive.

WORDS Maria Giord PHOT OS Tobin Bennett SEASONS | Health 2014 66 66-69 Pharmacy_bp.indd 66 12/2/13 1:18 PMHy-Vee pharmacists are ready to help you fight off the common cold, the flu or other health challenges this season. Turn to these professionals for your prescriptions and knowledgeable advice about over-the-counter (OTC) drugs that might ease your symptoms. OTC AND GENERI C From a decongestant to cough drops to nasal spray, Hy-Vee brand OTC products offer you cost savings in your quest to overcome illness, says Hy-Vee Pharmacy manager Lisa Linder in West Des Moines. \"There are a lot of different over-the-counter medications that target different symptoms,\" Lisa says. \"Check with the pharmacist about which one is best for your symptoms. An example is a runny nose. There are good antihistamines on the shelves. But if you have nasal congestion, you're better off with one of the decongestants that's kept behind the counter and you have to sign for.\" When ordering prescriptions, ask about the generic medications Hy-Vee offers for $4 for a 30-day supply or $10 for a 90-day supply. With hundreds of generics available, you can save money while receiving expert guidance from your local Hy-Vee pharmacists. COLD OR FLU? A cold is a mild respiratory illness. Symptoms usually begin with a sore throat that goes away after a day or two. Congestion and runny nose follow, along with a cough developing a few days later. Low-grade fevers are another common symptom. With a cold, you can feel sick for a few days, and you generally improve each day. Flu symptoms are usually more severe and come on quickly, hitting full force within two to three hours. You may have a sore throat, fever, headache, muscle aches and soreness, congestion and cough. With the flu, it's not uncommon to feel quite ill and run-down for a number of days or even weeks. MAYBE YOUR CHILD CAM E HOM E FROM SCHOOL LOOKING FEVERISH AND PALE.

DRUG INTERACTIONS Reduce your risk of harmful medication errors and drug interactions by communicating closely with your doctor and pharmacist. Take an ask-and-tell approach to your medications: Ask your local Hy-Vee pharmacist about potential drug interactions before you take any new medicine, and be sure to tell him or her about all other medications and herbal supplements you use before you take a new OTC or prescription drug. Pharmacists at Hy-Vee can advise you on medication safety. EXPRESS REFILLS ONLINE Hy-Vee's online express features make it quick and simple to refill, check status and transfer prescriptions.

Fortunately, there are many tools available for your cleaning tasks. These range from environmentally benign all-purpose cleansers formulated with gentle ingredients to chemical cleansers labeled with strongly worded safety warnings. Some jobs require more power than others. If killing bacteria or viruses is the goal, look for products labeled as either \"disinfectant\" or \"antimicrobial.\" These solutions destroy all germs, according to the American Cleaning Institute. Products called santizers are good, too, and kill more than 99 percent of germs. Read labels very closely when purchasing cleaning products. Because some are harsh, follow all manufacturer recommendations. Most accidents occur because of improper handling, use or storage. Mixing up your own nontoxic cleaners is another choice. These use vinegar, baking soda and other nontoxic ingredients recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency. For a few cleaners you can make, see the chart, opposite.

PLANNING Singles. Couples. Families. Empty nesters. Perhaps you've gone through a lifestyle change and it's time to rethink your approach to menu planning. Not long ago, you were setting out dinner for five and now it's just the two of you. Or perhaps you are living alone for the first time and figuring out how to cook for one. If you feel like you're spinning your wheels in coming up with the next meal, you're not alone. Make a smooth transition with the timesaving tricks below, which will help you double the efficiency of your shopping and kitchen duties. You'll enjoy delicious meals with less effort, giving you more time to reflect on the day or bond with family at the table. SINGLES...SOLO COOKING AND DINING Most singles say it's a challenge to shop and cook for one. Recipes are usually designed for four or more people. We buy bread in sizable loaves, cereal in large boxes and eggs by the dozen. On the other hand, frozen entr\u00e9es, yogurt and some frozen desserts are available in single servings. Fresh, ready-to-eat produce at the salad bar offers another way of buying just the amount needed for a meal or two. Canned soup is an easy meal for one. Find soups you like and keep some in your pantry. Then embellish soups by adding frozen or fresh veggies, or topping with green onions, low-fat sour cream or freshly shredded Parmesan cheese. When purchasing bread, rolls or sandwich buns, take out what you need for the next few days and freeze the rest. The freezer also keeps frozen fruit handy to pair with yogurt for a last-minute smoothie. Pasta is a perfect entr\u00e9e for singles. If you use fresh-packaged tortellini or ravioli, boil what you need and freeze the rest. Another option is to make two servings and have the leftovers for lunch the next day. Cold pasta salad makes a lovely lunch, or you can microwave leftover pasta for a hot meal. For easy sauces, try bottled marinara, store-bought pesto or just a drizzle of flavored olive oil and some shredded Parmesan. Tossing a dinner salad is quick and can be quite nutritious. Buy a bag of mixed greens and add one or more of the following: fresh or dried fruit, roasted nuts, ready-to-go veggies, canned and rinsed beans, or presliced, shredded or cubed cheese. If desired, include cooked shrimp, or sliced turkey or roast beef from your Hy-Vee deli. Use a light salad dressing or drizzle olive oil and balsamic vinegar over the top. NEWLYWEDS...TILL DINNER DO US PART The first years of married life often coincide with hard-charging years in a career. But at the end of each workday, the best is yet to come. Take the time to talk, laugh, cook and dine together into the evening and you'll nourish each other in so many ways. When preparing food for two, consider halving recipes that yield four to six servings or freeze leftovers. You'll appreciate having a home-cooked meal ready to quickly reheat in the microwave. However, should you run into a good buy on meat, poultry or fish, make the purchase. Divide what you buy into perfect-for-two portions and freeze any meat you won't use within the next two days. Your freezer can also store extra bread or loose-pack vegetables. That way, you can use just what you need and return the rest to the freezer.

Always label food with the date it was frozen. When cooking for two, use smaller-size saucepans and skillets to keep the food from cooking too quickly and burning. FAMILIES...ON THE GO Rushing between work and school often leaves parents scrambling for time to prepare nutritious, good-tasting meals for their families. But good-for-everyone meals are possible, no matter how much or how little time you have. Pull out a variety of recipes\u2014soups, salads, sandwiches, casseroles, skillet meals and whatever your family prefers. Choose recipes that utilize a timesaving appliance, such as a slow cooker or grill. One night have a slow-cooked stew; another night, a 20-minute stir-fry. Oven-roasting meats is a great habit to get into on weekends. During the week, use the leftovers in sandwiches, on top of pizza or as a flavorful addition to a spaghetti sauce. There are dozens of other ways to whip up quick meals with leftover roasts. Pasta, eggs and potatoes are versatile foods for quick meals. Set up a baked potato bar with toppers so family members can assemble their own. Omelets are also great for dinner. You can poach, fry or scramble eggs to add to salads, stir-fries and even sandwiches. Pastas will pair with just about anything you have on hand, including sauce, fresh produce and cheese. Toss cooked, cooled pasta with leftover meats and vegetables and your favorite dressing for a main-dish salad. EMPTY NESTERS...SIMPLIFYING One would think that after the last child goes to college or moves out, mealtime would become less stressful. In truth, cooking for two\u2014or one\u2014sometimes is just as trying as cooking for a crowd. Still, the transition needn't be rough, you just need a new rhythm for cooking and shopping. You can enjoy many of the same foods you enjoyed as a family. Pull out a few of your favorites and pare them down to serve one or two. You'll find that many recipes are highly flexible. Reducing a recipe may mean adjusting the cooking time, though not usually the temperature. For example, a mini meat loaf might be done 10 to 15 minutes sooner than a meat loaf cooked in a regular-size loaf pan, but both will likely cook in a 350\u00b0F oven. When meat or poultry are the main ingredient, there are multiple ways to cook without the new dish resembling leftovers. Top grilled steaks or chicken breasts with a sauce one night, then use them in salads, pasta or quesadillas on other nights. Stash extras in the freezer. Freeze meat in individual portions. If you made a half batch of turkey chili and still have leftovers, freeze the extras in pint-size containers for easy defrosting. You'll feel good knowing you have another meal ready to go. Shop the Hy-Vee salad bar for smaller amounts of salad greens, fruits and veggies. Also, use this new life stage to try dishes and cuisines you haven't tasted in a while because of the picky palates of your children. SEASONS | hy-vee.com 73 70-75 Solutions LO.indd 73 12/2/13 1:21 PMSOLUTIONS: MAKING MENUS 6 STEPS TO MEAL PLANNING 1. PLAN A WEEK'S WORTH OF MEALS. Create a master list of meals that your family enjoys and include a few new recipes from your favorite cookbooks, magazines or online sources. Go for simple recipes that fit your time frame. At least one recipe should yield leftovers that can be used in other meals. For example, roast a chicken on Sunday and use leftovers for chicken tacos later in the week. 2. MAKE A SHOPPING LIST. Check your pantry and fridge for ingredients you already have on hand. Create a shopping list categorized by sections at the store to help cut down on shopping time and to ensure you won't forget anything. 3. PREP IN ADVANCE. Go through the list of meals that you've chosen for the week and set aside an hour or two to do some of the prep work. This can also be turned into a family session where everyone participates. Clean and prep vegetables, and chop onions and herbs. Store all these ingredients in the fridge or freezer until needed. 4. INVEST IN A SLOW COOKER. A slow cooker allows for easy prep when you have less time than usual. In many instances, your slow cooker is great for the \"cook once, eat twice\" mealtime strategy. Cooking a large roast one day cuts your work in half another day, when you can toss leftovers with pasta and a simple sauce. 5. THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX. Instead of the usual meatballs and spaghetti, incorporate salads and sandwiches or even traditional breakfast options like scrambled eggs and whole wheat pancakes. Serve with fruit and yogurt smoothies for the added nutrients. 6. LOVE THOSE LEFTOVERS. You can create a range of dishes by adding fresh ingredients to leftover foods. Try tossing lightly cooked green vegetables with fresh salad veggies and vinegar to create a light salad. Stewed or oven-roasted vegetables puree nicely in a food processor to use as a sauce base for a meat or pasta dish. Cooked rice and other grains can easily be incorporated into stir-fries, stews or even grain-and-vegetable burgers.
