Like the ironically named genre itself, the show was, by all accounts (except for the official \"kayfabe\" one), varying degrees of \"staged outrage and drama\". I don't remember the show being too \"poverty porn\" as a result, but it did pave the way for later reality TV shows that were quite exploitative.

Article about on Robert Plomin[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive436&action=edit\u00a7ion=4)] I am trying to get the factually incorrect, possible-parody article [Robert Plomin](/wiki/Robert_Plomin) deleted. It says things like Plomin is a crypto-white nationalist, and evidences this by talking about how he believes in genetic links to intelligence. Yet this is the mainstream scientific view, most think that IQ is around 80% heritable in adulthood. Here is a good article, written to debunk race realists, written by some distinguished scientists in 2017. [https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/5/18/15655638/charles-murray-race-iq-sam-harris-science-free-speech](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/5/18/15655638/charles-murray-race-iq-sam-harris-science-free-speech) It shows the fallacies in race realism, yet affirms that IQ is mainly heritable in adulthood. Additionally, years before that, Plomin said \"No, they are not right. Individual differences in IQ can be highly hereditary; at the same time, the difference between migrants and natives can be entirely due to the environment. For example, because of their origin, migrants only get bad jobs, they attend worse schools and are discriminated against in other ways.\" [https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/there-is-no-nature-nurture-war/](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/there-is-no-nature-nurture-war/) \"Robert Plomin is a legend. For over 40 years he has been on the forefront of our understanding of the genetic and environmental influences on human behavior. \". The article is basically saying that a mainstream scientific view is crypto white nationalism and was very likely written by a troll intending to make RW look incredulous and ridiculous. He is president of the BGA, recieved the 2017 American Psychological Association award for Distinguished Scientific contributions, was ranked the 71st most eminent psychologist in the history of science, and is a fellow of the FBA the UK's national academy for social sciences. He also was awarded the William James Fellow award by the Association for Psychological Science and the Lifetitme Achievement Award of the ISIR. He is also MRC Research Professor in Behavioural Genetics at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London. He is not a white nationalist or a eugenicist or any of these things. What he has said is merely the mainstream science on intelligence, as well as behavioral genetics. None of it has anything to do with race or white nationalism. A brief overview of the article's author's account shows a lot of suspicious contributions, I suspect a troll. \"Plomin argues that differences in intelligence and academic outcomes are caused by differences in genetic ability \u2014 a standard white nationalist claim.[\" It's not a white nationalist claim, the predictive power of psychometric G is one of the most replicable things in the field of psychology. Secondly, research on the heritability of IQ is very high-powered and replicable.

Whether or not he's right on his heritability estimates or not, is simply an unrelated matter. He may \"overemphasize\" the importance of genetics (or he might not, its disputed for a reason: we are trying to use mainly indirect methods to find links between highly-polygenic \"complex traits\", that have many confounders and interactions, so of course there will be a lot of disagreement on this subject). But regardless, it's unrelated to race and he isn't a white nationalist or \"scientific racist\", he certainly isn't alt right as the article had him categorized at one point. As to the \"Mainstream Science on Intelligence\" thing from 1994, the impression I got from that was \"There is no definitive answer to why IQ bell curves differ across racial-ethnic groups.\" which is a direct quote from that piece. What I do know is that Plomin has repeatedly said that IQ differences between ethnic groups are not necessarily due to any genetic factors, and that discrimination and socio-economic status could explain it. Even the Bell Curve itself does not say that \"racial gaps in IQ are caused by genetic factors\", the book itself took an agnostic position and the final chapter says to paraphrase \"if I have convinced you that the gap is genetic or environmental beyond a doubt, then I have failed in writing this book\". Murray himself has from what I've heard taken a more hereditarian position in the years since then, but I never interpreted it as some kind of white nationalist or alt right book. Herrnstein co-authored it, he was the chairman of the Harvard Psychology Department. Regardless, Plomin did not endorse the Bell Curve as far as I know in any matter. When I took his classes the subject of racial hereditarian only came up twice and he gave more or less the same answer, that there isn't really any proof and it could be explained by environmental factors. [2603:9001:300:81A:2933:D4A0:6B94:2028](/wiki/Special:Contributions/2603:9001:300:81A:2933:D4A0:6B94:2028)( [talk](/w/index.php?title=User_talk:2603:9001:300:81A:2933:D4A0:6B94:2028&action=edit&redlink=1)) 22:30, 29 April 2023 (UTC) - Any article here would focus on any crank views due to RW's mission. I think \" [genetic determinism](/wiki/Biological_determinism)\" is a fair claim to examine whether it applies to Plomin ( [other critics have done so](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06784-5)). I don't see evidence that he was a white nationalist, though a blog by [Leonid Schneider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Schneider) [made a claim](https://forbetterscience.com/2020/06/03/i-am-not-a-racist-but/)that he was tolerant of more questionable peers like [Arthur Jensen](/wiki/Arthur_Jensen)(a claim I have not been able to verify). Still, even this is not the same as more overtly white nationalist race geneticists. - So while an article could be done on him, I do agree that the article is poor quality, makes too many unsourced and over-assumed claims, and probably IMHO shouldn't be a priority subject for RW anyways (meaning I'm not going to edit it into anything salvageable). The talk page seems to suggest that AfD has been brought up before. If no one is willing to edit this into something better, I'd support an AfD personally.

I checked the author's previous contributions and it seems like he might have been trolling the site, something someone else in the AFD talk page agreed with. The article is a bizarre stub that makes what I see as bizarre unfounded claims, possibly written by a troll.

Your personal connection to the subject is noted; sometimes we don't know the people we respect as well as we think, however. Anyhow his article could be better articulated and probably provide a fuller description of his work. I changed the page to describe him as [Hereditarian](/wiki/Hereditarian)rather than white nationalist which seems more accurate, though many would say the difference between the two is not much. Albeit there's the whole \"left Hereditarian\" branding the Bell Curve authors like to use. [Chillpilled](/wiki/User:Chillpilled)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Chillpilled)) 20:41, 30 April 2023 (UTC) - Hereditarian can easily drift into white nationalism but I don't make that assumption immediately. I wouldn't call the [Bell Curve](/wiki/The_Bell_Curve)book white nationalist, for instance (even though it has been used by white nationalists); it is, however, very [elitist](/wiki/Elitist)in its balderdash conclusions and (from my perspective) a [pseudoscience](/wiki/Pseudoscience)exercise and excuse for a bunch of [ruling class](/wiki/Ruling_class)(or wannabe) \"got mine\" [libertarians](/wiki/Libertarians)to self-justify the type of elitist social positions you find in the [American Enterprise Institute](/wiki/American_Enterprise_Institute)domain. Strictly working in the American social space, of course. - I wouldn't agree that it could easily drift into white nationalism. And although many white nationalists believe in a genetic influence to traits, this doesn't mean that hereditarianism is somehow white nationalist. Simply because a general heritability score tells us nothing about between-group heritability. The heritability of IQ could be 80% yet the black-white difference could be 0%. That's an error that some white nationalists make however. If the environment is different for black people, or if there is some kind of statistical interactionism going on (not to be confused with other definitions of interactionism) then how would you extrapolate a general heritability onto race differences? The heritability estimates are different between countries, even between USA and Europe (presumably because Europe is a more socially democratic society and ensures better access to resources to everyone, or perhaps some other reason). In fact on the issue of intelligence most researchers would be \"hereditarian\" in that they believe in a first-world country that differences in intelligence would be largely heritable. 60%, and approaching 80% in adulthood (the Wilson effect). Obviously intelligence is only a single trait, many other traits exhibiting large differences probably have those differences mainly caused by environmental factors. In fact, we know that's the case. But as Turkheimer (no friend of race realists and self-described as part of \"the radical scientific left\") would say, the 1st law of behavioral genetics is that all human behavioral traitsare heritable. The second law is that \"The effect of being raised in the same family is smaller than the effect of the genes.\", but the third law is \"A substantial portion of the variation in complex human behavioural traits is not accounted for by the effects of genes or families\" and his own studies have shown \"environment accounted for about 60% of the variance in IQ among low-income children, while genes accounted for almost none of it. In contrast, this study also found that the reverse was true for wealthy children.\" So even if POC have the same genotypic IQ, the genes won't be able to express themselves if they live in deprived environments. In conclusion, if Plomin is a \"hereditarian\" then depending on how you define hereditarian that's not a fringe thing. If you are defining it as someone who believes behavioral traits are significantly heritable, then that's basic stuff and has been empirically demonstrated for decades. If it means he believes it's more heritable than not, then he's still right and isn't going off track. If it means that he believes that the significant majority of the difference is attributable to differences in genes, then he is again right in IQ if he is referring to adults in an equal environment (this still has nothing to do with race or country, as we know different races face different environmental factors, such as poverty and racism, which even Plomin said and which I quoted him saying earlier). That being said, I will acknowledge that Plomin in general ascribes higher heritability to most traits across the board than most people would, but theres also people that would ascribe much lower heritability and are also in good standing. I wouldn't call either of those \"pseudoscientists\" or attribute some crypto socio-political motivations. There is always difference in opinion between experts in any field, and Plomin's conclusions are not untestable/pseudoscientific. It falls within the standard range of disagreement. PS: heritability doesnt mean \"caused by genes\", i.e. if IQ is 80% heritable it doesn't mean the IQ is caused 80% by genes.

That being said, I actually would be curious if Plomin's work has \"culture tells\". The Bell Curve for instance heavily relies on American paradigms and tropes, as if no other country exists in the world; this is an immediate disqualification for any broad generalization of the human condition.

Part of why Bud Light struck a deal with a trans influencer on TikTok (at least according to what I've seen in public statements by ABev folks [[4]](https://www.vox.com/money/2023/4/12/23680135/bud-light-boycott-dylan-mulvaney-travis-tritt-trans)) is probably because of this. In America at least people increasingly have more to chose from, and increasingly (especially among younger folks) people are not choosing watery mass produced light beer. If they drink alcohol, there's on one hand a \"premiumization\" trend (where people drink less, but drink more premium and/or local community produced spirits, beers, and wine), and on the other hand the rise of Zima reborn!\"hard seltzers\" for those who want a lighter way to get their \"buzz\". Cannabis lounges are now a thing where legal, as are kava and kratom bars. It's not like the saloon with interchangeable light beer taps is the only game in town anymore. - The VP of marketing for Bud Light said that the beer has a \"we do not attract young people\" problem (as well as a \"white male fratty\" image), both of which I agree with, and which I think the \"negative reaction\" to the trans influencer reinforced (I mean, c'mon, Kid Rock getting pissed at Bud Light, what's more old fart and white-boy fratty then Kid Rock?). In this case, you have to either ride your niche (even if it's in decline) or pivot. Myself, I think if I were in charge of Bud Light marketing (eek!), I'd \"ride the niche\" as I don't think Bud Light's problems are fixable with crass marketing, and Bud Light still is a very big name in the world of beers.

There's no reason to chase after young and trendy all the time from my perspective. (It's not like all young'uns don't drink Bud Light, anyways, and like I said, Bud Light is still big.) If you do chase after the young and trendy, you use new branding, I would think (eg it's Truly, not \"Samuel Adams seltzer\").

'Phobes just didn't visit those places back then so they didn't notice, so one could quietly market to segments that didn't like each other with less issue.

It's why all over the Anglosphere, the 'best selling' lagers are almost invaribly the ones which are also rated worst [and 'Big Beer' has ruined many of the old Euro brands by 'ironing out' the taste notes, though not as harshly as the American ones] - the people who do the ratings are to some extent 'beer snobs' who like lagers to taste like, well lager.

They fully got that the product has become too closely ID'd in the public perception with a 'stereotypical customer' image which was a shrinking demographic, and desired to widen that appeal. What they didn't anticipate was just how bitchy/touchy some of that traditional 'core customer' group could be, because they have become so identified with it - a process termed 'brand betrayal'. Chances are, you have all felt this at least once; a classic example being when a brand renowned for quality declines in that. Should the execs have seen this coming? Perhaps; whenever you decide to do a 'shift', you need to carry your existing customer base with you. I think the execs again, knew this but were thinking in 'silo fashion'; ie they thought the 'Kid Rock' people wouldn't notice the 'Dylan Mulvaney' ones, which is not stupid when you consider Corp America has been doing this 'segmentation' in the USA since the 60s [classically with African-Americans].

If you're drinking 6 beers a day, going from a 150 calorie beer to a 100 calorie scented-vodka-water means 300 fewer calories. That might not seem like a lot, but the human body will grow/shrink until the increased/decreased metabolic rate of fat/muscle eliminates the calorie deficit/surplus, which actually comes out to 100-150 lbs of extra bodyweight. Less if you are active and the weight causes you to use more energy to do things like walking, of course. As far as marketing it to women as a \"diet beer\", perhaps there's sexism involved... except that the vast majority of women are trying to lose weight. [Correkt](/wiki/User:CorruptUser) [(talk)](/wiki/User_talk:CorruptUser)13:47, 26 April 2023 (UTC) - Quite a lot of alcoholics I've known/seen aren't obese; they are in fact relatively 'normal' sizes or even thin - quite a lot simply don't eat much, which evens out the calorific ratings of booze. They are also much more likely to smoke too [some stats I've seen as high as 90%, when the Anglo 'baseline' is between 12%/20%] which takes the edge off hunger too. Lastly, don't mistake the swollen 'beer belly' being all fat, either [some is stomach bloating, from the yeast fermentation]. Non-alcoholic drinkers, however I would hazard would be more likely to be overweight because of the 'invisible' calories being consumed. As for the last point... it's a well-known fact that most 'diet' products etc have traditionally assumed their target was women. It's only relatively recently where that view has started to shift.

Probably some Internet hotheads would see those ads as \" - I suspect you and I are using different definitions of 'alcoholic'. I don't class simple 'heavy drinkers' as alcoholics, I use it as a term signifying 'dependence on alcohol'. - Quite a lot of alcoholics I've known/seen aren't obese; they are in fact relatively 'normal' sizes or even thin - quite a lot simply don't eat much, which evens out the calorific ratings of booze. They are also much more likely to smoke too [some stats I've seen as high as 90%, when the Anglo 'baseline' is between 12%/20%] which takes the edge off hunger too. Lastly, don't mistake the swollen 'beer belly' being all fat, either [some is stomach bloating, from the yeast fermentation]. Non-alcoholic drinkers, however I would hazard would be more likely to be overweight because of the 'invisible' calories being consumed. As for the last point... it's a well-known fact that most 'diet' products etc have traditionally assumed their target was women. It's only relatively recently where that view has started to shift. - Alcoholics are obese for a reason; every standard drink contains ~100 calories from the ethanol alone. If you're drinking 6 beers a day, going from a 150 calorie beer to a 100 calorie scented-vodka-water means 300 fewer calories. That might not seem like a lot, but the human body will grow/shrink until the increased/decreased metabolic rate of fat/muscle eliminates the calorie deficit/surplus, which actually comes out to 100-150 lbs of extra bodyweight. Less if you are active and the weight causes you to use more energy to do things like walking, of course. As far as marketing it to women as a \"diet beer\", perhaps there's sexism involved... except that the vast majority of women are trying to lose weight. - I do feel sorry for those execs, though. They fully got that the product has become too closely ID'd in the public perception with a 'stereotypical customer' image which was a shrinking demographic, and desired to widen that appeal. What they didn't anticipate was just how bitchy/touchy some of that traditional 'core customer' group could be, because they have become so identified with it - a process termed 'brand betrayal'. Chances are, you have all felt this at least once; a classic example being when a brand renowned for quality declines in that. Should the execs have seen this coming? Perhaps; whenever you decide to do a 'shift', you need to carry your existing customer base with you. I think the execs again, knew this but were thinking in 'silo fashion'; ie they thought the 'Kid Rock' people wouldn't notice the 'Dylan Mulvaney' ones, which is not stupid when you consider Corp America has been doing this 'segmentation' in the USA since the 60s [classically with African-Americans]. In this case, they failed to appreciate just how god-damn desperate the fascisty loons are to find fuel for the culture wars flames. [https://beveragebeaver.com/when-did-bud-light-come-out-and-why-explained/](https://beveragebeaver.com/when-did-bud-light-come-out-and-why-explained/) With my marketing hat on for a moment, I would also note that [as you point out] 'regular' Budweiser was already strongly marketed/associated with blue-collar masculinity by the late 70s. Thus... I can either try to 'pivot' this brand to make it more 'female-neutral' or I can launch a new beer which is less 'masculine'. For the female drinker was very poorly considered/served market at this point, even though stats always showed there was some female beer drinkers. Let's remember that by this point, I'd guess the average American male was close to saturation point with beer, esp as this was the point the public/police/businesses started seeing excess drinking as an issue. I also suspect that the decline of 'out of home consumption' [ie bars] and then the rise of big-box grocers had their part to play too; women were more likely to be in charge of the grocery shop and thus, could be pitched directly to via point-of-sale advertising etc [And didn't require a trip to either Moe's Tavern or some seedy liquor store]. [KarmaPolice](/wiki/User:KarmaPolice) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:KarmaPolice)) 18:15, 26 April 2023 (UTC) - As an aside, it's interesting how the status drink can change. As far back as 1751 Beer Street and Gin Lane made it very clear which was the beverage of \"high society\", which stuck for a long time. But by the 1950s, it was the working class (mostly) men who had beer after work while the businessmen had three martini lunches (albeit a martini was a 2 oz drink and not the 3 oz drink we think of today, hence the Vesper requiring a champagne coupe; most of what we call martini glasses today are actually cocktail glasses). Now we have much better craft beer, so even though there's an overall decline in beer consumption it's gotten onto somewhat better footing.

The US joined the Great War on the side of Britain, so there was a collective \"fuck the Germans\" going on, and maybe an occasional \"fuck the Irish\", which is why the 18th amendment happened when it did. Effectively, the breweries died. Then the US decided they needed to get drink away their great depression, and legalized alcohol again, but seeing as there was a depression and then a war, nothing but the simplest/cheapest swill was produced. So the working man took to the garbage beer. And in the 80's, the craft breweries finally began making a return. [Correkt](/wiki/User:CorruptUser) [(talk)](/wiki/User_talk:CorruptUser)05:29, 29 April 2023 (UTC) - That's part of it (the US brewing industry was heavily German influenced before Prohibition, and the variety you got before Prohibition was more Germanic in nature, e.g. Munich lagers and bocks weren't uncommon). From what I remember, Prohibition heavily tilted American consumption towards liquor, in accordance with what some researchers have dubbed the \" [iron law of prohibition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iron_law_of_prohibition)\". Simply put, it is more difficult to transport weaker alcoholic beverages like beer into illicit bars. So the \"commercial market\" during that time dramatically shifted towards liquor. Beer breweries of course were largely decimated. - After Prohibition, another factor also happened: consolidation. Those breweries that survived after Prohibition started disappearing as giant Big Breweries gobbled up any of the more interesting regional competition, and pivoted any interesting recipes towards the same generic watery product. (Reportedly an old departed Newark beer called Ballantine IPA, which from all I've heard actually bears some similarities to modern craft IPAs even though it was brewed long before \"craft beer\" was a thing, is a great example; it got acquired by Falstaff, then Pabst, and as time went on, the hops and ABV became weaker.) So by the early 1980s, except for a handful of exceptions (like Anchor Steam), the market was dominated by light adjunct lager, which was generic enough where even generic \"beer\" cans were a thing. However, this over-consolidated genericness was perfect for something with taste to make its way on the market. Since the craft brew industry was fueled by \"tinkerers\" (read: homebrewers), it also allowed for a whole smorgasbord of far more interesting beers to be produced. Not all experiments were successful, of course, but on the whole, American beer became much better, and at minimum caters to far more tastes (I'm one who will happily drink an IPA but, if offered a light lager, would skip it in favor of the glass of water).

And part of what makes breweries attractive to localities is the ease with which they can fit in various places. My native Connecticut is full of abandoned factories and train depots, and those are perfect for retrofitting into breweries; even better when you can serve it on site, since they have plenty of space for a good taproom. But they can also fit into smaller areas too, and having one in a strip mall is a much better image than having an empty storefront. And in some places it just gives people something to do after 5 PM, so it makes for an an easy collaboration with some nearby restaurant(s) where everyone wins.

However, Prohibition itself was the severe damage to the industry; most of the smaller players left the business forever and there would have been a lot of loss of talent too. What's more, most which survived would have been the major players, with much better access to credit and capital. What's more, while Federal Prohibition ended in 1933, local alcohol controls still could [and did exist] and quite a lot put punative controls on booze which was over [normally] 3.8% ABV. Thus, encouraging weaker lagers [I don't understand exactly why, but low-alcohol ale doesn't really seem a thing until very recently]. Also, the 'Prohibitionists' still dominated in many individual states, and I'll be shocked if they didn't continue 'the good fight' by doing harrassment tactics on professional brewers to the extent it was de facto illegal to operate in that area [like the pro-bump crowd later on have done with abortion clinics]. - All true.

So the working man took to the garbage beer. And in the 80's, the craft breweries finally began making a return. - I believe the other main fillip to American 'Big Beer' was WW2. The Germans/Italians cut off most of America's supply of wine and several spirits [such as vermouth], the UK was far too stretched to continue exporting her Scotches and cask ales and the Irish whiskey industry basically starved to death as it couldn't get the kit, fuel or grains. So, much of the field was 'to themselves'. What's more, the massive supply contracts the American military offered was biased towards 'Big Beer' [it normally is biased towards anything Big, as they're the only ones who have the bandwidth to supply them] and what's more, often they were 'big enough' to be able to screw sufficient inputs out of the ration boards etc so they could actually continue to operate. Lastly, we have to remember that many a million of American male was in uniform, and for many younger person would have been their first proper introduction to Big Beer's products. - Talk about a win-win situation; exiting WW2 with lots of money, expanded plant and millions of Americans familiar with your products for a sector which is known to be fairly brand-loyal.

However words without action are meaningless, she should spend her life undoing the damage she did her whole life. It's okay to love you're family while still believing they're bad people, and it's okay, sometimes necessary to cut them off if they are truly evil like Mussolini, but her embrace of far right politics is something truly despicable, and use your ancestors clout to advocate the same evil they did makes two peas in a pod, no better. How can you be disgusted at Mussolini's capital punishment when you're not disgusted at the victims he killed, tortured, oppressed, raped, and humiliated, and embrace the far right opportunistic politics he embraced. On the other hand, she is making the first step towards redemption, and even if she can't be redeemed, doing good is good for its own sake, regardless of anyone forgiving or not, as long as it's not hollow or in vain or for show or for your own advantage. Hell if you forget your redemption and focus on their good for its own sake (as long as you understand what good is, and that's a whole other debate) then redemption will come naturally and even if it doesn't, maybe you don't deserve it. As you did good, that's not all that matters and if doesn't cancel you're evil or you're (healthily, as in you earned it or they came to that forgiveness independently ) forgiven, it's not redemption it's different but it's something. And remember I'm talking about specifically the case of the granddaughter of Mussolini, sometimes you're just an evil fuckwit. Take Hitler and Ted Bundy, for instance. One problem is she needs to realize how far right politics led to her grandfathers rise to power which lead to the aforementioned evil which was the above tip of the iceberg evil he did, and how he literally inspired Hitler and was a holocaust perpetrator. She needs to show that's moved beyond far right politics and needs to show accountability for her and since she's defending her grandfather, her whole life, and she has fortune, fame, and political clout from her the name and lineage of her grandfather robbing his country dry in the process of creating a totalitarian state and cult of personality based on him and his ideas, she probably take accountability for him too. Please critique this opinion if it is wrong, otherwise I don't learn. I don't have a good filter and I have poor mental hygiene.

So it's either a terribly embarrassing failure of an effort to beef up security, or evidence that it was a false flag attack because it's so unlikely that such a crude attack would make it past all defenses. ISW's take is the latter, but some argue the former. A commentator I watched said Russia seemed to have such a ready-made media response it suggested it was planned by the Kremlin. - It could be part of a plan for Russia to motivate a weary population and drum-up support for intensifying mobilization and more. But it also makes Russia look vulnerable and inept in a way undesirable to the Kremlin. They may have decided that the latter was worth it.

Right now I just want a way to move past it. I'm tired of it being at the front of my mind all the time. The issue I'm having is that I've gotten it into my head that I read a post on Quora that proved that it was true. The issue is that I don't remember anything about the post: content, name of user, or the question. All I have is a feeling when I remember the day that I read it. I try to tell myself that I only remember that day because it was Halloween (and not some random day), the day before I had essentially ruined the engine in my car and had to tell my parents (so I was bummed out the whole day), so I try to tell myself that that is why that day sticks out not because someone proved it true. But it doesn't work. I even did a google search for proof of it or proving it true (I know the irony behind it but I had to do it) and found nothing. Nothing came up for proof of it, not one paper. Nothing to corroborate it, if it were able to be proven at least ONE other person would have. But it still wouldn't get out of my head because my brain would insist the dude proved it true (despite remembering nothing of what I read that day and only having a powerful feeling). I'm even asked how it is unprovable (and I know it is because you can't get outside your perception of the world so it's unsolvable) and even after reading responses as to how nothing sticks. I even tried searching Quora for that damn thing one day and got nothing, but with no memory of anything about the post that sounds like an impossible task. I checked nearly every post about solipsism and didn't find it. It feels like my brain won't let go unless I find the post but that's not gonna happen because I remember nothing about it. I've tried everything to let this go because I don't want to regard others as figments, I don't want to feel this barrier between me and the world around me. But I don't know what else to try. No matter what logic or evidence I gather that I am wrong my mind won't let go. The more I try to show that I am wrong the stronger the insistence that I am right becomes, it's like I can't win. My mind takes the attempts at denying the truth or lying to myself (even though I try to tell myself that is false and the same baloney my brain comes up with to avoid letting things go). I'm not sure what else to do. I need help. I doubt a walk is going to do much of anything for them. I think the point about other people loving you is the difference between a human with a mind saying it and something without feelings saying the same. It's like the character in a dating game saying that they love you but in reality we know it's just a program saying that. The difference seems to be volition behind the act. We give weight to those who choose us and we like to think there is emotion behind the action. If a human with a mind and a p zombie performed the same act to us and said the same things I'm willing to bet we'd value the human and not the zombie. It's not the same thing in either universe, that seems like a surface level analysis. It also sounds like they allegedly found a post that proves nothing else is real, highly doubtful though. But I understand the difference between it being true and not. We can't truly prove someone loves us but it carries greater weight whether we believe they feel the emotions and think about us or not, giving my example about the P zombie. There is a difference between the two and I imagine not being able to tell is painful for some. To be fair I don't really see how someone can really move past it. Calling it dumb never works out and tends to backfire and it really is a philosophical issue that hasn't had a solution in hundreds of years. It's understandable for someone to get stuck on it.

Imagine you were kidnapped by the society of music lovers, knocked unconscious, and you woke up in a hospital bed the following day. Upon waking up you find yourself connected by the kidney to a world famous violinist. It turns out you were the right match and this man needs your kidneys to survive. The doctor states you would have to stay connected to him for 9 months, or he will die. The question becomes, is it okay to disconnect yourself from the violinist? - Assuming you said yes, then it would be inconsistent at the very least not to conclude that abortion under the case of coerced pregnancy is morally permissible. The real point of the argument is that it doesn't matter if the being using your body for survival without your consent can be classed as a person or not. If a stranger is using your body at cost to yourself to sustain themselves, you are more than entitled to refuse them \u2014 regardless of it results in their death. Disagreeing with this premise sets the precedent that it would be okay in society to force random strangers into supporting the life of other random strangers regardless of the personal costs of inconveniences. At the very least if it was not okay to force people into that situation, it would be mandatory to force to stay within that situation. If we reject that then we would have to allow for abortion, or be faced with a logical contradiction in our morals. - [Only Sort of Dumb](/wiki/User:OnlySortaDumb)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:OnlySortaDumb)) - My view: Abortion is honestly a pretty complex moral issue with multiple viewpoints and several factors, and decisions made are largely going to rest on individual decisions concerning the mother and other family members. - Treat unwanted pregnancies like rabies or something.

The victim should \"man up\" and immediately report to the police and be treated ASAP. - This is also reflected by the wide variety of positions on abortion in various religions. No religion embraces abortion with open arms as far as I know, but some (like Judaism) allow much more autonomy to the individual in making the correct moral decision. - Personally, I think European consensus (which tends to be stricter than American liberal movements, but much more permissive than absolutists like Catholicism) is probably the \"best position\" and where a \"cloud of consensus\" of some sort could be formed in a multicultural country: typically, there is a small period (say 12-15 weeks) where abortion on demand is allowed, and then there is an extended period where abortion is allowed in the case of pregnancy complications, rape, and/or risk to health. - Any discussion of abortion morality IMHO should be paired with discussion of the morality of poverty / economic factors and discussion of capitalism's failures in many nations to fully accommodate pregnancy and work / education / etc. These are correctible issues that are a very large factor in why women get voluntary abortions. (Some other major reasons for abortion, like partner issues, are less addressable, but abortion discussion usually end up being shouting matches that never touch root cause.)

Sadly, in this system, there is no way that AFAB people will be treated equally if there's a possibility that they can be effectively out of commission for several months at a time, as businesses would always rather hire someone who they can count on to show up at work any day. Now, it's screwed up that this system treats people like that, and the consequences are really starting to show with things like the lower birth rate and the increase in loneliness in general in developed countries. But still, as long as this system is in place, AFAB people need to have this option to be equal to AMAB people.

In the strict biological sense the zygote is no more or less alive than the gametes that fused before it. If we are speaking of the \"child's life\" then that just pushes the question further on when the cells in question become a \"child\". It seems strange to say a zygote is a child when it is so utterly unlike the prototypical human child. You can say when it becomes a fetus but that doesn't seem so obvious as the likeness isn't as abrupt. At some point the fetus develops into something like a child, but even then it calls into question what makes something a child? Maybe there is a underlying \"potential\" that is most relevant but how does one even demonstrate when that potential is either present or absent? If the fetus can said to be a child because it will eventual become one, then why not say every child is an adult and should have the full rights of adults? - [Only Sort of Dumb](/wiki/User:OnlySortaDumb) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:OnlySortaDumb)) 03:45, 14 April 2023 (UTC) - Except that the gametes are as much a part of mom and dad as any other cell; once the zygote forms, it's not exactly an extreme position to say that it;s a distinct lifeform from the mother. We want it to be part of the mother's body, because that allows us to skip the ethical conundrums of what the value of a human life is. There's really only two ways to allow for abortion if you believe that a fetus is a human life; the first is that there are personal rights greater than the life of someone else, and the second is that not all lives are worth enough to supersede the rights of the mother.

I work with adults who are quite sensibly not given all the legal rights of an average adult, but if someone were to bash in the skull of one of my clients (which is basically how intact dilation and extraction works; it doesn't faze me, when idiots set up \"humane\" mouse traps I use a hammer) said person would quite properly be immediately arrested. The way I can resolve it fits with both points above; to cite an example I absolutely delight in my Down syndrome clients, but you couldn't pay me enough to want to raise one, so for someone incapable of handling that responsibility being able to kill it before becoming an independent human being means at least someone has a better chance at a fulfilling life.

A part of this some people seem to not understand is that genetic defects will still be present, and abortion may well be the best option, especially if the defect is fatal. People that choose to take a pregnancy to term even when the baby won't survive I find incredibly selfish. It requires additional resources to be deployed by hospital staff, and newborns suffer unnecessarily. Abortion is a mercy. But others with disabilities can still live fulfilling lives, especially as technology improves and new prosthetics come online. But an actual investment giving every pregnant person the highest quality of care will reduce some of the preventative disabilities that develop in-utero. Until then though, abortion through the second trimester.

If we say the cutoff is a life-expectancy of less than a year, why not 2 years? Why not 5, 10, 20 or 30 years? - Also, the abortion law presents an interesting legal issue regarding wrongful birth. \"Wrongful birth\" is where you give birth to an unhealthy baby, you would've aborted had you known about the issues beforehand, and the doctors' care was below the standard of care and as a result they failed to warn you, so you need extra money for the care. [So there was a $2.5m judgement against a hospital for an infant born without most of its limbs, that the doctors supposedly failed to catch during an ultrasound](https://medicalmalpracticelawyers.com/florida-appellate-court-overturns-2-5m-wrongful-birth-verdict/). But that was overturned on appeal, because the fetus was just barely into the 3rd trimester at the time; legally, the parents couldn't seek an abortion because Florida Law at the time did not allow for 3rd trimester abortions in cases of fetal impairment. Other states may allow for 3rd trimester abortions for fetal impairment, so it actually does sound like a good case for SCOTUS to rule on. But until then, that's definitely an issue for med-mal lawyers.

These decisions should be made at the whims of the pregnant person and the doctor who both need the best information to proceed. Sometimes this can entail in terminating a pregnancy after 40 weeks (see cryptic pregnancies). Sometimes circumstances drive pregnant people to not seek abortion after 40 weeks which are exacerbated by our draconian laws and hostile healthcare access. If that's the case it should be legal. It comes down to this seeming oxymoron: if you want to limit abortions past 40 weeks, don't limit abortions. --It's-a me, [Lefty](/wiki/User:LeftyGreenMario) [Green](/wiki/User_talk:LeftyGreenMario) [Mario](/wiki/Special:Contributions/LeftyGreenMario)!( [Mod](/wiki/RationalWiki:Moderators)) 22:31, 15 April 2023 (UTC) - The stuff regarding trimesters is actually relevant to the \"sentience\" concern. It's been stated in past literature that the fetuses' capacity to to experience pain develops around the end of the second trimester. Some utilitarian's then argue that abortions for any reason should be permissible before that point, but after that point adequate justification should be provided. The status of the fetus as a person doesn't particularly matter from that utilitarian perspective as many are animal rights advocates who see the the category of \"person\" to have no inherent moral worth. The issue is kind of red herring though. The vast, vast, vast majority of abortions happen before that point and for the rare exceptions that do happen \"late\" almost exclusively happen because of a threat to the pregnant person's health. People who experience pregnancy who wish not to carry the pregnancy to term often do not wait around for the relevant symptoms to become more than apparent.

People who experience pregnancy who wish not to carry the pregnancy to term often do not wait around for the relevant symptoms to become more than apparent. As LGM said though if you want to limit these kinds of abortion the only effective way to do that is (as she said) not to limit abortions. We still shouldn't see it as arbitrary. - - Trimester stuff is arbitrary and not useful concerning the health of the pregnant person. These decisions should be made at the whims of the pregnant person and the doctor who both need the best information to proceed. Sometimes this can entail in terminating a pregnancy after 40 weeks (see cryptic pregnancies). Sometimes circumstances drive pregnant people to not seek abortion after 40 weeks which are exacerbated by our draconian laws and hostile healthcare access. If that's the case it should be legal. It comes down to this seeming oxymoron: if you want to limit abortions past 40 weeks, don't limit abortions. --It's-a me, - Why should there even be a cutoff time? Abortions in the third trimester should still be allowed for any reason. It is not my job to dictate how, why and when women can get abortions. Fetuses, they're not people. They're fetuses that will be people when they pop out of the womb. I'd much rather respect the wishes of the person we KNOW FOR A FACT is a person rather than the \"wishes\" of a \"person\" we can't know is actually a person or not. --- - I seem to have lost the plot here, but I digress. A part of this some people seem to not understand is that genetic defects will still be present, and abortion may well be the best option, especially if the defect is fatal. People that choose to take a pregnancy to term even when the baby won't survive I find incredibly selfish. It requires additional resources to be deployed by hospital staff, and newborns suffer unnecessarily. Abortion is a mercy. But others with disabilities can still live fulfilling lives, especially as technology improves and new prosthetics come online. But an actual investment giving every pregnant person the highest quality of care will reduce some of the preventative disabilities that develop in-utero. Until then though, abortion through the second trimester. - Huh, I can't seem to copy the plunger emoji either. Let's see what I have in the toolbox . - re: this general \"discussion\". I still have my wrench from the last ATIM. Don't make me have to whip out the plunger too. --It's-a me, - From a biological perspective, yes. Kind of like spilled blood, I guess. - \"the sperm in my ejaculate is a part of me\" - Cory 2023. - - In fairness, anyone bashing in the head of one of your clients is almost certainly willing to do the same to you if given the opportunity. Even if we don't value everyone the same, anyone killing the \"less valuable\" just for fun should never see the light of day. - The question belongs to a variety of philosophical questions that are impossible to settle with finality. How can we decide when a fetus is human when we can't clearly say, apart from a resort to biological jargon, what it means to be human? We do decide, as we are a species capable of choosing, however not with a sense of finality. One could say there is a continuity of life so any time period during which abortion is allowed must be arbitrary. One could also say that a developing fetus is not a human life, but rather a potential life. Almost one in three pregnancies end in miscarriage, so it is very likely that a fetus will never become a human being. No argument could possibly convince everyone that either extreme answer is acceptable. A compromise would seem inevitable.

I think if you're going to argue against abortion, you should see why people do it rather than calling them hedonistic whores and baby murderers. Simply put, I think if you can't provide a society that actually cares and aids, not just \"sympathizes for\", CARES AND AIDS the single parent, the poverty-stricken, the rape victim, the medically compromised, and the teenage girl, then anti-Abortion is just a tool to punish those groups for their biology in the name of a potential human who will be forgotten by these abortion activists as soon as it has needs that only society can provide.- [Ryan1257](/wiki/User:Ryan1257)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Ryan1257)) 17:29, 19 April 2023 (UTC) - @CorruptUser Re: the violinist argument, yes, this point is frequently made about the violinist argument, but Thomson's other cases push further, and it is independently fairly simple to modify the violinist argument to do the same. The key case here is perhaps Thomson's \"Henry Fonda\" argument, that (i) Even if the only thing that could save your life is Henry Fonda's touch, you do not have the right to coerce Fonda to fly in from across the country to save you, (ii) Even if Henry Fonda is already standing in the room, you still don't have the right to coerce him to walk the last few feet to save you (according to Thomson, because it is implausible that Fonda nullify whatever right you have to use his body just by running away, so that (ii) follows from (i)). This suggests that you don't have the right to coerce Fonda the last few feet even if he has already flown in from across the country expressly to save your life. Here, the claim is stronger than in the violinist case, because what Fonda has to do is very easy, and he is apparently allowed to withdraw consent to help at the last second. With respect to the violinist case, supposing that one initially agrees to be hooked up to the violinist, if they subsequently change their mind and attempt to disconnect themselves, can they be legitimately (legally) coerced into staying hooked up? It seems to me that this is no more legitimate than dragging into the OR against their will somebody who at one point had agreed to donate an organ (the case is not totally analogous, but the disanalogies make no difference). Perhaps communicating that you'll donate an organ and then reneging on that is ethically censurable, but that is not sufficient to legitimize coercion. [](/wiki/User:Serene) [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Serene)17:17, 21 April 2023 (UTC) - A separate point worth noting for GoSW: as Thomson recognizes, her case for a right to abortion on the grounds of bodily autonomy does not ground a right to ensure the death of the fetus. If the fetus can be removed without killing it, and it has a right to life (as Thomson presupposes), then (barring some concern such as the fetus-saving procedure being otherwise much more dangerous) the fetus' life should be saved, since it will no longer be taking up another's bodily resources in a manner akin to the violinist. Likewise, if you disconnect from the violinist, but they find some other way to save his life, you don't have the right to ensure his death anyway. [](/wiki/User:Serene) [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Serene)17:35, 21 April 2023 (UTC) - Aside from Thomson's argument, there is a substantial philosophical case to be made in favor of abortion even supposing that life begins at conception. To begin, it is not, in general, morally impermissible to kill living things. The canonical example is bacteria, but we also routinely kill molds and other fungi, plants, certain insects, and various parasites, like tapeworms, without inviting ethical condemnation. This extends to human cases as well: cancers are composed of living human tissue, but we routinely make efforts to kill cancer cells, and this is widely agreed to be a morally good thing. In medical settings, brain dead patients are removed from life support (excepting organ donors, who are kept on life support to maintain organ viability) even though it is often technically possible, with modern medical technology, to keep the body alive for significantly more time. So, being alive is not sufficient to make killing morally impermissible, nor is being biologically human. Rather than being alive, then, the typical criterion now appealed to is personhood, a fraught status which is associated with a right to life. The typical argument in favor of abortion is that, as indicated by, among other things, the treatment of brain dead patients, personhood is characterized by some mental capacity or capacities. Since the brain is not developed early in pregnancy, the fetus cannot have the relevant capacity or capacities, and so cannot count as a person. There are some reasons to think this line of reasoning applies even well into the second trimester, to ~22-24 weeks or so. Since the fetus to this point lacks the properties that confer moral patienthood, abortion is permissible even absent independent reasons in favor, because the fetus, not being a person, lacks independent rights or interests. A second, closely related point, is that since the early fetus is not conscious, it is impossible to harm it. It cannot experience pain of any kind, nor does it have interests that can be constrained or violated. These are ways in which early fetuses are relevantly different from a baby, child, or adult. Obviously, these arguments do not apply late in pregnancy, when the fetus has developed various mental capacities. But abortions at that stage are comparatively rare anyway, and typically involve some threat to the health of the mother, which is an independent reason in favor of abortion. - As already noted, Thomson's argument circumvents the personhood issue by presupposing that the fetus has a right to life. On the other side, Don Marquis has put forward an argument against abortion also aiming to circumvent the personhood issue. He argues that killing children and adults is wrong (at least in part) because it robs the victim of their valuable future. But fetuses have futures like those of children and adults (after all, they will eventually be children and adults), so killing fetuses is wrong for the same reason. A problem with this argument is that it seems to prove too much. The egg-and-sperm-which-will-fertilize-it (i.e. the combination of egg and sperm prior to fertilization, not either one taken individually) also seems to have the relevant kind of future. Since abstinence deprives an egg-and-sperm-that-would-have-fertilized-it from coming together, it deprives the combination of a future-like-ours, and is therefore morally wrong on the same grounds as abortion. Thus, all forms of contraception, including abstinence, are apparently morally impermissible. But this is absurd, so Marquis cannot be correct.

I don't think I can easily resolve that but I'll try. So the first difficulty is that... well, what does being anti-abortion mean here. Because this is not as straight-forward a question as you might think it is. Anti-abortion stances actually take many views - most of the countries with anti-abortion laws [as you can see on this chart here](/wiki/File:Abortion_Laws.svg)do still allow abortions in cases where giving birth would cause severe harm to the mother, in the case of rape, if the mother is legally underage, or if the child would be extremely likely to end up being stillborn due to a genetic disease. I'm not going to assume any position here, I just want you to keep this in mind when thinking about this. With that in mind, we can best look at this from two different angles; the first is that of the unborn fetus that will grow into a baby. Now the interesting question here is that if you think that if there's life, it should not be aborted, the question is \"when does that life start\". Now this is a very philosophical question - the commonly accepted case is when something experiences [wp:Qualia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia)that we consider it to be living. So, when does a child experience qualia is the question here. A religious person likely will take the stance that when you have the initial fertilized egg, that's when the child starts. I can't really challenge that without going after religious views which I'm not going to do here. If you're interested in a scientifically motivated answer - the answer to this is 24 weeks. That is when the fetus starts developing the connection from their brain to their sensory organs, and is when a child can be expected to experience qualia. For entirely related reasons, most abortion laws (so places where we can consider it \"to be legal\") place the max limit for an abortion at about 24 weeks, usually slightly less, to account for earlier development of this. Most people interested in forbidding abortions are trying to move the goalpost on when qualia occurs - usually by tying it to \"the first heartbeat\" or similar nonsense. This is easily dismissed out of hand just by pointing at the fact that you can extract cells from a human body and create cell colonies (which is used heavily in medical research). Whilst currently not possible, it is theoretically possible to grow full organs this way. So with that logic - does a theoretically lab-grown heart experience qualia? Obviously not I would say. - The second angle that is interesting to look at is that of the mother. Abortions usually aren't taken lightly - most horror stories the conservative media likes to tell you are either [PIDOOMA](/wiki/PIDOOMA)or [Nutpicking](/wiki/Nutpicking). Most people don't go around sleeping with everything not nailed to the wall, knowing they can just visit the doctor 10 weeks later when they notice that they're no longer menstruating. That's... just a bit absurd (like on-the-face-absurd), especially considering the abortion process isn't great either for the mother - they basically have to dump a half-grown fetus out of their body. With that in mind, actually having a child can be very difficult for (a) parent(s) who aren't prepared for it. It's been statistically proven that unexpected children often also turn into unwanted children. Unwanted children typically leads to very bad parenting being given to those children (since usually the mother would rather do anything but raise the kid, and fathers tend to become deadbeat dads fairly quickly as well). From that perspective, one can wonder if it is in any way remotely fair to raise a child in an abusive household where they are unloved. Dumping the kid into the foster care system also is not the failsafe option as it is often presented as being - the foster care system is often overburdened and children tend to have issues connecting with their foster parents. (Not to mention a large chunk of foster parents in the system are pretty much only in the foster care system because they think foster kids make for good servants, not to actually raise the kid - I know some people who grew up in foster homes, it's rarely sunshine and roses). - To refocus back on the mother, the other thing (lightly touched on earlier) is that unwanted pregnancies often tend to lead to the father becoming a deadbeat father, which means that the mother now has to raise that child alone. I don't have to say much to point out that the US (which I presume you're from) does not have a great system when it comes to caring for young children - if you're alone and don't have a lot of disposable income, you literally don't have the time to take like 4 years out of the labor force until your child is self-sufficient enough to go to school, you need food on the table. That is better in other countries but it bears mentioning. - I don't know if I convinced you. I probably didn't. But I hope my arguments at least gave you something to think about. -- [Techpriest](/wiki/User:Techpriest)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Techpriest)) 21:46, 21 April 2023 (UTC) - And when you do get the woman who uses abortion in lieu of birth control?

This is partly why the American system is so shit - the myriad of health providers have little real incentive to work in preventative medicine because they think they won't have to pay the $$$$ for the treatment later, so can book the $ as profit today. - Even if, you might as well conjure a scenario of a patient going through a drive-through and asking \"one open heart surgery please\" and the doctor goes \"because of socialized healthcare I must comply\". And then we the taxpayers gripe about the sheer nerve of people who need surgery. This conversation is stupid and I feel stupider engaging in it. --It's-a me, - I would personally come on the general side of Ozzy here. If a woman has multiple abortions; so what? Is it the business of the state to limit them by number? In my book, it is the business of the person undergoing it and the medical staff related to them. Not politicians. And experience shows; restricting the provision of abortion produces negative side-effects and often beyond the woman herself, some of which have been outlined above including by Techpriest. That does make it an issue of 'public importance' in the regard it's my taxes which shall have to foot the various bills from the 'unwanted children' often from parent(s) who are not in a position to care for them to a sufficient level. Thus, there is no contradiction in this viewpoint; 'I don't care what you really do until the point you involve wider society'. The only point you could really bitch about people having 'too many' invasive abortions is if they are being paid for via [your] taxes in some form of socialised healthcare system. I'm not disagreeing which you are saying here, Karma. I want people using contraception.

Sunday 30 April would have been my younger sister's birthday if she hadn't died suddenly and unexpectedly 5 years ago at the age of 42, leaving a husband and a young daughter. As always, instead of raising a glass in her memory, I'll be having a packet of crisps and a chocolate bar in her memory. It's what she would have wanted. If you'd like to join me in having some crisps and chocolate in her honour, preferably British brands or the closest you can get to them, that would be great. And when I say \"crisps\", I mean any potato or corn snack, including such things as Monster Munch, Frazzles, Wotsits, Cheetos, Doritos and Funyuns. Alternatively for you Americans, my sister was lucky enough to visit New England one year and absolutely loved the hot food and ice cream from Dairy Queen, so you might like to go there in her honour. Looking at their current menu, I'd say my sister would have an Original Cheeseburger Meal Deal with a strawberry sundae.

It happened in 2011, 2013, and 1995. So not all the public is fooled. It's just that, so far, the impact of Republican tomfoolery is not long-lasting enough or serious enough politically to prevent them from trying the same ol' shit yet again.

Jordan Neely was a homeless guy on the subway who, at the time of his death, was threatening people on the train. His last words were apparently \"I don't have food, I don't have a drink, I'm fed up. I don't mind going to jail and getting life in prison. I'm ready to die.\" And he did. Three people grabbed Neely, one of whom was a marine who choked him unconscious. It's unclear how long the marine choked him, or if he let go afterwards, but in total the 3 held him down for 15 minutes. The marine was questioned by police, then released. The case is now being handled by Alvin Bragg, who has a bit of a bad reputation amongst New Yorkers. In the meantime, Eric Adams has sided with the marine, apparently, which I actually don't fully understand, unless there's something going on behind the scene which I don't know. The case has divided New Yorkers for many reasons. One reason is, of course, it's a White man killing a Black man, and not being arrested. Another issue is that, well, the homeless are second only to bicyclists in terms of how badly the average New Yorker wants them dead. Compounding this, there's concern from other residents about how the subway is becoming more and more dangerous each year. Yet another issue is that the public is questioning why there wasn't psychiatric or other care for Neely. More details are coming out, but until then, well, I don't think I'm capable of determining what to feel about the whole thing. It reminds me a bit of Bernie Goetz, so maybe at some point someone can update the \"we didn't start the fire\" song.

That he didn't care anymore if we went to jail. He then took his jacket off. He didn't state anything to anyone in particular, didn't say he was going to do something violent to any particular person on the train. He didn't approach anyone and didn't give any indication of trying to hurt anyone. He was a extremely desperate man having an understandable mental breakdown in public. There is zero justification to violently engage with him on that basis. Especially considering the killer approached him from behind. He was not an immediate threat to anyone. There is a certain degree of just unempathetic callousness that is required to see this as anything other than a horrible societal injustice. - Reported by whom?

Apparently in 2021, Neely punched a 67 year old woman in the face unprovoked, breaking her nose and orbital bone; technically that's felony assault and the sentencing in NY is between 3 and 25 years depending on the circumstances; given his prior convictions and record, it's unlikely he'd get the minimum. But, he took a plea deal and received some sort of alternative to incarceration, which required reporting to court every so often. He missed a court date, ergo the warrant. I don't know the exact case, but from what I understand, a violation of a deal like that means the entire deal is scuppered and you get the full sentence. So Neely would've been fucked even if he lived. [Correkt](/wiki/User:CorruptUser) [(talk)](/wiki/User_talk:CorruptUser)21:45, 6 May 2023 (UTC) - Sources: - I wouldn't assume there was a murder.

[Bob](/wiki/User:Bob_M) [\"Life is short and (insert adjective)\"](/wiki/User_talk:Bob_M)07:07, 12 May 2023 (UTC) - The water vapor feedback loop is pretty much the known cause of global warming. Basically, the atmo can only hold so much water, but the carbon makes it slightly warmer, so the atmo can hold more water and warm more. If the air was 100% carbon, the earth would actually freeze over. There's a question of what happens when the methane in the ocean escapes into the atmo, which would be Bad but probably fix itself once most humans die off and forests overtake the abandoned farmland and cities. [Correkt](/wiki/User:CorruptUser) [(talk)](/wiki/User_talk:CorruptUser)22:04, 12 May 2023 (UTC) - If the air were \"100% carbon\" we would have a lot more problems than being cold. So I guess you mean \"carbon dioxide\". But even then the claim \"If the air was 100% carbon dioxide, the earth would actually freeze over\" is going to be \"citation needed\". Venus has an atmosphere which is over 95% carbon dioxide and it's a lot hotter than the earth. (Though it's admittedly closer to the sun). So do you have a source for that claim? [Bob](/wiki/User:Bob_M) [\"Life is short and (insert adjective)\"](/wiki/User_talk:Bob_M)08:24, 13 May 2023 (UTC) [From NASA](https://climate.nasa.gov/explore/ask-nasa-climate/3143/steamy-relationships-how-atmospheric-water-vapor-amplifies-earths-greenhouse-effect/). Basically, CO2 creates a positive feedback loop with water vapor; water vapor is a greenhouse gas, which warms the atmo leading to more capacity for water vapor, but it tapers off. If CO2 increases, this causes a slight warming effect, which results in a positive feedback loop which causes the atmosphere to hold much more water vapor. A 100% CO2 atmo would necessarily have 0% water vapor, something that obviously wouldn't happen, but pretend it does. The greenhouse effect of CO2 is not linear, but logarithmic; the Earth has a CO2 PPM of around 420, which would mean about 11 doublings to get to 100% CO2. Every doubling is around 2C more temperature, for 22C more than it is currently. Currently, the total warming effect of the Earth's atmo is about 33C, but IIRC something like 4/5ths of this is just from the water vapor. So we get 22C more from CO2, and we end up losing 27C, so a net of -5C, or -4C compared to pre-industrial times. Basically, an ice age. - Again, hypothetical, since the atmo can't have 0 water short of a nearby star going super-nova. [Correkt](/wiki/User:CorruptUser) [(talk)](/wiki/User_talk:CorruptUser)05:24, 14 May 2023 (UTC) - You wrote \"\"If the air was 100% carbon dioxide, the earth would actually freeze over\" and I'd still like to see you justify that. Pointing out the well-known interplay between CO2 and H2O does not mean that CO2 alone is not a greenhouse gas by itself. You are still in \"citation needed\" territory - the link you provided does not back up your claim. [Bob](/wiki/User:Bob_M) [\"Life is short and (insert adjective)\"](/wiki/User_talk:Bob_M)07:26, 14 May 2023 (UTC) - As I said, most of the total greenhouse effect on earth is from water vapor; the increase in temperature results in more water vapor, which is a positive feedback. Every doubling of CO2 appears to result in 2C higher temps, including from feedbacks resulting in more water vapor. But, CO2 increases temperature logarithmically, not linearly. An atmosphere close to 100% CO2 would thus be 22C warmer than today, BUT, getting to 100% means squeezing out ALL the water (and methane, ozone, etc). No water in the air, and the Earth freezes over. If it gets cold enough, the CO2 in the air becomes dry ice at the poles, and eventually, no atmosphere left. - Mars has the equivalent CO2 levels of around 6,667 PPM or about 4 doublings of Earth's (1/150th the atmospheric pressure, but nearly 100% CO2). In spite of only having 43% of the sunlight, Mars once had liquid water and an average temperature of 10C, close to our average temp of 15C. But without a magnetosphere, the lighter hydrogen was sun-blasted away into space, eventually removing most of the water and leaving the planet the cold, dry husk it is today. With a magnetosphere, it likely would've been effectively habitable as is, with the right equipment and so forth to get the correct pressure and gas-ratios indoors. - Again, it's mostly just a hypothetical, because such a scenario is literally impossible beyond some sort of doomsday effect where the core freezes solid and solar wind slowly scrapes all the hydrogen into space, desiccating our world over the course of millions of years, unless we have a deep drilling device armed with nuclear bombs to restart it, along with a Black dude willing to sacrifice himself for the mission. [Correkt](/wiki/User:CorruptUser) [(talk)](/wiki/User_talk:CorruptUser)21:46, 15 May 2023 (UTC) - You are still wrong. A planet with 100% CO2 would not be frozen. To your Mars I point to Venus.

Funnily enough a lot of German surnames stereotyped as Jewish in US antisemitic circles are just regular German surnames (developed from German terms for geography, occupations, attributes etc; examples being \"-berg\", \"-stein\", \"-schwarz\", \"-schmidt\") that some Jews happen to also have, not even names highly specific to German-Jews. - In this same vein, some people have insinuated that the [Koch brothers](/wiki/Koch_brothers)are Jewish although they aren't; their surname means \"cook\" in German, an occupation. The surname Schwab is geographic in origin for people from Swabia, an area in Germany.

Your typical HOA is made up of people who want to dictate every little detail for the greater good of their neighborhood, but almost always degenerates into bickering over little details, corruption and bribery involving the contractors, nepotism, disputes over HOA fees, and every petty squabble imaginable. Okay, that was just my own HOA, but, ugh; worst bunch of bastards to ever bastard. But interestingly, everything I saw was pretty much exactly the same as every other planned or like-minded community of social misfits, whether they were preppers, extreme libertarians, commies, anarchists, socialists, you name it.

(Monty Python captured the absurdity of the ideological purist cliques like the anarchists etc. best with their \"People's Front of Judea\" joke). The \"Karen\" pejorative is apt. Some people basically go through life chronically complaining about everything, nitpicking over minor deviations, and love to feel entitled and get their way. They often are pretty stupid and/or have a very narrow view, too. HOAs attract this sort of asshole, unfortunately. Imagine if [Marjorie Taylor Greene](/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene)was the entire government, that's too often a HOA. (I've heard of HOAs that work well too, but it only takes a few Karen style asses to spoil things. So no thanks.)

This is an issue which can arise in any organisation which has these flaws - it's not the co-op nature by itself which causes these issues [I mean, go to 'Ask A Manager' and read about all the Pointy-Haired Karens in positions of authority in American businesses]. Thus, the question is how to build org structures which stop 'Karens' from getting into positions of power. There's nothing inherently bad to the principle of 'communialism' itself. - Serious folks who desire to say, set up residential communes, workers/producers co-ops, mutual aid societies and so on can [and should] draw on the wealth of expertise and historical examples on how to do it right [and how not to do it]. And oddly enough, it tells a strong message; 'the skillsets and needs of communialist endevours are almost identical to that of 'individualist' private business'. 'Wrong' people, lack of focus, lack of capital, flaky plans, no real organisation and incompetent leadership - this can doom any type of human endevour. - Thinkpiece; [https://aeon.co/essays/like-start-ups-most-intentional-communities-fail-why](https://aeon.co/essays/like-start-ups-most-intentional-communities-fail-why) [KarmaPolice](/wiki/User:KarmaPolice)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:KarmaPolice)) 10:44, 17 May 2023 (UTC) - Thinkpiece; With a direct answer Cory. Yes. Very wrong. It ignores the entire individualist tradition, and anarchist critiques of democracy. Also when you are talking of HOA's you are often talking in regards to an association of bourgeois interests. It has nothing to do with worker self-management and people don't typically draw the comparison between the function of HOA's and labour unions. You have to keep in mind the economic structures and incentives that shape behaviour in this context. Otherwise basically every group of people that is run either democratically or without a tyrant could be described as a \"HOA\". It's an incredibly asinine analogy. - [Only Sort of Dumb](/wiki/User:OnlySortaDumb) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:OnlySortaDumb)) 02:47, 18 May 2023 (UTC) - When you live in a condominium, there's not really a way around having an HOA. I'm hardly a fan, but in my building we had someone say \"fuck it I'm ignoring the rules\" and would threaten people in the hallways; said situation led to thousands of dollars in damage since our old board president didn't have the balls to stand up to it, and the police were repeatedly there. Given she was a convicted murderer (she got blasted, stabbed her boyfriend to death, and killed her boyfriend's dog by throwing it against a wall for good measure), people in our association had good reason to be afraid of her. Having an effective HOA that could've gotten her ass thrown out of our building, since she was a renter, would've been better than having the situation drag out for 5 years. It only ended when we finally got a board president willing to do what was necessary to get her evicted. For all the horror stories about \"bourgeois\" values and whatnot, the other option would be self-policing that would basically turn into vigilantism, which is basically anarchy; an HOA is theoretically supposed to prevent that. So on an individual level, it's supposed to be something of an antidote to anarchy, sort of like having a municipality within a state. Not that it often turns out that way.

No way I am denying the the numerous crimes and injustices these regimes have caused, just the semantics [Jakester499](/wiki/User:Jakester499) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Jakester499)) ( [contributions](/wiki/Special:Contributions/Jakester499)) 07:30, 20 May 2023 (UTC) - )There are differences, you can find the definitions easily, for example on WP. A state can have all of these characteristics, some or none. A totalitarian state does need to have a (de-facto) single party system bc it represses opposition by definition. A de facto one-party state is a democracy that allows elections, but because of the existing practices de facto (not de jure) they always result in a win for the same party. Represantative monarchies or elective monarchies do (or did) exist, but I've never heard of a \"Republican monarchy\". If a country's system is de jure a democracy with elections and stuff, but without separation of power and a free press, then a few people can amass power and effectively forbid opposition while still keeping up a democratic fa\u00e7ade. Many dictatorships also claim to be democratic *without* according to the principles of a (Western) republic: I say that the people want me to lead this country, so this must be a democracy. In most democratic states we have the principle of the separation of power which prevents the executive (govt) from also being the legislative (parliament) and judicative (courts). In contrast to the head of govt who actually has power, the head of state has often (not always) only represantative function. Last time I checked, Frank-Walter Steinmeier was not Olaf Scholz in disguise. There is no doubt that totalitarian states existed, for example Nazi Germany tried to influence all areas of social life (for example youth organisations or their attempts to \"aryanize\" science, the arts and the economy). I am curious how you got the idea that they did not.

Recent problems[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive436&action=edit\u00a7ion=43)] Hello, you probably don't know me, and I probably don't know you. I have recently been having some kind of \"issue\" if it can be phrased like that. I'm just going to jump into it. So, I've been raised christian for my entire life, I specifically chose the Catholic path (following my mother) and have been that way unquestioning for years. Recently, I began to fall away from my faith . Approximately 2 years ago my family stopped going to mass. Up until that point I was enrolled in schools that held daily mass and taught faith. We stopped going due to scheduling issues and the fact that my parents can't decide on where to go (my mother is catholic and my father in a non-denominal protestant if I remember right). Recently, I began to read arguments (many being on this site) against the existence of a higher power. Now, I originally did this to see the arguments against my stances and reaffirm my faith and beliefs. However, it has evoked a few questions. - One: if God exists, then why have there been so many religions? Each religion believes itself to be right, which seems odd if there is only 1 god? - two: if God exists, then why was (and sometimes still is) the catholic church so corrupt? (This was brought about to me when I began to recognize that the church seems to worship itself more than God)? - Three: if God exists, then why is there so much evidence (physical and theoretical) disproving the stories of creation? - Four: if God exists, then why are there discrepancies in the bible? Like where Adam's sons somehow found women (because God had not created any other humans) to reproduce with? - Five: if God exists, then why don't we see any visible or notable miracles in our everyday life? - Six: if God exists, then why is it that when I pray for help I don't feel as if I get any? I don't know what to do at this point. My family would be crushed if I told them I felt like this. They would be anyways if it got out that I have been finding an odd fascination with suicide. I can't seem to stop thinking about killing myself when I feel down. I actually wrote two notes a month or so ago when I was feeling especially bad one day. I planned to jump in front of a car in a 55 mph area near-ish to my school. My mom arrived though to make me try playing for my school's golf team. It took my mind off of it. This is another thing I don't really know what to do about. I don't want to tell anyone because it will probably get around to my family and others, and I don't think I'll really kill myself. Yet, I can't seem to shake the thought. Pardon my rant here, any thoughts or ideas on what I should do here? [Gang O' Shadow Wizards ](/wiki/User:Gang_O%27_Shadow_Wizards) [Bore me](/wiki/User_talk:Gang_O%27_Shadow_Wizards) 15:42, 15 May 2023 (UTC) - You are certainly not the first person to arrive at this or a similar point. First, it is important to note that if your intrusive thoughts are really getting bad, it could be useful to talk to a professional and not just random persons on the internet like me. It is also a good idea to try to find out and express stuff that bothers you (which is apparently what you are doing here). Consider also checking the usual stuff: are you eating and sleeping enough? While this might not be enough to get rid of these thoughts, I can personally say that it helped me in similar situation. Physical activity might also be useful to keep your brain from wandering. - Your questions feel familiar to me. I know at least three of them from my own experience. There are multiple possible solutions to them. - a) God works in mysterious ways (TM) and/or You Are Wrong Because Magic - For me, this does not make any sense, because I dont think it is useful to try to pray to a being that defies the most basic laws of logic. - b) God ( or multiple gods?) exists, but the bible, your church and your tradition might be partially or completely wrong - This answer is interesting, because there are many possible results of it. You might want to consider a deistic perspective (there was a creator at the Big Bang, but they are not interferring with the universe anymore), or a historical-critical approach to the bible (e.g. it consists of the experience of humans with God, but in the historical context and with loads of metaphors and stuff). Actually, most christians I personally know choose this approach. There are probably tons of different christian and non-christian material to this on the Internet. Again, you are obviously not the first person to have these questions, even among christians. - c) There is no god. - This is my personal approach. It is very important to note that this does *not* mean that there is no objective moral system. There are many atheists out there, and they somehow manage to survive pretty well, so it is in fact possible to live without a religion. Your intrusive thoughts are apparently no rational conclusion from your distress, but more or less subjective. [Iluzasipal](/wiki/User:Iluzasipal) [Stone them!](/wiki/User_talk:Iluzasipal)16:53, 15 May 2023 (UTC) - You really seem to have two different issues and I'm not sure if they are connected. The first is that there is no good objective evidence which demonstrates the existence of any particular god - and by extension no way to show that any particular religion has identified a \"god\" which they should be worshiping. - And a second (far more serious problem) with suicidal thoughts. You seem to be implying that the second is a consequence of the first. But I'm not sure why that should be. - You would certainly be better advised getting professional help with this second problem rather than talking to strangers on the Internet, and I really think you should do this. Nevertheless, you might you might find it useful to explain why the first issue would lead to the second (if it does). [Bob](/wiki/User:Bob_M) [\"Life is short and (insert adjective)\"](/wiki/User_talk:Bob_M)17:26, 15 May 2023 (UTC) - The thoughts are not a consequence of my newfound question of faith. Rather, it is now more appeasable to my mind. I've always been taught that self-harm and suicide is a mortal sin and is a direct path to hell. However, if there aren't any consequences beyond the life, it seems more appeasing.

I would use the analogy of pets here; to pet rats, their owner is akin to God and has the emotional bonds to match.

[Plutocow](/wiki/User:Plutocow)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Plutocow)) 16:47, 16 May 2023 (UTC) - And of course, saying things don't matter because they won't have an impact in an infinite sense is absurd, because we only live finite lives. Our actions still will have an influence in our lives, and since that's all we have (as far as is known) our lifespan matters a lot more than what might happen trillions of years after our deaths. Furthermore, the influence of people who died many centuries in the past can still be felt, so it's hard to say it was all for nothing. Sure, everything will fade away trillions of years into the future, but so what? It has no bearing on your life right now.

At that point, the kindness you show will have ripple-effects that are untold, in ways we can't comprehend. It's hard, but going to another planet guarantees that humanity will exist until the around the heat-death of the universe, and even then, that might not be guaranteed. [Correkt](/wiki/User:CorruptUser) [(talk)](/wiki/User_talk:CorruptUser)18:27, 16 May 2023 (UTC) - I honestly think humanity will have found a way to kill itself long before the inevitable end comes. At that point, it still will not matter. Plus, practically everyone gets forgotten. There is no way people in this theoretical future would remember any of us. Regardless, I obviously will not be around then, no matter what. The inevitability of the end comes for everything.

After having read the Hebrew Bible, Christian New Testament and Islamic Quran, from cover to cover, the only conclusion I can make is that their God absolutely hates human beings, despises and takes great pleasure in tormenting his creation while gaslighting the shit out of his believers into thinking he loves them and is really doing what is best for them. I commend you for finding a few very basic and obvious holes in the logic of God existing. None of it matters: God could exist and yet still be a contradictory monster of a magical being. If the singular God does exist (I give this a 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000-0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001% probability) then he is a menacing psychopathic deranged being the Universe is simply stuck with. Run in absolute terror if it is true. Literally every other world belief, no matter how absurd, including outlandish, creepy and impossible ones, are a huge improvement over what came out of the Middle East. I certainly would prefer the petty, vindictive trouble making Greek pantheon over the horror that is the singular God. Better yet: how about none of the magical strange beings thought up from humanities over-active imagination exist at all?

I have (under what I've been taught) basically doomed myself to hell by not believing god with my entire being. I've been questioning for a while and I was trying to get back into it through Sunday service and whatnot, but I just don't feel the same anymore. I feel as if I see religion better after accidentally distancing myself from it. I feel as if all religion is merely a way to enforce your rules of choice through holding people's metaphorical souls hostage to a non-existent power with the threat of punishment after death. This obviously would be very powerful as death itself is inevitable.
