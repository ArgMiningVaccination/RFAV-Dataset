Research at inStem has received a welcome boost from the Government of India with funding for the Centre for Brain Development and Repair. Our congratulations to the investigators on the grant supporting this Centre and to the Department of Bio technology for enabling these exciting new avenues of research (Page 3). As before, the newsletter has a listing of forthcoming grant submission deadlines. We request applicants to allow at least two working weeks lead time prior to submission deadlines t o allow RDO staff to assist with grant submissions.

We wish all the investigators well for their proposed programme s of research. Awarded grants PI InstitutionCo-PIs/ SupervisersAgency Scheme two bacterial lifestyles: planctonic and biofilm1.35 A donation for the Wildlife Program We are very grateful to the Wildlife Conservation Trust for having made a donation to NCBS in support of the Masters program in Wildlife Biology and Conservation. These funds from the WCT provide vital support for the program via the creation of a corpus , which is ma naged by NCBS and will be made available to the program to meet unique and emerging challenges. Lorem Ipsum Dolor Spring 2012 3 Centre for Brain Development and Repair (CBDR) Disorders of the brain represent a growing and major public health threat to India. There is an unmet need for a human based and led approach to investigating the cause(s), consequence and ultimately treatment of these diseases. Critically this requires a cadre of neurologist scientists who can both inform the basic science as well as lead the underpinning clinical research necessary for translation of laboratory discoveries. Presently In dia does not have such a group of physician -\u00adscientists. The Centre for Brain Development and Repair is a collaborative effort between inStem, NCBS and the University of Edinburgh (UoE) . CBDR's mission is to develop a collaborative, comprehensive program t o understand the cause, consequence and, finally, treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders. The initial thrust of the Centre is to conduct studies specifically focusing on Autism Spectrum Disorders/ Intellectual Disabilities (ASD/ID). The program aims to develop a core group of clinician scientists and promotes discovery -\u00adled translational studies. The Centre is headed by Prof. Sumantra Chattarji (NCBS) who is interested in the cellular basis of emotional memories, and how these are affected by behavioral a nd genetic perturbations. The Associate Directors are -\u00ad Prof Siddharthan Chandran (UoE) who works in the emerging discipline of Regenerative Neurology and Prof Peter Kind (UoE) who examines the cellular dysfunction associated with fragile X syndrome (FXS) and related monogenic forms of Intellectual Disabilities (ID) and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The Centre is funded by the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India (DBT) and also supported by the Wadhwani Foundation.
