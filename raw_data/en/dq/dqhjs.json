Deep Dives are one part of the required homework for The Certified Crystal Healer Certification through the [Selvica Institute](https://www.selvica.org). The certification course is a go at your own pace curriculum and I plan on doing a full write-up once I've finished it. In the Deep Dive, we take turns tuning into the chosen crystal or stone and sharing what we feel, see, and experience. With every go-around we get deeper and deeper into the crystal energy, letting it reveal what it wants to us. This type of group meditation with a crystal is the best way to really see how the same crystal or stone has different, and maybe similar, messages for each person. Dioptase is known as a crystal for forgiveness and healer of emotional pain. I had watched the Dioptase Deep Dive recording a couple of months ago but did not actually do the dive until I was on a long drive back from Chicago. I'd been feeling the call to start working with my ancestors, mostly because I feel there is some ancestral healing that needs to happen for myself and for my family that might be directly related to some health concerns we are having. I've always felt kinda disconnected from them because I never knew my grandparents or any of my extended family. I decided to combine this deep dive with ancestral forgiveness - for not being able to know them while they were alive and for the genetic/environmental health struggles I've been dealing with. Driving can be a meditative state for me and visions seem to come easier this way so I thought, there's no better time than now. Diving with Dioptase There are similarities through all generations, there is universality. I see a long segment of an accordion-folded paper stretching out into the darkness and my ancestors are on each panel. Generation after generation. There is no judgment because we all share the same genes. They suffered too, I cannot place blame on them. There is water, a constant fresh stream available to cleanse each moment of our life. There is child-like innocence accessible to all because we all were once children. It is the equalizer across all cultures. There is healing. Guaranteed. Always there on the other side of the pain, the reassurance of comfort. Love is an underlying current through all space and time no matter the situation, no matter what has happened. Final Thoughts I felt like Dioptase was showing me that to know my ancestors I only needed to look within. Almost like they were telling me, I am a carbon copy of them. Then it shifted to the bigger picture to show me that the commonality of all humans is our childhood innocence. We are spirits born into a \"pre-programmed\" body and we weren't even given the operating manual when we got here. With Dioptase we use it to tap into that part of ourselves and forgive whoever we need to forgive. Our parents, our caretakers, our siblings, ourselves. That was only one aspect of meditating with Dioptase. The first time I meditated with Dioptase a feeling of resolution washed over my body. Similar to the feeling you get when you've had a big fight with someone and makeup and hug each other. It was beautiful. I want to continue to share my personal experiences with crystals so that you understand that everyone's connection to them will be unique depending on the intent and what type of healing you need at that moment in time. I'm hoping it will expand people's expectations of crystal healing possibilities. "}
