Introduction [1](#B1-vaccines-09-00687)]. It is estimated that 75% of sexually active men and women will acquire HPV infection in their lifetime. HPV infections are most prevalent in young adults, as sexual risk behaviors are greatest in this age group. Sexually active young women, in particular, carry the highest risk of infection, with studies documenting rates as high as 68-71% [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00687)]. To date, more than 200 HPV types have been identified and classified into two groups: high-risk and low-risk types [ [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00687)]. Although most HPV infections are transient and asymptomatic, persistent infection with high-risk HPV types may result in cancers, including cervical, anal, vulvar, vaginal, penile, and oropharyngeal cancers [ genital associated with cancers in humans, whereas low-risk HPV including HPV-6, -11, -40, -42, -43, -44, -54, -61, and -72 cause benign diseases such as genital warts [ [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00687)]. Among these HPV types, the majority of HPV-related clinical diseases are associated with HPV-16, -18, -6, and -11. HPV types 16 and 18 cause approximately 70% of cervical cancer, and HPV-6 and HPV-11 are responsible for approximately 90% of genital warts. Most HPV-associated morbidity and mortality is due to cervical cancer, the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide, with an estimated 604,127 cases and 341,831 deaths in 2020 [ [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00687)]. HPV vaccination is an important tool to prevent and control HPV infection and its complications [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00687)]. There are currently three prophylactic HPV vaccines that are used across the world: Cervarix, bivalent HPV a HPV vaccine that targets and -18; and Gardasil 9, a nonavalent HPV vaccine that targets HPV-6, -11, -16, -18, -31, -33, -45, -52, and -58 [ [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00687)]. All three vaccines have proven to be highly efficacious against persistent infection of their vaccine genotypes. However, HPV vaccines are most effective when administered before debut and exposure to HPV [ [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00687)]. HPV vaccination is currently recommended for adolescent males and females aged 9-14 years in a two-dose series and as a three-dose series for young men and women aged 15-26 years [ [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00687)]. [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00687)]. There is, therefore, an urgent need for effective interventions to improve HPV vaccination coverage and reduce the burden of HPV-associated infections and cancers. Several reviews have assessed interventions to improve HPV vaccination coverage. However, the reviews assessed the effectiveness of interventions among adolescents [ [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00687)], young adults [ [14](#B14-vaccines-09-00687)], adolescents and young adults [ [15](#B15-vaccines-09-00687)], the effectiveness of practice- and community-based interventions [ [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00687)], and communication technology interventions [ [16](#B16-vaccines-09-00687)]. A comprehensive systematic review on interventions to increase HPV vaccination coverage was published in 2016 [ [17](#B17-vaccines-09-00687)]. However, the review included only studies conducted in the United States of America. Therefore, this review's findings may not be applicable to low- and middle-income countries, where the burden of HPV is high, and vaccination coverage is very low. In addition, the review included only studies up to 2015, while there have been numerous potentially eligible studies published since then. To the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive systematic review that has assessed interventions to improve HPV vaccination coverage across all country income categories. These limitations justify the need for a comprehensive systematic review on the interventions to improve HPV vaccination coverage. 2. Materials and Methods [18](#B18-vaccines-09-00687)], and the review was prepared according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00687)]. 2.1. Criteria for Considering Studies for This Review [20](#B20-vaccines-09-00687)]. We only included cluster-randomized controlled trials with at least two intervention and two control clusters. Interrupted time-series studies were only included if their outcomes were measured during at least three points before and after the intervention. We also included controlled before-after studies only if they had at least two intervention groups and at least two comparable control groups. We included studies conducted among all individuals eligible for HPV vaccines and their parents/legal guardians or healthcare providers. Included studies evaluated recipient-oriented, provider-oriented, legislative, health system, and multi-component interventions. Eligible studies compared the interventions to standard HPV vaccination practices, alternative interventions, or similar interventions implemented with different degrees of intensity. Our primary outcome of interest was HPV vaccination coverage, while our secondary outcomes were adverse effects and the cost of the intervention. 2.2. Search Methods for Identification of Studies [Appendix A](#app1-vaccines-09-00687), [Table A1](#vaccines-09-00687-t0A1)). We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials and the reference lists of included studies and related reviews for other relevant studies. In addition, we searched the abstracts of the latest conferences of relevant scientific societies related to vaccination and HPV virology for new or pending information not yet published in peer-reviewed journals. 2.3. Selection of Studies 2.4. Data Extraction and Management 2.5. Assessment of Risk of Bias in Included Studies [21](#B21-vaccines-09-00687)]. For each included study, the two review authors independently described what the study authors reported that they did for each domain and then made a decision relating to the risk of bias for that domain by assigning a judgement of \"low risk\" of bias, \"high risk\" of bias, or \"unclear risk\" of bias. The review authors compared the results of their independent assessments of risk of bias and resolved any discrepancies by discussion and consensus. 3. Results 3.1. Results of the Search [Figure 1](#vaccines-09-00687-f001). 3.2. Description of Studies [Appendix [ [54](#B54-vaccines-09-00687), [55](#B55-vaccines-09-00687)], and one study was a non-randomized trial [ [56](#B56-vaccines-09-00687)]. Thirty-two studies were conducted studies were carried out in the UK [ [36](#B36-vaccines-09-00687)], the Netherlands [ [38](#B38-vaccines-09-00687)], and was conducted among males only [ [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00687)]; one study was conducted among males and females [ [43](#B43-vaccines-09-00687)]; thirteen studies were conducted mixed participants: adolescents and parents/guardians [ [35](#B35-vaccines-09-00687), [48](#B48-vaccines-09-00687), [50](#B50-vaccines-09-00687)] and the standard of care in each setting to alternative interventions. 3.2.4. data on the receipt of any HPV vaccine dose [ [Appendix A](#app1-vaccines-09-00687), [Table A4](#vaccines-09-00687-t0A4).

Comparison 5: Outreach Plus Reminders Compared to Standard of Care [31](#B31-vaccines-09-00687)]. We judged the certainty of the evidence as moderate because of an unclear risk of bias in the included study. Comparison 6: Outreach Plus Education Compared to Standard of Care [56](#B56-vaccines-09-00687)]. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to moderate because of study limitations (i.e., non-randomized study). [56](#B56-vaccines-09-00687)].

We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to low because of study limitations, as the included study had a high risk of bias. [37](#B37-vaccines-09-00687)]. We judged the certainty of the evidence as very low because of concerns regarding the risk of bias in the included study and serious imprecision in the findings. [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00687), [42](#B42-vaccines-09-00687), [43](#B43-vaccines-09-00687)]. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to very low because of concerns regarding the risk of bias in the included studies and serious imprecision in the findings. Comparison 8: Reminders vs. Standard of Care [25](#B25-vaccines-09-00687), [39](#B39-vaccines-09-00687)]. We judged the certainty of the evidence as low because of study limitations, as the included studies had a high risk of bias. [45](#B45-vaccines-09-00687)] reported that 26.5% of female adolescents initiated HPV vaccine series in the intervention group compared to 15.3% in the control group. We judged the certainty of the evidence as low because of study limitations, as the included studies had a high risk of bias. [24](#B24-vaccines-09-00687), [25](#B25-vaccines-09-00687), [40](#B40-vaccines-09-00687), [48](#B48-vaccines-09-00687)]. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to very low because of concerns regarding the risk of bias and serious inconsistency in the included studies. [49](#B49-vaccines-09-00687)] assessed the effect of reminders compared to the standard of care on the uptake of any HPV dose. The study found that the intervention had no effect on the uptake of HPV vaccine (RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.05; 5912 participants). We judged the certainty of the evidence as moderate because of a high risk of bias in the included study. [25](#B25-vaccines-09-00687), [45](#B45-vaccines-09-00687), [47](#B47-vaccines-09-00687)]. Coley (2018) [ [25](#B25-vaccines-09-00687)] calculated the reminder mailing and vaccination costs. The mailing costs were $13,698 for address verification, $44,312 for printing, and $57,991 for postage. The vaccination cost was $30.95 per adolescent who initiated the HPV vaccine series. Szilagyi (2013) [ [47](#B47-vaccines-09-00687)] measured the cost of the intervention on pertussis, meningococcal, and HPV vaccination among adolescents. The delivery cost of the intervention was $18.78 for mailed and $16.68 for phone reminders per adolescent per year, respectively. The cost per additional fully vaccinated adolescent was $463.99 for mailed and $714.98 for telephone reminders. Suh (2012) [ [45](#B45-vaccines-09-00687)] calculated the total operating cost of reminder/recall intervention per additional adolescent who received tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis, meningococcal conjugate, or a first dose of human papillomavirus vaccine in four practices. The total operating cost, which included personnel and supply costs, ranged between $1087 and $1349. Comparison 9: Educational Reminders Compared to Plain Reminders [32](#B32-vaccines-09-00687)] showed that educational reminders improve the initiation of the HPV vaccination series compared to plain reminders (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.06; 90 participants). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to very low because of concerns regarding the risk of bias in the included study and serious imprecision in the findings.

Comparison 16: Assessment and Feedback Compared to Standard of Care Series [54](#B54-vaccines-09-00687)] evaluated the effect of assessment and feedback intervention compared to the standard of care on the initiation of the HPV vaccine series among adolescent boys and girls aged 11-17 years. The study reported that there was no significant difference in the initiation of the HPV vaccine series between intervention and control clinics. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to very low because of study limitations (i.e., before-after study). [54](#B54-vaccines-09-00687)]. The study found that the completion of the HPV vaccine series between the intervention and control clinics was not significantly different.

We may therefore have missed important findings from these studies. Well-designed studies that assess the effect of the interventions on HPV vaccination coverage are needed. [21](#B21-vaccines-09-00687)]. We conducted comprehensive searches of both peer-reviewed and grey literature, without limiting the searches to a specific language. Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias in each included study. We are not aware of any biases in the review process. [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00687), the effectiveness of the interventions for improving HPV vaccination coverage in USA. The review found that many types of intervention strategies (targeting recipients, providers, and the health system) increased HPV vaccination coverage in different settings. Contrary to our review, which included 35 studies, this similar comprehensive review, which searched five databases for studies published between 2006 to 2015, resulted in 34 eligible studies. Like their review, all the studies included in our review were conducted in high-income countries. Of the 35 studies included in our review, 32 were conducted in the USA and the remaining three were from Australia, the Netherlands, and the UK. Acampora (2020) [ [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00687)] and colleagues evaluated the effectiveness of interventions for improving HPV vaccination coverage among adolescents. The authors found that reminder-based interventions, either alone or in combination with other interventions, had a positive effect on vaccination coverage [ [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00687)]. In another review, the effectiveness of intervention for improving HPV coverage among college students was assessed. The authors reported that the educational intervention that utilized a joint peer and medical provider message was the only intervention in their review that significantly increased HPV vaccine uptake [ [14](#B14-vaccines-09-00687)]. The effectiveness of communication technology interventions on HPV vaccination coverage was assessed by Francis (2017) [ [16](#B16-vaccines-09-00687)] and found that usage of computer, mobile, or internet technologies as the sole or primary mode for intervention delivery increased vaccination coverage. Niccolai (2015) [ [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00687)] conducted a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of practice- and community-based interventions on improving HPV vaccination coverage. The review reported that several interventions including reminder and recall systems, physician-focused strategies (e.g., audit and feedback), school-located programs, and social marketing have improved vaccination coverage. The effectiveness of the interventions that applied new media to improve vaccination coverage was assessed by Odone and colleagues. The authors reported that text messaging, accessing immunization campaign websites, using patient-held web-based portals and computerized reminders, and standing orders increased vaccination coverage rates [ [57](#B57-vaccines-09-00687)]. Walling and colleagues compared the effectiveness of the informational-, behavioral-, and environmental-based interventions on improving HPV vaccination coverage among adolescents and young adults aged 11 to 26 years. The authors found that environmental interventions, particularly school-based vaccination programs were most effective in increasing vaccination coverage [ [15](#B15-vaccines-09-00687)]. 5.
