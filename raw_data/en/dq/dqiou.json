Chevron Amethyst combines the strengthening and enhancing qualities of Quartz with the stress relieving qualities of Amethyst. This symbiotic combination of minerals lends itself to a wonderfully spiritual stone, which is great for gently removing the veils that obscure some of the hidden meanings in life. Banded/Chevron Amethyst encourages and supports inner strength, as well as dissipates and repels negativity. Banded/Chevron Amethyst is one of the best stones to work with the Third-Eye, enhancing both intuition and physical vision on all planes of existence. Excellent for all types of introspective work, Banded/Chevron Amethyst can deepen the meditative state, allowing your higher guidance to communicate. This can be achieved if you have a piece with a distinct chevron pattern. You can use it with the v-stripes pointing upward to direct energy up toward the Third Eye or Crown Chakra which can deepen meditation. You can use Banded/Chevron Amethyst to cleanse the aura and subtle bodies, to promote spiritual healing, and to enhance your psychic abilities.
