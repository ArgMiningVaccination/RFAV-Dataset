A spa should be a place of rest and relaxation. We therefore ask you to behave quietly in all areas of the spa and to respect the privacy of other guests by refraining from the use of mobile devices. It is up to you whether you use the sauna area clothed or unclothed. We kindly ask you to place towels between you and the seats and to shower before using the sauna and the pool. It is, however, compulsory to wear bathing attire in the entire pool and quiet area and to wear sports attire in the fitness area. "}
