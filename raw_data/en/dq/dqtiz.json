The following is a list of common chiropractic treatments available to those suffering from certain health conditions. Spinal adjustments A spinal adjustment, also known as spinal manipulation and chiropractic manipulation, is one of the most common treatments that a patient can receive. This type of treatment is especially useful for patients who are experiencing pain in their upper back, neck, shoulders and arms. It is also beneficial for those who suffer from chronic headaches or migraines. A spinal adjustment allows the spine to be in its proper alignment, which in turn helps reduce pain, increase range of motion and restore proper functioning to the head and neck area. Massage therapy Massage therapy is a popular treatment option and helps facilitate the natural healing process within the body. It is performed for therapeutic reasons, as it helps to increase the overall effectiveness of any necessary chiropractic adjustments, to minimize any pain experienced in the soft tissues or muscles and to prevent the patient from being diagnosed with future health problems. Ultrasound therapy Ultrasound therapy is also known as sonography and is a treatment option commonly utilized by chiropractors because this type of therapy offers multiple benefits to the patient. The first benefit is reducing pain, a goal for every patient. The second benefit is that it helps speed up the healing process, with the third benefit being an increase in cell regeneration. The two main types are thermal ultrasound and mechanical ultrasound. A chiropractor will choose which type is optimal for each individual patient. Hot therapy, cold therapy Hot therapy, also known as heat therapy, is a chiropractic treatment option that helps enlarge blood vessels, with a goal of bringing more blood to a certain area of the body. This, in turn, brings more oxygen to the area, allowing for a more efficient flow of nutrients to the muscles that allow for faster healing time. This type of therapy also decreases pain while increasing overall flexibility when used to treat the back area, allowing for a higher quality of life. Cold therapy is also called cryotherapy. This type of chiropractic therapy is used to narrow blood vessels, with a goal of slowing down any blood circulation to a particular area on the body. It is a common treatment option for relieving any spinal pain that a patient is currently experiencing and provides optimal results when used within the first three days of being injured. Cold therapy helps eliminate pain and swelling incurred due to the injury and can also be used to diminish any muscle spasms due to muscle contraction. Strengthening exercises, stretching exercises Many patients will be given a list of exercises to perform when they are at home as part of their overall chiropractic treatment plan. Some of the more common exercises assigned to patients include progressive rolls, pelvic rotation blocking, lumbar extension, cervical extension, piriformis stretch, cobra exercise, carpal tunnel stretch, pelvic tilt, pectoral stretch, tech neck and pelvic bridge.
