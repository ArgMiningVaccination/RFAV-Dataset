Though very rare, there are potential complications associated with scurvy treatment. \"Since vitamin C is water soluble \u2014 meaning that excessive amounts will be eliminated in the urine \u2014 toxic accumulation of vitamin C within the body is extremely unlikely,\" Springer says. \"However, I would still recommend staying below the upper limit of 2,000 mg per day of vitamin C, because too much can cause undesirable side effects, especially for those with kidney problems.\" [too much vitamin C](/drugs/ascorbic-acid)(generally a concern through supplementation rather than diet alone) can lead to [kidney stones](https://www.everydayhealth.com/kidney-stones/guide/)among people who are prone to them.
