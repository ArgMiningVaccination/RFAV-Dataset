You might consider trying a natural deodorant if you want an [aluminum-free](/health/what-to-know-about-aluminum-in-deodorant) product or find that conventional brands [irritate your skin](/health/contact-dermatitis). Why? Well, conventional deodorants often contain harsher ingredients or potentially aggravating fragrance chemicals. Natural deodorants, on the other hand, typically use naturally derived fragrances and gentler ingredients. Natural deodorants don't block sweat glands or reduce perspiration like antiperspirants do. Instead, they help neutralize odors. They can do this in one of two ways: reducing bacteria responsible for producing odors or masking the smell of odors with added fragrance. [Learn the difference between deodorant and antiperspirant here.](/health/deodorant-vs-antiperspirant) Benefits of natural deodorant The benefits of using natural deodorant largely relate to your well-being, rather than the ineffectiveness of your conventional deodorant. A few of the key benefits of making the switch: - Natural deodorant generally contains ingredients suitable for sensitive skin. - Typically, natural deodorants are free of ingredients known to cause irritation or reactions, like parabens and artificial fragrances. - Many natural deodorants are free of aluminum, which has linked to breast cancer. [some research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23899626/) In a nutshell, natural deodorant lets you sweat the way your body naturally should. Antiperspirants that contain aluminum work by blocking your sweat glands. This helps reduce underarm moisture, which cuts down on odor. Natural deodorant doesn't stop you from sweating, but it does help decrease unwanted odor. With so many options out there, you might have a hard time knowing which product will work best to take care of odor. But we found 15 options that really work. Read on to get the details on our picks. We searched for deodorants made of natural ingredients, or products without any synthetic or artificial ingredients. We also tried to include some eco-friendly options. The deodorants we chose contain: - ingredients like [coconut oil](/nutrition/coconut-oil-and-skin)or alcohol that help stop bacteria from growing - naturally absorbent ingredients, like [baking soda](/nutrition/baking-soda-benefits-uses), [cornstarch](/nutrition/cornstarch-uses), bamboo, and zinc - no aluminum, which means they can help neutralize or mask odors but won't [prevent sweating](/health/how-to-stop-sweating-armpits). To figure out the best options, we scoured online reviews and tested a few products ourselves. Pricing guide Natural deodorants are generally more expensive than conventional brands. Here's how we broke down the prices: - $ = under $15 - $$ = $15-$18 - $$$ = over $18 Best natural spray deodorant [Distilled Bath & Body Pit Liquor Whiskey Vanilla Spray Deodorant](https://pitliquor.com/products/whiskey-vanilla-100ml-spray-deodorant) - Price: $$$ - Pros: long lasting bottle - Cons: on the expensive side - Synthetic fragrance-free: yes - Paraben-free: yes - Cruelty-free: yes - Size: 100 milliliters (mL) - Key ingredients: vodka, whiskey, vanilla essential oil Vodka and whiskey make up the alcohol base of this spray deodorant, while vanilla essential oil works to leave your pits smelling sweet. It's on the pricier side, but one bottle can last 3 to 4 months. Spray deodorants like this one apply easily and dry quickly, without leaving a white residue behind. It comes packaged in eco-friendly glass, and you can buy a [refill size](https://distilledbathandbody.com/collections/refill) when your bottle runs dry. Then you can recycle your empties or send them back to the company for reuse. Reviewers express an initial surprise that the deodorant does actually smell like whiskey, until the alcohol evaporates. In testing we found that it really works, lasting even through a workout or long run. It also doesn't stain clothing like oil-based natural deodorants can. If you've just shaved your armpits, though, it may sting a little when it first goes on. Otherwise, it's nonirritating and nondrying. Best plastic-free natural deodorant packaging, vegan-friendly - Cons: leaves residue, may stain clothing - Synthetic fragrance-free: yes - Paraben-free: yes - Cruelty-free: yes - Size: 2.65 ounces (oz.) - Key ingredients: coconut oil, shea butter, baking soda This coconut oil and [shea butter](/health/beauty-skin-care/what-is-shea-butter) formula glides on smoothly, while [tapioca](/nutrition/tapioca) starch and baking soda soak up excess sweat and oil. You have 10 light, natural scents to choose from, from Coconut & Vanilla to Citrus & Herbal Musk. If you have [sensitive skin](/health/skin-disorders/sensitive-skin) or want to avoid fragrances, you might prefer the unscented version. Another perk? The [plastic-free packaging](/health/beauty-skin-care/plastic-free-skin-care) won't add to the burden of single-use plastics. This deodorant comes in a round paperboard tube, and it's shipped in a recycled paper mailer. If you'd rather shop in person, your local Target may also carry some scents. In testing, we found it was fairly long-lasting, though you may need to reapply after a long workout or on particularly hot days. One downer: It can leave white marks and oil stains on your clothing, so swipe carefully. Best oil-free spray natural deodorant [Weleda Citrus Deodorant](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000T5O87M?tag=healthline-subtag-20&ascsubtag=null&correlationId=null) - Price: $$$ - Pros: glass bottle is recyclable - Cons: essential oils may be irritating - Synthetic fragrance-free: yes - Paraben-free: yes - Cruelty-free: yes - Size: 3.4 oz. - Key ingredients: alcohol, essential oils This deodorant spray features an alcohol and water base \u2014 no mineral oil, so it won't stain your clothing. It doesn't contain [parabens](/health/paraben-free) or phthalates, which can cause skin irritation for some people. That said, it does use [essential oils](/health/are-essential-oils-safe) for the scent, which some people also find irritating. You may want to [patch test](https://greatist.com/health/patch-test) first if you're sensitive to fragrances or have sensitive skin. Reviewers like this deodorant because of the gentle formula and refreshing citrus scent. People say they can get through the day free of stink with just a few sprays each morning. Using after shaving, however, can cause stinging from the alcohol. Best natural crystal deodorant [Energy Balance Crystal Deodorant](https://www.econowca.com/product/crystal-deodorant-stick-biork/1260) Price: $$$ Pros: recyclable, biodegradable container Cons: you need to moisten before using and dry after using Synthetic fragrance-free: yes Paraben-free: yes Cruelty-free: yes Size: 120 g Key ingredients: potassium alum crystal This deodorant is made from potassium alum crystal (a natural mineral salt) \u2014 and that's all. The rock is said to kill bacteria that contribute to BO, though it won't reduce sweating. The lack of other ingredients means it's less likely to cause a negative skin reaction. This crystal deodorant, specifically, is designed with the planet in mind. The crystal and cork container are backyard compostable, while the paper label is recyclable. The main downside of potassium alum? It may leave a chalky residue behind on your skin and clothing. Reviewers say this product lasts a long time \u2014 even as long as a year. They also note that while they still sweat in hot weather, the smell is noticeably reduced or eliminated for up to 24 hours. Some people say this product does nothing for their underarms, but others swear by it. Best baking soda-free natural deodorant [megababe Rosy Pits Daily Deodorant](https://www.ulta.com/rosy-pits-daily-deodorant?productId=pimprod2001147&correlationId=null) - Price: $ - Pros: glides on clear - Cons: contains fragrance - Synthetic fragrance-free: no - Paraben-free: yes - Cruelty-free: yes - Size: 2.6 oz. - Key ingredients: cornstarch, sage, coconut oil If you like baby powder freshness, you'll like this natural deodorant. It's free of both alcohol and baking soda \u2014 a plus if these ingredients typically cause irritation on your skin. The formula's cornstarch sops up sweat, while [glycerin](/health/glycerin-for-face), coconut oil, and [vitamin E](/health/vitamin-e-for-skin) keep pits moisturized. [Sage](/nutrition/sage) and [green tea](/health/benefits-of-green-tea-for-skin) help battle bacteria that lead to BO. Though it doesn't have baking soda, some reviewers complain of a rash after using it. That may be due to the plant extracts and essential oils, which affect everyone's skin differently. It's always best to do a patch test before trying a new product on your skin. In testing, we found that it didn't leave white marks on clothing like the Native deodorant did, but it also didn't last as long. Best exfoliating natural deodorant [Kosas Chemistry Serum Deodorant](https://activation.healthline.com/api/member-offers/6531/redirect?lp=328&tc=120226&subid2=%2Fhealth%2Fbeauty-skin-care%2Fbest-natural-deodorants&subid=sephora%29kosas_AHA_serum_deodorant_textlink_35036&correlationId=null) - Price: - underarm texture and color - Cons: users aren't happy with the packaging - Synthetic fragrance-free: yes - Paraben-free: yes - Cruelty-free: yes - Size: 2.4 oz. - Key ingredients: AHAs, glycerin, aloe vera Why not take the same ingredients that are good for your face and use them on your armpits? That's exactly what this deodorant does. It features a blend of [alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs)](/health/beauty-skin-care/alpha-hydroxy-acid) to exfoliate and keep odor at bay. [Hyaluronic acid](/health/beauty-skin-care/hyaluronic-acid) and [aloe vera juice](/health/beauty-skin-care/aloe-vera-for-face) help keep things soft and smooth. Reviewers love the brighter appearance of the skin on their underarms. (Thanks, AHA!) They also praise how well this deodorant whisks away body odor. Some reviewers say, though, that it doesn't always work on heavy sweating days. Others didn't like the scented version. Many reviewers also say the packaging needs improvement since the rollerball often gets stuck. Best scented natural deodorant stick [Meow Meow Tweet Lavender Bergamot Deodorant Stick](https://meowmeowtweet.com/products/lavender-bergamot-deodorant-stick?correlationId=null) - Price: $ - Pros: compostable tube, mostly organic and fair trade ingredients - Cons: small size, essential oils may cause irritation - Synthetic fragrance-free: yes - Paraben-free: yes - Cruelty-free: yes - Size: 1.8 oz. - Key ingredients: baking soda, arrowroot powder, coconut oil The floral-citrus scent of this deodorant may leave your armpits smelling so good you find yourself taking a whiff. You can also apply this deodorant to your neck, chest, and feet if they need a pick-me-up, too. Coconut oil, cocoa seed butter, and shea fruit butter make the formula silky, while [arrowroot powder](/nutrition/what-is-arrowroot) and baking soda help absorb unwanted moisture. However, heavy sweaters say it's not enough to get the job done. (Like all the products on this list, this is a deodorant, not an antiperspirant \u2014 so it doesn't keep you from sweating. Plus, this certified organic, fair trade product boasts a backyard compostable tube and seal. In testing, we found it did, in fact, have a long-lasting scent from the essential oils, but it also tended to leave marks on clothing. Best solid natural deodorant [Ethique Rustic Solid Deodorant](https://www.amazon.com/Ethique-Eco-Friendly-Deodorant-Bar-Rustic/dp/B07TP45397?&linkCode=ll1&tag=best-natural-deodorant-20&linkId=f588052fde74bc0ec5c1b4f87db19fd3&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl&ascsubtag=null&correlationId=null) - Price: $ - Pros: zero-waste, ethically sourced ingredients - Cons: can get messy - Synthetic fragrance-free: yes - Paraben-free: yes - Cruelty-free: yes - Size: 2.47 oz. - Key ingredients: magnesium hydroxide, zinc oxide, bamboo This bar's biodegradable ingredients and compostable packaging make it a zero-waste product. But what's inside counts, too: It's made from magnesium hydroxide, zinc oxide (a common [sunscreen ingredient](/health/skin/zinc-oxide-sunscreen)), and surprisingly sweat-absorbent bamboo. Lime and cedarwood oils provide the woodsy-citrus scent, which reviewers say tends to fade quickly. You'll have to get used to using a deodorant bar since it's a different hand-to-pit skill to develop. You might find this bar leaves some residue on your hands. Still, it lasts a long time. You can also [opt for a mini size](https://ethique.com/products/rustic-mini?correlationId=null) before committing to the larger bar. Many reviewers say they have to reapply this 2 to 3 times per day for best results, though that's the case with many natural deodorants. Best travel-friendly natural deodorant [Ursa Major Sublime Sage Natural Spray Deodorant](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YZPBRQG?tag=healthline-subtag-20&ascsubtag=null&correlationId=null) - Price: $$ - Pros: doesn't stain, portable, vegan-friendly - Cons: may not last as long - Synthetic fragrance-free: yes - Paraben-free: yes - Cruelty-free: yes - Size: 1.79 oz. - Key ingredients: enzymes, sage, alcohol This deodorant comes in an easy-to-spritz bottle for quick application anywhere \u2014 mid-day or even mid-flight. The vegan formula uses enzymes to battle odor-causing bacteria and leaves behind an herbal scent with notes of sage, [geranium](/health/geranium-oil), [sandalwood](/health/what-is-sandalwood), and lemon myrtle. Many reviewers say they can apply this once per day and get by without that tell-tale funk. Others really like how it washes off well, leaving skin soft and residue-free. In the few negative reviews available, some people say the deodorant didn't last as long as they hoped. Others didn't care for its scent. Best charcoal natural deodorant [Schmidt's Natural Deodorant, Charcoal and Magnesium](https://www.amazon.com/Schmidts-Deodorant-Charcoal-Magnesium-grams/dp/B071YYMZ19?&linkCode=ll1&tag=best-natural-deodorant-20&linkId=253ffbe8e23afc6e6adcfef063374dad&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl&ascsubtag=null&correlationId=null) - Price: $ - Pros: large size, widely available - Cons: baking soda may cause irritation, charcoal may stain clothing - Synthetic fragrance-free: yes - Paraben-free: yes - Cruelty-free: yes - Size: 3.25 oz. - Key ingredients: arrowroot powder, baking soda, coconut oil When it comes to absorbing sweat, Schmidt's does it with arrowroot powder and baking soda. The formula also features coconut oil, shea butter, and vitamin E to keep armpits touchably soft, while charcoal helps banish stink. There's often a detox period when switching from aluminum-based to natural deodorant. If you want to expedite the process, activated charcoal can help draw out toxins and bacteria, including gland-clogging aluminum. This lets your pits get back to sweating as they're designed to. Because the charcoal gives the deodorant a gray color, you may notice some staining. Some people also report irritation from the baking soda. Best alcohol-free natural deodorant [Malin+Goetz Eucalyptus Deodorant](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003554PYO?tag=healthline-subtag-20&ascsubtag=null&correlationId=null) - Price: $$$ - Pros: free of alcohol and baking soda - Cons: essential oils may cause irritation - Synthetic fragrance-free: yes - Paraben-free: yes - Cruelty-free: yes - Size: 2.6 oz. - Key ingredients: cornstarch, saccharomyces ferment, bergamot This small tube is easy to maneuver around your pits, so you can cover only the surface you need. [Eucalyptus](/health/9-ways-eucalyptus-oil-can-help) and citronellyl help eliminate odors and provide a fresh fragrance. Alcohol is a common and safe ingredient in natural and conventional deodorants alike, but it can dry out the skin and cause irritation in some people. If you're looking for an alcohol-free natural deodorant, this one makes the cut. It doesn't contain baking soda, either. Many reviewers love how the product doesn't cause buildup on their skin or stain their clothes. While the manufacturers advertise this deodorant as having 24-hour protection, some people say they don't get that kind of longevity out of the product. Others call the scent too strong. Best natural deodorant for sensitive skin [Magsol Magnesium Deodorant](https://www.amazon.com/Sandalwood-Magnesium-Deodorant-Aluminum-Sensitive/dp/B07DNGSBSC?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=best-natural-deodorant-20&linkId=20c28810066b97e2490cafc9d713a75e&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl&ascsubtag=null&correlationId=null) - Price: ingredients, gender-neutral - Cons: some users experienced irritation - Synthetic fragrance-free: yes - Paraben-free: yes - Cruelty-free: yes - Size: 3.2 oz. - Key ingredients: magnesium oxide, beeswax, almond oil With just four ingredients \u2014 sweet [almond oil](/health/beauty-skin-care/almond-oil-for-face), beeswax, magnesium oxide, and essential oils \u2014 this formula is ideal for those with sensitive pits. The active ingredient, food-grade [magnesium](/nutrition/10-proven-magnesium-benefits), works to reduce moisture buildup and effectively stop stink. Happy reviewers say the scent lasts all day and keeps their BO at bay. Others didn't find the product suitable for their sensitive skin, noting irritation and reactions still occurred. Everyone has a different level of reactivity, so performing a patch test before using a new product is always your safest bet. Manufacturers advertise the bottle as lasting up to 9 months, but reviewers say it lasts closer to 2 to 3 months. Best natural deodorant cream [Little Seed Farm Deodorant Cream](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Seed-Farm-Deodorant-Aluminum-Free/dp/B0791XWCCK?&linkCode=ll1&tag=best-natural-deodorant-20&linkId=c66d08707bfb71d0d0d8059ea0df71cf&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl&ascsubtag=null&correlationId=null) - Price: $ - Pros: contains activated charcoal to draw out toxins - Cons: not vegan, messy application - Synthetic fragrance-free: yes - Paraben-free: yes - Cruelty-free: yes - Size: 2.4 oz. - Key ingredients: arrowroot powder, magnesium hydroxide, coconut oil This deodorant comes in cream form \u2014 you scoop it out with your fingers and apply it to your pits by hand. It might go without saying, but this technique can take some getting used to. For a less messy application, Little Seed Farm sells a [bamboo applicator](https://littleseedfarm.com/collections/deodorant/products/bamboo-deo-applicator?correlationId=null). Its baking soda-free formula may work well on sensitive skin. Plus, thanks to coconut and jojoba oils, it goes on smoothly and melts into skin. You can buy it in several scents, or opt for the unscented version. Reviewers like how you only need to apply a pea-size amount. This means it likely won't transfer onto your clothes, and the container will last for months. Best natural deodorant gel [N\u00e9cessaire THE DEODORANT GEL - Price: on clear, dries quickly - Cons: small size - Synthetic fragrance-free: yes - Paraben-free: yes - Cruelty-free: yes - Size: 1.7 oz. - Key ingredients: AHAs, witch hazel, niacinamide Deodorants come in many different textures: solids, creams, liquids, and even gels. This gel deodorant isn't like stick deodorants that can leave your underarms feeling moist. It glides on clear, so it doesn't leave a white residue on your clothes or underarms, and it dries down quickly. The AHA blend, which consists of lactic acid and mandelic acid, helps balance underarm pH level and prevents odor. The gentle exfoliation also helps brighten areas of darker or discolored skin, making it a great option if you have underarm dark spots or razor bumps. Reviewers praise the efficient roller and the way the product glides across the skin. Some people say they don't notice any difference in odor, but many reviews praise this deodorant's effectiveness. Best plant-based natural deodorant [Kopari Natural Aluminum-Free Coconut Deodorant](https://www.sephora.com/product/coconut-deodorant-P429518?correlationId=null) - Price: $ - Pros: vegan-friendly, no baking soda - Cons: contains fragrance - Synthetic fragrance-free: no - Paraben-free: yes - Cruelty-free: yes - Size: 2 oz. - Key ingredients: coconut oil, coconut water, activated charcoal Conventional deodorants are often tested on animals or formulated with animal-derived ingredients like beeswax and lanolin, which can make it difficult to find vegan and plant-based options. But this natural coconut-based deodorant is powered by plants. Coconut oil, which contains fatty acids that have [antibacterial properties](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6817632/) [2013 research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3897065/) This plant-based deodorant checks a lot of boxes \u2014 it goes on clear, reduces odors, and protects sensitive skin. But it does have a major downside: It contains artificial fragrance (aka parfum), which can trigger irritation for some people. Some reviewers report itchiness, irritation, and reactions. Others praise the deodorant's pleasant smell and effective formula. |Price||Pros||Cons||Synthetic fragrance-free||Paraben-free||Cruelty-free| |Distilled Bath & Body Pit Plastic-Free bottle is recyclable||essential oils may be irritating||yes||yes||yes| |Energy Balance Crystal Deodorant||$$$||recyclable and biodegradable container||needs to be moistened before use and dried afterward||yes||yes||yes| |megababe Rosy Pits |Meow Meow Tweet Lavender Bergamot Deodorant Stick||$||compostable tube, mostly organic and fair trade ingredients||essential oils may cause irritation, small size||yes||yes||yes| ethically sourced Deodorant||$$||doesn't stain, portable||pricey||yes||yes||yes| |Schmidt's Natural Deodorant, Charcoal and Magnesium||$||large size, widely available||baking soda may cause irritation, charcoal may stain clothing||yes||yes||yes| |Malin+Goetz Eucalyptus Deodorant||$$$||free of alcohol and baking soda||essential be irritating||yes||yes||yes| Magnesium Deodorant||$$||long-lasting bottle, users experienced irritation||yes||yes||yes| |Little Seed Farm Deodorant Cream||$||contains activated charcoal to draw out toxins||not vegan, messy application||yes||yes||yes| |N\u00e9cessaire THE DEODORANT GEL - With AHA||$$||goes dries quickly||small Deodorant||$||vegan-friendly, no baking soda||contains fragrance||no||yes||yes| The best natural deodorant for you can depend on your specific needs. Here's what to consider as you shop. Ingredients As a start, check the ingredients list for aluminum. This active ingredient in traditional antiperspirants plugs up sweat glands in the armpit. A natural deodorant won't contain aluminum. Next, check for other ingredients you'd like to avoid. Some people like baking soda because they find it neutralizes odors and absorbs moisture well, while others find it causes irritation. Similarly, essential oils are a hallmark of natural deodorant, but you might find certain oils too harsh on your skin. Scent Natural deodorants come in a variety of scents. Since you'll be wearing the product all day, try to smell the deodorant in person before buying. Some brands also sell sample sizes. Application type Natural deodorants come in sprays, sticks, pastes, or creams. Pastes and creams can get a little messy, though some people prefer them. Sprays and sticks are generally easier to apply. Lifestyle Keep in mind that you might need to reapply natural deodorants more frequently than traditional deodorants. If you tend to sweat a lot, you may want to opt for an oil-free deodorant, since the oil can stain clothing. It can also help to consider the product's portability. Some people report experiencing a \"transition period\" as their body adjusts to natural deodorant. Anecdotally, some people say this transition period can last a few weeks to a month. If you're searching for ways to help the process along, you might come across things like underarm scrubs and exfoliating masks. These products claim to \"detox\" your armpits and soothe the skin to decrease the risk of irritation. While no research suggests these products are actually necessary, some people do say they help keep odor at bay as they begin using natural deodorant. Below, you'll find answers to commonly asked questions about natural deodorant. Is natural deodorant as effective as regular deodorant? That depends on how you define \"effective.\" Remember, deodorant can reduce odor, but it can't stop sweat. It doesn't contain any ingredients that plug sweat glands to stop perspiration. Deodorant ingredients can help reduce and neutralize natural odors that result from underarm sweat mixing with bacteria. Both natural and regular deodorants also contain ingredients like cornstarch to absorb moisture for more comfort. Some people find this combination of ingredients effective for reducing BO, while others don't notice much difference. It may take some trial and error before you find a product that works for you. What's the most gentle natural deodorant? You'll often notice the term \"gentle\" used to describe natural products, including deodorants. Yet since this term isn't regulated, it doesn't have a standard definition. Natural deodorants commonly include ingredients like baking soda, alcohol, or essential oils. Many people can tolerate these ingredients, but others can't. As a result, the most gentle natural deodorant may be one that contains very few ingredients and has none of these potential irritants. What's the best natural deodorant for men? The qualities that make a deodorant ideal for men are typically the same qualities that make a deodorant ideal for anyone else: - an appealing scent, or none at all - odor reduction - lack of skin irritation - easy application - no white residue or staining Picking a natural deodorant generally comes down to personal preference, but people of all genders have plenty of options. If you prefer to avoid the floral scents typically marketed to women, you're in luck: Many natural deodorants feature more herbal or woody fragrances from essential oils. If you're hoping to switch from conventional to natural deodorant, or you want to try a new natural brand, you have a wide variety of products to choose from. You may find that you need to apply a natural deodorant more frequently than you would a conventional one, but your skin may still thank you for going natural.
