In fact, about [a third of Americans](https://www.cnn.com/2015/02/11/health/feat-alternative-medicine-study/index.html) currently use or have tried holistic medicine in the past. Holistic treatments take a more realistic approach to healing, going back to the root of the ailment and including a person's whole being in the treatment. These treatments include acupuncture, aromatherapy, homeopathy, nutrition, chiropractic, and more. Before you decide if a holistic approach is the right option for you, keep reading to learn more about the many benefits it can provide. Whole-Person Treatment With traditional medicine, a disease is seen as an entirely separate thing from the person who has it. This differs from most alternative medicines, which put the emphasis on whole-body care. These treatments involve treating the condition in the physical body, as well as the person's spiritual and emotional health. This is one of the main reasons that holistic healthcare is gaining in popularity. Use of Natural Resources and Methods When you go to a [holistic medicine treatment center in Boulder, CO,](https://holisticacare.com/) you will notice that they utilize mostly natural medicines, herbs, and methods in their treatment plans. The plans may include using proper nutrition, exercise, detoxification, and other natural, non-invasive remedies. While natural does not automatically mean better, many people prefer natural treatments because they have fewer side effects, and they don't contain any toxic substances. Personalized Attention Since holistic care focuses on the whole person, holistic practitioners usually provide their patients with more personal attention. Traditional doctors typically have limited time and energy to focus on each patient. But, because of their unique philosophy and different fee structures, holistic practitioners are able to prioritize each of their patients and offer them the one-on-one attention that they need and deserve. Remedy Numerous Conditions Holistic health care can be used to treat a wide range of conditions. There are treatment plans for most ailments, including insomnia, anxiety, depression, back problems, chronic pain, and more serious issues like lupus, early-stage cancer, and Lyme disease. For example, acupuncture can be used to treat anxiety, improve mood, boost focus, and even treat chronic aches and pains. Emphasis on Prevention Another major benefit of holistic care is its emphasis on prevention. While traditional medicine aims to intervene after the disease appears, most types of holistic practitioners promote \"well visits.\" These treatments focus on preventing diseases before they show their symptoms, along with caring for those who are already ill. Fewer Side Effects Holistic treatments also tend to result in fewer side effects. Prescription medications, procedures, and surgery all result in unwanted side effects like nausea, weight gain, pain, and more. Alternative practices are designed to limit or eliminate side effects that are common within traditional medicine. You will remain more alert and in touch with what is going on in your body and your mind, and you'll feel even better throughout the process of your treatment.
