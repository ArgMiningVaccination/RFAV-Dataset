PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS - The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA . For these p urposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, \" MiFID II \"); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (the \"Insuranc e Distribution Directive \"), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II ; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the \"EU Prospectus Regulation \"). Consequently , no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 ( as amended, the \"PRIIPs Regulation \") for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offeri ng or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

MiFID II Product Governance / target market - The Final Terms (or Pricing Supplement, in the case of Exempt Notes ) in respect of any Notes may include a legend entitled \"MiFID II Product Governance\" which will outline the target market assessment in respect of the Notes and which channels for distribution of the Notes are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a \"distributor \") should take i nto consideration the target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. A determination will be made in relation to each issue about whether, for the purpose of the Product Governance rules under EU Delegated Directive 2017/593 (the \"MiFID Product Governance Rules \"), any Dealer subscribing for any Notes is a manufacturer in respect of such Notes, but otherwise neither the Arranger nor the Dealers nor any of their respective affiliates will be a manufacturer for the purpose of the M iFID Product Governance Rules.

Legal investment considerations may restrict certain investments. The investment activities of cer tain investors are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, or review or regulation by certain authorities. Each potential investor should consult its legal advisers to determine whether and to what extent (1) Notes are legal investments for it, ( 2) Notes can be used as collateral for various types of borrowing, and (3) other restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge of any Notes. Financial institutions should consult their legal advisers or the appropriate regulators to determine the appropriat e treatment of Notes under any applicable risk -based capital or similar rules.

There is a wide range of factors which individually or togeth er could result in the Obligors becoming unable to make all payments due in respect of the Notes. The Obligors may not be aware of all relevant factors and certain factors which it currently deem not to be material, may become material as a result of the o ccurrence of events outside the Obligor 's control. The Obligors have identified in this Information Memorandum a number of factors which could materially adversely affect its business and ability to make payments due under the Notes. In addition, factors w hich are material for the purpose of assessing the market risks associated with Notes issued under the Programme are also described below. Prospective investors should also read the detailed information set out elsewhere in this Information Memorandum and reach their own views prior to making any investment decision. The following is a general discussion of certain risks typically associated with the Obligors and the acquisition of, and holding, Notes issued under the Programme. It does not consider the inv estor 's specific knowledge and/or understanding of risks typically associated with the Obligors and the acquisition of, and holding, Notes issued under the Programme, whether obtained through experience or circumstances that may apply to a particular inves tor. References in this \"Risk Factors \" section to \"Shell \" means Shell plc and all of its subsidiaries including Shell Finance. FACTORS THAT MAY AFF ECT THE OBLIGORS' AB ILITY TO FULFIL THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER NOTES ISS UED UNDER THE PROGRA MME Shell's operations and earnings are subject to competitive, economic, political, legal, regulatory, social, industry, business and financial risks, as discussed below. These could have a material adverse effect separately, or in combination, on Shell's operational performance, earnings or financial condition. Accordingly, investors should carefully consider these risks. Strategic risks Shell is exposed to macroeconomics risks including fluctuating prices of crude oil, natural gas, oi l products and chemicals The prices of crude oil, natural gas, oil products and chemicals are affected by supply and demand, both globally and regionally. Macroeconomic, geopolitical and technological uncertainties can also affect certain product ion costs and demand for Shell's products. Government actions may also affect the prices of crude oil, natural gas, oil products and chemicals. This could happen, for example, if governments promote the sale of lower -carbon electric vehicles or prohibit future sales of new diesel or gasoline vehicles, such as the phasing out in the UK that will come into force in 2030. Oil and gas prices can also move independently of each other. Factors that influence supply and demand include operational issues, natural disasters, weather, pandemics, such as the coronavirus outbreak (\"COVID -19\"), political instability, conflicts such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine (which commenced in February 2022) , economic conditions including inflation and actions by major oil and gas produci ng countries. In a low oil and gas price environment, Shell would generate less revenue from its Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses, and parts of those businesses could become less profitable, or could incur losses. Low oil and gas prices have resulted , and could continue to result, in the debooking of proved oil or gas reserves, if they become uneconomic in this type of price environment. Prolonged periods of low oil and gas prices, or rising costs, have resulted and could continue to result in project s being delayed or cancelled. Assets have been impaired in the past, and there could be impairments in the future. Low oil and gas prices have affected and could continue to affect Shell's ability to maintain its long -term capital investment and sharehold er distribution programme s. Prolonged periods of low oil and gas prices could adversely affect the financial, fiscal, legal, political and social stability of countries that rely significantly on oil and gas re venue . In a high oil and gas price environment , Shell could experience sharp increases in costs, and, under some production -sharing contracts, Shell's entitlement to proved reserves would be reduced. Higher prices could also reduce demand for 11 Shell's products, which could result in lower profitability , particularly in its Oil Products and Chemicals business. Higher prices can also lead to more capacity being built potentially resulting in an oversupplied market which would negatively affect Shell's Upstream, Integrated Gas, Oil Products and Chemicals businesses. Accordingly, price fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on Shell's earnings, cash flows and financial condition. Shell's ability to deliver competitive returns and pursue commercial opportunities depends in part on the accuracy of t he price assumptions Shell uses a range of oil and gas price assumptions, which it reviews on a periodic basis, to evaluate projects and commercial opportunities. If Shell's assumptions prove to be incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on Shell's earnings, cash flows and financial condition. Shell's ability to achieve strategic objectives depends on how it reacts to competitive forces Shell faces competition in all its businesses. Shell seeks to differentiate its services and products; though , many of its products are competing in commodity -type markets. Accordingly, failure to manage Shell's costs and its operational performance could result in a material adverse effect on Shell's earnings, cash flows and financial condition. Shell also compet es with state -owned hydrocarbon entities and state -backed utility entities with access to financial resources and local markets . Such entities could be motivated by political or other factors in making their business decisions . Accordingly, when bidding on new leases or projects, Shell could find itself at a competitive disadvantage because these state -owned entities may not require a competitive return. If Shell is unable to obtain competitive returns when bidding on new leases or projects, this could have a material adverse effect on Shell's earnings, cash flows and financial condition. Shell is seeking to execute divestments in the pursuit of its strategy. Shell may not be able to successfully divest these assets in line with its strategy Shell may not be able to successfully divest assets at acceptable prices or within the timeline envisaged due to market conditions or credit risk, resulting in increased pressure on its cash position and potential impairments. Additionally, in some cases, Shell has retain ed certain liabilities following divestments. Moreover, even in cases where Shell has not expressly retained certain liabilities, Shell may be held liable for past acts, failures to act or liabilities that are different from those foreseen. Shell may also face liabilities if a purchaser fails to honour all of its commitments. Accordingly, if Shell is unable to divest assets at acceptable prices or within its envisaged timeframe, this could have a material adverse effect on its earnings, cash flows and finan cial condition. Shell's ability to stay in step with the pace and extent of society's demands with regard to the energy transition to a low -carbon future The pace and extent of the energy transition to a low -carbon future could pose a risk to Shell if its own transition towards decarbonisation moves at a different speed to society. If Shell moves slower than society, customers may prefer a different supplier , which would adversely impact Shell's reputation and demand for its products. If Shell move s much fa ster than society, it risks investing in technologies, markets or low -carbon products that are unsuccessful because there is limited demand for them. These factors could have a material adverse effect on Shell's earnings, cash flows and financial condition . (also see risk factor entitled \" Rising climate change concerns have led and could lead to additional legal and/or regulatory measures which could result in project delays or cancellations, a decrease in demand for fossil fuels, potential litigation and a dditional compliance obligations \" below). Rising climate change concerns have led and could lead to additional legal and/or regulatory measures which could result in project delays or cancellations, a decrease in demand for fossil fuels, potential litigati on and additional compliance obligations Societal demand for urgent action on climate change has increased , especially since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report of 2018 on 1.5\u00b0C effectively made the aspirational goal of the Paris Agreement to limit the rise in global average temperature this century to 1.5 degrees Celsius as the default target . This increasing focus on climate change and drive for energy transition ha ve created a risk environment that is changing rapidly , resulting in a wide range of stakeholder actions at global, local and business levels. The potential impact and likelihood of the associated exposure for Shell could vary across different time horizons, 12 depending on the specific components of the risk. Shell expect s that a growing share of its greenhouse gas (\"GHG \") emissions will be subject to regulation, resulting in increased compliance costs and operational restrictions. Regulators may seek to limit certain oil and gas projects or make it more difficult to obtai n required permits. Additionally, climate activists are challenging the grant of new and exi sting regulatory permits. Shell expect s that these challenges are likely to continue and could delay or prohibit operations in certain cases. Achieving Shell's target of becoming net zero on all emissions from its operations could result in additional costs. Shell also expect s that actions by customers to reduce their emissions will continue to lower demand and potentially affect prices for fossil fuels, as will GHG emissions regulation through taxes, fees and/or other incentives. This could be a factor contributing to additional provisions for Shell's assets and result in lower earnings, cancelled projects and potential impairment of certain assets. The physical effe cts of climate change such as, but not limited to, increases in temperature and sea levels and fluctuations in water levels could also adversely affect Shell's operations and supply chains. Certain investors have decided to divest their investments in foss il fuel companies. If this continue s, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of Shell's securities and Shell's ability to access capital markets. Stakeholder groups are also putting pressure on commercial and investment banks to stop financin g fossil fuel companies. According to press reports, some financial institutions have started to limit their exposure to fossil fuel projects. Consequently , Shell's ability to use financing for these types of future projects may be adversely affected . This could also adversely impact Shell's potential partners' ability to finance their portion of costs, either through equity or debt. In some countries, governments , regulators , organisations and individuals have filed lawsuits seeking to hold fossil fuel com panies liable for costs associated with climate change. While Shell believes these lawsuits to be without merit, losing could have a material adverse effect on its earnings, cash flows and financial condition. For example, in May 2021, the District Court i n The Hague, the Netherlands, ruled that, by 2030, Shell must reduce, from its consolidated subsidiaries, its Scope 1 net emissions by 45 per cent. from its 2019 levels and use its best efforts to reduce its Scope 2 and Scope 3 net emissions by 45 per cent . from its 2019 levels. In 2019, Shell's Scope 1 emissions from its consolidated subsidiaries were approximately 86 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (COe). Shell expects to see additional regulatory requirements to provide disclosures related to climate risks and the impact of such climate risks on business performance. Rising climate change concerns and ef fects of the energy transition have led and could lead to a decrease in demand and potentially affect prices for fossil fuels. If Shell is unable to find economically viable, publicly acceptable solutions that reduce its GHG emissions and/or GHG intensity for new and existing projects and for the products it sells , Shell could experience financial penalties or extra costs, delayed or cancelled projects, potential impairments of its assets, additional provisions and/or reduced production and product sales. T his could have a material adverse effect on Shell's earnings, cash flows and financial condition. See also \" Shell plc and Shell International Finance B.V. - Litigation Update and Contingent Liabilities - Climate Change Litigation \" below for further informa tion. Shell operates in more than 70 countries that have differing degrees of political, legal and fiscal stability. This exposes Shell to a wide range of political developments that could result in changes to contractual terms, laws and regulations. In ad dition, Shell and its joint arrangements and associates face the risk of litigation and disputes worldwide Developments in politics, laws and regulations can and do affect Shell's operations. Potential impacts include: forced divestment of assets; expropri of property; cancellation or forced renegotiation of contract rights; additional taxes including windfall taxes, restrictions on deductions and retroactive tax claims; antitrust claims; changes to trade compliance regulations; price controls; local c ontent requirements; foreign exchange controls; changes to environmental regulations; changes to regulatory interpretations and enforcement; and changes to disclosure requirements. Any of these, individually or in aggregate, could have a material adverse e ffect on Shell's earnings, cash flows and financial condition. Since 2020, many governments have run deficits to deal with the economic impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic. Given the ongoing nature of the pandemic, there will be uncertain long -term fiscal co nsequences, with possible subsequent effects on government policies that affect Shell's business interests. 13 From time to time, social and political factors play a role in unprecedented and unanticipated judicial outcomes that could adversely affect Shell. Non-compliance with policies and regulations could result in regulatory investigations, litigation and, ultimately, sanctions (also see risk factor entitled \" Violations of trade compliance laws and regulations, including sanctions, carry fines and expose S hell and its employees to criminal sanctions and civil suits \" below) . Certain governments and regulatory bodies have, in Shell's opinion, exceeded their constitutional authority by: attempting unilaterally to amend or cancel existing agreements or arrangem ents; failing to honour existing contractual commitments; and seeking to adjudicate disputes between private litigants. Additionally, certain governments have adopted laws and regulations that could potentially force Shell to violate other countries' laws and regulations, therefore potentially subjecting Shell to both criminal and civil sanctions. Such developments and outcomes could have a material adverse effect on Shell's earnings, cash flows and financial condition. Operational risks Russia's invasion o f Ukraine has affected the safety and security of Shell's people and operations in these and neighbouring countries. The subsequent sanctions and export controls and the evolving geopolitical situation have caused wide -ranging challenges to Shell's operati ons which could contin ue in the medium to longer -term Russia's recent invasion of Ukraine poses wide -ranging challenges to Shell's operations. The immediate impacts include the safety and security of Shell's people and operations in these and neighbouring countries. The subsequent sanctions and export controls imposed by countries around the world could have a material impact on a number of Shell's activities, including supply, trading and treasury activities. More sanctions and export controls are expected . Given the evolving situation, there are many other unknown factors and events that could materially impact Shell's operations, which may be temporary or more permanent in nature. These risks and future events could impact Shell's supply chain, commodity prices, credit, commodity trading, treasury and legal risks. The tensions also create heightened cyber -security threats to Shell's information technology infrastructure. This geopolitical situation may influence Shell's future investment and financial dec isions. Any of these factors, individually or in aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on Shell's earnings, cash flows and financial condition. See also \" Shell plc and Shell International Finance B.V. - Recent Developments \" below for further inf ormation. Shell's future hydrocarbon production depends on the delivery of large and integrated projects, as well as on Shell's ability to replace proved oil and gas reserves Shell faces numerous challenges in developing capital projects, especially those which are large and integrated. Challenges include uncertain geology, frontier conditions, the existence and availability of necessary technology and engineering resources, the availability of skilled labour, the existence of transportation infrastructure, project delays, the expiration of licences and potential cost overruns, as well as technical, fiscal, regulatory, political and other conditions. These challenges are particularly relevant in certain developing and emerging - market countries, in frontier a reas and in deepwater fields, such as off the coast of Mexico . Shell may fail to assess or manage these and other risks properly. Such potential obstacles could impair Shell's delivery of these projects, its ability to fulfil the value potential at the tim e of the project investment approval, and/or its ability to fulfil related contractual commitments. These could lead to impairments and could have a material adverse effect on its earnings, cash flows and financial condition. Future oil and gas production will depend on Shell's access to new proved reserves through exploration, negotiations with governments and other owners of proved reserves and acquisitions, as well as on developing and applying new technologies and recovery processes to existing fields. Failure to replace proved reserves could result in lower future production, potentially having a material adverse effect on Shell's earnings, cash flows and financial condition. The estimation of proved oil and gas reserves involves subjective judgements b ased on available information and the application of complex rules; therefore subsequent downward adjustments are possible The estimation of proved oil and gas reserves involves subjective judgements and determinations based on available geological, techni cal, contractual and economic information. Estimates could change because of new 14 information from production or drilling activities, or changes in economic factors, including changes in the price of oil or gas and changes in the regulatory policies of host governments or other events. Estimates could also be altered by acquisitions and divestments, new discoveries, and extensions of existing fields and mines, as well as the application of improved recovery techniques. Published proved oil and gas reserves e stimates could also be subject to correction due to errors in the application of published rules and changes in guidance. Downward adjustments could indicate lower future production volumes and could also lead to impairment of assets. This could have a mat erial adverse effect on Shell's earnings, cash flows and financial condition. The nature of Shell's operations exposes Shell, and the communities in which Shell works, to a wide range of health, safety, security and environment risks The health, safety, se curity and environmental (\" HSSE \") risks to which Shell, and the communities in which Shell works, are potentially exposed cover a wide spectrum, given the geographic range, operational diversity and technical complexity of Shell's operations. These risks i nclude the effects of natural disasters (including weather events), earthquakes, social unrest, personal health and safety lapses, and crime. If a major HSSE risk materialises, such as an explosion or hydrocarbon spill, this could result in injuries, loss of life, environmental harm, disruption of business activities, and loss or suspension of Shell's licence to operate or ability to bid on mineral rights. Accordingly, this would have a material adverse effect on Shell's earnings, cash flows and financial c ondition. Shell's operations are subject to extensive HSSE regulatory requirements that often change and are likely to become more stringent over time. Governments could require operators to adjust their future production plans, as has been done in the Net herlands, affecting production and costs. Shell could incur significant additional costs in the future due to compliance with HSSE requirements or as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, laws and regulations, such as fines, penalties, clean -up costs and third -party claims. Therefore, HSSE risks, should they materialise, could have a material adverse effect on Shell's earnings, cash flows and financial condition. A further erosion of the business and operating environment in Nigeria could have a material adverse effect on Shell In its Nigerian operations, Shell faces various risks and adverse conditions. These include: security issues surrounding the safety of Shell's people, host communities and operations; sabotage and theft; Shell's ability to enforce existing contractual rights; litigation; limited infrastructure; potential legislation that could increase Shell's taxes or costs of operations; the effect of lower oil and gas prices on the government budget; and regional instability created by mi litant activities. Any of these risks or adverse conditions could have a material adverse effect on Shell's earnings, cash flows and financial condition. An erosion of Shell's business reputation could have a material adverse effect on its brand, its abili ty to secure new resources or access capital markets , attract staff and its licence to operate Shell's reputation is an important asset. The Shell General Business Principles (the \" Principles \") govern how Shell and its individual companies conduct their af fairs, and the Shell Code of Conduct (the \" Code \") instructs employees and contract staff on how to behave in line with the Principles. Shell's challenge is to ensure that all employees and contract staff, comply with the Principles and the Code. Real or pe rceived failures of governance or regulatory compliance or a perceived lack of understanding of how Shell's operations affect surrounding communities could harm Shell's reputation. Societal expectations of businesses are increasing, with a greater focus o n business ethics, quality of products, contribution to society, minimising environmental impact and maximising safety. There is increasing focus on the role of oil and gas in the context of climate change and energy transition. This could negatively affec t Shell's brand, reputation and licence to operate, which could impact Shell's ability to deliver its strategy and meet consumer demand for Shell branded and non -branded products, harm its ability to secure new resources and contracts and limit Shell's abi lity to access capital markets or attract staff. Many other factors, including the materialisation of the risks discussed in several of the other risk factors, could negatively impact Shell's reputation and could have a material adverse effect on its earni ngs, cash flows and financial condition. 15 Many of Shell's major projects and operations are conducted in joint arrangements or associates. This could reduce Shell's degree of control, as well as its ability to identify and manage risks In cases where Shell is not the operator, it has limited influence over, and control of, the behaviour, performance and costs of operation of such joint arrangements or associates. Despite not having control, Shell could still be exposed to the risks associated with these oper ations, including reputational, litigation (where joint and several liability could apply) and government sanction risks. For example, Shell's partners or members of a joint arrangement or an associate (particularly local partners in developing countries) may not be able to meet their financial or other obligations to the projects, threatening the viability of a given project. Where Shell is the operator of a joint arrangement, the other partner(s) could still be able to veto or block certain decisions, whi ch could be to Shell's overall detriment. Accordingly, where Shell has limited influence, Shell is exposed to operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on its earnings, cash flows and financial condition. Shell relies heavily on informati on technology systems for its operations The operation of many of Shell's business processes depends on reliable information technology (\" IT\") systems. Shell's IT systems are increasingly concentrated in terms of geography and number of systems. They are dependent on key contractors supporting the delivery of IT services. The COVID -19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions have altered the nature of the IT threat, increasing the frequency and ingenuity of malware attacks and increasing the temptation to attack targets for financial gain. In 2021, Shell was impacted by data security breaches, including one involving a third -party supplier who gained unauthorised access to various files during a limited time period, some of which contained personal data. The facto rs described above continue to contribute to potential breaches and disruptions of critical IT services. If such breaches are not detected early and responded to effectively, they could harm Shell's reputation and have a material adverse effect on its earn ings, cash flows and financial condition . See also \"Violations of data protection laws carry fines and expose Shell and/or its employees to criminal sanctions and civil suits \" below. Shell's operations expose it to social instability, criminality, civil un rest, terrorism, piracy, cyber -disruption, acts of war and risks of pandemic diseases, that could have a material adverse effect on its business As seen in recent years, the above risks can manifest themselves in the countries where Shell operate s and elsewhere. These risks affect people and assets and potential risks include: acts of terrorism ; acts of criminality including maritime piracy , cyber -espionage or disruptive cyber -attacks; conflicts including war such as Russia's recent invasion of Ukraine and malicious acts carried out by individuals within Shell as well as civil unrest ; and environmental and climate activism (including disruptions by non -governmental and political organisations). These risks can threaten the safe operation of Shell's facilitie s and the transport ation of products. They can harm the well -being of Shell's people, inflict loss of life and injuries, damage the environment and disrupt operational activities. The occurrence of any of the se risks could have a material adverse effect on Shell's earnings, cash flows and financial condition. Production from the Groningen field in the Netherlands causes earthquakes that affect local communities Shell and ExxonMobil are 50:50 shareholders in Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij B.V. (\" NAM \"). An important part of NAM's gas production comes from the onshore Groningen gas field, in which EBN, a Dutch government entity, has a 40 per cent. interest and NAM a 60 per cent. interest. The gas field is in the process of being closed down due to earthquake s induced by gas production. Some of these earthquakes have damaged houses and other structures in the region, resulting in complaints and lawsuits from the local community. The Dutch government has announced that it intends to accelerate the close -down, b ringing the end of production forward from 2030 to possibly during 2022. The exact shut -in date depends on security of supply considerations and is still to be decided. While Shell expects the earlier closing down of the Groningen gas field to further reduce the number and strength of earthquakes in the region, any additional earthquakes could have further adverse effects on Shell's earnings, cash flows and financial condition. See also \" Shell plc and Shell International Finance B.V. - Litigation Update and Contingent Liabilities - NAM (Groningen gas field) Litigation \" below for further information. 16 Shell's future performance depends on the successful development and deployment of new technologies and new products Technology and innovation are essential to S hell's efforts to meet the world's energy demands in a competitive way. If Shell does not develop and deploy the required technology and new products, or fully leverage its data effectively in a timely and cost -effective manner, there could be a material a dverse effect on the delivery of Shell's strategy and its licence to operate. Shell operates in environments where advanced technologies are utilised. In developing new technologies and new products there is the possibility of unknown or unforeseeable technological failures or environmental and health effects that could harm Shell's reputation and licence to operate or expose it to litigation or sanctions. The associated costs of new technology are sometimes underestimated, or delays can occur in developmen t and rollout . If Shell is unable to develop the right technologies and products in a timely and cost -effective manner, or if Shell develops technologies and products that adversely impact the environment or health of individuals, there could be a material adverse effect on Shell's earnings, cash flows and financial condition. Shell is exposed to treasury and trading risks, including liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and credit risk. Shell is affected by the global macroeconomic env ironment as well as financial and commodity market conditions Shell's subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates are subject to differing economic and financial market conditions around the world. Political or economic instability affects such markets . Shell uses debt instruments, such as bonds and commercial paper, to raise significant amounts of capital. Should Shell's access to debt markets become more difficult, the potential impact on its liquidity could have a material adverse effect on its opera tions. Shell's financing costs could also be affected by interest rate fluctuations or any credit rating deterioration. Shell is exposed to changes in currency values and to exchange controls as a result of its substantial international operations. Shell's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. However, to a material extent, Shell holds assets and is exposed to liabilities in other currencies. While Shell undertakes some foreign exchange hedging, it does not do so for all activities. Even where hedging is in place, it may not function as expected. Commodity trading is an important component of Shell's Upstream, Integrated Gas, Oil Products and Chemicals businesses. Processing, managing and monitoring many trading transactions across the world, some of them complex, exposes Shell to operational and market risks, including commodity price risks. Shell uses derivative instruments , such as futures and contracts for di fference , to hedge market risks, however, it does not hedge all activities and even where hedgin g is in place, it may not function as expected . Shell is exposed to credit risk and its counterparties could fail or could be unable to meet their payment and/or performance obligations under contractual arrangements. Although Shell does not have significa nt direct exposure to sovereign debt, it is possible that Shell's partners and customers may have exposure which could impair their ability to meet their obligations. In addition, Shell's pension plans may invest in government bonds, and therefore could be affected by a sovereign debt downgrade or other default. If any of the risks set out above materialise, they could have a material adverse effect on Shell's earnings, cash flows and financial condition. Shell has substantial pension commitments, the fund ing of which is subject to capital market risks Liabilities associated with defined benefit pension plans can be significant, as can the cash funding requirement of such plans , and both depend on various assumptions. Volatility in capital markets or govern ment policies, and the resulting consequences for investment performance and interest rates, as well as changes in assumptions for mortality, retirement age or pensionable remuneration at retirement, could result in significant changes to the funding level of future liabilities. Shell operates a number of defined benefit pension plans and, in case of a shortfall, Shell could be required to make substantial cash contributions (depending on the applicable local regulations) resulting in a material adverse eff ect on Shell's earnings, cash flows and financial condition. 17 Shell mainly self -insures its risk exposure. Shell could incur significant losses from different types of risks that are not covered by insurance from third -party insurers Shell insurance subsidi aries provide hazard insurance coverage to other Shell entities and only reinsure a portion of their risk exposures. Such reinsurance would not provide any material coverage in the event of a large -scale safety and environmental incident. Accordingly, in t he event of a material safety and environmental incident, there would be no material proceeds available from third -party insurance companies to meet Shell's obligations. Therefore, Shell may incur significant losses from different types of risks that are n ot covered by insurance from third -party insurers, potentially resulting in a material adverse effect on Shell's earnings, cash flows and financial condition. Conduct risks Shell is exposed to conduct risk in its trading operations Commodity trading is an important component of Shell's Upstream, Integrated Gas and Downstream businesses and is integrated with Shell's supply business. Shell's commodity trading entities are subject to many regulations including requirements for standards of conduct. The risk o f ineffective controls , poor oversight of trading activities and the risk that traders could deliberately operate outside compliance limits and controls, either individually or as a group, has materialised in the past and has resulted in losses and may res ult in further losses in the future. This could have a material adverse effect on Shell's earnings, cash flows and financial condition. Violations of antitrust and competition laws carry fines and expose Shell and/or its employees to criminal sanctions and civil suits Antitrust and competition laws apply to Shell and its joint ventures and associates in the vast majority of countries in which Shell does business. Shell and its joint ventures and associates have been fined for violations of antitrust and com petition laws in the past . This include s a number of fines imposed by the European Commission Directorate -General for Competition (\" DG COMP \"). Due to the DG COMP's fining guidelines, any future conviction of Shell or any of its joint ventures or associates for violation of European Union competition law could result in significantly larger fines and have a material adverse effect on Shell. Violation of antitrust laws is a criminal offence in many countries, and individuals can be imprisoned or fined. In cer tain circumstances, Shell's directors may receive director disqualification orders. It is now common for persons or corporations allegedly injured by antitrust violations to sue for damages. Any violation of these laws or harm to Shell's reputation could h ave a material adverse effect on its earnings, cash flows and financial condition. Violations of anti -bribery, tax evasion and anti -money laundering laws carry fines and expose Shell and/or its employees to criminal sanctions and civil suits and ancillary consequences (such as debarment and the revocation of licences) Anti-bribery, tax evasion and anti -money laundering laws apply to Shell, its joint ventures and associates in all countries in which Shell does business. Shell and its joint ventures and assoc iates in the past have settled with the U nited States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC \") regarding violations of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Any violation of anti -bribery, tax evasion or anti -money laundering laws including those potentia l violations associated with the investment of Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company Ltd. (\"SNEPCO \") in Nigerian oil block OPL 245 and the 2011 settlement of litigation pertaining to that block (see \"Shell plc and Shell International Finance B.V . - Litigation Update and Contingent Liabilities - OPL 245 \" below for further information) , could have a material adverse effect on Shell's earnings, cash flows and financial condition. Violations of data protection laws carry fines and expose Shell and/o r its employees to criminal sanctions and civil suits Data protection laws apply to Shell and its joint arrangements and associates in the vast majority of countries where Shell does business. Since many countries in which Shell operate s have data protecti on laws and regulations, Shell has adopted Binding Corp orate Rules which means Shell applies one consistent standard to data protection, across the Shell Group and globally. The EU General Data Protection Regulation ( \"GDPR \") forms the basis of Shell 's Bind ing Corporate Rules. With data privacy legislation now in force in the USA, the risk of class actions has increased. Class actions after large -scale data breaches are increasingly common. Shell 18 companies are increasingly processing large volumes of persona l data as Shell continues to acquire small companies with relatively large amounts of customer data as part of its energy transition. The COVID -19 pandemic has increased the level of processing of sensitive personal data, for example , to confirm the health or vaccination status of Shell employees and visitors , with some governments requir ing immediate disclosure of this information. Shell must be able to update its guidance to employees quickly, so as to reflect the requirements set out by the relevant cou ntry's legislation on COVID -19. In some countries that are key to Shell's business operations, such as China, legislation continues to be amended or introduced. Shell must be able to adapt dynamically to such legislative changes and be capable of updating its internal programmes , if necessary. Many countries require mandatory notification of data breaches in certain situations. In these circumstances , Shell might be required to report to affected individuals and regulators in the relevant countries. Non -compliance with data protection laws could harm individuals and expose Shell to regulatory investigations. This could result in : fines, which could be up to 4 per cent. of global annual turnover in case of breaches under the GDPR; orders to stop processing ce rtain data; harm to Shell 's reputation; and loss of the trust of existing and potential customers, stakeholders, governments and employees. With regard to data breaches, Shell notified a number of data privacy regulators in 2021 of personal data breaches, and some investigations are still ongoing. As at the date of this Information Memorandum , no material fines have been imposed, however no assurance can be provided that future breaches would have similar outcomes. In addition to imposing fines, regulators may also issue orders to stop processing personal data, which could disrupt operations. Shell could also be subject to litigation from persons or entities allegedly affected by data protection violations. Violation of data protection laws is a criminal off ence in some countries, and individuals can be imprisoned or fined. Any violation of these laws or harm to Shell 's reputation could have a material adverse effect on Shell 's earnings, cash flows and financial condition. Violations of trade compliance laws and regulations, including sanctions, carry fines and expose Shell and its employees to criminal sanctions and civil suits Shell uses \" trade compliance \" as an umbrella term for various national and international laws designed to regulate the movement of it ems across national boundaries and restrict or prohibit trade and other dealings with certain parties. For example, the European Union and the USA continue to impose comprehensive sanctions on countries and territories such as Syria, North Korea and the Crimea region of Ukraine , and continue to adopt targeted restrictions and prohibitions on certain transactions in countries such as Venezuela and Russia. The USA continues to have comprehensive sanctions against Iran and Cuba. The European Union and some nations continue to maintain targeted sanctions against Iran. The European Union and the USA introduced sectoral sanctions against Venezuela in 2017, which the USA expanded in 2018 and 2019. The USA sanctions primarily target the government of Venezuela and t he oil industry. In 2014, the European Union and the USA imposed additional restrictions and controls directed at defined oil and gas activities in Russia which remain in force. The USA introduced further restrictions regarding Russia in 2017, subsequentl y expanding them in 2018. In February 2022, countries around the world began imposing additional sanctions and export controls against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine including, regional trade bans, designations of entities (including Russian banks and state-owned entities) and individuals as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Parties (SDNs), and restrictions on access by Russia to financial systems. As at the date of this Information Memorandum, e xport controls have also been introduced targeti ng Russian defence, aerospace and maritime sectors and more sanctions and export controls are expected. A s at the date of this Information Memorandum, a number of countries have also implemented new sanctions against Belarus for its role in the Russian inv asion. Many other nations are also adopting trade compliance programmes similar to those administered by the European Union and the USA. Since January 2021, the UK has maintained a legal framework for trade compliance that is separate and distinct from tho se of the European Union and USA. Abiding by all the laws and regulations on trade compliance and sanctions can sometimes be complex and challenging because of factors such as the expansion of sanctions, the frequent addition of prohibited parties, the number of markets in which Shell operates, the risk of differences in how jurisdictions apply sanctions and the 19 large number of transactions Shell processes. Shell has voluntarily self -disclosed potential violations of sanctions in the past. The COVID -19 pan demic has increased trade compliance risks, because of factors such as growing state involvement in business dealings, the need to maintain and develop business opportunities and cross -border movement of goods and technologies, and the increasing likelihoo d that counterparties will change ownership as the economic crisis continues. Any violation of sanctions could lead to loss of import or export privileges and significant penalties on or prosecution of Shell or its employees. This could harm Shell's reput ation and have a material adverse effect on Shell's earnings, cash flows and financial condition. Other risks Shell plc 's Articles of Association determine the jurisdiction for shareholder disputes. This could limit shareholder remedies Shell plc 's Articl es of Association generally require that all disputes between its shareholders in such capacity and Shell plc or its subsidiaries (or its Directors or former Directors), or between Shell plc and its Directors or former Directors, be exclusively resolved by arbitration in The Hague, the Netherlands, under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. Shell plc 's Articles of Association also provide that, if this provision is to be determined invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the d ispute could only be brought before the courts of England and Wales. Accordingly, the ability of shareholders to obtain monetary or other relief, including in respect of securities law claims, could be determined in accordance with these provisions. FACTOR S WHICH ARE MATERIAL FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSESSING THE MARKET RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH NOTES ISSUED UNDER THE PROGRAMME Risks related to the structure of a particular issue of Notes A wide range of Notes may be issued under the Programme. A number of these Not es may have features which contain particular risks for potential investors. Set out below is a description of certain such features: Notes subject to optional redemption by the Issuer An optional redemption feature is likely to limit the market value of N otes. During any period when the relevant Issuer may elect to redeem Notes, the market value of those Notes generally will not rise substantially above the price at which they can be redeemed. This also may be true prior to any redemption period. The relev ant Issuer may be expected to redeem Notes when its cost of borrowing is lower than the interest rate on the Notes. At those times, an investor generally would not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds at an effective interest rate as high as the int erest rate on the Notes being redeemed and may only be able to do so at a significantly lower rate. Potential investors should consider reinvestment risk in light of other investments available at that time. Variable rate Notes with a multiplier or other l everage factor Notes with variable interest rates can be volatile investments. If they are structured to include multipliers or other leverage factors, or caps or floors, or any combination of those features or other similar related features, their market values may be even more volatile than those for securities that do not include those features. Inverse Floating Rate Notes Inverse Floating Rate Notes have an interest rate equal to a fixed rate minus a rate based upon a reference rate such as EURIBOR . The market values of those Notes typically are more volatile than market values of other conventional floating rate debt securities based on the same reference rate (and with otherwise comparable terms). Inverse Floating Rate Notes are more volatile because a n increase in the reference rate not only decreases the interest rate of the Notes, but may also reflect an increase in prevailing interest rates, which further adversely affects the market value of these Notes. Fixed/Floating Rate Notes Fixed/Floating Rat e Notes which bear interest at a rate that the relevant Issuer may elect to convert from a fixed rate to a floating rate, or from a floating rate to a fixed rate. Such a feature to convert the interest basis, and any 20 conversion of the interest basis, may affect the secondary market in, and the market value of , such Notes as the change of interest basis may result in a lower interest return for Noteholders. Where the Notes convert from a fixed rate to a floating rate, the spread on the Fixed/Floating Rate No tes may be less favourable than then prevailing spreads on comparable Floating Rate Notes tied to the same reference rate. In addition, the new floating rate at any time may be lower than the rates on other Notes. Where the Notes convert from a floating rate to a fixed rate, the fixed rate may be lower than then prevailing rates on those Notes and could affect the market value of an investment in the relevant Notes. Notes issued at a substantial discount or premium The market values of securities issued at a substantial discount or premium to their nominal amount tend to fluctuate more in relation to general changes in interest rates than do prices for conventional interest -bearing securities. Generally, the longer the remaining term of the securities, the g reater the price volatility as compared to conventional interest -bearing securities with comparable maturities. The regulation and reform of \"benchmark \" rates of interest and indices may adversely affect the value of Notes linked to or referencing such \"benchmarks \" Interest rates and indices which are deemed to be \"benchmarks\" (including EURIBOR ) are the subject of national and international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some of these reforms are already effective whilst others are still to be implemented. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on any Notes linked to o r referencing such a \"benchmark\". The EU Benchmarks Regulation applies, subject to certain transitional provisions, to the provision of benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of a benchmark within the EU. Among other things, it (i) requires benchmark administrators to be authorised or registered (or, if non -EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent regime or otherwise recognised or endorsed) and (ii) prevent certain uses by EU supervised entities of \"benchmarks\" of administrat ors that are not authorised or registered (or, if non -EU based, not deemed equivalent or recognised or endorsed). The UK Benchmarks Regulation among other things, applies to the provision of benchmarks and the use of a benchmark in the United Kingdom. Simi larly, it prohibits the use in the United Kingdom by United Kingdom supervised entities of benchmarks of administrators that are not authorised by the FCA or registered on the FCA register (or, if non -United Kingdom based, not deemed equivalent or recognis ed or endorsed). The EU Benchmarks Regulation and/or the UK Benchmarks Regulation, as applicable, could have a material impact on any Notes linked to or referencing a \"benchmark\", in particular, if the methodology or other terms of the \"benchmark\" are chan ged in order to comply with the requirements of the EU Benchmarks Regulation and/or the UK Benchmarks Regulation, as applicable . Such changes could, among other things, have the effect of reducing, increasing or otherwise affecting the volatility of the pu blished rate or level of the \"benchmark\". More broadly, any of the international or national reforms, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of \"benchmarks\", could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the settin g of a \"benchmark\" and complying with any such regulations or requirements. The euro risk free -rate working group for the euro area has published a set of guiding principles and high level recommendations for fallback provisions in, amongst other things, new euro denominated cash products (including bonds) referencing EURIBOR. The guiding principles indicate, among st other things, that continuing to reference EURIBOR in relevant contracts (without robust fallback provisions) may increase the risk to the euro area financial system. On 11 May 2021, the euro risk -free rate working group published its recommendations on EURIBOR fallback trigger events and fallback rates. Such factors may have the following effects on certain \"benchmarks\": (i) discouraging marke t participants from continuing to administer or contribute to the \"benchmark\"; (ii) triggering changes in the rules or methodologies used in the \"benchmark\" and/or (iii) leading to the disappearance of the \"benchmark\". Any of the above changes or any other consequential changes as a result of international or national reforms or other initiatives or 21 investigations, could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any Notes linked to, referencing or otherwise dependent (in whole or in part) upon, a \"benchmark\". The Terms and Conditions of the Notes provide for certain fallback arrangements in the event that a Benchmark Event occurs, including if an Original Reference Rate and/or any page on which an Original Reference Rate may be published, becomes unavailable, or if the relevant Issuer, the Calculation Agent, the Trustee , any Paying Agent or any other party responsible for the calculation of the Rate of Interest (as specified in the applicable Final Terms or, in the case of Exempt Notes, the Pricing Supplement ), as applicable, are no longer permitted lawfully to calculate interest on any Notes by reference to such an Original Refer ence Rate . Such fallback arrangements include the possibility that the Rate of Interest could be set by reference to a Successor Rate or an Alternative Rate (both as defined in the Terms and Conditions), with the application of an adjustment spread (which may be positive, negative or zero) and may include amendments to the Terms and Conditions of the Notes to ensure the proper operation of the successor or replacement benchmark, all as determined by the relevant Issuer following consultation with the Independent Adviser (as defined in the Terms and Conditions) , if the relevant Issuer is able to appoint one , and acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner . It is possible that the adoption of a Successor Rate or Alternative Rate , including with the application of an adjustment spread , may result in any Notes linked to or referencing an Original Reference Rate performing differently (which may include payment of a lower Rate of Interest) than they would if the Original Reference Rate were to continue to apply in its current form. There is also a risk that the relevant fallback provisions may not operate as expected or intended at the relevant time . Furthermore, in certain circumstances, the ultimate fallback for the purposes of calculation of the Rate of Interest for a particular Interest Period may result in the Rate of Interest for the last preceding Inte rest Period being used. This may result in the effective application of a fixed rate for Floating Rate Notes based on the rate which was last observed on the Relevant Screen Page. Investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own a ssessment about the potential risks imposed by the EU Benchmarks Regulation and/or the UK Benchmarks Regulation, as applicable, or any of the international or national reforms and the possible application of the benchmark replacement provisions of Notes in making any investment decision with respect to any Notes linked to or referencing a \"benchmark\". The market continues to develop in relation to risk free rates (including SONIA ) as reference rates Where the applicable Final Terms (or, in the case of Exemp t Notes, the Pricing Supplement) for a Series of Floating Rate Notes identifies that the Reference Rate for such Notes will be Compounded Daily SONIA, the Rate of Interest will be determined on the basis of Compounded Daily S ONIA or by reference to a speci fied index (all as further described in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes) . SONIA differ s from the London Interbank Offered Rate (\" LIBOR \") in a number of material respects, including (without limitation) that SONIA is a backwards -looking, risk -free ove rnight rate, whereas LIBOR is expressed on the basis of a forward -looking term and includes a risk -element based on inter -bank lending. As such, investors should be aware that SONIA may behave materially differently as an interest reference rate for Notes issued under the Programme from LIBOR or other inter -bank offered rates . The use of SONIA as a reference rate for Euro bonds is nascent, and is subject to change and development, both in terms of the substance of the calculation and in the development and adoption of market infrastructure for the issuance and trading of debt securities referencing SONIA. Accordingly, prospective investors in any Notes referencing Compounded Daily SONIA should be aware that the market continues to develop in relation to SONIA as a reference rate in the capital markets and its adoption as an alternative to inter-bank rates such as LIBOR. Market participants , industry groups and/or central bank -led working groups have explored compounded and weighted average rates and observatio n methodologies for SONIA (including so -called 'shift' , 'lag' and 'lock -out' methodologies) and forward -looking 'term' SONIA reference rates (which seek to measure the market's forward expectation of an average SONIA rate over a designated term) have also been, and are being, developed . The adoption of SONIA may also see component inputs into swap rates or other composite rates transferring from LIBOR or another reference rate to SONIA. The market or a significant part thereof may adopt SONIA in a way that differs significantly from that set out in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes issued under the Programme . In addition, the methodology for determining the SONIA Compounded Index by reference to which the Rate of Interest in respect of certain 22 Notes may be calculated could change during the life of any Notes. Furthermore, each of the Issuers may in future issue debt securities referencing SONIA that differ materially in terms of interest determination when compared with any previous SONIA -referencing Note s issued by it under the Programme. The nascent development of SONIA as an interest reference rate for the Euro bond markets and the market infrastructure for adopting such rates could result in reduced liquidity or increased volatility or could otherwise a ffect the market price of any SONIA -referencing Notes issued under the Programme from time to time. Furthermore, t he Rate of Interest on Notes which reference Compounded Daily SONIA is only capable of being determined immediately prior to the relevant Inte rest Payment Date. It may be difficult for investors in Notes which reference SONIA to estimate reliably the amount of interest which will be payable on such Notes, and some investors may be unable or unwilling to trade such Notes without changes to their IT systems, both of which factors could adversely impact the liquidity of such Notes. Because of the delay between the final day on which SONIA is observed in connection with any interest determination and the related Interest Payment Date, increases in th e level of SONIA which occur during such period will not be reflected in the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date, and any such increase will instead be reflected in the following Interest Period. Further, in contrast to LIBOR -based debt securiti es, if Notes referencing SONIA become due and payable as a result of an Event of Default under Condition 9, or are otherwise redeemed early on a date which is not an Interest Payment Date, the final Rate of Interest payable in respect of such Notes shall o nly be determined immediately prior to the date on which the Notes become due and payable, and shall not be reset thereafter. In addition, t he manner of adoption or application of SONIA -based rates in the Eurobond markets may differ materially compared wit h the application and adoption of SONIA -based rates in other markets, such as the derivatives and loan markets. Investors should carefully consider how any mismatch between the adoption of SONIA -based reference rate s across these markets may impact any hed ging or other financial arrangements which they may put in place in connection with any acquisition, holding or disposal of Notes referencing SONIA. Investors should carefully consider these matters when making their investment decision with respect to an y such Notes. Risks relating to Notes denominated in Renminbi Set out below is a description of the principal risks which may be relevant to an investor in Notes denominated in Renminbi (\"Renminbi Notes \"): Renminbi is not completely freely convertible; th ere are still significant restrictions on remittance of Renminbi into and out of the PRC which may adversely affect the liquidity of Renminbi Notes Renminbi is not completely freely convertible at present. The government of the PRC (the \"PRC Government \") continues to regulate conversion between Renminbi and foreign currencies , including the Hong Kong dollar, despite significant reduction over the years by the PRC government of control over trade transactions involving import and export of goods and services as well as other frequent routine foreign exchange transactions. These transactions are known as current account items. Currently, participating banks in Hong Kong and a number of other jurisdictions (the \" Applicable Jurisdictions \") have been permitted to engage in the settlement of current account trade transaction in Renminbi. However, remittance of Renminbi by foreign investors into and out of the PRC for the purposes of capital account items, such as capital contributions, is generally only permitted u pon obtaining specific approvals from, or completing specific registrations or filings with, the relevant authorities on a case -by-case basis and is subject to a strict monitoring system. Regulations in the PRC on the remittance of Renminbi into the PRC fo r settlement of capital account items are developing gradually. Although from 1 October 2016, the Renminbi has been added to the Special Drawing Rights basket created by the International Monetary Fund and policies further improving accessibility to Renmin bi to settle cross -border transactions in foreign curr encies were implemented by the People 's Bank of China ( \"PBOC \") in 2018 , there is no assurance that the PRC Government will continue to liberalise control over cross border remittance of Renminbi in the future or that new regulations in the PRC will not be promulgated in the future which have the effect of restricting or eliminating the remittance of Renminbi into or outside the PRC. In the event that funds 23 cannot be repatriated outside the PRC in Renminb i, this may affect the overall availability of Renminbi outside the PRC and the ability of the relevant Issuer to source Renminbi to finance its obligations under Renminbi Notes. There is only limited availability of Renminbi outside the PRC, which may aff ect the liquidity of Renminbi Notes and the relevant Issuer 's ability to source Renminbi outside the PRC to service such Renminbi Notes As a result of the restrictions imposed by the PRC Government on cross -border Renminbi fund flows, the availability of R enminbi outside the PRC is limited. Currently, licensed banks in Singapore and Hong Kong may offer limited Renminbi -denominated banking services to Singapore residents, Hong Kong residents and specified business customers. While the PBOC has entered into a greements on the clearing of Renminbi business (the \" Settlement Agreements \") with financial institutions in a number of financial centres and cities (the \" RMB Clearing Banks \"), including but not limited to Hong Kong, and are in the process of establishing Renminbi clearing and settlement mechanisms in the Applicable Jurisdictions , the current size of Renminbi - denominated financial assets outside the PRC is limited. The relevant RMB Clearing Bank only has access to onshore liquidity support from the PBOC fo r the purpose of squaring open positions of participating banks for limited types of transactions, including open positions resulting from conversion services for corporations relating to cross border trade settlement. The relevant RMB Clearing Bank is not obliged to square for participating banks any open positions as a result of other foreign exchange transactions or conversion services and the participating banks will need to source Renminbi from outside the PRC to square such open positions. Although i t is expected that the offshore Renminbi market will continue to grow in depth and size, its growth is subject to many constraints as a result of PRC laws and regulations on foreign exchange. There is no assurance that new PRC regulations will not be promu lgated or the Settlement Agreements will not be terminated or amended in the future which will have the effect of restricting availability of Renminbi outside the PRC. The limited availability of Renminbi outside the PRC may affect the liquidity of the Ren minbi Notes. To the extent the relevant Issuer is required to source Renminbi in the offshore markets to service the Renminbi Notes, there is no assurance that the relevant Issuer will be able to source such Renminbi on satisfactory terms, if at all. If Renminbi is not available in certain circumstances as described in the terms and conditions applicable to Renminbi Notes, the relevant Issuer can make payments in U.S. dollars and other currencies as set out in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes. Investme nt in Renminbi Notes is subject to exchange rate risks The value of Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies fluctuates from time to time and is affected by changes in the PRC and international political and economic conditions and by many other factors. In August 2015, the PBOC implemented changes to the way it calculates the Renminbi's daily midpoint against the U.S. Dollar to take into account market -maker quotes before announcing the daily midpoint. This change, among others that ma y be implemented, may increase the volatility in the value of the Renminbi against foreign currencies. All payments of interest and principal with respect to Renminbi Notes will be made in Renminbi unless otherwise specified. As a result, the value of thes e Renminbi payments in U.S. dollar terms may vary with the prevailing exchange rates in the marketplace. If the value of Renminbi depreciates against the U.S. dollar or other foreign currencies, the value of investment in U.S. dollar or other applicable fo reign currency terms will decline. In the event that access to Renminbi becomes restricted to the extent that, by reason of Inconvertibility, Non - transferability or Illiquidity (as defined in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes), the relevant Issuer is u nable, or it is impractical for it, to pay interest or principal in Renminbi, the Terms and Conditions of the Notes allow the relevant Issuer to make payment in U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies at the prevailing spot rate of exchange, all as provid ed in more detail in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes. As a result, the value of these Renminbi payments may vary with the prevailing exchange rates in the marketplace. If the value of the Renminbi depreciates against the U.S. dollar or other foreign currencies, the value of a holder 's investment in U.S. dollar or other foreign currency terms will decline. An investment in Renminbi Notes is subject to interest rate risks 24 The PRC Government has gradually liberalised the regulation of interest rates in r ecent years. Further liberalisation may increase interest rate volatility. In addition, the interest rate for Renminbi in markets outside the PRC may significantly deviate from the interest rate for Renminbi in the PRC as a result of foreign exchange contr ols imposed by PRC law and regulations and prevailing market conditions. The Renminbi Notes may carry a fixed interest rate. Consequently, the trading price of such Renminbi Notes will vary with fluctuations in interest rates. If a holder of Renminbi Notes tries to sell any Renminbi Notes before their maturity, they may receive an offer that is less than the amount invested. Payments in respect of Renminbi Notes will only be made to investors in the manner specified in the Terms and Conditions of the releva nt Notes. Investors may be required to provide certification and other information (including Renminbi account information) in order to be allowed to receive payments in Renminbi in accordance with the Renminbi clearing and settlement system for participat ing banks in Hong Kong. All Renminbi payments to investors in respect of the Renminbi Notes will be made solely (i) for so long as the Renminbi Notes are represented by Global Notes held with the common depositary or common safekeeper, as the case may be, for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg or any alternative clearing system, by transfer to a Renminbi bank account maintained in Hong Kong in accordance with prevailing Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg rules and procedures, or (ii) for so long as the Renminbi Notes are in definitive form, by transfer to a Renminbi bank account maintained in Hong Kong in accordance with prevailing rules and regulations. Other than described in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes, the relevant Issuer cannot be req uired to make payment by any other means (including in any other currency or in bank notes, by cheque or draft or by transfer to a bank account in the PRC). There may be PRC tax consequences with respect to investment in the Renminbi Notes In considering w hether to invest in the Renminbi Notes, investors should consult their individual tax advisers with regard to the application of PRC tax laws to their particular situations as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any other tax jurisdictio ns. The value of the Noteholder 's investment in the Renminbi Notes may be materially and adversely affected if the Noteholder is required to pay PRC tax with respect to acquiring, holding or disposing of and receiving payments under those Renminbi Notes. Risks related to Notes generally Set out below is a brief description of certain risks relating to the Notes generally: Modification, waivers and substitution The Trust Deed contain provisions for calling meetings (including , at the sole discretion of the T rustee , who may prescribe further regulations in this regard, by way of conference call or by use of a videoconference platform) of Noteholders to consider and vote upon matters affecting their interests generally , or to pass resolutions in writing or thro ugh the use of electronic consents . These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all Noteholders including Noteholders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting or, as the case may be, did not sign the written resolution or give their conse nt electronically, and including those Noteholders who voted in a manner contrary to the majority. The Terms and C onditions of the Notes provide that the Trustee may, without the consent of Noteholders, agree to (i) any modification of, or to the waiver or authorisation of any breach or proposed breach of, any of the provisions of Notes or (ii) the substitution of another company as principal debtor under any Notes in place of the relevant Issuer or (iii) the substitution of another company in place of the Guarantor, in the circumstances described in Condition 16 of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes. Restructuring Plan implemented pursuant to Part 26A of the Companies Act 2006 may modify or disapply certain terms of the Notes or the Guarantee without the consent of the Noteholders Where the relevant Issuer or Guarantor encounters, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern, it may propose a Restructuring Plan (a \"Plan \") with its creditors under Part 26A of the Companies Act 2006 (introduced by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020) to eliminate, reduce, prevent or mitigate the effect of any of those financial difficulties. Should this happen, c reditors whose rights are affected are organised into creditor 25 classes and can vote on any such Plan (subject to being excluded from the vote by the English courts for having no genuine economic interest in the relevant Issuer or Guarantor and (in the case of Notes issued by Shell plc ) certain exclusions where the Plan is proposed within the 12 week period fo llowing the end of a moratorium ). Providing that one class of creditors (who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the relev ant Issuer or Guarantor) has approved the Plan, and in the view of the English courts any dissenting class(es) who did not approve the Plan are no worse off under the Plan than they would be in the eve nt of the \"relevant alternative\" (such as, broadly, liq uidation or administration), then the English court can sanction the Plan where it would be a proper exercise of its discretion. A sanctioned Plan is binding on all creditors and members, regardless of whether or not they approved it. Any such sanctioned Plan in relation to the relevant Issuer or the Guarantor may, therefore, adversely affect the rights of Noteholders and the price or value of their investment in the Notes, as it may have the effect of modifying or disapplying certain terms of the Notes or the Guarantee or substituting the Guarantor . Risk related to the enforcement of English law judgments The Notes are governed by English law and subject to the jurisdiction of the English courts. The recognition and enforcement in the Netherlands of an English court judgment against Shell Finance is subject to the commencement of a procedure ( exequatur ), which is likely to be more costly and time -consuming compared to the automatic recognition and enforcement of such judgments before the end of the Brexi t transition period on 1 January 2021 . This may limit or complicate the ability of the Noteholders to enforce their rights under the Notes . The right to receive payments on the Notes issued by Shell plc or under the Guarantee is structurally subordinated t o the other liabilities of its subsidiaries Shell plc is organised as a holding company, and substantially all of its operations are carried on through subsidiaries of Shell plc . Shell plc 's ability to meet its financial obligations is dependent upon the a vailability of cash flows from its domestic and foreign subsidiaries and affiliated companies through dividends, intercompany advances and other payments. Moreover, Shell Finance is a special -purpose financing vehicle that was formed for the purpose of rai sing debt for the Shell Group. Shell Finance conducts no business or revenue -generating operations of its own. Shell Finance has no subsidiaries and will rely on payments (including principal and interest) from Shell plc and other subsidiaries in the Shell Group to whom it has on -lent the proceeds of any debt securities issued by it in order to make payments on securities issued by it. Shell plc 's subsidiaries are not guarantors of the Notes that may be issued under the Programme. Claims of the creditors o f Shell plc 's subsidiaries have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over the claims of Shell plc . Consequently, in the event of insolvency of Shell plc , the claims of holders of debt securities guaranteed or issued by Shell plc would be structur ally subordinated to the prior claims of the creditors of subsidiaries of Shell plc. The Notes are unsecured The Notes issued under the Programme will be unsecured. If Shell plc or Shell Finance default on the Notes or Shell plc defaults on the Guarantee, or in the event of bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganisation, then, to the extent that Shell plc or Shell Finance have granted security over their assets, the assets that secure these debts will be used to satisfy the obligations under that secured debt be fore Shell plc or Shell Finance could make payment on the Notes or the Guarantee, as applicable. If there is not enough collateral to satisfy the obligations of the secured debt, then the remaining amounts on the secured debt would share equally with all unsubordinated unsecured indebtedness. Change of law The Terms and C onditions of the Notes are based on English law in effect as at the date of issue of the relevant Notes. No assurance can be given as to the impact of any possible judicial decision or chan ge to English law or administrative practice after the date of issue of the relevant Notes and any such change could materially adversely impact the value of any Notes affected by it . 26 Notes where denominations involve integral multiples: Definitive Notes In relation to any issue of Notes which have denominations consisting of a minimum Specified Denomination plus one or more higher integral multiples of another smaller amount, it is possible that such Notes may be traded in amounts in excess of the minimum Specified Denomination that are not integral multiples of such minimum Specified Denomination. In such a case a holder who, as a result of trading such amounts, holds an amount which is less than the minimum Specified Denomination in their account with the relevant clearing system would not be able to sell the remainder of such holding without first purchasing a principal amount of Notes at or in excess of the minimum Specified Denomination such that its holding amounts to a Specified Denomination. Further, a holder who, as a result of trading such amounts, holds an amount which is less than the minimum Specified Denomination in their account with the relevant clearing system at the relevant time may not receive a Definitive Note in respect of such holding ( should Definitive Notes be printed) and would need to purchase a principal amount of Notes at or in excess of the minimum Specified Denomination such that its holding amounts to a Specified Denomination. If Definitive Notes are issued, holders should be aw are that Definitive Notes which have a denomination that is not an integral multiple of the minimum Specified Denomination may be illiquid and difficult to trade. Risks related to the market generally Set out below is a brief description of certain market risks, including liquidity risk, exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and credit risk: The secondary market generally Notes may have no established trading market when issued, and one may never develop. If a market does develop, it may not be very liquid . Therefore, investors may not be able to sell their Notes easily or at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to similar investments that have a developed secondary market. This is particularly the case for Notes that are especially sensiti ve to interest rate, currency or market risks, are designed for specific investment objectives or strategies or have been structured to meet the investment requirements of limited categories of investors. These types of Notes generally would have a more li mited secondary market and more price volatility than conventional debt securities. Illiquidity may have a severely adverse effect on the market value of Notes. Exchange rate risks and exchange controls The relevant Issuer will pay principal and interest o n the Notes and the Guarantor will make any payments under the Guarantee in the Specified Currency. This presents certain risks relating to currency conversions if an investor 's financial activities are denominated principally in a currency or currency uni t (the \"Investor 's Currency \") other than the Specified Currency. These include the risk that exchange rates may significantly change (including changes due to devaluation of the Specified Currency or revaluation of the Investor 's Currency) and the risk tha t authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor 's Currency may impose or modify exchange controls. An appreciation in the value of the Investor 's Currency relative to the Specified Currency would decrease (1) the Investor 's Currency -equivalent yield on t he Notes, (2) the Investor 's Currency equivalent value of the principal payable on the Notes and (3) the Investor 's Currency -equivalent market value of the Notes. Government and monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange contr ols that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected, or no interest or principal. Interest rate risks Interest rate risk occurs when the interest rate payable on assets an d liabilities for a fixed period do not coincide. Investments in Notes with fixed interest involve a risk that subsequent changes in market interest rates may adversely affect the value of fixed interest Notes. Investments in Notes with floating interest i nvolve a risk of adverse changes in the interest rate payable on the Notes. 27 Credit ratings may not reflect all risks One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to structure, market, additional factors discussed above, and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be revised or withdrawn by the rating agen cy at any time. In general, European regulated investors are restricted under the CRA Regulation from using credit ratings for regulatory purposes in the EEA, unless such ratings are issued by a credit rating agency established in the EEA and registered un der the CRA Regulation (and such registration has not been withdrawn or suspended), subject to transitional provisions that apply in certain circumstances. Such general restriction will also apply in the case of credit ratings issued by third country non -EEA credit rating agencies, unless the relevant credit ratings are endorsed by an EEA -registered credit rating agency or the relevant third country rating agency is certified in accordance with the CRA Regulation (and such endorsement action or certificatio n, as the case may be, has not been withdrawn or suspended, subject to transitional provisions that apply in certain circumstances). Investors regulated in the United Kingdom are subject to similar restrictions under the UK CRA Regulation. As such, United Kingdom regulated investors are required to use for United Kingdom regulatory purposes ratings issued by a credit rating agency established in the United Kingdom and registered under the UK CRA Regulation. In the case of ratings issued by third country no n-United Kingdom credit rating agencies, third country credit ratings can either be: (a) endorsed by a United Kingdom registered credit rating agency; or (b) issued by a third country credit rating agency that is certified in accordance with the UK CRA Reg ulation. Note this is subject, in each case, to (a) the relevant United Kingdom registration, certification or endorsement, as the case may be, not having been withdrawn or suspended, and (b) transitional provisions that apply in certain circumstances. In the case of third country ratings, for a certain limited period of time, transitional relief accommodates continued use for regulatory purposes in the United Kingdom, of existing pre -2021 ratings, provided the relevant conditions are satisfied. If the sta tus of the rating agency rating the Notes (or endorsing a rating of the Notes, as the case may be) changes for the purposes of the CRA Regulation or the UK CRA Regulation, relevant regulated investors may no longer be able to use the rating for regulatory purposes in the EEA or the United Kingdom, as applicable, and the Notes may have a different regulatory treatment, which may impact the value of the Notes and their liquidity in the secondary market. Certain information with respect to the credit rating ag encies and ratings is set out on the cover of this Information Memorandum. 28 Overview of the Programme The following overview does not purport to be complete and is taken from, and is qualified in its entirety by, the remainder of this Information Memorandu m and, in relation to the terms and conditions of any particular Tranche of Notes, the applicable Final Terms (or, in the case of Exempt Notes, the applicable Pricing Supplement).

An Independ ent Adviser appointed pursuant to this Condition 3(d) shall act in good faith and (in the absence of bad faith or fraud) shall have no liability whatsoever to the Issuer, the Terms and Conditions of the Notes 51 Calculation Agent, the Paying Agents, the Trustee, the Noteholders or the Couponholders for any determination made by it or for any advice given to the Issuer in connection with any determination made by the Issuer, pursuant to this Condition 3(d). (ii) Successor Rate or Alternative Rate If the Issuer, following consultation with the Independent Adviser (if appointed) and acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner , determines that: (A) there is a Successor Rate, then such Successor Rate shall (subject to adjustment as provided in Condition 3(d)(iii)) subsequently be used in place of the Original Reference Rate to determine the relevant Rate(s) of Interest (or the relevant component part (s) thereof) for all relevant future payments of interest on the Notes (subject to the further operation of this Condition 3(d)); or (B) there is no Successor Rate but that there is an Alternative Rate, then such Alternative Rate shall (subject to adjustment a s provided in Condition 3(d)(iii)) subsequently be used in place of the Original Reference Rate to determine the relevant Rate(s) of Interest (or the relevant component part (s) thereof) for all relevant future payments of interest on the Notes (subject to the further operation of this Condition 3(d)). If the Issuer is unable to appoint an Independent Adviser, the Issuer (acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonab le manner) may nevertheless determine a Successor Rate or, if there is no Successor Rate, an Alternative Rate and make any and all other determinations expressed to be made by the Issuer pursuant to this Condition 3(d), notwithstanding that such determinations are not made following consultation with an Independent Adviser . (iii) Adjustment Spread If a Successor Rate or Alternative Rate is determined in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the Issuer, following consultation with the Independent Adviser (if appointed) , shall determine an Adjustment Spread ( which may be expressed as a quantum or a formula or methodology for determining the applicable Adjustment Spread (and, for the avoidance of doubt, an Adjustment Spread may be positive, negative or zero) ), which Adjustment Spread shall be applied to the Successor Rate or the Alternative Rate (as the case may be) for each subsequent determination of a relevant Rate of Interest (or a relevant component pa rt thereof) by reference to such Successor Rate or Alternative Rate (as applicable) . (iv) Benchmark Amendments If any Successor Rate or Alternative Rate and (in either case) the applicable Adjustment Spread is determined in accordance with this Condition 3(d) and the Issuer, following consultation with the Independent Adviser (if appointed) , determines (i) that amendments to these Conditions , the Trust Deed and/or the Agency Agreement are necessary to ensure the proper operation of such Successor Rate or Alternative Rate and/or (in either case) the applicable Adjustment Spread (such amendments, the \"Benchmark Amendments \") and (ii) the terms of the Benchmark Amendments, then the Issuer shall, subject to giving notice thereof in accord ance with Condition 3(d)(v), without any requirement for the consent or approval of Noteholders or Couponholders , vary these Conditions , the Trust Deed and/or the Agency Agreement to give effect to such Benchmark Amendments with effect from the date specified in such notice. At the request of the Issuer, the Trustee and the Agent shall, without any requirement for the consent or approval of Noteholders or Couponholders, be obliged to concur with the Issuer in effecting any Benchmark Amendments (including, inter alia , by the execution of a deed Terms and Conditions of the Notes 52 supplemental to the Trust Deed) and neither the Trustee nor the Agent shall be liable to any party for any consequences thereof, provided that neither the Trust ee nor the Agent shall be obliged so to concur if in the sole opinion of the Trustee or the Agent (as applicable) doing so would impose more onerous obligations upon it or expose it to any additional duties, responsibilities or liabilities or reduce rights and/or the protective provisions afforded to the Trustee in these Conditions , the Trust Deed or the Agency Agreement, as applicable, (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any supplemental trust deed) in any way. In connection with any such variation in accordance with this Condition 3(d)(iv), the Issuer shall comply with the rules of any stock exchange on which the Notes are for the time being listed or admitted to trading.

If, in the case of any Benchmark Event, any Successor Rate , Alternative Rate and/or Adjustment Spread is notified to the Agent pursuant to Condition 3(d)(v) or Condition 3(d)(vi), as applicable, and the Agent or, as applicable, the Calculation Agent is in any way uncertain as to the application of such Successor Rate, Alternative Rate and/or Adjustment Spread in the calculation or determi nation of any Rate of Interest (or any component part thereof), it shall promptly notify the Issuer thereof and the Issuer shall direct the Agent or, as applicable, the Calculation Agent in writing (which direction may be by way of a written determination of an Independent Advisor pursuant to Condition 3(d)(v) or Condition 3(d)(vi), as applicable) as to which course of action to adopt in the application of such Successor Rate, Alternative Rate and/or Adjustment Spread in the determination of such Rate of Interest.

Shell plc and Shell International Finance B.V. 88 Shell plc and Shell International Finance B.V. History and development of Shell plc Shell plc (then known as \"Royal Dutch Shell plc\") became the single parent company of N.V. Koninklijke Nederlandsche Petroleum Maatschappij (Royal Dutch Petroleum Company) ( \"Royal Dutch \") and The \"Shell \" Transport and Trading Company , p.l.c. (\"Shell Transport \") as a result of the unification transaction described below. Since 1907, Royal Dutch and Shell Transport have been the par ent companies of a group of companies known collectively as the \"Royal Dutch/Shell Group \" (now known as Shell or the Shell Group). The companies of the Shell Group are engaged worldwide in all the principal aspects of the oil and natural gas industry. In July 2005, Shell plc (then known as \"Royal Dutch Shell plc\") became the parent company of Royal Dutch and Shell Transport upon the consummation of (i) an exchange offer under Dutch law by Shell plc for the outstanding shares of Royal Dutch and (ii) a scheme of arrangement under English law involving Shell Transport and its shareholders. After the unification, a series of restructuring transactions of the Group occurred in December 2005, which included the contribution of Shell Transport to Royal Dutch and th e merger under Dutch law of Royal Dutch with its wholly -owned subsidiary, Shell Petroleum N.V. ( \"Shell Petroleum \"). As a result of the merger, Royal Dutch and the Royal Dutch shares ceased to exist and Shell Petroleum, the surviving company in the merger, became a 100 per cent. owned subsidiary of Shell plc and Shell Transport , a 100 per cent. subsidiary of Shell Petroleum. Royal Dutch Shell plc was incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 1985 on 5 February 2002 as a private company limite d by shares. On 27 October 2004 , it re-registered as a public company limited by shares and changed its name to Royal Dutch Shell plc. In December 2021, a shareholder vote was cast in support of amending the Articles of Association of Shell plc (then named \"Royal Dutch Shell plc\") to enable the following changes: the alignment of Shell's tax residence with its country of incorporation, including relocating the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to the UK; the corporate name change; and impl ementation of a single line of shares, eliminating the complex A/B share structure, which occurred in early 2022 (see also \" Business Update \u2014Simplification exercise and change of name \" below) . The primary object of Shell plc is to carry on the business of a holding company. It has not traded since incorporation. Shell plc does not have an objects clause in its Articles of Association and so, pursuant to section 31(1) of the Companies Act 2006, its objects are unrestricted. Shell plc is registered at Compani es House, Cardiff, with company number 04366849. Its registered office is at Shell Centre, London SE1 7NA, United Kingdom, tel.: 08007318888 . Shell plc is considered a resident of the UK for tax purposes. History and development of Shell Finance Shell Fin ance was incorporated as a private company with limited liability under the laws of the Netherlands on 5 March 2004 with the name Shell Project Development (VII) B.V. Shell Finance has its corporate seat in The Hague, the Netherlands and is registered in t he commercial register of the Dutch Chamber of Commerce under number 27265903. The registered office of Shell Finance is Carel van Bylandtlaan 30, 2596 HR The Hague, the Netherlands, tel.:+31 (0) 70 377 9111. Shell Finance was renamed Shell International F inance B.V. and became a 100 per cent. owned subsidiary of Shell plc (then known as \"Royal Dutch Shell plc\") on 20 July 2005. Shell Finance is a financing vehicle for Shell plc and its consolidated subsidiaries. Shell Finance has no independent operations, other than raising debt for use by the Shell Group, hedging such debt when appropriate and on -lending funds raised to companies in the Shell Group. Shell Finance will lend substantially all proceeds of its borrowings to companies in the Shell Group and is therefore dependent on such companies repaying funds lent to them. The corporate object of Shell Finance is set out in Article 2 of its Articles of Association and is to obtain financial resources by securing Shell plc and Shell International Finance B.V. 89 public or private loans or by any other means and making such financial resources available in whatever form, in particular to other Shell Group companies (which includes the granting of security rights). History and development of the Shell Group The history of the companies that make up the Shell Gr oup goes back more than a century. Royal Dutch was registered in 1890, with its main interests being the development of the oil fields of Sumatra. Shell Transport was formally established in 1897, having begun as a company selling seashells before diversif ying into shipping oil. Subsequently, the Royal Dutch/Shell Group grew out of a scheme of amalgamation between Royal Dutch and Shell Transport dated 12 September 1906 and agreements from 1907 by which the scheme of amalgamation was implemented and pursuant to which they combined their interests in the oil industry through the transfer of all the significant operating assets of each of Royal Dutch and Shell Transport to companies owned 60 per cent. by Royal Dutch and 40 per cent. by Shell Transport. The Roya l Dutch/Shell Group 's energy and petrochemical operations then expanded rapidly with acquisitions in Europe, Africa and the Americas and the establishment of its chemicals business in 1929. By the middle of the 20th century, the Royal Dutch/Shell Group had become one of the world 's leading suppliers of oil products. The Royal Dutch/Shell Group was also developing interests in natural gas, which was emerging as a new alternative source of energy. This was followed by the major oil and gas discoveries in the North Sea in the 1970s, continued growth in gas consumption and the first shipments of LNG . Shell is a global group of energy and petrochemical companies with 8 2,000 employees in more than 70 countries. Shell uses advanced technologies and take s an innovat ive approach to help build a sustainable energy future. Shell is a customer -focused o rganisation, serving more than one million commercial and industrial customers, and around 32 million customers at 46,000 retail service stations daily. Shell's strategy i s to accelerate the transition of its business to net -zero emissions, purposefully and profitably, in step with society. Business overview of the Shell Group Activities and major interests Shell is an international energy company with expertise in the exp loration, development, production, refining and marketing of oil and natural gas, as well as in the manufacturing and marketing of chemicals. Shell is one of the world 's largest independent energy companies in terms of market capitalisation, cash flow from operating activities and production levels . Shell explores for oil and gas worldwide, both in conventional fields and from sources such as tight rock, shale and coal formations. Shell works to develop new crude oil and gas supplies from major fields. Shel l also extracts bitumen from oil sands, and converts it into synthetic crude oil. Shell cools natural gas to provide LNG that can be safely shipped to markets around the world, and it converts gas to liquids ( \"GTL \"). Shell transports and trades oil, gas a nd other energy -related products, such as electricity and carbon -emissions rights. Shell 's portfolio of refineries and chemical plants enables it to capture value from the oil and gas production , turning them into a range of refined and petrochemical produ cts, which are moved and marketed around the world for domestic, industrial and transport use. The products Shell sells include gasoline, diesel, heating oil, aviation fuel and marine fuel, LNG for transport, lubricants, bitumen and sulphur. Shell also pro duces and sells ethanol from sugar cane in Brazil, through its Raizen joint venture. Shell invests in nature -based solutions that avoid or reduce carbon dioxide emissions, such as capturing carbon dioxide using carbon capture and storage ( \"CCS \") technolog y, biofuels, hydrogen, wind and solar power, and in other opportunities linked to energy transition. The integration of the businesses of Shell is one of its competitive advantages allowing for optimisations across its global portfolio. Shell 's key strengt hs include the development and application of innovation and technology, the financial and project management skills that allow it to safely develop large and integrated projects, the Shell plc and Shell International Finance B.V. 90 management of integrated value chains and the marketing of energy produc ts. The distinctive Shell pecten, a trademark in use since the early part of the 20th century, and trademarks in which the word Shell appears, help raise the profile of its brand globally. Description of activities and principal markets Until 2021, Shell 's reporting segments were Integrated Gas, Upstream, Oil Products, Chemicals and Corporate. Integrated Gas, Upstream and Downstream include d their respective elements of Shell 's Projects & Technology organisation . With effect from the beginning of 2022, Shell's reporting segments have change d to Integrated Gas, Upstream, Marketing, Chemicals and Products, Renewables and Energy Solutions and Corporate, reflecting the way Shell reviews and assesses its performance .

Principal subsidiaries In 2005, Shell plc (then known as \"Royal Dutch Shell plc\") became the single 100 per cent. parent comp any of Royal Dutch and Shell Transport, the two former public company parent companies of the Shell Group. After Shell plc and Shell International Finance B.V. 91 the unification, a series of restructuring transactions of the Shell Group occurred in December 2005, which included the contribution of Shell Transport to Royal Dutch and the merger under Dutch law of Royal Dutch with its wholly -owned subsidiary, Shell Petroleum. As a result of the merger, Royal Dutch and the Royal Dutch shares ceased to exist and Shell Petroleum, the surviving company in the me rger, became a 100 per cent. owned subsidiary of Shell plc and Shell Transport a 100 per cent. subsidiary of Shell Petroleum. Shell plc is organised as a holding company and substantially all of its operations are carried on through subsidiaries of Shell p lc. Shell plc's ability to meet its financial obligations is dependent on the availability of cash flows from its domestic and foreign subsidiaries and affiliated companies through dividends, intercompany advances and other payments. Principal investments For cash capital expenditure, the base capex to sustain Shell's strategy is expected to be $19 -22 billion per annum. To accelerate Shell' s strategy, it expects its cash capital expenditure to grow to $23 -27 billion per annum, once it has me t its priority t o distribute 20 to 30 per cent. of cash flow from operations to shareholders. Reporting of reserves Proved reserves estimates are calculated pursuant to the SEC Rules and the Financial Accounting Standard Board 's Topic 932.

Audit Committee Remit of the Audit Committee The roles and responsibilities of the A udit Committee , as set out in its Terms of Reference , are reviewed annually, taking into account relevant regulat ory changes and recommended best practice. The key responsibilities of the Audit Committee include, but are not limited to: Risk Management and Internal Control evaluating the effectiveness of the system of risk management and internal control Financial Re porting reviewing the integrity of the financial statements, including annual reports, half -year reports, and quarterly financial statements reviewing the potential impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the implementation of Shell's strategy, climate change and energy transition advising the Board whether, in the Audit Committee's view, the annual report taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess Shell's position and p erformance, business model and strategy reviewing and discussing with management the appropriateness of judgements involving the application of accounting principles and disclosure rules Compliance and Governance reviewing the functioning of the Shell Glob al Helpline and rep orts arising from its operation overseeing compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, including monitori ng ethics and compliance risks Internal Audit monitoring the qualifications, expertise, resources and independenc e of the internal audit function approving the internal audit function's remit and the annual internal audit plan to ensure alignment with the key risks of the business reviewing the significant matters arising from internal audits with the Chief Internal Auditor and assessing management's response to significant internal audit findings and notable control weaknesses , which includes discussing potential improvements and agreed actions with management assessing internal audit's performance and effectiveness each year External Audit reviewing and monitoring the qualifications, expertise, resources and independence and objectivity of the external auditor considering the annual external audit plan and approving related remuneration, including fees for audit and non-audit services assessing the performance and effectiveness of the external auditor and the audit process, including an assessment of the quality of the audit recommending to the Board for it to put to shareholders for approval at the annual general me eting to appoint, reappoint, or remove the external auditor Shell plc and Shell International Finance B.V. 96 These responsibilities form the basis of the A udit Committee's annual work plan which is adjusted throughout the year as necessary. In addition, the Audit Committee annually identifies certain bus iness and function areas to focus on during the year. The focus areas generally encompass aspects of risk management and internal control, financial reporting and compliance. The A udit Committee is authorised to seek any information it requires from manage ment and external parties and to investigate issues or concerns as it deems appropriate. The Audit Committee may also obtain independent professional advice at Shell plc's expense , however, n o such independent advice was required in 202 1. The Audit Committ ee keeps the Board informed of its activities and recommendations, and the Chair of the Audit Committee provides an update to the Board after every Audit Committee meeting. The Audit Committee discusses with the Board if it is not satisfied with or believe s that action or improvement is required concerning any aspect of financial reporting, risk management and internal control, compliance or audit -related activities. A copy of the Audit Committee's Terms of Reference (which was updated to reflect the amende d NYSE rules regarding the A udit Committee 's oversight for related party transactions and its role regarding the impact of Shell's strategy, climate change and energy transition on the financial statements and with respect to non -financial reporting relati ng to climate change and energy transition metrics ) avoidance of doubt, such Terms of Reference are not incorporated into, and do not form part of , this Information Memorandum. Focus areas for 202 1 In 2021, s enior leaders from various business and function areas briefed the A udit Committee on the adequacy, design and operational effectiveness of risk management and controls related to the critical activities carried out by their respe ctive business es or function s. The se discussions included information on any enhancements to strengthen controls and how areas identified for improvement had been addressed, monitoring activities around key risks, and steps being taken to identify new or e merging risk areas. In addition to the significant accounting and reporting areas discussed on page s 160 and 161 of the Annual Report of Shell plc for the year ended 31 December 2021, t he business and function areas reviewed by the Audit Committee in 2021 included the following: Non-Financial Reporting - The Audit Committee was briefed on the increasing pace of change in external regulatory and voluntary frameworks in non -financial reporting, which includes environmental, social and governance reporting. Th e Audit Committee and management discussed the key shifts in the external landscape and in particular , requests for expanded disclosures. Oil and gas pricing methodology - The Audit Committee reviewed the process, methodology and approach to price assumpt ions used by Shell for business planning, accounting (for example, impairment and deferred tax assessments) and investment and divestment decisions. The Audit Committee considered the overall governance framework, the application of key principles of indep endence, expertise, consistency and stability and management's oversight responsibilities. New business models and ventures - The Audit Committee received a briefing from management regarding the governance approach to new business models and ventures, inc luding R&ES portfolio companies. The Audit Committee and management discussed the activities in 2021 to govern the implementation of the Shell control framework in the R&ES portfolio companies and the status of such activities. Contracting and Procurement (\"C&P \") - As part of a joint session with the Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee, the Audit Committee was briefed on Shell's C&P programme. Trading and Supply's ( \"T&S \") control framework - Noting the continued regulatory demands in this area , the Audit Committee met with T&S leaders, including the risk officer, to gain a deeper understanding of the controls and processes enhancements undertaken in 2021. Pensions - Treasury leaders provided the Audit Committee with an overview of Shell's pensi on plans which cover around 230,000 current and p ast employees in 46 countries. Shell plc and Shell International Finance B.V. 97 Shell Finance does not have an audit committee and there is no requirement for it to have an audit committee. Litigation Update and Contin gent Liabilities General In the ordin ary course of business, Shell subsidiaries are subject to several contingencies arising from litigation and claims brought by governmental authorities , including tax authorities, and private parties. The operations and earnings of Shell subsidiaries contin ue, from time to time, to be affected to varying degrees by political, legislative, fiscal and regulatory developments, including those relating to the protection of the environment and indigenous groups in the countries in which they operate. The industri es in which Shell subsidiaries are engaged are also subject to physical risks of various types. The amounts claimed in relation to such events and, if such claims against Shell were successful, the costs of implementing the remedies sought in the various cases could be substantial. Based on information available as at the date of this Information Memorandum and taking into account that in some cases it is not pract icable to estimate the possible magnitude or timing of any resultant payments, management beli eves that the foregoing are not expected to have a mat erial adverse impact on Shell's Consolidated Financial Statements. However, there remains a high degree of uncertainty around these contingencies, as we ll as their potential effect on future operations, earnings, cash flows and Shell's financial condition. In certain divestment transactions, liabilities related to d ecommissioning and restoration are de -recognised upon transfer of thes e obligations to the buyer. For certain of these obligations Shell has issued guarantees to third parties and continues to be liable in case the primary ob ligor is not able to meet its obligation. These potential obligations arising from issuance of these guarantees are assessed to be remote. Decommissioning and restoration o f manufacturing facilities Industry practice ha d been not to recognise decommissioning and restoration provisions associated with manufacturing facilities in Oil Products and Chemicals. This was on the basis that these assets were considered to have indefi nite lives and, therefore, it was considered remote that an outflow of economic benefits would be required. In 2020, the changed macroeconomic fundamentals were considered, together with Shell' s plans to rationalise the Shell Group's manufacturing portfoli o. It was also reconsidered whether it remained appropriate not to recognise decommissioning and restoration provisions for manufacturing facilities. It was concluded that the assumption of indefinite lives for manufacturing facilities is no longer appropr iate, and the need for either recognition of decommissioning and restoration provisions or contingent liability disclosure was reviewed. In 2021, provisions ha d been recognis ed for certain shorter -lived manufacturing facilities ( see Note 1 9 to the 202 1 Consolidated Financial Statements ). For the remaining longer -lived facilities, where decommissioning would generally be more than 50 years away, it was concluded that, while there is a present obligation that has arisen from past events, the amount of the obl igation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. This conclusion was reached on the basis that the settlement dates are indeterminate and that other estimates, such as extremely long-term discount rates for which there is no observable measure, are not reliable. Consequently, a decommissioning and restoration obligation exists that cannot be recognised or quantified and that is disclosed as a contingent liability. Pesticide Litigation Shell Oil Company ( \"SOC \"), along with another agricultural chemica l pesticide manufacturer and several distributors, has been sued by public and quasi -public water purveyors , water storage districts and private landowners, alleging responsibility for groundwater contamination caused by applications of chemical pesticides . There are approximately 38 such cases currently pending , four claims made but not yet filed and an active subpoena for records . These matters assert various theories of strict liability and negligence, and seek to recover actual damages, including drinki ng well treatment and remediation costs. Most assert claims for punitive damages. While Shell continues to vigorously defend these matters , in January 20 18, an environmental regulatory standard became effective in the State of California, where suits are p ending. The 2018 standard requires public water systems state -wide to perform quarterly or monthly sampling of their drinking water sources for a chemical contained i n certain pesticides . Water systems deemed out of compliance with the Shell plc and Shell International Finance B.V. 98 regulatory standard must take c orrective action to resolve the exceedance or take the potable water source out of service. In response to this regulatory standard, Shell has been monitor ing the sampling results to determine the number of wells potentially impacted. Based on t he claims asserted and SOC's history with regard to amounts paid to resolve varying actions , management does not expect the outcome of the matters pending as at 30 June 2022, to have a material adverse impact on Shell. However, there remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding the potential outcome of some of these pending lawsuits, as well as their potential effect on future operations, earnings, cash flows and Shell's financial condition. Climate Change Litigation In the USA, 20 lawsuits filed by sever al municipalities and/or states against oil and gas companies, including Shell plc, are pending as of 30 June 2022. The plaintiffs seek damages for a variety of claims including harm to their public and private infrastructure from rising sea levels and oth er alleged impacts of climate change caused by the defendants' fossil fuel products. A similar suit has been filed by a crab -fishing industry group claiming harm to their fisheries as a result of alleged o cean-related impacts of climate change. In the Neth erlands , in a case against Shell brought by a group of environmental non-governmental organisations and individual claimants , the court found that while Shell is not currently acting unlawfully, Shell must reduce the aggregate annual volume of all carbon d ioxide emissions of the Shell Group operations and energy -carrying products sold across Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 by 45 per cent. (net) by the end of 2030, relative to its 2019 emission levels. For Scope 2 and Scope 3, this is a significant best efforts obligation and Shell has appealed that ruling. Management believes the outcome of these matters should be resolved in a manner favourable to Shell, but there remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits, as well as their potential effect on future operations, earnings, c ash flows and Shell's financial condition. In March 2022, lawyers for the environmental non-governmental organisation, ClientEarth , sent a notice of their intention to file a derivative claim against the Board of Shell plc in the UK courts, claiming the directors breached their duties by failing to manage Shell's climate -related risks and prepare a plan for timely compliance with the Dutch Court judgment. ClientEarth has not yet made a formal filing, and court permission will be required before the case can advance. At present, no monetary claim has been made against the Board of Shell plc and it is anticipated that ClientEarth will seek injunctive relief directing an alternative strategy to manage cli mate risks and payment of their legal costs. No clai m has been filed as at the date of this Information Memorandum. Louisiana Coast Litigation The State of Louisiana and multiple local governments have initiated 43 lawsuits against more than 200 oil and gas companies , claiming either current or historical oil and gas operation s caused or contributed to contamination, land loss and the erosion of the Louisiana coastline. Shell entities are named in 14 of the se lawsuits. Although the State and local parishes fail to claim specified amounts, these claims represent potentially material matters. The case s are of first impression, aris e out of an untested 1980 Louisiana statute and represent a novel attempt to render illegal operations that federal and state agenc ies permitted and authori sed at the time. Management believes the outcome of these matters should ultimately be resolved in a manner favourable to Shell. However, t here remains a high degree of uncertainty concerning the scope of the claims and the ultimat e outcome s, as well as their potential effect s on future operations, earnings, cash flows , reputation and Shell's financial condition. The cases continue to go through jurisdictional challenges with respect to whether the cases should be tried in federal c ourt or state court . NAM (Groningen gas field) L itigation Since 1963 , NAM , a joint venture between Shell and ExxonMobil (50 :50) has been producing gas from the Groningen field, the largest gas field in Western Europe. After smaller tremors in the 1990s and the late 2000s, an earthquake measuring 3.6 on the Richter scale occurred in 2012, causing damage to properties in the affected area, and the area continues to experience tremor/earthquake -type events. NAM has received more than 100,000 claims for physica l damage to property , the majority of which have been successfully settled. Since 2018, the Dutch State has taken over the damage -claim -handling from NAM for all claim categories ( strengthening, physical damage to property, housing value loss, emotional da mages and loss of living enjoyment) while NAM remains financially responsible . In February 2022, NAM commenced arbitral proceedings against the Dutch Shell plc and Shell International Finance B.V. 99 State to get clarity on the financial responsibilities for physical damages and strengthening. NAM is fili ng formal objections against costs charged through levies (instead of under a contract) and will need to start administrative litigation if these objections are denied . NAM still faces a declining number of claims in civil litigation from claimants who ele ct not to use the government arrangement or from claims pre -dating the governmental arrangements. Substantial claims for value loss and immaterial damages have been settled in the second quarter of 2022 . Shell and Exxon Mobil have started exploratory talks with the Dutch state to come to a negotiated settlement. Nigerian Litigation Shell subsidiaries and associates operating in Nigeria are parties to various environmental and contractual disputes br ought in the courts of Nigeria, England and the Netherlands . These disputes are at different stages of litigation, including at the appellate stage, wher e judgments have been rendered against Shell entities. If taken at face value, the aggregate amount of these judgments could be viewed as material. Managem ent, ho wever, believes that the outcomes of these matters will ultimately be resolved in a manner favourable to Shell. However, there remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding these cases, including threat of committal of senior staff for contempt of court, as well as their potential effect on future operations, earnings, cash flows and Shell's financial condition. OPL 245 Authorities are investi gating SNEPCO's investment in Nigerian oil block OPL 245 (as defined below) and the 2011 settlement of litigation p ertaining to that block with regard to potential anti -bribery and anti-corruption laws. On 27 January 2017, the Nigeria Federal High Court issued an Interim Order of Attachment for Oil Prospecting Licence 245 ( \"OPL 245 \"), pending the conclusion of the inv estigation. SNEPCO applied for and was granted a discharge of this order on constitutional and proce dural grounds. Furthermore, in Nigeria, in March 2017 , criminal charges alleging official corruption and conspiracy to commit official corruption were filed against SNEPCO, one current Shell employee and third parties including ENI SpA and one of its subsidiaries. Those proceedings are in abeyance . In January 2020, criminal charges alleging disobeying direction of law related to tax waivers were filed in Nige ria against Shell Nigeria Ultra Deep L td., SNEPCO and third parties including Nigeria Agip Exploration Limited (\"NAE \"). Those proceedings are ongoing. In Mar ch 2017, parties alleging to be shareholders of Malabu Oil and Gas Company L imited (\"Malabu \") filed two actions to challenge the 2011 settlement and the award of OPL 245 to SNEPCO and an ENI SpA subsidiary by the Federal Government of Nigeria. Both actions are currently stayed awaiting the outcome of appeals filed against procedural decisions. The appea l proceedings are ongoing. On 8 May 2018, Human Environmental Development Agenda ( \"HEDA \") sought permission from the Federal High Court of Nigeria to apply for an order to direct the Att orney General of the Federation to revoke OPL 245 on grounds that the entire Malabu transaction in relation to the Oil Prospecting Licence is unconstitutional, ille gal and void as it was obtained through fraudulent and corrupt practice. On 3 July 2019, the Nigerian Federal High Court upheld objections from SNEPCO and NAE and struck the lawsuit filed by HEDA. The suit was struck because of the statute of limitations and lack of jurisdiction to hear the matter. HEDA has appealed the judgement , which is ongoing . On 12 December 2018, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (\"FRN \") issued a claim form in the United Kingdom against Shell and six of its subsidiaries, ENI SpA and two of its subsidiaries, Malabu as well as two other entities for th e amount of $1,092 million plus damages for having participated in a fraudulent and corrupt schem e leading to the acquisition by Shell and ENI corporate defendants in 2011 of OPL 245. The Shell entities were serve d with proceedings in April and May 2019 , following which they, and other defendants , challenged the jurisdiction of the English courts . Fol lowing a hearing in April 2020, the English High Court rendered a judgement in May 2020, dismissing the claims in England and refusing the FRN's request for permission to appeal. In September 2020, the UK Court of Appeal also refused the FRN's permission t o appeal, meaning the case is now concluded. On 14 February 2017, Shell plc received a notice of request for indictment f rom the Milan public prosecutor with respect to this matter. On 20 December 2017, Shell plc and four forme r Shell employees including one Shell plc and Shell International Finance B.V. 100 former executive were remanded to trial in Milan. O n 14 May 2018, a trial commenced in the Court of Milan . The FRN was admitted as a civil claimant by a court decision on 20 July 2018. On 18 September 2018, Shell was joined to the proceedings as the c ivilly responsible party ( responsabile civile ) for the damages caused by the alleged illegal acts of the four former Shell employees. Three other Shell entities (Shell UK Ltd, Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria L td. and Shell Exploration and Pr oduction Africa L td.) also joined the proceedings as responsabile civile for their respective former employees at th at phase of the proceedings. On 17 March 2021, the Court of Milan acquitted the Shell entities and four former Shell employees of all charge s on the grounds that there was no case to answer. The Court of Milan published the full grounds for its decision on 9 June 2021. The decision is under appeal. On 20 September 2018, a guilty judgement was filed by the Milan Judge of the Preliminary Hearing in a separate OPL 245 fast -track trial of two individuals, neither of whom worked for or on behalf of Shell. That decision was appeal ed to the Court of Appeal which rendered its judgement on 24 June 2021, acquitting both individuals. Separate OPL 245 pre -trial criminal proceedings are pending against another individual who also did not work for or on behalf of Shell. In February 2019, Shell was informed by the Dutch Public Prosecutor's Office that they were nearing the conclusion of their investigation and preparing to prosecute Shell plc for criminal charges directly or indirectly related to the 2011 settlement of di sputes over OPL 245 in Nigeria. On 2 October 2019 , the U S Department of Justice (\" DOJ \") informed Shell that it was closing its inquiry into Sh ell in relation to OPL 245. Shell understands that the decision was based on the facts available to the DOJ, including ongoing legal proceedings in Europe. On 22 April 2020, the SEC notified Shell that it had also closed its inquiry into Shell in relation to OPL 245. There remains a high degree of uncertainty around the OPL 245 matters and contingencies discussed above, as well as their potential effect on future operations, earnings, cash flows and Shell's financial condition. Accordingly, at this time, i t is not practicable to estimate the magnitude and timing of any possible obligations or payments. Any violation of anti -bribery, anti -corruption or anti -money laundering legislation could have a material adverse effect on Shell plc's earnings, cash flows and financial condition . Business Update Simplification exercise and change of name On 10 December 2021, the shareholders of Shell plc approved changes to its Articles of Association which permitted Shell plc to simplify its share structure through (i) the establishment of a single line of shares and (ii) alignment of Shell plc's tax residence with its country of incorporation by relocating the Shell plc Board and Executive Committee meetings, as well as its Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial O fficer, to the United Kingdom and (iii) granting the Board the power to change Shell plc's name. On 20 December 2021, the Board decided to proceed with the proposal. On 21 January 2022, Shell plc changed its name from Royal Dutch Shell plc to Shell plc and on 29 January 2022, a single line of shares was established through assimilation of class A shares and class B shares into a pool of ordinary shares of Shell plc. This assimilation had no impact on the voting rights or dividend entitlements related to suc h shares. Following the assimilation, the Dutch withholding tax which previously applied to dividends on class A shares, no longer applies in relation to the dividends paid on the ordinary shares. The simplification was designed to strengthen Shell's compe titiveness and accelerate shareholder distributions and the delivery of Shell's strategy to become a net -zero emissions energy business. Integrated Gas Key portfolio events included the following: In March 2021, Shell completed the sale of a 26.25 per ce nt. interest in the Queensland Curtis LNG Common Facilities to Global Infrastructure Partners Australia for $2.5 billion. Shell plc and Shell International Finance B.V. 101 In June 2021, Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind, Shell's 50:50 joint venture with EDF Renewables North America, was awarded rights to prov ide 1.5 gigawatt of renewable offshore wind po wer to New Jersey, USA. In July 2021, Shell signed a memorandum of understanding with Deutsche Telekom to advance digital innovation as both companies accelerate d their transitions to net -zero emissions. In Jul y 2021, Shell started production in Block 5C in the East Coast Marine Area off the coast of Trinidad and Tobago. In December 2021, Shell completed the acquisition of Savion LLC, a large utility -scale solar and energy storage developer in the USA. In Decemb er 2021, Shell signed a gas concession agreement for Block 10 in Oman. In January 2022, Shell announced that Shell and Scottish Power had won bids to develop 5 gigawatt of floating wind po wer in the UK. In January 2022, Shell started operations at the powe r-to-hydrogen electrolyser in China. In February 2022, Shell completed the acquisition of online energy retailer , Powershop Australia which was announced in November 2021. In February 2022, Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind, Shell's 50:50 joint venture with ED F Renewables North America, became the provisional winner of acreage in the New York Bight offshore wind auction, USA. In February 2022, Shell announced its intention to exit its joint ventures with Gazprom and related entities, including its 27.5 per cent . interest in Sakhalin -2 and involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project (see also \" Recent Developments \" below) . Upstream Shell took the following key p ortfolio decisions during 20 21: In Brazil, in August 2021, Shell announced the final investment de cision ( \"FID\") taken by the Libra consortium, operated by Petrobras, to contract the Mero -4 floating production, storage and offloading vessel to be deployed at the offshore Mero field in the Santos Basin. In Malaysia, in August 2021, Shell announced the F ID on the Timi gas development project. In the US Gulf of Mexico, in July 2021, Shell took the FID for Whale, a deep -water development in the US Gulf of Mexico that features a 99 per cent. replicated hull and a n 80 per cent. replication of the topsides of Shell's Vito project. Shell continue s to review positions that are outside its risk appetite, such as Nigeria ons hore. In the last decade , Shell has reduced the total number of licences by half and Shell continue s to review the portfolio options for Nigeri a onshore oil and gas. Shell continued to divest assets during 2021, including: In Canada, in April 2021, Shell completed the sale of its Duvernay light oil position in Alberta. The transaction had an ef fective date of 1 January 2021. In Egypt, in Septem ber 2021, Shell completed the sale of its upstream assets in Egypt's Western Desert. Oil Products Significant portfolio and business developments included: In July 2021, Shell announced the start -up of Europe's largest polymer electrolyte membrane hydrogen electrolyser at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland, Germany, producing green hydrogen (hydrogen produced from renewable energy sources). Shell plc and Shell International Finance B.V. 102 In July 2021, Shell's subsidiary , Shell Deutschland , reached an agreement for th e sale of its non -operated 37.5 per cent. shareholding in the PCK Schwedt Refinery, 120 km north -east of Berlin, Germany. In August 2021, trading in shares of Ra\u00edzen S.A. (Shell's joint vent ure holding an interest of 44 per cent. ) began on the S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange (B3) in Braz il, after a successful initial public offering. In September 2021, Shell announced the FID to build an 820,000 tonnes -a-year biofuels facility at the Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam, the Netherlands, which was formerly known as the Pernis refinery. In October 2021, Shell signed an agreement to acquire the retail gas station network (including gas stations, convenience retail and dealer supply agreements) from the Landmark group of companies, a Texas -based fuel retail and convenience retailing business. The deal was completed in June 2022 . In January 2022, Shell's subsidiary , Shell Oil Company , completed the sale of its interest in Deer Park Refining Limited Partnership, in Texas, USA. This was a 50:50 joint venture bet ween Shell Oil Company and P.M.I. No rteamerica, S.A. De C.V. (a subsidiary of Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos). The transaction transferred Shell's interest in the partnership, and with it full ownership of the refinery, to Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos . The agreement for sale of interest was reached in May 2021. Shell Chemical L. P. continues to operate its 100 per cent. owned Deer Park Chemicals facility located adjacent to the site. In July 2022, Shell announced that Shell USA, Inc. and Shell Midstream Partners, L.P. had executed a definitive agreement and plan of merger, pursuant to which Shell USA, Inc. will acquire all of the common units representing limited partner interests in Shell Midstream Partners, L.P. held by the public. Recent Developments Russia's recent invasion of Ukraine poses wide -ranging challe nges. Given the evolving situation, there are many unknown factors and events that could materially impact Shell's operations. These events have and continue to impact commodity prices, supply chain, credit risks including those related to receivables, com modity trading, treasury and other factors. Any of these factors, individually or in aggregate, could have a material effect on Shell's earnings, cash flows and financial condition. On 28 February 2022, following Russia's invasion in Ukraine, Shell announc ed its intention to exit its ventures in Russia with Gazprom and related entities, and to end its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project. At the end of 2021, Shell had around $3 billion in non -current assets in these ventures in Russia. In 2021, net income from Sakhalin Energy and Salym was $0.7 billion. Subsequently, on 8 March 2022, Shell announced its intent to withdraw from its involvement in all Russian hydrocarbons, including crude oil, petroleum products, gas and LNG in a phased manner, a ligned with the new UK government guidance. Since these announcements, Shell has stopped all spot purchases of Russian crude, LNG , and of cargoes of refined products directly exported from Russia. As of the date of this Information Memorandum, Shell is no t intending to renew long -term contracts for Russian oil, unless under explicit government direction, but is still legally obliged to take delivery of crude bought under contracts that were signed before the invasion. By the end of 2022, all of Shell's lon g-term thi rd party purchases of Russian crude will stop, except for two contracts with a small, independent Russian producer. All of Shell's contracts to purchase refined products exported from Russia will also conclude by the end of 2022 . Shell still has long-term contractu al commitments for Russian LNG and reducing European reliance on piped natural gas supplies from Russia is also a very complex challenge that requires concerted action by governments, as well as energy suppliers and customers. The decisi ons to start the process of exiting ventures with Gazprom and related entities, to end the involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project and to shut down its service stations, aviation fuels and lubricants operations in Russia has impact ed the carrying value of the related assets and led to recognition of impairments in 2022. Details of these impairments can be found in Note 9 to the Q2 Report incorporated by reference in this Information Memorandum. Details of Shell's interest in the respective venture s and operations are as follows: Shell plc and Shell International Finance B.V. 103 Sakhalin -2: Shell has a 27.5 per cent. interest in Sakhalin -2, an integrated oil and gas project located on Sakhalin island, accounted for as an associate. Other ownership interests are Gazprom 50 per cent., Mitsui 12.5 pe r cent. and Mitsubishi 10 per cent. Salym: Shell has a 50 per cent. interest in Salym Petroleum Development N.V., a joint operation with Gazprom Neft that is developing the Salym fields in the Khanty Mansiysk Autonomous District of western Siberia. Nord Stream 2: Shell is one of five energy companies which have committed to provide financing and guarantees for up to 10 per cent. of the total cost of the project, which is accounted for as a long -term loan. Shell's downstream operations in Russia: Shell ow ns 100 per cent. of its downstream operations in Russia . Shell Overseas Investments B.V. and B.V. Dordtsche Petroleum Maatschappij, which are subsidiaries of Shell plc, have signed an agreement to sell Shell Neft LLC, which owns Shell's retail and lubrican ts businesses in Russia, to PJSC LUKOIL . The completion of such sale was announced on 25 May 2022 . 104 Taxation THE NETHERLANDS This paragraph outlines the principal Dutch tax consequences of the acquisition, holding, settlement, redemption and disposal of the Notes. It does not present a comprehensive or complete description of all aspects of Dutch tax law which could be relevan t to a Noteholder. For Dutch tax purposes, a Noteholder may include an individual or entity that does not h old the legal title of t he Notes, but to whom or to which, the Notes are , or income from the Notes is, nevertheless attributed based either on this individual or entity owning a beneficial interest in the Notes or on specific statutory provisions . These includ e statutory provisio ns attributing Notes to an individual who is, or who has directly or indirectly inherited from a person who was, the settl or, grantor or similar originator of a trust, foundation or similar entity that holds the Notes. Where this paragraph refers to \"Notes \" or \"Noteholder\", such reference includes Coupons or Couponholder (as applicable) . This paragraph is intended as general information only. Prospective Noteholders should therefore consult their own tax adviser regarding the tax consequences of any acquisi tion, holding or disposal of Notes. This paragraph is based on the Dutch tax law as applied and interpreted by Dutch tax courts and as published and in effect on the date of th is Information Memorandum , including the tax rate s applicable on that date, without prejudice to any amendments introduced at a later date and implemented with or without retroactive effect. Any reference in this paragraph made to \"Dutch Taxes \", \"Dutch tax \" or \" Dutch tax law\" should be construed as a reference to any taxes of any nature levied by or on behalf of the Netherlands or any of its subdivisions or taxing authorities or to the law governing such taxes, respectively . The Netherlands means the part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands located in Europe. The statements below are b ased on the assumption that the Final Terms of any Series of Notes will not materially deviate from the Terms and Conditions as described in this Information Memorandum, in particular with regard to the Status of the Notes and the Guarantee. This paragraph does not describe any Dutch tax considerations or consequences that may be relevant where a Noteholder: (i) is an individual and the Noteholder's income or capital gains derived from the Notes are attributable to employment activities, the income from which is taxable in the Netherlands; (ii) is an entity resident in the Netherlands which under the Dutch Corporate Income Tax Act 1969 (Wet op de vennootschapsbelasting 1969 ) (the \"CITA \") is not subject to Dutch corporate income tax or is fully or partly exempt from Dutch corporate income tax (such as a qualifying pension fund); (iii) is an investment institution ( beleggingsinstelling ) as described in Section 6a or 28 CITA; or (iv) is an entity which is a resident of Aruba, Curacao or St. Maarten and fully or part ly conducts a business through a permanent establishment ( vaste inrichting ) Sint Eustatius or Saba, to which the Notes are attributable. A. Withholding tax A Noteholder will not be subject to withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Dutch Taxes, unless, in the case of payments by Shell Finance (or any substitute Dutch principal debtor pursuant to Condition 16 of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes), the Noteholder is a \" Related Entity \" and: (i) is resident in a state that qualifies as a low taxed jurisdiction or a jurisdiction that is listed on the European Union list of non -cooperative jurisdictions (\" Listed Jurisdictions \"); or (ii) is resident in another state, but the interest under the Notes is allo cated by the Noteholder to a permanent establishment situated in one of the Listed Jurisdictions; or Taxation 105 (iii) holds the interest in Shell Finance, directly or indirectly, with the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, to avoid taxation due on the interest rece ived in respect of the Notes by another entity and holds the interest, or is deemed to hold the interest, as part of an artificial arrangement or transaction (or a series of artificial arrangements or composite of transactions) ; or (iv) is resident in a state, not being one of the Listed Jurisdictions, and that state allocates the interest under the Notes to another entity in which the Noteholder holds an interest, and is not able to make use of an applicable rebuttal scheme; or (v) it is not considered a resident under the laws of the state in which it is incorporated, not being one of the Listed Jurisdictions, nor is it considered to be resident in another state, and it is not able to make use of an applicable rebuttal scheme ; or (vi) is a Reverse Hybrid Entity (as d efined below) to the extent that an entity , that is a resident in a jurisdiction that does not treat such Reverse Hybrid Entity as a taxpayer for purposes of a tax levied on profits , holds a Qualifying Interest (as defined below) in the Reverse Hybrid Enti ty and that entity would have been subject to withholding tax based on one (or more) of the items in (i) -(v) above had it been entitled to receive payments under the Notes directly. A Reverse Hybrid Entity is a partnership ( samenwerkingsverband ) incorporat ed or otherwise established under Dutch law or resident or registered in the Netherlands , other than certain investment funds, if at least 50 per cent . of the voting rights, profits rights or capital interests in it are held by affiliated entities ('' Inter est Holders '') that are resident in a jurisdiction that treats such partnership as a taxpayer for purposes of a tax levied on profits and the profits of that partnership would, but for the application of Section 2, paragraph 12 CITA, be attributable to the Interest Holders for Dutch tax purposes . If the conditions above are satisfied, interest, including original issue discount, under the Notes will be subject to a Dutch withholding tax at a rate of 25 .8 per cent . An entity is considered a Related Entity i f: (i) it has a Qualifying Interest in Shell Finance ; (ii) Shell Finance has a Qualifying Interest in the Noteholder; or (iii) a third party has a Qualifying Interest in both Shell Finance and the entity holding the Notes. The term \"Qualifying Interest \" means a direct or indirectly held interest - either by an entity individually or jointly if an entity is part of a collaborating group ( samenwerkende groep ) - that enables such entity or such collaborating group to exercise a definite influence over another entities' dec isions, such as Shell Finance or the Noteholder as the case may be, and allows it to determine the other entities' activities. A jurisdiction is a Listed Jurisdiction if it is considered \"low taxed \" and/or \" non-cooperative \" and it is designated as such in the annually updated ministerial decree of the Dutch Ministry of Finance. At the date of this Information Memorandum , the designated low taxed and/or non -cooperative jurisdictions are the American Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Anguilla, the Bahamas, Bahr ain, Barbados, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, Guernsey, Fiji, Guam, the Isle of Man, Jersey, the Cayman Islands, Palau, Panama, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkmenistan, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Vanuatu and the United Arab Emirates. B. Taxes on inc ome and capital gains A Noteholder will not be subject to any Dutch Taxes on any payment made to the Noteholder under the Notes or on any capital gain made by the Noteholder from the disposal, or deemed disposal, or redemption of, Notes, except if: Taxation 106 (i) the Noteholder is, or is deemed to be, resident in the Netherlands for Dutch (corporate) income tax purposes; or (ii) the Noteholder derives profits from an enterprise, whether as entrepreneur ( ondernemer ) or pursuant to a co -entitlement to the net worth of such enter prise, other than as an entrepreneur or a shareholder, which enterprise is, in whole or in part, carried on through a permanent establishment ( vaste inrichting ) or a permanent representative ( vaste vertegenwoordiger ) in the Netherlands, to which permanent establishment or permanent representative the Notes are attributable; or (iii) the Noteholder is an individual and has a substantial interest ( aanmerkelijk belang ) in Shell Finance or derives benefits from miscellaneous activities ( overige werkzaamheden ) carried out in the Netherlands in respect of the Notes, including (without limitation) activities which are beyond the scope of active portfolio investment activities; or (iv) the Noteholder is not an individual and (a) the Noteholder has a substantial interest, or a fictitious substantial interest, in Shell Finance , (b) which (fictitious) substantial interest is held with the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of avoiding income tax due by an individual and (c) there is an artificial arrangement or transaction (or a series of arrangements or composite of transactions to achieve such purpose); or (v) the Noteholder is not an individual and is entitled to a share in the profits of an enterprise or a co - entitlement to the net worth of an enterprise, other than by way of the holding of securities, which is effectively managed in the Netherlands and to which enterprise the Notes are attributable; or (vi) the Noteholder is an individual and is entitled to a share in the profits of an enterprise, other than by way of securities , which is effectively managed in the Netherlands and to which enterprise the Notes are attributable. Generally, a Noteholder has a substantial interest if such Noteholder, alone or together with his partner or one of certain relatives of the Noteholder or his partner , directly or indirectly: (i) owns, or holds certain rights on, shares representing five per cent. or more of the total issued and outstanding capital of Shell Finance , or of the issued and outstanding capital of any class of shares of Shell Financ e; or (ii) holds rights to, directly or indirectly, acquire shares, whether or not already issued, representing, directly or indirectly, five per cent. or more of the total issued and outstanding capital of Shell Finance , or of the issued and outstanding capita l of any class of shares of Shell Finance ; or (iii) owns, or holds certain rights on, profit participating certificates that relate to five per cent. or more of the annual profit of Shell Finance or to five per cent. or more of the liquidation proceeds of Shell Finance . A Noteholder who is an individual and has the ownership of shares of Shell Finance , will also have a substantial interest if his partner or one of certain relatives of the Noteholder or of his partner has a (fictitious) substantial interest. If a Noteholder who has a substantial interest in Shell Finance holds other shares in Shell Finance , including shares of a different class, or holds profit -sharing certificates of Shell Finance , these will also become part of the substantial interest of the Not eholder. Generally, a Noteholder has a fictitious substantial interest if, without having an actual substantial interest in Shell Finance : (i) an enterprise has been contributed to Shell Finance in exchange for shares on an elective non - recognition basis; (ii) the shares have been obtained under inheritance law or matrimonial law, on a non -recognition basis, while the disposing shareholder had a substantial interest in Shell Finance ; Taxation 107 (iii) the shares have been acquired pursuant to a share merger, legal merger or legal dem erger, on an elective non -recognition basis, while the Noteholder prior to this transaction had a substantial interest in an entity that was party to that transaction; or (iv) the shares held by the Noteholder, prior to dilution, qualified as a substantial inte rest and, by election, no gain was recognised upon disqualification of these shares. C. Gift tax or inheritance tax No Dutch gift tax or inheritance tax is due in respect of any gift of the Notes by, or inheritance of the Notes on the death of, a Noteholder, unless : (i) the Noteholder is resident, or is deemed to be resident, in the Netherlands at the time of the gift or death of the Noteholder ; or (ii) the Noteholder dies within 180 days after the date of the gift of the Notes and was, or was deemed to be resident in the Netherlands at the time of the Noteholder's death but not at the time of the gift; or (iii) the gift of the Notes is made under a condition precedent and the Noteholder is resident, or is deemed to be resident, in the Netherlands at the time the condition is fulfilled. D. Other taxes No other Dutch Taxes, including turnover or value added taxes and taxes of a documentary nature, such as capital tax, stamp or registration tax or duty, are payable by or on behalf of a Noteholder by reason only of the issue, acquis ition or transfer of the Notes. E. Residency A Noteholder will not become a resident or deemed resident of the Netherlands by reason only of holding the Notes. THE UNITED KINGDOM The following is a summary of the Issuers ' understanding of current United King dom law and HM Revenue & Customs ( \"HMRC \") published practice relating only to United Kingdom withholding taxation treatment at the date hereof in relation to payments of interest in respect of the Notes. The comments do not deal with any other United Kingd om tax implications of acquiring, holding or disposing of Notes. The comments relate only to the position of persons who are absolute beneficial owners of the Notes. The United Kingdom tax treatment of prospective Noteholders depends on their individual ci rcumstances and may be subject to change in the future. Prospective Noteholders should be aware that the particular terms of issue of any series of Notes as specified in the relevant Final Terms (or Pricing Supplement, in the case of Exempt Notes) may affe ct the tax treatment of that and other series of Notes. The following is a general guide and should be treated with appropriate caution. Prospective Noteholders who may be subject to tax in a jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom or who are in any dou bt as to their tax position should consult their professional advisers. A. Payments of interest by an Issuer Payments of interest on the Notes that do not have a United Kingdom source may be made without deduction or withholding on account of United Kingdom i ncome tax. If interest paid on the Notes does have a United Kingdom source, then payments may be made without deduction or withholding on account of United Kingdom income tax in the following circumstances. Payments of interest on the Notes may be made wit hout withholding or deduction for or on account of United Kingdom income tax provided that the Notes carry a right to interest and the Notes are and continue to be listed on a \"recognised stock exchange \" as defined in Section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The London Stock Exchange is such a recognised stock exchange. Securities will be treated as listed on the London Stock Exchange if they are included in the Official List (within the meaning of and in accordance with the provisions of Part 6 of the Fina ncial Services and Markets Act 2000) and admitted Taxation 108 to trading on the London Stock Exchange. Provided, therefore, that Notes carry a right to interest and are and remain so listed, payments of interest by an Issuer on such Notes may be made without withholdi ng or deduction for or on account of United Kingdom income tax. Interest on the Notes paid by an Issuer may also be paid without withholding or deduction on account of United Kingdom tax where the maturity of the Notes is less than 365 days and those Notes do not form part of a scheme or arrangement of borrowing intended to be capable of remaining outstanding for more than 364 days. In other cases, an amount must generally be withheld from payments of interest on the Notes that ha s a United Kingdom source o n account of United Kingdom income tax at the basic rate (currently 20 per cent.), subject to any other available exemptions and reliefs. However, where an applicable double tax treaty provides for a lower rate of withholding tax (or for no tax to be withh eld) in relation to a Noteholder, HMRC can issue a notice to an Issuer to pay interest to the Noteholder without deduction of tax (or for interest to be paid with tax deducted at the rate provided for in the relevant double tax treaty). B. Payments by Guarant or The United Kingdom withholding tax treatment of payments by the Guarantor under the terms of the Guarantee which have a United Kingdom source is uncertain. In particular, i f Shell plc (as Guarantor) makes any payments in respect of interest on the Notes (or other amounts due under the relevant Notes other than the repayment of amounts subscribed for the Notes) the payments may be regarded as having a United Kingdom source . Such payments by Shell plc may not be eligible for the exemptions described at A above in relation to payments of interest and therefor e such payments may be subject to withholding on account of United Kingdom tax at the basic rate . C. Other Rules Relating to United Kingdom Withholding Tax 1. Notes may be issued at an issue price of less than 100 per cent. of their principal amount. Any discount element on any such Notes will generally not be subject to any withholding on account of United Kingdom tax pursuant to the provisions mentioned in A above . 2. Where Notes are issued with a redemption premium, as opposed to being issued at a discount, then any such element of premium may constitute a payment of interest. Payments of interest are subject to withholding on account of United Kingdom tax in certain circumstances , as set out in A above. 3. Where interest has been paid under deduction of United Kingdom income tax, Noteholders who are not resident in the United Kingdom may be able to recover all or part of the tax deducted if there is an appropriate provision in any a pplicable double taxation treaty. 4. The references to \"interest \" and \"principal \" in this summary of the United Kingdom withholding tax position mean \"interest \" and \"principal \" as understood in United Kingdom tax law. The statements in this summary do not tak e any account of any different definitions of \"interest \" or \"principal \" which may prevail under any other law or which may be created by the Terms and Conditions of the Notes or any related documentation. 5. This summary description of the United Kingdom with holding tax position assumes that there will be no substitution of an issuer pursuant to Condition 16 of the Notes and does not consider the tax consequences of any such substitution. THE PROPOSED FINANCI AL TRANSACTIONS TAX (\"FTT \") On 14 February 2013, th e European Commission published a proposal (the \"Commission 's Proposal \") for a Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the \"participating Member States \"). However, Est onia has since stated that it will not participate. Taxation 109 The Commission 's Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. The issuance and subscriptio n of Notes should, however, be exempt. Under the Commission 's Proposal, the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, \"established \" in a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, includin g (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a participating Member State. However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation betwee n participating Member States. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional Member States may decide to participate. Prospective holders of Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT. FOREIGN ACCOUNT TAX COMPLIANCE ACT ( \"FATCA \") Pursuant to certain provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, commonly known as FATCA, a \"foreign financial institution \" (as defined by FATCA) may be required to withhold on certain payments it makes ( \"foreign passthru payments \") to persons that fail to meet certain certification, reporting or related requirements. The Issuers may be foreign financial institutions for these purposes. A number of jurisdictions (including the Ne therlands and the United Kingdom ) have entered into, or have agreed in substance to, intergovernmental agreements with the United States to implement FATCA ( \"IGAs \"), which modify the way in which FATCA applies in their jurisdictions. Under the provisions o f IGAs as currently in effect, a foreign financial institution in an IGA jurisdiction would generally not be required to withhold under FATCA or an IGA from payments that it makes. Certain aspects of the application of the FATCA provisions and IGAs to instruments such as Notes, including whether withholding would ever be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as Notes, are uncertain and may be subject to change. Even if withholding would be required pursuant to FAT CA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as Notes, such withholding would not apply prior to the date that is two years after the date on which final regulations defining foreign passthru payments are published in the U.S. Federal Register and Notes characterised as debt (or which are not otherwise characterised as equity and have a fixed term) for U.S. federal tax purposes that are issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which final regulations defining foreign passthru payments are published generally would be grandfathered for purposes of FATCA withholding unless materially modified after such date (including by reason of a substitution of the Issuer s). However, if additional Notes (as described in Condition 12 of the terms and conditions of the Notes) that are not distinguishable from previously issued Notes are issued after the expiration of the grandfathering period and are subject to withholding under FATCA, then withholding agen ts may treat all Notes, including the Notes offered prior to the expiration of the grandfathering period, as subject to withholding under FATCA. Holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding how these rules may apply to their investment in Notes. 110 Subscription and Sale Subject to the terms and conditions in an amended and restated Dealer Agreement dated 26 September 2022 between Shell Finance, Shell plc , the Dealers and the Arranger (as modified and/or supplemented and/or restated from time to ti me, the \"Dealer Agreement \"), Notes may be offered on a continuous basis by each Issuer to the Dealers. Such Notes may be resold at prevailing market prices, or at prices related thereto, at the time of such resale, as determined by the relevant Dealer. The Dealer Agreement also provides for Notes to be issued in syndicated Tranches which are jointly and severally underwritten by two or more Dealers. The Dealer Agreement provides that the obligation of any Dealer to subscribe for Notes under any such agreeme nt is subject to certain conditions and that, in certain circumstances, a Dealer shall be entitled to be released and discharged from its obligations under any such agreement prior to the issue of the relevant Notes . Shell Finance and Shell plc have agreed to indemnify the Dealers, on a joint and several basis, against certain liabilities in connection with the offer and sale of Notes. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Regulation S Category 2 The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the United St ates Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act \") or the securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction of the United States and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons exce pt in certain transactions exempt from or not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

Appendix 1 119 Appendix 1 - Overview of differences between UK -adopted intern ational accounting standards a nd the Dutch Accounting Standards Summary of Dutch Accounting Standards accounting policy as applied Summary of equivalent UK -adopted international accounting standards (UK -adopted IFRS) requirements Financial Assets Basic financial assets comprise cash at bank and in hand and amounts owed by group undertakings. Financial assets are initially measured at fair value. Financial assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. If there is objective evidence of impairment, the amount of the impairment loss is determined and recognised in the profit and loss account for all categories of assets. The amount of impairment losses on financial assets stated at amortised cost is measure d as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss shall be reversed. The reversal shall not result in a carrying amount of the financial asset that exceeds what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised at the date the impairment is reversed. The amount of the reversal shall be recognised in the profit and loss ac count. Financial assets are classified at initial recognition and subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income ( FVOCI ) or fair value through profit or loss ( FVTPL ). The classification of financial assets is dete rmined by the contractual cash flows and , where applicable , the business model for managing the financial assets. A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if the objective of the business model is to hold the financial asset in order to collect co ntractual cash flows and the contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest. Financial assets at amortised cost are initially recognised at fair value plus or minus transaction costs that are directly attribu table to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset. Subsequently the financial asset is measured using the effective interest method less any impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or im paired. All equity instruments and other debt instruments are recognised at fair value. For equity instruments, on initial recognition, an irrevocable election (on an instrument -by-instrument basis) can be made to designate these as at FVOCI (without rec ycling to profit and loss) instead of FVTPL. Dividends received on equity instruments are recognised as other income in profit or loss when the right of payment has been established, except when the company benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in other comprehensive income. The impairment requirements for expected credit losses (ECLs ) are applied to financial assets measured at amortised cost, financial assets measured at FVOCI and financial guarantees contracts to which UK- adopted IFRS 9 is applied and that are not accounted for at FVTPL. If the credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition, the loss allowance for the financia l asset is measured at an amount equal to the lifetime ECLs . In other instances, the loss allowance for the financial asset is measured at an amount equal to the twelve month ECLs . ECL is only in UK-adopted IFRS and is hence Appendix 1 120 different to Dutch Accounting Standards . Changes in loss allowances are recognised in profit and loss account. For trade debtors that do not contain a significant financing component, the simplified approach is applied recognising expected lifetime credit losses from initial recognit ion. Therefore, only significant difference in methodology relates to ECL, and this is not determined to be material for S hell Finance . Financial Liabilities Basic financial liabilities comprise trade and other creditors, bonds and amounts owed to gr oup undertakings. Financial liabilities are measured initially at fair value. Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Financial liabilities are derecognised when the liability is extinguish ed. Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, unless they are required to be measured at FVTPL, such as instruments held for trading, or opted to measure them at FVTPL. Debt is recognised initially at fair value based on amounts exchanged, net of transaction costs, and subsequently at amortised cost. Shell believe s the requirements of Dutch Accounting Standards are materially consistent to UK-adopted IFRS. Interest expense Interest expense is allocated to successive financial reporting pe riods in proportion to the outstanding principal. Premiums and discounts are treated as annual interest charges so that the effective interest rate, together with the interest payable on the loan, is recognised in the profit and loss account, with the amor tised cost of the liabilities being recognised in the balance sheet. Period interest charges and similar charges are recognised in the year in which they fall due. Interest expense on debt is accounted for using the effective interest method and is recog nised in income. Shell believe s the requirements of Dutch Accounting Standards are materially consistent to UK-adopted IFRS. Interest income Interest income is recognised pro rata in the profit and loss account. The effective interest rate for the ass et concerned is taken into account, provided the income can be measured and the income is probable to be received.
