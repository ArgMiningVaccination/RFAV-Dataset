The medical term used to describe high amount of uric acid (gout) is Hyperuricemia! These uric acid stones are extremely dangerous and needs to be kept under control. This post will help you to understand the difficulties you would face if you have high Uric acid in your body. It will also give you an idea about the symptoms and the way Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine will help you overcome Gout! What is Hyperuricemia? Hyperuricemia is nothing but presence of surplus uric acid in the blood. The overflowing Uric acid passes through the liver, and enters your blood. Most of the uric acid is excreted from your body in your urine, or it passes through your intestines to normalize the acid levels. The normal Uric acid levels are; - 2.4 to 6.0 mg/dL for women - 3.4 to 7.0 mg/dL for men Understand what purines are!! Purines are compounds that contain nitrogen. They are either formed inside the cells of your body, or gets into your body from outside when you eat food containing purine. This nitrogen containing compound breaks down into uric acid. When these compounds increase,it gets accumulated in your tissues, and form crystals. This causes high uric acid levels in the blood.Uric acid formation will lead to problems like kidney stones and gout (gathering of uric acid crystals in the joints). Causes of Hyperuricemia! - Heredity reasons play an important role in determining a person's risk in developing Hyperuricemia. - Age and Gender factor is another major issue; it is said that it occurs more common in men than in women! - Consumption of alcohol - Obesity - Intake of food that's rich in purines causes gout for some people.. - Diseases in the kidney - Certain medications can cause increased levels of uric acid in the body - Problems related to Endocrine glands and metabolic conditions can raise the uric acid levels of the body 11 Reasons that cause gout attack - Medicines that affect kidney function - Cyclosporine is given to organ transplant recipients that raises uric acid levels - Aspirin given in low dosage can raise uric acid levels in the blood - Obesity - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol) - Diabetes - Consumption of alcohol - Injuries at your joints - Fad diets, fasting, and dehydration - Body temperature; because gout attacks people more in cold regions Some symptoms of Hyperuricemia - Predominantly, you may not have any symptoms!
