Conventional (allopathic) medicine excels at emergency medicine and symptom management. The strength of naturopathic medicine is its focus on identifying the underlying cause of the condition and helping the patient to change those conditions. Whereas conventional medicine relies heavily on pharmaceutical drugs, naturopathic medicine relies primarily on diet, lifestyle, and natural products (e.g. vitamins, herbs) as treatment interventions. Naturopathic medicine has much to offer patients with conditions for which conventional medicine has been unable to offer much relief- chronic diseases, cancer, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune conditions, and toxic exposures. By evaluating the roles of genetics, environment, and lifestyle, we are able to individualize the care we provide for each patient. Naturopathic Doctors Naturopathic doctors (N.D.s) are licensed primary care providers in the state of Washington and are covered by many insurance plans. The role of doctor [L. docere, teacher] is taken literally and, thus, a large part of our medicine revolves around education. Our goal is to teach the patient what is happening in their body, why it is happening, and what they can do about it. Patients who see a naturopathic doctor usually do so for a number of reasons. Some seek preventative counseling, others have an aversion to pharmaceutical drugs, and others come because conventional medicine has been inadequate in their treatment.
