It is the end of our Li Chun Solar Term and the start of Rain Water Solar Term. You may have also experienced more rains and increased humidity especially for those of us in Singapore, which fits exactly to this switch to another seasonal term. The change in weather right now marks first of the 24 changes in our seasonal, astronomical, natural phenomena in the course of a year, as our ancestors have determined it. In the olden days and in current rural areas of China, this is the season when familial ties are strengthened through acts of gratitude between members not related by blood. Wives went back to their parental homes to do visitations, children were pledged to godparents if they did not have one, daughters- and sons-in-laws prepared traditional dishes for parents-in-law to show their appreciation of them for raising their partners. As doctors, our duties are just like parents, taking care of the mass public in ways we are trained, empowered and capable of. (Except that I don't nag as much) So today let me share some precious Traditional Chinese Medicine and Fengshui tips with you for this seasonal term when rain is frequent, humidity is high and temperature changes are extreme. 1. Take more dampness clearing foods Dampness is more easily accumulated in the body with the high humidity in the environment during these upcoming two weeks. This is also the period when the digestive system tends to be sluggish. You may feel like you have less appetite during this period of time. Some suggestion for dampness clearing foods that you can opt for the next time you are out shopping or having meals: China Barley, Adzuki beans, Hyacinth beans, Millet, Corn, Chinese Yam You can read more about my blog on [Everything you need to know about Dampness](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-dampness). 2. Take more foods that nourish Stomach This is the period when Stomach's energy is weaker. Take foods that can nourish the lining of the gut. Example: Red dates, Goji Berries, Licorice, Sweet potatoes 3. Avoid foods that stimulate the Liver Liver's energy is still on the high side and unstable during this time. So cut down or stay away from foods that can cause over stimulation of Liver even further. Some foods to avoid: Alcohol, citrus fruits, tamarind, rhubarb, tart cherries, gooseberries, cranberries, vinegars, kimchi 4. Water your plants with the rainwater during this period There is a traditional saying, \"the spring rain is as precious as oil\". So during this period, try watering your plants with the rain water, you may find that your plants can grow to become more lush and luxuriant. 5. Wear clothes that can cover and keep warm This is the term when temperatures change drastically as we are interspersed with sudden hot and cold weather changes. So avoid short sleeves and shorts/skirts, wear clothes that can keep you warm. 6. Keep immunity high With high humidity and temperature changes, chances of falling ill and catching flus are high too. Exercise regularly and drink enough water to keep your guards of health up.

Keep spirits high Spring is still in the season and in Traditional Chinese Medicine, this is the season of depression and anger. Practice compassion and self love more. Remember to smile and be nice. That is the elixir to keep your spirits high and your heart light. 8. Mantra for this "}
