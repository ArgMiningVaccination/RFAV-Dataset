But that all changed [during an Instagram Live](https://www.instagram.com/tv/B_sok_mlC2s/) with Shani Darden when Jessica Alba whipped out [The Facialift](https://www.sarahchapman.com/facialift-face-massage-roller/) ($50). Not only did this facial massager by Sarah Chapman look bizarre, but, to be honest, it also looked fun to use. Alba nonchalantly rolled it around her jaw like it was a common activity during a video call\u2014and I was intrigued. It's clear Alba has stunning skin. It's glowy, supple, and looks super moisturized and bouncy practically all the time. Though she most likely has access to some top treatments (and stellar genetics), this one product seemed easily accessible. But I had to wonder: Does it actually work on non-celebrity, mere mortal skin like my own? There was only one way to find out. Keep reading for my full product review of the Facialift. Sarah Chapman The Facialift - Best for: All skin types; however, if you have any skin condition, it's best to consult your doctor before use. - Uses: Drains toxins, reduces puffiness, brightens and lifts the skin. - Star Rating: 3.5 - Potential allergens: None, but discontinue use if you're experiencing any pain or irritation. - Price: $50 - About the brand: Sarah Chapman is known for her eponymous skincare line of luxury products and devices.

[Shop](https://www.amazon.com/Sarah-Chapman-Skinesis-The-Facialift/dp/B016IN81D0) About My Skin: Relatively firm (for now) This new addition to my skincare tool arsenal makes number three, following a rose quartz roller and gold bar massager. As you could imagine, I'm obsessed with products that come with the promise of tight, firm skin. But, that's not to say that I've got a lot of [fine lines and wrinkles](https://www.byrdie.com/best-anti-aging-serums-4582774) or sagging skin that I'm obsessing over (but when I do, c'est la vie). It's just that nowadays, it's all about staying ahead of the skincare game. That means giving the largest organ of your body some serious TLC via a proper routine\u2014because, who knows? The right tools and products may even help to plump and lift skin, reduce puffiness, and [brighten your complexion](https://www.byrdie.com/how-to-brighten-your-complexion-3013535). And as it just so happens, the Facialift aims to do just that. The Feel: A mini massage therapist Upon arrival, I noticed the massager itself was a bit flimsier than anticipated. But, after trying it, it packed a lot of power and certainly got the job done. The handle of the tool has two branches that have eight heads with 48 massaging nodules. These nodules basically serve as little wheels that get that blood circulating in your face and work against gravity. All in all, it's a breeze to use and is rather comforting\u2014sitting on the couch after work and rolling it around mindlessly is a nice, healthy way to get your mind off things (and do something nice for your skin, too). How to Use: Push, roll, and tap Although it's not a must, I found applying a [facial oil](https://www.byrdie.com/best-face-oils-4582722) or moisturizer before using my massager helpful. For one, it made it easier to roll around my face and neck, and secondly, I also felt like it was helping my serums better penetrate into my skin. Technically, it's recommended to massage each area (the chin to the ears, either side of the neck, and all over the face) at least six times, but once you get caught up in the trance of it all, it's easy to end up standing in front of the mirror for 15 minutes gazing at your flushed cheeks and funny expressions. The end of the handle is a small round paddle, which the brand recommends tapping around your face and eyes to increase blood flow (and really get that plumpness going). This isn't nearly as fun as the massaging, though. After you're done, make sure to clean the tool with warm water and soap. The Results: A defined jawline Though I can't say my cheekbones are that much more refined, I've noticed my jawline always looks way more defined after the fact (i.e. the [lymphatic drainage](https://www.byrdie.com/what-is-lymphatic-drainage-5071354) is working). It makes me believe in facial workouts as a viable alternative skincare treatment\u2014kind of like [facial cupping](https://www.byrdie.com/cupping-facial-under-eye-bags)\u2014to fillers or a facelift. Interestingly, another unexpected benefit of using the Facialift had nothing at all to do with skin, but rather, pain relief from teeth grinding. As someone who unknowingly developed bruxism, I welcomed this result. And while I still wear a mouthguard\u2014okay, sometimes, wear a mouthguard\u2014to bed, I've noticed a significant difference in other ways. Although it's a tad painful on nights when my jaw is especially tight, The Facialist is like a mini massage therapist for these parts of my face, working out a day's worth of knots and tension. The Science Other than the anecdotes from Jessica Alba, myself, and some happy reviewers, is there proof facial massagers like this one bring about real benefits? Thankfully, yes. One study from 2018 found [they increase and improve blood flow](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965229918306423?via%3Dihub) to your face, and another study conducted in 2017 showed using a [massager with an anti-aging cream](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5383004/) boosted the effects of the product. Even the Byrdie team has a large range of [favorite massage techniques and tools](https://www.byrdie.com/best-face-massagers-4775278) that they swear by. So, don't just take it from me, even science backs our wacky (and much-loved) contraptions. The Value: Accessible luxury Compared to to other facial massagers and sculptors on the market, this one falls into that sweet middle category where cost meets quality. While it may not be as luxurious or as effective as, say, an [NYC spa facial treatment](https://www.byrdie.com/best-facials-nyc), it definitely wields noticeable results\u2014not to mention, it's much more affordable.
