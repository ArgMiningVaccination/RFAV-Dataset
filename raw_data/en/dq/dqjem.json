Obesity can lead to multiple systemic complications. At present, the treatment of obesity is mainly lifestyle intervention, drug weight loss, and weight loss surgery, but the curative effect is limited or the side effects are serious. Traditional Chinese medicine plays a unique role in the treatment of obesity. Existing studies have found that traditional Chinese medicine can treat obesity in a variety of ways, such as regulating intestinal microflora, enhancing hormone level, regulating fat metabolism, and so on. In this review, we will introduce and summarize the mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of obesity. Keywords: metabolism, leptin, intestinal microflora, adiponectin Introduction According to the definition of the World Health Organization, overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health. [1](#cit0001) The prevalence of obesity among children, adolescents, and adults worldwide is increasing every year. [2](#cit0002)- [4](#cit0004) According to the World Health Organization, the worldwide population rate of obesity (BMI 30) in 2016 was significantly higher in all countries, especially the Americas, Europe, and Oceania. With the obesity rate in some countries as high as 60.7%, the need for attention to this problem is urgent. Obesity can lead to injury of multiple biological systems, significantly increasing the risk of metabolism-related diseases, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, Alzheimer's disease, osteoarthritis, and some cancers, [5](#cit0005)- [8](#cit0008) and it increases mortality. [9](#cit0009) To date, the main measures for treating obesity are lifestyle management, drugs for lipid reduction (orlistat and lipopeptide), weight loss surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, or adjustable gastric banding) and strategies [6](#cit0006) to reduce food intake and absorption and increase its utilization. However, due to a typical rebound in weight gain, the high risks associated with surgery and other problems, obesity has not been effectively resolved, and there is an urgent need to find a way to reduce the risks and improve patient compliance. The ancient documentation of traditional Chinese medicine, \"Lingshu Jing of the Inner Canon of Huangdi\", pointed out that obesity means \"people have fat, ointment and meat.\" It characterizes obesity as a disease mainly based on spleen and kidney deficiency and liver depression, with phlegm, dampness, heat, and blood stasis as the standard manifestations. Traditional Chinese medicine has been used for a long time for treating diseases, playing an important role in the treatment of obesity. [10](#cit0010), [11](#cit0011) In this paper, we selected drugs that have been widely discussed in obesity-related metabolic studies and can be used in clinical practice without obvious toxic and side effects, such as Considering that different organ tissues may play similar weight-reducing roles under the role of TCM or TCM extracts in the weight-reducing process, we will mainly generalize from the specific mechanisms (regulating fat metabolism, intestinal Microflora, and regulating hormone level, etc.), as shown in [Figure 1](#f0001). In order to clarify the specific mechanism, the mechanism that plays the same role in different organs will be reflected in the tissue localization in [Table 1](#t0001). Summary of the mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicine and its extracts in the treatment of obesity, specifically as follows. | | Table 1 Mechanism of TCM in the Treatment of Obesity Regulate Fat Metabolism It is well known that excessive energy intake or insufficient energy consumption by the human body can cause mature adipocytes to accumulate lipid and expand. The treatment of obesity can regulate the balance of energy intake and consumption by inhibiting lipid synthesis, promoting lipid decomposition, and/or promoting thermogenic fat activation. Traditional Chinese medicine has been successfully applied to the treatment of obesity in this way. Increase Lipid Decomposition Traditional Chinese medicine can increase the decomposition of lipids to treat obesity through the regulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), autonomic nerves, or -adrenoceptors. After being activated, AMPK can coordinate a variety of metabolic pathways (including liver lipid metabolism), regulate metabolism by phosphorylating key metabolic proteins and transcription factors, promote catabolism and inhibit anabolism. [18](#cit0018) Many traditional Chinese medicines affect lipid synthesis and metabolism by acting on AMPK to induce weight loss. INDUS810 isolated from Trigonella foenum-graecum (L.) can activate AMPK to increase lipid degradation in a time-dependent manner. [19](#cit0019) can [20](#cit0020) The phosphorylation of AMPK induced by the white tiger plus ginseng decoction promotes the expression of ATGL and lipolysis. [21](#cit0021) The smell of grapefruit oil and its active ingredient limonene affects the autonomic nervous system and increases fat decomposition through a histamine reaction. [22](#cit0022) The extract of Nelumbo nucifera leaves can of 3T3-L1 adipocytes mediated by -adrenoceptors. [23](#cit0023) Long-term use of tea catechins (Green tea) could effectively activate the mRNA expression of acyl-COA oxidase (ACO) and medium-chain acyl-COA in the liver, promote the oxidation of fatty acids, and inhibit the diet-induced obesity. [24](#cit0024) Inhibit Fat Production and Accumulation Obesity can lead to adipocyte proliferation and hypertrophy and thus can also play a role in weight loss by inhibiting the proliferation and differentiation of adipocytes. Hydroxy safflower yellow pigment (HSYA), the extract of Carthamus tinctorius, can inhibit the proliferation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in a time- and concentration-dependent of Aster yomena (EEAY) exerts its anti-adipogenic effect by inhibiting or delaying the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and the expression of adipogenic factors (peroxisome (PPAR), response element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c)), inhibiting the de novo synthesis of lipids and the differentiation of adipocytes. [26](#cit0026) The water extract from Ganoderma lucidum mycelia can reduce the expression of adipogenic genes and the level of serum free-fatty-acids (FFAs) in a dose-dependent manner diet (HFD). militaris decrease the expression and activity of SREBP-1c and decrease fat synthesis. [28](#cit0028), [29](#cit0029) Curcumin increases fatty acid synthesis, which inhibits lipogenesis. [30](#cit0030) Traditional Chinese medicine can also inhibit lipid synthesis and metabolism by activating AMPK. Chrysophanic acid (rhubarb) can reduce weight by activating AMPK to inhibit lipid accumulation and the expression of adipogenic factors (PPAR and C/EBP, glucose transporter type the content of intracellular triglycerides after adipocyte differentiation, reduce lipid accumulation during lipid differentiation in an AMPK-dependent manner, and increase the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated can synthesis genes (SREBP-1c, ACC, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1), liver X receptor the expression of ACC and fatty acid synthase (FAS), and reduce fat production. [16](#cit0016) The white tiger plus ginseng decoction can induce the activation of AMPK, inhibit the expression of ACC, and reduce the synthesis and accumulation of lipids. [21](#cit0021) Promote Thermogenic Fat Activation Traditional Chinese medicine can promote the browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) by upregulating the expression of brown adipose tissue (BAT)-related genes in white adipose tissue or activating BAT heat generation to increase energy consumption and weight loss. Celastrol can induce the browning of inguinal adipose tissue (IWAT), 1 thermogenic function and energy consumption. [13](#cit0013) Capsaicin (chili pepper) can induce the browning of WAT by activating transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) channels. [33](#cit0033), [34](#cit0034) Chrysophanic acid increases the expression and PGC1 by AMPK and promoting thermogenesis. [31](#cit0031) Jiang Gui Fang (JG) increases the expression of BAT markers (PPAR, PGC1, and UCP1), activates interscapular brown Ca2+-AMPK signaling pathway in a time-dependent manner to trigger WAT browning in adipocytes and increase the expression of BAT markers in a dose-dependent manner. [17](#cit0017) Curcumin can significantly upregulate the expression of BAT-specific genes (fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), cell death-inducing DNA effector (Tbx1)) and proteins (UCP1, PGC1 and PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16)) to drive BAT thermogenesis. Curcumin can also increase carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) to increase the activity of mitochondria in brown adipocytes and enhance the oxidation of fatty acids. [30](#cit0030) The water extract from Caulis Spatholobi (WECS) can promote whole-body energy metabolism by increasing the oxygen consumption of HFD mice and increasing the levels of BAT febrile (WSE) increases oxygen consumption and enhances the expression of BAT genes, including UCP1, PGC1, type tissue in mice fed a high-fat diet. [37](#cit0037) Regulate Intestinal Microflora Intestinal microflora can affect host energy metabolism, the immune system and the inflammatory response, and changes to its structure and function can promote obesity. By changing the abundance and constituent ratio of intestinal microorganisms, traditional Chinese medicine can increase the proportion and content of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), regulate the levels of bile acids, choline, amino acids, and other metabolites, thus playing a role in improving obesity. Increase the Level of SCFAs SCFAs produced by intestinal microorganisms can activate G protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43) to inhibit insulin signal transduction in adipocytes, thereby inhibiting fat accumulation in adipose tissue and promoting unbound lipid metabolism in other tissues. [38](#cit0038) Acetate, propionate, and butyrate account for 83% of human intestinal SCFAs. [39](#cit0039) Acetate can activate AMPK to increase the indexes related to lipid catabolism, reduce abdominal lipids, and protect the liver and abdomen from lipid accumulation. [40](#cit0040) Butyrate can reduce the accumulation of fat in the liver, reduce metabolism and mitochondrial efficiency, and counteract obesity. [41](#cit0041) Propionic acid, similar to butyric acid, induces weight loss by adjusting the energy balance. [42](#cit0042)- [44](#cit0044) Berberine and capsaicin can improve obesity by increasing acetic acid and propionic acid levels. [45](#cit0045), [46](#cit0046) Chinese cannabis can increase acetate levels to reduce visceral fat and induce weight loss. [47](#cit0047) Protopanaxatriol saponins (PPTs) can increase the levels of SCFAs and their receptors to ameliorate obesity. [48](#cit0048) Inulin can increase SCFAs in the colon and thus affect appetite and the secretion of peptide YY (PYY) from improve the production of intestinal microbiota-derived SCFAs, regulate energy metabolism, and attenuate dyslipidemia induced by high-fat diet in obese rats. [50](#cit0050) The Xiexin decoction reduces weight by increasing the level and activity of key enzyme mRNAs involved in SCFA synthesis and increasing the abundance of intestinal microflora. [16](#cit0016) Regulate the Levels of Bile Acids and Other Metabolites There is a two-way interaction between bile acid and intestinal microbial composition. [51](#cit0051) Bile acid can change the bacterial community structure, affect host metabolism, [52](#cit0052) regulate liver lipid, glucose and energy balance, and maintain metabolic balance. [53](#cit0053) Bile acid can also induce WAT browning by activating G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (TGR5) [54](#cit0054) or directly or indirectly affect glucose metabolism and insulin signal transduction through lipid emulsification, affecting the cell membrane and inducing ectopic functions and receptors (such as liver farnesol X receptor (FXR) and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)). [55](#cit0055) can stimulate the lipolysis of liver through specific lipases (ATGL, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and HSL), inhibit the formation TAG through diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1/2 (DGAT1/2), activate liver AMPK and reduce fatty acid and FAS to reduce hepatic steatosis. [56](#cit0056), [57](#cit0057) It was found that inducing a reduction in the number of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) leads to rapid body weight and fat weight loss. [58](#cit0058) BCAAs can inhibit lipid production and autophagy by activating the liver mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR) and reduce cholesterol intestinal microbial changes, thereby regulating bile acid excretion and reducing fat production. [60](#cit0060), [61](#cit0061) Scutellaria the cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member in the bile acid biosynthesis pathway, and CYP7A1 can prevent the obesity induced by a high-fat diet (the exact mechanism is not clear). [62](#cit0062) Clove, allspice, and aromatic ginger extracts can induce TGR5-mediated BAS weight loss effects. Berberine affects the composition of intestinal microorganisms, activates multienzyme branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC) to promote BCAAs metabolism in the liver and IWAT of mice fed a HFD, and reduces the number of valine, leucine, isoleucine, and during BCAAs biosynthesis, ameliorates BCAAs dysfunction, thus reducing obesity. [64](#cit0064) Regulate Hormone Level Endocrine cells can play roles in environmental balance and neuroendocrine function by secreting circulating hormones such as leptin, insulin, GLP1, PYY, cholecystokinin (CCK) and the hunger hormone, which can affect human eating behavior and signal satiety, playing a role in weight loss. [65](#cit0065) Adipocytes can secrete adiponectin, leptin, and resistin. The most fruitful results in traditional Chinese medicine research on the regulation of hormone-induced weight loss were obtained from studies on leptin and adiponectin. Enhance Leptin Sensitivity Leptin and its receptor (LEPR) are closely related to the regulation of energy uptake and consumption by the central nervous system. [66](#cit0066) Leptin secreted by WAT can act on leptin-sensitive neurons in hypothalamic nuclei and regulate the lipid decomposition of WAT, nonshivering thermogenesis (NST) of BAT, lipid decomposition of beige adipose tissues (BeAT) and NST in brown adipose tissue through the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). [67](#cit0067) Increasing leptin-LEPR signaling and/or that of other neural pathways that activate leptin regulation can ameliorate obesity. Celastrol can inhibit food intake by increasing leptin sensitivity until body weight returns to normal. [68](#cit0068) Astragaloside IV (ASIV) may improve the central leptin sensitivity of obese mice by upregulating the expression of LEPR mRNA and phosphorylation of signal transducer and the of obese mice, promotes leptin-BDNF-axonal growth and synaptogenesis, and plays a role in weight loss by improving leptin sensitivity. [70](#cit0070) It can reverse central leptin resistance. [70](#cit0070), [71](#cit0071) Curcumin can improve the sensitivity to leptin by improving the hypoxic state of cells. [72](#cit0072) Chaihu Shugan powder and the Zhugan of leptin and [73](#cit0073), [74](#cit0074) Regulate the Level of Adiponectin Adiponectin can reduce lipid accumulation in adipose tissue by activating the adiponectin-adenylate protein kinase pathway [75](#cit0075), [76](#cit0076) or activate BAT thermogenesis to regulate energy consumption. [77](#cit0077) Piperonal (pepper) inhibits de novo adipogenesis in mice by increasing the level of circulating adiponectin mRNA, increasing the level of AMPK phosphorylation and S6K1 reducing the and adipogenesis-related mRNAs. [78](#cit0078) Green tea (GT), which is rich in polyphenols, promotes BAT heat production by increasing adiponectin levels and activates AMPKa1 to promote lipid decomposition through PKA-HSL. [79](#cit0079) 6-Gingerol can relieve ectopic lipid accumulation in the skeletal muscle of aging rats by increasing the level of adiponectin and its receptor, activating AdipoR1, and downstream AMPK/PGC1 signaling. [80](#cit0080) Huganqingzhi tablets AMPK and PPAR pathways to inhibit SREBP-1 in the liver and de novo fat production, promote -oxidation of fatty acids, and decrease cellular lipid levels. [81](#cit0081) Sheng Jiang San (SJP) increases the level of serum adiponectin and inhibits the activation of inflammatory bodies and lipid accumulation through the adiponectin-AMPK pathway. [82](#cit0082) Chaihu Shugan powder also reduces lipid synthesis by increasing the level of adiponectin. [73](#cit0073) Regulate the Levels of Other Hormones Among gastrointestinal hormones, GLP-1 and PYY are peripheral hormones associated with anorexia that can increase satiety, while ghrelin can induce hunger. [83](#cit0083) Capsaicin can promote intestinal epithelial cells to secrete PYY and GLP-1, which inhibit the expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AgRP), and activate neurons expressing POMC and CART in the hypothalamic ARC, thus reducing food intake. [46](#cit0046) Geniposide can ameliorate obesity by activating GLP-1 to activate and Sirt1 Siraitia grosvenorii glycoside (L-SGgly) plays a role the level of serum GLP-1 in rats. [85](#cit0085) Rhein increases plasma activity and the level of GLP-1, regulating appetite. [86](#cit0086) A dietary supplement consisting of lemon fruit combined with hibiscus polyphenol extract increases the level of GLP-1 and decreases the level of ghrelin. [87](#cit0087) The triterpenoids in Salvia miltiorrhiza may lead to weight loss by inhibiting the activity of ghrelin. [88](#cit0088), [89](#cit0089) Also, some traditional Chinese medicines can increase the production of gastrointestinal hormones (PYY, GLP-1, CCK, and ghrelin) through SCFAs and play a role in weight loss. Inulin increases the concentration of intestinal hormones and the level of SCFAs by increasing the density of specific intestinal endocrine cells in the colon and regulates the secretion of PYY and GLP-1, respectively, by free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2)-dependent and independent mechanisms. [49](#cit0049) Berberine can induce the expression and secretion of GLP-1 by upregulating SCFAs30 and stimulating GPR43, which can lead to weight loss. [14](#cit0014) Discussion We mainly explain the mechanism of weight loss of TCM according to the above three points, but the mechanism targeting muscle, liver and pancreas is not clear. These tissues play an important role in the metabolism of the human body. For example, insulin, a hormone secreted by pancreatic cells, can increase fat production during hyperinsulinemia. Therefore, in the early stage of increased insulin secretion, properly reducing the level of insulin can improve insulin sensitivity and achieve the purpose of weight loss. [90](#cit0090) In addition, some studies have suggested that resveratrol [91](#cit0091) can improve mitochondrial dysfunction, increase muscle content, reduce fat and lose weight. But it is not clear whether these herbs first improve obesity and then improve the metabolism of these tissues, or whether they first improve the metabolism of these tissues and then improve obesity. A large number of studies in vitro and animal experiments have shown that TCM has the potential of multi-target treatment for obesity ( [Table 1](#t0001)). And in clinical treatment, traditional Chinese medicine physicians use TCM to prove its role in the treatment of obesity. In addition, the theory of food and drug homology made TCM, or named nutraceutical, [92](#cit0092) an unrelated food drug derived from food that is believed to have physiological benefits and to improve chronic disease, more acceptable. This type of nutraceutical has great potential to be applied to human weight loss. However, in clinical use, a combination of multiple drugs is often selected according to patients' personal conditions. The synergistic relationship [93](#cit0093) among these drugs is complex, and the sample drug may have multiple action targets. Therefore, under the uncertain circumstances of the interaction between these drugs, the specific mechanism of single drugs, and the individual differences in the human body, it is still a very difficult and significant task to study the optimal dose, dose-effect relationship, half-life, and the treatment of related adverse reactions that can be used in clinical practice. As obesity and obesity-related metabolic diseases are often multi-gene variation, multi-target disturbance and multi-disease related, it is not realistic to treat obesity in a single way, while TCM's multi-target, synergistic effect between drugs, small toxic and side effects, and easy to obtain from nature will become its advantages in treating obesity.
