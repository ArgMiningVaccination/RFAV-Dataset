ADDED Cefoxitin and Parke Davis)Volume 19, Number 1 January 2005 SHANDS at the University of Florida Drugs & Therapy BULLETIN he Joint Commission for the T Accreditation of Healthcare Organi - zations is emphasizing the medication safety concerns caused by common abbreviations. The Commission has mandated that these abbreviations no longer be used. Orders written using these abbreviations (see table on page 4) are considered invalid.MEDICATION SAFETY Banned abbreviation compliance There is some initial indication that this approach is working. The rst of - cial audit of the use of banned abbre - viations was done in September 2004. The bad news was that in an 8-hour period on 1 day, there were 229 banned abbreviations used. This means over 600 banned abbreviations were being used in 1 day! Clearly, contacting the prescriber for a new order for each of these 600 banned abbreviations would be impractical. However, trend data show some improvement and provides some insight as to where improvement efforts need to be focused. In September, there was a 59% com- pliance rate (ie, number of avoided ab - breviations divided by total number of opportunities to use one of the banned abbreviations). In October, the compli - ance rate rose to 69%. We are optimis - tic that this trend will continue. The AQSA target is 90%. Of the 10 banned abbreviations, \"cc,\" the \">\" and \"<\" symbols, and \"QD\" are the most often abbreviations still used. The use of \"units\" instead of \"U\" has been the greatest improve - ment, and the use of this abbreviation is rarely noted. One innovative method of writing orders about when to \"Contact House Ofcer\" is to create \"less than\" and greater than\" columns, then list the monitoring variables as rows. This avoids spelling out \"less than\" or \"greater than\" for each monitoring variable. Another solution is to create standing orders. Avoiding banned abbreviations is difcult. Old habits are hard to break. However, patient safety requires con - tinued vigilance. (continued on next page) Flu vaccine and shortagesINSIDE THIS ISSUE (See Table on Banned Abbreviations, page 4)Regardless of the difculty, compliance is a requirement, not an option. Hospitals around the country have struggled with how to get prescribers to stop using abbreviations that have been used for years. Regardless of the difculty, compliance is a requirement, not an option. Some hospitals require that every single order with a banned abbreviation be re-written. As you can imagine, this can be very time consum - ing. In some cases, the delay caused by these order clarications could adverse - ly affect patient care. Despite many educational efforts to explain the risks of the banned abbre - viations, their use has continued. Thus, education alone is not the answer. Since holding orders could potentially harm patients and requires a massive amount of manpower, and since educa - tion works slowly and has limitations, how can we possibly solve this prob - lem and avoid regulatory problems? Recently, Shands has entered into an agreement with the College of Medi - cine that provides nancial incentives for improvement in quality measures (ie, Academic Quality Support Agree - ment or AQSA). Avoiding the use of the 10 banned abbreviations in the table is 1 of 84 quality indicators being moni - tored. Compliance with each quality indicator results in potential nancial compensation to the College of Medi - cine. This provides positive incentive for change.2Formulary update, from page 1 Cefoxitin, a second-generation cephalosporin, was added in the For- mulary when cefotetan, the current second-generation cephalosporin listed in the , was discon - tinued by its manufacturer. will be - cally interchanged to cefoxitin. surgical prophylaxis, cefoxitin be interchanged on a milligram-for-milligram basis. However, because cefoxitin has a shorter half-life than cefotetan, cefoxitin will have to be given more frequently than cefotetan for moderate and severe infections. For moderate to severe infections when cefotetan 2 grams IV every 12 hours is prescribed, cefoxitin 2 grams IV every 6 hours will be dispensed. For severe infections when cefotetan 3 grams IV every 12 hours is pre - scribed, cefoxitin 2 grams IV every 4 hours will be dispensed. As with all therapeutic interchanges, a note will be placed in both the Orders and Progress Notes sections of the chart to alert the prescribers and nursing staff of this interchange. Although cefotetan is still consid - ered the preferable second-genera - tion cephalosporin, its unavailability made this change necessary. Cefoxi - tin is available only in limited quanti - ties. Therefore, it is recommended that its use be limited to pre- and peri-operative therapy. Cefazolin plus metronidazole is an alternative and gyne - cological surgeries. cover which are covered by cefoxitin (and cefotetan). Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase type 3 inhibitor approved for treat - ment of intermittent claudication. It decreases platelet aggregation, formation of arterial thrombi, vascu - lar smooth-muscle proliferation, and causes vasodilatation. The American College of Chest Physicians' (ACCP) 2004 guideline for the symptomatic treatment of chronic limb ischemia recommends a limited role for cilostazol. Cilostazol is recommended for patients with disabling intermittent claudication who do not respond to conservative measures (ie, risk factor modication and exercise) and who are not candi - dates for surgical- or catheter-based interventions. Cilostazol should not be used with less disabling claudica - tion. A meta-analysis of 8 randomized, placebo-controlled trials of cilostazol in patients with stable, moderate- to-severe claudication, ranging from 12 to 24 weeks in duration, found that cilostazol signicantly increased the maximal walking distance before pain becomes intolerable and increased the walking distance before the onset of claudication pain by 50% and 67%, respectively. A well-designed post-mar - keting study showed similar results. The most frequently reported adverse events are headache, diarrhea, abnor - mal stools, dizziness, and palpitations. Dose-related increases in resting heart rate (5 to 7 beats per minute) have also occurred, along with increased premature ventricular contractions and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Cilostazol is in a pharmacological class that is dangerous to people with severe heart failure. Additional studies designed to determine the risk of heart failure in patients taking cilostazol are needed. As for the current lack of in - formation on the use of cilostazol with clopidogrel, it is important to weigh the necessity of both medications with the risk of bleeding in each individual patient. Cilostazol was added in the Formu - lary for the maintenance treatment of intermittent claudication. It allows people with intermittent claudication to exercise longer before developing their characteristic leg pain and to walk lon - ger before they have to stop because of pain. Because it takes time for this drug to be fully effective, discontinua - tion of therapy during a hospitalization could affect the ambulation of patients after their discharge. CiproDex\u00ae Otic is a combination of a fluoroquinolone antibiotic (ciprofloxa cin) and a corticosteroid ( dexametha - sone ) with a labeled with tympanostomy tubes and otitis externa. Otic fluoroquinolone suspensions are used for various off- labeled otic infections for which there is little scientic evidence of efcacy. However, the otitis media data are considered applicable for other otic infections. Ofloxacin has been the only otic fluoroquinolone listed in the Formu - lary. Published evidence shows that ciprofloxacin combined with a topical steroid signicantly increases clini - cal cure rates when compared with monotherapy for the treatment of acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes. Topical steroids are added to a fluoroquinolone to re - duce inflammation and enhance clinical response rates. An additional benet for CiproDex\u00ae Otic Suspension is that it is a fluoroquinolone-cor - ticosteroid , but it is not sterile. This product has been requested through the nonformulary process but will now be unavailable. Ofloxacin otic remains in the Formulary as an alternative fluoroquinolone without a corticosteroid. Codeine liquid has been discon - tinued by its manufacturer and there is no other identiable alternative vendor. If it was being used as an antitussive, it is recommended that codeine tablets or guaifenesin plus dextromethorphan liquid be used as an alternative. If a liquid opioid is needed, morphine or oxycodone may be suitable alternatives. Truvada \u00ae is a combination of 2 reverse transcriptase inhibitors, emtricitabine (Emtriva\u00ae) and teno - fovir (Viread\u00ae), used to treat patients infected with HIV. The rationale for the xed combination is to reduce the \"pill burden\" of patients with HIV infections with the goal of improved adherence and therapeutic respons - es. Instead of taking 2 tablets per day, patients taking Truvada \u00ae only take 1 tablet per day. Both of the individual ingredients of Truvada \u00ae are listed in the Formulary. Emtricitabine is a synthetic nucleo - side analog of cytosine. It was added in the Formulary for use in combina - tion with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of patients infected with HIV. Emtricitabine is structur - ally similar to lamivudine (3TC), so patients with HIV strains resistant to lamivudine should not be treated with emtricitabine. Tenofovir is a nucleotide analog of adenosine. It was added in the For- mulary for use in combination with other drugs for the treatment of HIV infection. The FDA approved Truvada\u00ae be- cause the combination tablet is stable and exhibits the same pharmacoki - netic prole as the individual ingredi - ents. Efcacy was based on the data from the individual ingredients. Cost is not an issue, since the indi - vidual ingredients are the same cost as the combination product. However, adding this combination product will add to the hospital's inventory. Therefore, Truvada \u00ae was designated nonformulary and not available and will be automatically interchanged to its individual ingredients. Intravenous pantoprazole and lansoprazole were deemed therapeu - tically the P&T Com - mittee. Shands at UF has previously deemed oral proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) therapeutically equivalent. At this time, pantoprazole remains the oral solid and injectable PPI listed in the Formulary . There is no cost ad - vantage to switching to lansoprazole. Many standing orders already list (continued on next page) 3Formulary update, from page 2 pantoprazole, which was considered when keeping pantoprazole IV in the Formulary . Lansoprazole suspension and orally disintegrating tablets (Prevacid\u00ae Solu - Tab\u00ae) are alternatives to an injectable PPI for patients who cannot take oral solids. Lansoprazole suspension is at least as effective as intravenous PPIs (when used at comparable doses), and may work better because of the bicarbonate used to make the suspension. Pantoprazole injection has been plagued by chronic shortages, which has created considerable workload. When product is unavailable, the wholesale switch of patients from parenteral to enteral PPI administra - tion is required. This requires identi - fying patients, contacting prescribers, changing dosages, etc. Since pan - toprazole and lansoprazole are now considered therapeutic equivalents, lansoprazole IV can now be substi - tuted in these instances. Lansoprazole is more potent than pantoprazole on a milligram-per-mil - ligram basis; however, larger doses of pantoprazole are used, making this he influenza vaccine shortage draws T attention to an issue that has been a problem for longer than just this \"flu\" season...drug shortages. Drug short - ages are a problem for most hospitals and clinics around the country. The in - fluenza vaccine crisis drew attention to the shortage problem because it could result in a increased risk of infectious diseases. In an article published in the New York Times, Johnathan Gruber, an economics professor at MIT, states, \"In America, market incentives yield in - novation, but also uncertainty.\" In other words, even though the United States foots the bill for much of the world's drug development, we are also the rst country to feel the pinch of manufactur - ing changes and decreased product production. The free market system has its benets and risks. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has outlined some of the reasons for increased drug shortages over the last 10 years. The following is not every possible cause for shortages, but covers the major reasons. Production issues, whether attrib - uted to a raw material shortage or problems with manufacturing (eg, costs or work force), quickly result in short - ages. However, manufacturing is not the only culprit. Business decisions to discontinue production of drugs, limited manufacturing capacity, and the number of manufacturers producing a specic product also play a role in drug shortages. Vaccines are particularly vulnerable to market changes. In a news release from the International Vaccine Institute in March 2004, it was noted that the current global capacity for production of monovalent influenza vaccines (a vaccine that contains only 1 viral strain) was no more than 750 million doses per year. The World Health Organization estimated the total global production of trivalent vaccine (ie, the normal 3-strain vaccine) at 260 million doses. This is signicant because production would shift from trivalent to monovalent vac - cines during a pandemic. However, there are currently no estimates on the global use and demand for influenza vaccine. Aventis Pasteur, a US distributor of the influenza vaccine, released a news statement in August that the company expected to provide up to 52 million trivalent doses of the influenza vac - cine to Americans this flu season. As of 2000, the US population was estimated at 281 million. In an article published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that same year, 70 to 76 million people in the United States were considered to be at high risk for influenza. Complicating matters, the World Health Organization estimates each patient could require up to 2 dos - es of the vaccine during a pandemic. Not only is the lack of production concerning, but accidents during pro - duction can destroy huge batches and greatly affect the amount of product available. This is what happened when the Chiron vaccine was contaminated with bacteria (Serratia marcescans). Due to the use of 50-year-old technol - ogy, the methods used to grow the viruses used in vaccines lack advanced safeguards and make the process dif - cult to control. Influenza vaccine is still grown in fertilized chicken eggs that have been inoculated with the virus. After 3 to 4 days of incubation, the egg whites are decontaminated and prepared for quality control screen - ing. If the FDA nds contamination, the batch is lost. New methods are being studied to attempt addressing the tech - nological inferiority of these methods. Companies are working in laboratories to grow the virus in human, dog, and monkey cells, but the FDA has yet to approve any of these newer methods. Some countries, including the United States, are beginning to stockpile vac - cines in order to cover future shortages. However, stockpiling influenza vaccine in preparation for a pandemic is not an option. Influenza vaccine's composition (continued on next page) NEWS Influenza vaccine: shortcomings or shortages? difference irrelevant. Pantoprazole 40 mg is equivalent to lansoprazole 30 mg (ie, a 4:3 ratio in potency). This ratio will be used when interchanging from lansoprazole to pantoprazole, and vice versa. Fosphenytoin is a water-soluble pro - drug of phenytoin that has been listed in the Formulary for many years. It is used to control generalized seizures and for the prevention and treatment of seizures as a short-term substitute for oral phenytoin. Because fosphenytoin is water soluble, it does not need to be diluted with propylene glycol and ethanol, like injectable phenytoin. Also, the pH of fosphenytoin is closer to a physiologi - cal pH (unlike injectable phenytoin, which is very basic). These formulation changes make infusions of fosphenyt - oin less likely to cause infusion-site re - actions (eg, pain, tissue necrosis with extravasation) and permit intramuscu - lar administration when IV access is not possible. Unfortunately, fosphenytoin is 9 times more expensive than phenytoin. Fosphenytoin does not have any ad - vantage over diluted intravenous phe - nytoin in patients with good IV access. Data showing better tolerability of fosphenytoin and phenytoin is based on undiluted phenytoin. Therefore, the criteria for using fosphenytoin have always been limited. A recent audit showed signicant cost savings if the original criteria for use had been followed. Therefore, the P&T Committee approved the restriction of fosphenyt - oin. Fosphenytoin is now restricted to loading doses in patients without vascular access (ie, intramuscular administration) and maintenance doses in patient meeting the fol - lowing criteria: pediatric patients weighing less than 30 kg or less than 12 years old; patients with a history of signicant cardiovascular disease including (but not limited to) arrhyth - mias; patients with poor IV access (including patients with difcult to maintain peripheral IV lines or pa - tients receiving fluids or medications through a PICC line or central line that are incompatible with phenytoin; patients with signicant peripheral vascular disease; and patients with a history of an adverse reaction to intravenous phenytoin.4Volume 19, No.1 January 2005 This publication is produced by the Drug Information and Pharmacy Re - source Center under the direction of the Department of Pharmacy Services and the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee.

Since Chiron's announcement that it would not be able to supply the influenza vaccine, the United States Congress has proposed laws to try to address the shortage. The Influenza Vaccine Emergency Act (H.R. 5243) would allow health ofcials to direct the distribution of the influenza vac - cines to high-risk populations. The Influenza Preparation and Vaccination Act (S. 2959) would establish grants to the states to develop influenza vaccine supply and management programs and would guarantee the federal purchase of unused influenza virus vaccine held by grantees. These are some of the possible long-term solutions. In a quick-x initiative, The Emergency Flu Response Act of 2004 (S. 2968) declared a public health emergency and allowed the importation of vaccine from companies that had not originally been suppliers to the United States. After the declaration, an estimated 5 million imported doses were examined by the FDA. All vaccines imported to the U.S. were received by the government and treated as investigational drugs. Any patients receiving these doses will be required to sign a consent form for administration.On November 9, 2004, the CDC announced that it would distribute the remaining 10.3 million doses of influenza vaccine from Aventis Pasteur through December and January. This plan takes into account many factors, but the number of high-risk patients is the major determinant in the distribu - tion process. The recent influenza emergency is not the rst, nor will it be the last, shortage. Many resources are available to practitioners and the public. The CDC website (www.cdc.gov) and the ASHP drug shortage website ( http:// www.ashp.org/shortage) are regularly updated . The CDC has also established a hotline (1-800-CDC-INFO) to pro - vide practitioners and the public with information on the vaccine shortage. As practitioners, we have a duty to our patients to stay informed. by Brandi Beyhan, PharmD Avoid these abbreviations... and avoid problems The following inappropriate abbreviations CANNOT be used to write a valid order.
