Like many in his profession, Dr. Peter Hanson, a chiropractor in Everett, Wash., considers the flu vaccine to be largely ineffective and potentially more dangerous than the virus it is designed to prevent. \"If the vaccine does not prove to be effective the way it is professed to perform, then maybe the risk of the getting the flu shot is not worth the non-existent benefit of the vaccine,\" Dr. Peter Hanson, an Everett, Washington chiropractor states on his website. Hanson's views represent an industry-wide stance. A survey of websites by licensed chiropractors reveals staunch opposition to vaccines in general, but especially the flu shot. A chiropractor at Integrative Chiropractic in Oakland, Calif., Dr. Aaron Rossell told the Daily News that the bulk of his patients choose not to get the flu shot. In part, that's because Rossell discourages it.

Assertions by chiropractors that the flu vaccine doesn't doesn't measure up to alternative treatments are enough for public health officials to pull their hair out. \"The vaccine is safe and largely effective,\" [Curtis Allen](http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Curtis+Allen), spokesperson for the CDC, told the Daily News. Between 3,000 and 49,000 people in the U.S. die each year after being exposed to the influenza virus, and that this year's vaccine, while not perfect, is \"the best protection we have,\" Allen points out. \"Three strains of flu are combined into this year's vaccine, and 90 percent of the cases that have been reported this year have been covered by it,\" Allen said. An estimated 22 million Americans see a chiropractor at least once a year, most for back pain. Many patients, however, rely on chiropractors to treat a variety of non-muscular ailments, and seek medical advice on a range of topics. Melissa Lee, a spokesperson for the American Chiropractic Association, told the Daily News that the organization does not have a specific policy on the flu vaccine, but refers its members to its overall policy on vaccinations if they ask for guidance on what to advise patients. \"Since the scientific community acknowledges that the use of vaccines is not without risk, the American Chiropractic Association supports each individual's right to freedom of choice in his/her own health care based on an informed awareness of the benefits and possible adverse effects of vaccination,\" the organization's policy states. \"The ACA is supportive of a conscience clause or waiver in compulsory vaccination laws thereby maintaining an individual's right to freedom of choice in health care matters and providing an alternative elective course of action regarding vaccination.\" For doctors at hospitals overwhelmed by flu cases this year, the ACA's stance is anything but comforting. \"Chiropractors should stick to the musculoskeletal system, period,\" [Dr. Paul Offit](http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Paul+Offit), Chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases and the Director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told the Daily News. \"The bad information that they give their patients on vaccines is putting their patients at risk, and what are the consequences? There are none.\" Many chiropractors flag the use of such toxic ingredients as formaldehyde and the mercury-based preservative thimerosal in the vaccines as reasons to avoid the shots. Allen and Offit counter that those chemicals are used in trace amounts to protect the effectiveness of the vaccine, and that thimerosal has been removed from all but multi-use vials out of an abundance of caution. \"There have been seven recent scientific studies on whether exposure to thimerosal caused negative health effects like autism, none did,\" Offit said. While this year's vaccine is only 62% effective, Allen hopes that most people will realize that's a whole lot better than nothing. \"That means for most people who are vaccinated they have reduced their chances of becoming sick with flu by 62%,\" Allen said. \"Therefore, those falling into that 62% will not become sick with flu and will not die or be hospitalized with the disease.\" Offit says that the bulk of the children he sees with serious cases of the flu have not been vaccinated, mirroring what science has proven about the effectiveness of vaccines. \"The data are clear and reproducible,\" Offit said. \"Saying that the flu shot doesn't work is incorrect.\" Still, for many practitioners of chiropractic, the decision on whether to get a flu shot breaks down to what San Francisco chiropractor Dr. Andrew Cohen sees as a \"cost-benefit analysis.\" \"Chiropractors are focused on providing healthcare education so patients can weigh the pros and cons,\" Cohen said. \"I don't have an intrinsic opposition to flu shots or medications in general. Obviously, vaccinations have made society safer, but we we support taking the most conservative approach first and saving medications, vaccinations, and other invasive options for the times when non-invasive techniques can't "}
