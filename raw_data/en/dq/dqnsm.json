It literally didn't even feel like I had extensions on. I recommend her to the fullest! if you're ever looking to get a gorgeous set Elizabeth is your girl. I was new to lashes about three months ago, now I am addicted. I dont even have to put mascara anymore. The atmosphere and place is so relaxing, intimate and all in all just so cute! Oh, and don't get me started on the beds... SO COMFY! Best part of the whole experience was that you can truly tell that Elizabeth loves what she does and her passion truly shows in her sets! So in love and will always go back to see her. Marion Strachon Local Lasher I recently got a facial at Grounded Bodyworks. I was looking for something hydrating right before my wedding and Jenn (the lovely owner) recommended the Osea hydrating facial (I am sure that's not the exact name for the facial, perhaps that is the brand they use) and she was right\u2014that is exactly what I needed before my wedding; something super hydrating and glowy that wouldn't irritate my skin or make me breakout which is normal after a regular facial. After that I have been using Osea products in my daily routine because they are clean (they do not contain harsh chemicals) and the products actually work! They also have them for purchase as well, and I cannot wait to have another facial soon. I highly recommend it. \"Clean\" Beauty Blogger Awesome massage and studio experience at Grounded Bodyworks. I highly recommend this beautiful salon and day spa. Local Chiropractor When I first walked in ,I already felt relaxed! The interior is very welcoming and smells great!! I had an amazing massage. The pressure was great and she was very friendly. I also decided to try a reiki session with Kelly and it was very healing and therapeutic! A must try in the desert!! I will definitely be back when I come out for vacation! Reiki Infused Massage Sesh Everything about this business is stellar. The customer service was incredible, the staff were so kind, and the decor and cleanliness were also fantastic. I would come back here time and time again. I think the bar for customer service has been set so high I will probably be disappointed with everywhere else I go! Thank you for making our girls weekend special and memorable! So much love for this place!!! So Kind! I am so happy to have discovered Grounded Bodyworks Studio for sugaring. After two rather disastrous sessions with two Coachella Valley spas who purportedly know how to sugar (spoiler alert: they do not), the third time has proven to be the charm. Stephanie did my sugaring and I can't be more pleased with the results! She really does meticulous work, and I happen to be extremely fussy. Thanks for doing such a great job! I will definitely be back to avail myself of your other spa services. Grounded Bodyworks has my highest recommendation. Lisa K. Fussy [but happy] New Yorker I loved my treatments here! Don't miss this oasis for all your body needs. My lashes are still looking good three weeks later! Their retail products are great too, I especially like the body scrubs and body oil, in any flavor. I bought so much I did have some juggling to do at the airport to get things home safely. Well worth it! Palo Alto Lash Guest I loved my treatments here!
