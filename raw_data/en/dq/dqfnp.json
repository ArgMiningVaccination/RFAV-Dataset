The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have joined over 130 world leaders, scientists, humanitarians, and more in signing [The People's Vaccine open letter](https://peoplesvaccine.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Vaccine-Open-Letter-March-2022.pdf), and calling for an end to \"vaccine monopolies\" that hinder global access to the COVID-19 vaccine. \"Two years since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic - and faced with disturbingly unequal access to COVID-19 vaccines - we urge world leaders to do what is necessary to end this crisis and unite behind a People's Vaccine,\" the letter reads. The letter criticizes wealthy countries for their handling of the pandemic, specifically calling out the United Kingdom, along with the European Union and Switzerland, for \"block[ing] the lifting of intellectual property rules which would enable the redistribution and scale-up of COVID-19 vaccines, test and treatment manufacturing in the global south.\" It also calls the current approach to vaccine access \"immoral, entirely self-defeating and also an ethical, economic and epidemiological failure.\" \"We appeal to world leaders to end this strategy of counter-productive nationalism and of protecting pharmaceutical monopolies and to finally act with international solidarity,\" the letter continues. \"Now is the time to renew the commitments made at the founding of the World Health Organization, where all states agreed to deliver 'the highest attainable standard of health as a fundamental right of every human being.'\" Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan have also invested in The People's Vaccine Alliance via their Archewell Foundation, with their support going toward the coalition's efforts to \"secure fair vaccine access for low and middle-income countries,\" per the announcement. \"We are proud to welcome Archewell Foundation to the Alliance and appreciate their support, alongside Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex. We will work together to end vaccine inequity and ensure COVID-19 vaccines, treatments + tests are available to everyone,\" reads a Twitter statement. The couple have been vocal advocates for global vaccine access, speaking out during appearances at last year's [Global Citizen Live](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a37736707/prince-harry-meghan-markle-vaccine-equity-global-citizen-live/) [concerts](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a36316885/prince-harry-vax-live-speech/). They also penned their own [open letter](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a38108403/prince-harry-meghan-markle-g20-summit/) to leaders attending the G20 summit last October, and celebrated their son Archie's [second birthday](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a36352867/how-prince-harry-meghan-markle-celebrating-archies-birthday/) by securing donation matches to organizations that purchases vaccines for those across the world who cannot afford them.
