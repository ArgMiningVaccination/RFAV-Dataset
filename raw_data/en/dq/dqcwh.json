You will probably feel overworked, even overwhelmed. Inadequate sleep will leave you fatigued. Caring for a baby can be a lonely and stressful responsibility. You may wonder if you will ever catch up on your rest or work. The solution to this is to ask for help. No one should be expected to care for a young baby alone. Every baby awakens one or more times per night. The key to avoiding sleep deprivation is to know the total amount of sleep that you need per day and obtain it in bits and pieces. Try going to bed earlier in the evening. When your baby naps it is vital that you nap also. While you are napping, turn off the telephone and place a sign on the door stating MOTHER AND BABY SLEEPING. If your total sleep remains inadequate, consider hiring a baby sitter, or asking a relative to help. If you do not take care of yourself, you will not be able to take care of your baby. Postpartum Blues More than 50% of women experience postpartum blues on the third or fourth day after delivery. Symptoms may include tearfulness, tiredness, sadness, and difficulty in thinking clearly. This temporary reaction is linked to the sudden decrease of maternal hormones. Since the symptoms commonly begin on the day of discharge from the hospital, the impact of being totally responsible for a dependent newborn may be a contributing factor as well. Many mothers have the belief that they should be overjoyed about caring for their newborn, and therefore, feel let down and/or guilty about experiencing these symptoms. The symptoms usually diminish as hormone levels return to normal (usually within 1 to 3 weeks), and a routine is developed which provides new parents with a sense of control over life. If the symptoms are not better by the time your baby is one month old, you should contact your physician. There are several ways to cope with postpartum blues. See the following suggestions to help you through this difficult time: Acknowledge your feelings and discuss them with your husbandand/or a close friend. Do not try to suppress crying ortry to be a \"super mom\". Get adequate rest.Get help with housework/childcare. Socialize with others - do not allowyourself to become isolated; try to\"go out\" at least once a week; goto the hairdresser, visit a friend, goshopping, or see a movie. Source: East Lake Pediatrics Dr. Michael JordanThe Father's Role It is important for fathers to take time off of work to be with mom during labor and delivery, as well as when mom and baby first come home from the hospital. Many fathers often feel left out since most of the attention is usually focused on mom and baby. In addition, many fathers are concerned that they may hurt their baby and/or be unable to comfort them if they cry. However, it is important for fathers to get involved. Not only will this help mom, it will help to develop a close relationship with the baby as well. Below are some suggestions of activities that a father can use to develop a closer, stronger relationship with his baby. Visitors and Outings After the much-anticipated arrival of your newborn, many well-meaning friends, family, and neighbors will want to share in your excitement and come by for a visit. As proud new parents, the desire to show off your newborn is normal, and expected. However, it is best to minimize your newborn's contact with unnecessary visitors for at least the first month. It is also recommended to avoid unnecessary outings, and exposure to children, with the exception of siblings. Your newborn's immune system is not equipped to handle all the potential exposure to infectious diseases. Your baby can be taken outdoors; however, sun exposure should be limited to 10 to 15 minutes at a time. It is important to dress your baby with as many layers of clothing as an adult would wear for the outdoor temperature. The most common mistake is overdressing in the warm Florida weather. Overdressing can cause sweating, and an irritating heat rash. In the winter, the baby will need a hat to prevent heat loss.Bathe the baby Change the baby's diaper Assist mom with positioning the baby when breastfeeding Feed the baby pumped breast milkor formula once breastfeeding hasbeen establishedBurp the baby Walk the baby Rock the baby Comfort the baby when fussy Take the baby for a ride in a stroller Play with and talk to the baby Read to the baby Source: East Lake Pediatrics Dr. Michael JordanPhysician Appointments Your baby will have a series of scheduled well child visit's. The first visit will be approximately 2 days after discharge from the hospital, 1 - 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 15 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months of age, and yearly thereafter. The physician will perform a complete physical evaluation on the baby and appropriate immunizations will be administered. Please see the immunizations section for a summary of the scheduled immunizations. It is necessary to schedule a routine newborn exam in the office within 48 hours of discharge from the hospital. The baby will have a full evaluation by the physician. Screening for jaundice, appropriate weight maintenance/gain, voiding and stool patterns, and overall health will be reviewed. The two-week exam is probably one of the most important visits for your baby during the first year of life. Symptoms of any possible physical conditions that were not present during the hospital stay will usually develop by this time. Sleep Position The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends placing your baby in a bassinet/crib with a firm mattress on the infant's back in parent's room for the first 6 months of life. This reduces the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) . To avoid potential smothering unnecessary toys, blankets, and stuffed animals should not be placed in the crib. Jaundice Some degree of yellow jaundice is common and normal for your newborn, especially if breastfeeding. If it becomes significant, your baby may need to be treated with special light therapy. At times we have to supplement a jaundiced baby for better hydration. Jaundice (bilirubin) levels may need to be performed on your infant, which requires a simple heel stick to collect a small amount of blood to determine what intervention, if any, needs to take place. Infection Your infant may need to be observed closely for signs of infection if you have been ill near the time of delivery, or if your water broke, or leaked for an extended period of time. If necessary, your baby may need to be kept in the hospital for evaluation and treatment. Source: East Lake Pediatrics Dr. Michael JordanMetabolic Problems Occasionally, infants may have problems with the level of blood sugar, calcium, etc. This is especially true of infants of diabetic mothers, infants large for gestational age, and premature infants. All infants are screened for inherited metabolic problems through a test called the \"PKU\", or \"newborn metabolic screen\". The test is performed by obtaining a blood sample via a simple heel stick after the baby has had a full 24 hours of feedings. It detects several metabolic diseases including phenylketonuria, sickle cell disease, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Respiratory Problem Occasionally newborns can develop breathing difficulties of varying degrees. This is common in premature infants, very large infants, and infants born by C-section. If the problem becomes severe, your baby will be managed in the Neonatal Care Unit. Weight loss All babies lose a few ounces during the first few days after birth. However, a baby should never lose more than 7 - 10 % of their birth weight. Most bottle-fed babies are back to their birth weight by 10 days of age; breast-fed babies by 14 days of age. Breast Enlargement and Menses Male as well as female babies may occasionally have enlargement and/or a thin discharge from one or both breasts. The area should not be massaged. Cool compresses may be applied. If redness is noted, please call the office for an appointment. Some female infants experience a white, or thin bloody vaginal discharge. The vaginal area should be cleansed well with warm water only. Care should be taken to cleanse the area from top to bottom. Both conditions are due to hormonal influences from mom and will clear on their own. Source: East Lake Pediatrics Dr. Michael JordanNormal Behavior/Development Below is a summary of what you might see your baby doing between the ages of 0 and 2 weeks old. Each infant is unique, however, so it is difficult to describe exactly what should be expected. Source: East Lake Pediatrics Dr. Michael JordanSome normal newborn behaviors that concern parents are actually harmless reflexes; not signs of illness. The following is a list of common reflexes that are due to an immature nervous system and will disappear in 3 or 4 months: Chin trembling Lower lip quivering Hiccups Irregular breathing (This is normal if your baby is content, the rate is less than 60 breaths per minute, any pauses are less than 10 seconds long, and yourbaby doesn't turn blue. Occasionally infants take rapid, progressively deeper,breaths to completely expand their lungs.) Sleep noise from breathing and moving Sneezing Spitting up or belching Brief stiffening of the body after a noise or sudden movement (called thestartle, or Moro reflex) Straining with bowel movements Throat clearing (or gurgling sounds of secretions in the throat) Trembling or jitteriness of arms and legs are common during crying (Jitterybabies are common. Convulsions are rare. During convulsions babies alsojerk, blink their eyes, rhythmically suck with their mouths, and don't cry.) Ifyour baby is trembling and not crying, give her something to suck on. If thetrembling doesn't stop when your baby is sucking, call our office immediately.

While breastfeeding is our first choice, the basic approach to feeding your infant is the same whether you have selected to breast or bottle feed. The time spent feeding your child provides your baby with needed love as well as nutrition. This early contact that your infant receives establishes the maternal child bond t hat will continue to grow throughout the years. Therefore, regardless of the feeding method you choose, it is important that you try to remain relaxed, confident, and enthused during the process. Breastfeeding We strongly encourage mothers to breastfeed if they have the desire and an adequate milk supply. Human milk has a perfectly balanced distribution of protein, fat, carbohydrates, and minerals to provide for all the nutritional needs of your baby. Its composition is unique and changes to meet the varied needs of your baby as they develop. It is designed to be easily digested by your infant's sensitive and immature system, resulting in fewer problems with constipation, gas, and colic. Calcium and iron absorption are better from breast milk, than formula, and it presents a smaller sodium and protein load to the kidneys. In addition, certain protective immune substances called antibodies are secreted by the breast which help your infant combat potential infections by bacteria and viruses and protect against allergies. Breastfeeding often has the additional positive effect of helping you lose some of the post-pregnancy pounds faster. While breastfeeding, mom's diet may be a normal, regular diet with few exceptions. Food tolerances are individual to each mom and her baby. Food filters into breast milk within 4 - 6 hours after eating. If you find that a certain food bothers you or your baby, eliminate it from your diet. Prenatal vitamins and iron supplements should be continued. Alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking should be avoided. Plenty of fluids should be consumed with an average of twelve 8 - 16-ounce glasses per day; water is the healthiest choice. It is not necessary to drink milk to produce milk; however, calcium intake is important. Frequent nutrient-rich meals and snacks are recommended since your body needs extra calories to produce breast milk. For thousands of years women around the world have been breastfeeding and making it look easy. Therefore, many women who chose to breastfeed envision breastfeeding as natural and instinctive. However, many women are surprised and disappointed to discover that the early days of breast feeding can be awkward, exhausting, anxiety producing, and in some cases, simply frustrating. Source: East Lake Pediatrics Dr. Michael JordanBreastfeeding is a learned skill that can only be mastered by practice and experience. Nearly all new parents are worried that their baby is not getting enough milk. The fact is that normal milk supply can be very scant for the first 2 - 3 days. The key is to be aware of this and not allow yourself to become discouraged. Instead, try to be confident and recognize that all the time, effort, and love you invest now will soon pay off with big rewards for you and your baby. Stress and tension can inhibit milk production; therefore, it is important to relax and get comfortable. Experiment with various feeding positions, such as lying in bed, or sitting up, making sure that the baby and your arm are adequately supported to prevent fatigue. Use your free hand to grasp your breast above the areola between your fingers and thumb and guide the nipple into your baby's open mouth. Be sure that the baby latches onto the entire areola, not just the nipple; otherwise, your baby will not compress the milk glands properly. This will leave them hungry and you sore. It is also important that you make sure that your baby is not sucking on their own tongue, and that your baby's nose is not covered by your breast. During the first couple of days, you can expect to be producing only small amounts of pre-milk called colostrum. The colostrum is very high in antibodies. Fortunately, most newborns do well despite their relatively small intake, and will not need supplementation. Most breast-fed babies want to eat every 1 \u00bd to 2 \u00bd hours (at least 8 - 10 times per 24 hours). Offer both breasts at each feeding, alternating which side you start with at each feeding. Since newborns are often very sleepy, try nursing about 5 minutes per side with each feeding the first day, 10 minutes per side the second day, and 15 minutes or more per side thereafter. Once your milk is in, it is best to nurse all the way through on the first side before switching to the other side to ensure the baby gets all the hindmilk. The more your baby suckles at the breast, the more milk your breasts are stimulated to produce. Therefore, try to minimize other forms of sucking such as bottles and pacifiers while breastfeeding is getting established. In certain circumstances you may feel it is necessary, or we may recommend giving oral supplements. Examples of such circumstances include babies who are getting dehydrated, babies with significant jaundice, or where there is a longer than expected delay in establishing good milk supply. Source: East Lake Pediatrics Dr. Michael JordanMany parents are concerned that their breast-fed infant is not receiving enough since they are unable to see exactly how much milk their baby is taking while nursing. The following patterns are typical of a well-nourished breast-fed baby during the first month of life: You start producing milk abundantly 3 to 5 days after your baby is born. If your baby seems hungry after most feedings, or you do not think your milkhas come in by 5 days after delivery, please call our office. Your baby latches on correctly and sucks rhythmically for at least 10-15minutes per feeding. Your baby may pause sometimes while breastfeeding.However, they should nurse vigorously during most of the feeding. Youshould hear your baby swallow regularly while breastfeeding. Allow your babyto remain at the first breast until it is well drained, so your baby will receivethe rich, high-fat hind milk. When your baby starts to suck less vigorously onthe first side or begins to doze off, you can burp them, change the diaper andarouse them to take the second breast. Since the first breast gets drainedbetter, begin each feeding on a different side. This way, both breasts will getabout the same stimulation and emptying. Your newborn nurses at least 8-12 times every 24 hours. Nurse your baby asoften as they show hunger cues, such as waking from sleep, becoming alert,bringing a hand to the mouth, turning the head, or moving the mouth ortongue. Remember that crying is a late sign of hunger and a baby may notnurse well after crying too long. You can expect your baby to eat about every1 \u00bd to 3 hours, with a single longer stretch (up to 5 hours) between feedingsat night. At times you may need to awaken your baby to nurse. Some babiesjust don't demand to be fed as often as they should, especially in the first fewweeks of life. Your baby appears satisfied after nursing and may fall asleep at the secondbreast. Breast-fed infants who appear hungry after most feedings - who cry,chew their hands, or often need a pacifier after nursing - may not be gettingenough milk. Your breasts feel full before each feeding and softer after your baby hasnursed. After the longest time between feedings at night, your breasts shouldfeel particularly full. Your baby's bowel movements look like cottage cheese and mustard by the4th or 5th day of life. Bowel movements that look like cottage cheese andmustard are called \"milk stools.\" If your baby is still having dark meconium,green, or brown stools by 5 days of age, please call our office. Source: East Lake Pediatrics Dr. Michael JordanMore patterns that are typical of a well-nourished breast-fed baby during the first month of life: Your baby urinates 6 or more times a day once your milk has come in. The urine should be colorless, not yellow. If it looks like the diaper has reddishbrick dust on it after your baby is older than 3 days, your baby's urineprobably is too concentrated, and your baby may not be getting enoughmilk. Your baby has 4 or more good-sized bowel movements each day. Many breast fed babies have a bowel movement every time t hey nurse during their first 3 to 4 weeks of life. Your nipples may be a little tender for the first several days of nursing,especially at the beginning of feedings. The discomfort should be nearlygone by the end of the first week of breastfeeding. Nipple pain that is severe,lasts throughout a feeding, or continues more than 1 week after birth couldmean your baby is nursing incorrectly. If your baby does not latch on properlyto nurse, your infant may not be getting enough milk. Two or three weeks after delivery you may notice the sensations associatedwith milk let-down. Breastfeeding causes the release of the hormoneoxytocin, which causes the uterus to cramp. These \"after-pains\" withbreastfeeding are more noticeable than any early breast sensations. Theyusually go away 7 to 10 days after the birth of your baby. The sensations of milk let-down are tingling, pins-and -needles, or a t ightening feeling in your breasts as milk begins to flow. When your milk let-down occurs, your babymay start to gulp milk. Milk may drip or spray from the other breast. You mayfind that just hearing your baby cry causes your milk to let down, even beforeyour baby starts nursing. If you don't notice any signs of milk let-down, yourmilk supply may be low. Once your milk comes in, your breast-fed baby should gain weight rapidly-atleast 1 ounce each day for the first couple months of life. The only way to becertain that your baby is getting enough milk is to have your baby weighedregularly. If your baby is not gaining enough weight, your milk supply maybe low, or your baby may not be nursing effectively. Such breastfeedingdifficulties are easier to overcome if you recognize and treat them early. Source: East Lake Pediatrics Dr. Michael JordanDumping, storing and handling breast milk There may be times when you need to be away from your baby and unable to nurse. You may need to return to work, the baby's father or another person may want to feed the baby, or your baby may not be able to breastfeed for a while because of a medical problem. Regardless of the circumstance, it is best for your baby to be fed milk that has been pumped from your breasts when your infant cannot be breast-fed. You will want to know how to handle and store your breast milk safely for later use. Preparation and Hygiene Collection of Milk Storage of Breast MilkAlways wash your hands thoroughly before you pumpyour breasts. A daily shower or bath will keepyour breasts clean. After each use of a breast pump, Pour the milk expressed duringone pumping session into a cleancontainer. You may use a bottlethat has been washed in soapywater and rinsed, or a disposablebottle bag. If you use disposablebottle bags, put one insideanother to prevent tears or holes. Tightly cap bottles. Do not storebottles with nipples attached.Bottle bags are best closed with aclean rubber band. Label each container with yourbaby's name and the date and In the refrigerator for at least72 hours after pumping and 24hours after thawing (assuming thetemperature of the refrigerator is34\u00b0F to 40\u00b0F, or 1\u00b0C to 4\u00b0C). In a freezer inside a refrigeratorfor up to 3 weeks after pumping(assuming the temperature of thefreezer is 20\u00b0F to 28\u00b0F, or -7\u00b0C to-2\u00b0C).wash all the parts that come into contact with your milk using hot soapy water. Tell your doctor and your baby'sdoctor if you become ill or need totake any medication. time the milk was expressed. Put several bottle bags in a larger plastic bag to prevent them fromsticking to the freezer shelf. For healthy babies who are notin the hospital, it is safe to layermilk collected at different times onthe same day in the same bottle.Chill freshly expressed milk in therefrigerator before adding it topreviously frozen milk. In a separate-door freezer for up to3 months after pumping (assumingthe temperature of the freezer is5\u00b0F to 15\u00b0F, or -15\u00b0C to -9\u00b0C). In a deep freezer for up to 6months after pumping (assumingthe temperature of the freezer is0\u00b0F or below, or -18\u00b0C or below. Source: East Lake Pediatrics Dr. Michael JordanThawing of Milk Warming MilkSlowly in the refrigerator. Volumes of 3 or more ounces (100 or more milliliters) ofmilk may take several hours to thaw. Relatively quickly under running warmwater or by placing it in a bowl of warmwater. Be sure the top of the containeralways remains above the water. **Do not thaw milk at room temperature** Under warm running water. In a pan of warm water (not over directheat). In a purchased bottle warmer. **Do not warm milk in the microwave** Additional Recommendations DO NOT overheat milk. Overheating willcause it to curdle and will destroy someimmune components. DO NOT leave milk at room temperaturefor more than 1 hour. Milk may be reheated and used for thenext feeding if it has not been left at room temperature for more than 1 hour. Throw out any milk left after a second feeding. DO NOT refreeze thawedmilk. DO NOT store milk in thedoor of your freezer, wherethe temperature may changefrequently. Always transport milk on ice inan insulated cooler. Source: East Lake Pediatrics Dr. Michael JordanFormula Feeding Not every mother has the desire to breastfeed, each family must choose which feeding option best suits them. It is important for parents to know that a bottle can be fed to a baby with just as much warmth, love, and affection.Formula feeding does have its advantages. One big advantage is that dad can participate too. Another is that formula fed infants tend to eat less frequently, and therefore, may be easier to conform to a schedule, and/or may sleep through the night sooner. Milk based formula is designed to imitate, as closely as possible, the contents of breast milk, and to provide for all the nutritional needs of an infant in the first year of life. It is a sufficient form of feeding during the first 6 months of life; it is usually served in conjunction with solids during the following 6 months. Formula is available at food stores, pharmacies, and discount stores. It is available in the following forms: **It is important to prepare formula according to the directions to ensure proper nutrition** We at East Lake Pediatrics support the recommendation of the Committee of Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics that you use an iron fortified formula for your baby until at least 12 months old. Iron is a mineral that is used to make good red blood cells, which carry oxygen in the blood and supply it to all parts of the body. A rapidly growing baby has a great need for iron, not only for day-to-day maintenance but also to constantly replenish iron stores that are being used to support your newborns growth. By using an iron-fortified formula, with Iron, you are ensuring that your infant has plenty of iron to use when they need it. The amount of iron in your baby's formula will not cause gastrointestinal distress such as vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, cramps, gas, or colic, so please do not change or discontinue the iron-fortified formula unless we have advised you to do so. Upon leaving the hospital, your baby will take 1 - 2 ounces of formula per feeding. Every week or so thereafter, you will probably observe that your baby will desire more. See the infant feeding summary below for the average formula intake at different ages. There is a broad range of normal formula intake; the best judge of the proper amount for your baby is to follow their specific appetite. Your baby may be full before the bottle is empty. Never force them to drink more than they wish. Overfeeding can cause your baby to vomit. When your baby is finished feeding, it is best to discard any remaining formula in the bottle.Ready to feed - This form is the most convenient, however, morecostly. It is available in 4 or 8 ouncebottles, and in 8 or 32 ounce cans. Water is not to be added.Concentrate - This form is mixedwith equal parts of water. Powder - This form is even moreeconomical than concentrate. It ismixed with one scoop (providedin the can) to 2 ounces of water. Source: East Lake Pediatrics Dr. Michael JordanGenerally, your infant will be ready to eat about every 3 - 4 \u00bd hours. If, during the day, your baby goes longer than 4 \u00bd hours, awaken and feed the baby. On the other hand, if your infant cries in between feedings, you may try other soothing techniques such as holding, rocking, or playing soft music. To avoid excessive air or milk intake it is best to avoid feeding your baby at more frequent intervals. Doing so can cause your baby to become a \"grazer\" (eating an ounce or so nearly every hour) as well. This can create gas, cramps, stooling problems, irritability, and a need to re-adjust the feedings. After the first month or so, if your baby demonstrates a willingness to sleep through the night, consider yourself fortunate, and allow the infant to sleep until morning. Most babies will be able to sleep through the night by four months of age. Try burping your baby every ounce or two, as well as at the end of the feeding. Do not worry if your newborn does not burp successfully each time. It is common for babies to spit up occasionally as they are burped, however, if your baby vomits forcibly or the amount seems excessive, please call our office. Cow's milk is not an acceptable alternative to breast milk or formula and should not be given during the first year. The following are examples of what can occur if cow's milk is used in place of breast milk or formula. Allergic reactions. Low iron content which can cause iron deficiency and anemia. Injury to the intestinal lining due tomilk protein effects. Butterfat of cow's milk is poorlyabsorbed depriving your infant ofa necessary energy source.The mineral content greatlyexceeds the infant's requirementsand physiologic limits, an excessive solute load tothe kidneys. Source: East Lake Pediatrics Dr. Michael JordanIntroduction of Solids The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends when possible to solely breastfeed your infant until 6 months of age. However, some infants may need solid foods sooner and this can be started at age 4 months. Signs your baby may be ready for solids include, they have doubled birth weight, they have good neck/head control, they are able to sit upright in a feeding chair and feed off of a spoon. Remember solid food is to SUPPLEMENT the nutrition the baby is getting from breast milk or formula and not replace it. You will notice over time as your baby eats more foods, breast milk or formula intake will slowly decrease but your newborn still needs this as a vital part of their diet up until 12 months of age. Below is a chart with general feeding guidelines. Every baby is different though so if you have any questions regarding how your baby is responding to introduction of solids please speak to us about these questions. Source: East Lake Pediatrics Dr. Michael JordanFor most babies, it does not matter which foods you offer first. There is no medical evidence that introducing foods in a particular order has any advantages for babies. However, meats and vegetables do contain more nutrients per serving than fruits and cereals. New foods should be offered one at a time, feeding the same food daily for multiple days. This allows for easy identification of a specific negative reaction to a food. Signs of an allergic reaction to a new food can include rash, especially hives or vomiting. If this occurs call our office immediately. Each baby will eat different quantities of foods so try to go by your baby's cues. If they are looking at you and awaiting more foods, then continue to feed them or offer them more foods to self-feed themselves. If they are turning their heads, not actively looking for more food, or just throwing or playing with the food then they most likely are finished eating. This can vary from 1 tablespoon to 4 ounces per feeding. Each baby will be ready for soft table foods at different times. Once your baby can pick up food and bring it to their mouth they may be ready to start eating soft, diced up foods. If you notice they choke or gag when trying to eat table foods, stop, wait another 1 - 2 weeks then try again. Around 6 months old have your baby start experimenting with a sippy cup. You can put water in this for practice and extra fluids. Your baby does NOT need water prior to this age. New recommendations for peanut containing foods: As of 2017 it is now recommended you introduce peanut containing products to MOST infants, as early introduction has shown to be protective against the development of allergy. The guidelines state most children should be offered peanut containing foods soon after they've tried a few other solid foods, so around 6 months of age. IF YOUR BABY HAS TESTED POSITIVE FOR PEANUT OR EGG ALLERGY OR IF THEY HAVE SEVERE ECZEMA, then first speak with us prior to introducing these products to your baby. Never feed a baby whole nuts however, as this is a choking hazard. Source: East Lake Pediatrics Dr. Michael JordanVitamins and Flouride The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that breastfed infants be given vitamin D supplementation daily, to avoid deficiency as this is not transferred in breast milk. Commercial infant formula is fortified with all the vitamins and iron your baby needs in the first year, therefore, bottle-fed babies do not require additional supplements. If fluoride is not added to the natural water supply where you live, fluoride supplementation (daily prescription drops) will need to begin at 6 months. Your individual water company should be contacted to be certain that fluoride has not been added prior to beginning any supplements. Alternatively, formula fed infants may be fed formula that has been mixed with Nursery Water. Sterilization We do not feel sterilization is a mandatory procedure when you live where your drinking water is from a properly treated source. If you have well water, you need to boil your water for 10 minutes (plus 1 minute for each 1000 feet of elevation above sea level) or use distilled water until your child is 6 months old. All utensils used in preparing the formula must be kept scrupulously clean. Measuring pitchers and other utensils should be cleaned well, preferably scalded. Scrub bottles, nipples, and caps with hot, soapy water, and a clean brush. Rinse thoroughly with hot water, making sure to always rinse water through the holes of the nipples to be sure that they are not plugged. Protect bottles by placing them upside-down on a rack or clean towel. Nipples and caps should be stored in a clean, covered jar. Growth Consideration If your baby is gaining weight and growing appropriately, then your approach to feeding is working. It is important to remember that your baby's size is directly linked to heredity as well as nutritional intake. There is a wide range of normal weight gain, so do not worry if your infant seems significantly larger or smaller than another baby the same age. At each well baby check, we will review your baby's individual growth and development. If your baby feeds poorly or doesn't appear to be growing well (especially in the first 1-4 weeks), please call our office for an evaluation. Most obesity in infancy is due to overfeeding. Nursing mothers naturally terminate a feeding when suckling stops, and thus obese breastfed infants are few. When giving formula, remember that your baby does not always have to finish the bottle. If your baby demands more volume or suckling, it is preferable to offer a pacifier or if your baby is greater than 6 months of age, give a little water. An overweight baby is not necessarily the healthiest one. If you feed your baby too much, or too often, you may notice an increase in the number of spit ups, stools, or cramps and gas. Usually this can be corrected by simple changes in feeding routines. Source: East Lake Pediatrics Dr. Michael JordanCARE TIPS Bathing Until the umbilical cord falls off and the umbilical area is healed, your infant should be given a sponge bath. Submerging the cord could cause infection or interfere with its drying out and falling off. Getting the cord a little wet doesn't matter. The bath should consist mostly of water with little soap. Too much soap will dry your newborn's skin. Any basic, non-perfumed soap is acceptable such as Dove or Johnson's. For the first few months a full bath 2 to 3 times a week is often enough. Gently clean your baby's face and scalp to remove excessive oil and skin debris. Use caution to keep the suds out of your infant's eyes. At the end of the bath, rinse your baby well as soap residue can be irritating. Be sure when washing the genital area on females to use warm water only and wipe from front to back to prevent irritation. This practice along with avoidance of any bubble baths before puberty may help prevent many urinary tract infections and vaginal irritations. Commercial oils, lotions, and powders are not necessarily due to your infant's natural protective oils. Eyes Mucus often collects on the eyelids and eyelashes. A moist cotton ball can be used to remove the mucus. To clean your baby's eyes be sure to start at the inner corner of the eye, closest to their nose, and gently wipe outwards toward the outer corner of the eye. A clean cotton ball should be used for each eye. If there is pus, or the whites of your baby's eyes and/or the tissues around the eyes are red or swollen, please call the office to schedule an appointment. Nose Sneezing is normal in the newborn; it is the baby's way of clearing the mucus, which is often present in their nasal passages. If you notice that your infant remains congested, you can instill several drops of saltwater nose drops (1/4 tsp. of salt in a measuring cup of water) into one nostril. Wait 15 - 30 seconds, then aspirate with a bulb syringe. Repeat this process in the other nostril. Since babies depend on nose breathing while they suck, the best time for this is prior to feedings. Ears It is important to only clean the outside of your infant's ear. NEVER insert a Q-tip into the ear canal. More often this just pushes the wax further down the ear canal, while posing a risk of damaging the eardrum. Source: East Lake Pediatrics Dr. Michael JordanUmbilical cord Let the cord stump fall off on its own. In the past, cleaning the stump with rubbing alcohol was often suggested. New data suggest that natural drying will allow the cord to fall off faster. Diapers should be kept folded down below the cord area since air exposure helps the cord stay dry and eventually fall off. The cord usually falls off between 7 - 21 days after birth. It is normal to see a few drops of blood from the area when the cord detaches. Please call the office for an appointment if the skin surrounding the navel is red, swollen, and tender, or if red streaks are present on your baby's abdomen around the cord. Fingernails and toenails An infant Emory board or a dull adult Emory board can be used to gently file your baby's nails as well. This technique is often safer than using nail clippers since newborns fingernails are often attached to the skin at the tip of their fingers. Circumcision Plastibell circumcisions require no routine care. The area should simply be kept clean and dry. The plastibell should not be pulled off; it usually falls off on its own in 7 - 10 days. Surgical circumcisions require the placement of Vaseline gauze over the head of the penis with every diaper change for 3 - 5 days to prevent the penis from sticking to the diaper. With either type of circumcision, it is common for a yellow substance to form on the penis; it is part of the healing process and should not be removed. The foreskin may adhere to the rim of the head of the penis and it should be gently retracted daily. The best time to do this is after a bath when the skin is soft. It is also important to observe the nature of your son's urine stream. The urine should be forceful and shoot out, especially when the baby begins to urinate. If you notice that your baby dribbles his urine, please notify us. Laundry It is best to launder your infant's soiled clothing in a hypoallergenic detergent such as Dreft and refrain from using fabric softeners, and/or fabric softener sheets. If using cloth diapers, be sure to launder them separately. Source: East Lake Pediatrics Dr. Michael JordanStools There is a wide range of normal stooling patterns and colors. Some infants stool with each feeding while others may go several days between a bowel movement. If your infant's stool is soft in texture, either pattern is acceptable. Stool colors that should prompt a parent to call our office are red, black, and white. Almost all babies will strain and appear uncomfortable when they stool. As long as the texture remains soft, no intervention is necessary. After 2 months of age, if the stool is hard, and especially if there is evidence of blood streaking from straining, we recommend giving an ounce of diluted apple, pear, white grape, or prune juice (\u00bd ounce juice, \u00bd ounce water) 2 - 4 times per day. Increasing mom's fiber intake can help infants who are strictly breastfed. If the above interventions are unsuccessful, please contact our office. Diarrhea Diarrhea in an infant can be defined as stools that are more fluid and more frequent than usual. One or two loose stools rarely require specific therapy. Diarrhea usually lasts several days to a week, regardless of the type of treatment. The main goal of treatment is to prevent dehydration. Symptoms of dehydration include: a dry mouth, the absence of tears, infrequent urination (for example, none in 8 hours), and a darker, concentrated urine. Your child needs to drink enough fluids to replace the fluids lost in the diarrhea. Do not expect a quick return to solid bowel movements. If your infant/child appears sick, experiences pain, runs a fever, or passes blood with their diarrhea, please notify us. Bottle-fed infants: If your infant has several loose stools, we recommend taking them off milk for 24 hours and replacing with clear liquids. Pedialyte isrecommended, especially for young infants, because it has the right balance ofsalt, minerals, and sugar to keep your baby's blood chemistry normal. FlattenedSprite, diluted Gatorade, and Jell-O water are OK for toddlers and older children.Fruit juices should be avoided. Do not use plain water and avoid using red Jell-Osince it can be mistaken for blood when it appears in stool. After 24 hours on clearfluids, formula can be resumed. You should start by giving your child half-strength(\u00bd formula, \u00bd water or Pedialyte), then three-quarters strength (\u00be formula, \u00bcwater or Pedialyte), and finally returning to full strength formula. For older babiespreviously on solid foods, once the diarrhea stools return toward normal, you maytry introducing rice cereal, bananas, and applesauce. Once you baby is doing well,milk and a regular diet can be resumed. Breast-fed infants: If your breast-fed baby has diarrhea, treatment isstraightforward. Continue breastfeeding, but at more frequent intervals. Don'tstop breastfeeding your baby because they have diarrhea. For severe (wateryand frequent) diarrhea, Pedialyte can be offered between breastfeedings for 6to 24 hours. You may have to stop breastfeeding temporarily if your baby is tooexhausted to nurse and needs intravenous (IV) fluids for severe diarrhea anddehydration. Pump your breasts to maintain milk flow until you can breastfeedagain (usually within 12 hours). Remember that something in the mother's diet may cause a breast-fed baby to have more frequent or looser bowel movements for example, coffee, cola, or herbal teas. If you suspect this, take it out of your dietand see what happens. Source: East Lake Pediatrics Dr. Michael JordanDiaper rash Diaper rashes are usually due to irritation of the skin from a damp diaper. Diaper wipes should be avoided during this period since they tend to sting the irritated skin; instead, wash the diaper area with a soft cloth or cotton and warm water. Use care to clean the creases around the labia of little girls. Pat the area dry with a clean soft cloth. 1% hydrocortisone (no prescription necessary) applied to the area and exposure to the air will work well on mild irritations. A protective ointment, such as Vaseline, can be applied to the skin until healing occurs. If the rash is bright red or does not start getting better after 3 days of warm water cleaning and air exposure, your child probably has a yeast infection. Apply Lotrimin cream (no prescription necessary) four times a day. If the rash does not improve, or if it consists of large water blisters, please call the office for an appointment. Face rashes Newborns often have pinpoint \"white heads\" surrounded by some reddened areas on their face. These come and go, and do not require any particular care except routine gentle bathing. If the rash seems extensive, or is blistery or has pus, please call our office for an appointment. Your baby may also get an irritation rash from drooling. This should be cleansed gently with water only and dried by patting the area. Avoid soap, lotions, creams, or Vaseline unless advised to do so. Cradle cap Cradle cap is a common skin condition in babies. It appears as red patches with oily, yellow scales or crusts on the scalp. Hormones from mom cause the oil glands in the skin to become overactive and release more oil than normal. It often begins in the first weeks of life. With treatment it will clear up in a few weeks. Without treatment it will go away on its own after several months. Treatment is to apply an anti-dandruff shampoo to the scalp once a day. While the hair is lathered, massage your baby's scalp with a soft brush or rough wash cloth. Baby oil can be used to soften the scales prior to treatment; however, it will not clear the scales on its own. Hiccups Hiccups are common for new babies. They often occur during or after eating. There is no cause for concern, or intervention (such as sugar water); they will stop on their own. Source: East Lake Pediatrics Dr. Michael JordanCrying Crying is your baby's way of communicating. As you get to know your infant, you will learn what your baby is trying to convey to you with different cries. However, it is not uncommon for there to be times when you will be unable to comprehend the cause for the tears. It does not mean that there is necessarily anything wrong with you, or the baby. Between the ages of 3 weeks and 3 months, some babies will have a fussy period that can last several hours. Your baby may draw up their legs and pass gas. The infant's face may become beet red, and may be difficult to comfort. Some infants respond simply to being picked up and held. Others prefer being rocked or going for a ride in the car. Usually there is no magic cure. Just remember, you cannot spoil a newborn by holding and loving them. Signs of illness Every parent has concerns at one time or another that their infant may be ill. Infants are seen in the office on a regular basis to be examined by the physician to screen for any potential problems. The following list gives examples of what signs of illness parents can watch for. If your baby has any of the following, please call the office to schedule an appointment. Facts about fevers A fever indicates that your baby has an illness. The degree of fever however, does not always indicate the seriousness of the illness. Most fevers are not harmful and last 2 to 3 days. It is most important to evaluate how your child is acting with the fever. If your infant is still playing, smiling, and eating/drinking well, most likely they are not seriously ill.Sleeping more than usual Vomiting repeatedly, or forcefully (not just spitting up) Diarrhea (greater than 12 - 16 stools, liquid stools, stools with an offensive odor, or flecks of blood or mucous) Refuses to eat 2 times in a row Looks off color - especially if blueness in the lips, yellow eyes, or a generalpaleness is noted Inconsolable Temperature greater than 100.4 rectally, or less than 98 rectally in the first8 weeks of life Redness around the umbilical cord, or discharge or odor from the umbilical cord Labored, distressed, or rapid breathing Bleeding from the circumcision Source: East Lake Pediatrics Dr. Michael JordanA fever is a rectal temperature 100.4\u00b0 F (38\u00b0 C) or greater. Fever is the body's way of fighting infections. Medication should only be used if your child needs it. Generally, medication should be avoided until the temperature reaches 101 degrees or higher, unless your child is uncomfortable. Medication should never be given to an infant under 3 months of age for a fever without consulting our office first. Otherwise, acetaminophen (Tylenol) can be given every 4 to 6 hours. Aspirin should not be used. A lukewarm bath can be used as well to help lower your child's temperature. It is important to make sure that the water is lukewarm, not hot or cold, and that you do not submerge your child completely in the water. The water level should be at waist level. A washcloth can be used to place water on the chest, back, and head. Alcohol rubs should not be used. It is also helpful to have your child drink plenty of cold fluids and dress in light clothing. It is important to remember that regardless of the intervention, your child's temperature should only be expected to come down 1 to 3 degrees. Fever, itself, is not cured by antibiotic therapy. The fever is a symptom, not a disease. Fevers can be caused by either viral or bacterial infections. If the cause is a viral infection, antibiotics will not cure the illness. However, if the cause is a bacterial infection, such as strep throat, pneumonia, or an ear infection, antibiotic therapy will be prescribed. It is important to give any antibiotics prescribed for the full duration of the therapy. Never save \"leftover\" antibiotics to start them yourself for future illnesses. Thermometer Use The preferred method of temperature measure in an ill infant is a rectal temperature. A rectal temperature can be taken with a mercury thermometer, or a digital thermometer. The thermometer should be inserted about 1 inch and left in place for 2 - 3 minutes with a mercury thermometer, or until the beeping tone is sounded with a digital thermometer. The \"normal\" body temperature varies throughout the day ranging between 98-100 degrees (highest temperatures in the evening). Tympanic (ear) temperatures are accurate in older children; however, due to improper fit in the ear, they are not as accurate in infants and young children, therefore, should be avoided. Pacifier thermometers, and forehead strips are convenient, but are not very reliable. Axillary temperatures are good for screening if the room temperature is neutral, and your child is not over bundled, or under dressed. The thermometer should be placed in a dry armpit for 4 minutes for a mercury thermometer, or until the beeping tone is sounded with a digital thermometer. Teething Teething usually begins any time after 3 months. Signs of teething such as drooling, finger, or thumb sucking, and chewing on hands may occur months prior to this. Teething can cause your baby some discomfort, which can cause the baby to be somewhat irritable. However, it does not cause fevers, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, or runny nose. In other words, it will not make your baby sick. Source: East Lake Pediatrics Dr. Michael JordanComfort measures such as teething rings, and teething toys may be helpful and occasionally a dose of acetaminophen (Tylenol) may need to be given. Ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin) can be given to infants over 6 months of age. Topical medications should not be used as many have been recalled for contamination or dangerous ingredients. Teething biscuits, and cookies should be avoided since they can be a choking hazard. Safety Your baby needs full-time supervision and protection. Accidents tend to occur more often as babies begin to roll over, crawl, and grasp. The only place a baby is safe alone is in a crib or playpen. Be certain that the spaces between the crib bars are 2 \u00be inches or less and the crib sides are secure and placed in the upright position. Below is a summary of the most common hazards for babies. Burns - Bath water should be checked with your elbow to prevent scalding. Hot liquids should be kept out of reach. Do not drink hot liquids with your baby in yourlap. Set the water heater to 120 degrees or below. Falls - Never leave your baby unattended on a changing table. The safety strapshould be used, and all diaper changing supplies should be ready prior tochanging the baby. Toys - Toys should be too large to swallow, and too tough to break. Be sure thatthey do not have sharp points or edges. Small and Sharp Objects - Keep pins, buttons, beads, and other small or sharpobjects out of baby's reach. If using cloth diapers, be sure to use diaper safety pinswith plastic shields. Smothering - Plastic bags, long toy telephone cords, harnesses, and soft pillowscan smother or strangle. A firm crib mattress and a loose warm covering fora sleeping baby are the safest. Keep the baby's crib and playpen away fromVenetian blind cords. Do not allow the baby to chew or suck on balloons. Auto Travel - A car seat is a MUST. Do not hold your baby on your lap. Use anapproved infant carrier placed in the backseat facing backwards until at least age2 or even longer, new recommendations suggest keeping rear facing until reachesmax height and weight. If possible, avoid placing the car seat behind the sidewhere an airbag is present. Pools - As soon as an infant is able to crawl, there is a risk of tumbling into thepool. All families with young children and a pool should have a quality poolsafety fence at least 4 feet high immediately surrounding the pool. It is importantto remember that even children who go to swimming classes should never beconsidered \"water-safe\". ALL children must always be very closely supervisedwhen in or around any water. Pacifiers - If you choose to give your baby a pacifier, it is important to use it safely.Be certain that you purchase the type that is a single molded unit; the ones thatare jointed have been known to come apart and choke children. The pacifiershould NEVER be hung around the baby's neck with cord or string.

A baby grows from a helpless little bundle into a walking, talking, unique personality. Almost all parents wonder if their baby is developing at the right pace. While certain behaviors and physical milestones tend to occur at certain ages, a wide spectrum of growth and behavior for each age is normal. The most reassuring signs that your child is developing normally are an alert facial expression, alert eyes, and curiosity about their surroundings. Motor development Motor development occurs in an orderly sequence, starting with lifting the head, then rolling over, sitting up, crawling, standing, and walking. Although the sequence is predictable and follows the maturation of the spinal cord downward, the rate at which these stages happen varies. Speech Development Speech develops from cooing to babbling, to imitating speech sounds, to first words, to using words together. Again, however, the normal rate can vary considerably. Since each child is unique, it is difficult to describe exactly what should be expected at each stage of the baby's development. For example, although the average child walks at 12 months, the normal age for walking is any time between 9 and 16 months of age. The following guidelines are offered as a way of showing a general progression through the developmental stages. They should be used as a guideline only, not as a fixed requirement for normal development. Your child's individual development will be addressed at each well child visit. If at any point you have any concerns related to your child's own pattern of development, please contact our office.

Speech and Hearing Fine Motor SkillsGross Motor Skills Ways to stimulate your child's normal development Hold your baby as much as possible. Touching and cuddling is good for your baby. Give him or her lots of eye contact, smiles, and affection. Use feedings as a special opportunity for these warm personal interactions. Talk to your baby. Babies of all ages enjoy being talked and sung to. Babies must first hear language before they can use it themselves. You don't need a script--just put into words whatever you are thinking and feeling. Play with your baby. If this doesn't come easy for you, try to loosen up and rediscover your free spirit. Respond to your baby's attempts to initiate play. Provide your baby with various objects of interest. Encourage your baby's efforts at discovering how to use their hands and mind. Read to your baby. Even 4-month-olds enjoy looking at pictures in a book. Cut out interesting pictures from magazines and put them in a scrapbook for your baby. Look at the family photo album. By 8 months of age, begin reading stories to your child. Show your baby the world. Enrich their experience. Point out leaves, clouds, stars, and rainbows. Help your toddler describe what they see or experience. Everything we see or do has a name.Makes gurgling, cooing, or babbling sounds by age 3 months Turns head to quiet sounds or whispers by age 9 months Makes \"ma-ma\" and \"da-da\" sounds by age 12 months Uses at least 20 specific words by age 2 years Plays with hands by touching them together by age 6 months Uses fingers to put pieces of food in mouth by age 12 months Uses a cup without spilling by age18 months Rolls over by age 6 months Sits without support by age 9 months Supports own weight on legs when held under the arms by a parent by age 9 months Walks across a large room without help by age 18 months Source: East Lake Pediatrics Dr. Michael JordanProvide your child with social experiences with other children by age two years. If the child is not in day care, consider starting or joining a playgroup. Young children can learn important lessons from each other, especially how to get along with other people. Avoid formal teaching until age 4 or 5. Some groups have recently overemphasized academic (cognitive) development of young children. The effort to create \"super-kids\" through special lessons, drills, computer programs, and classes can put undue pressure on young children and may result in an early loss of interest in learning. Old - fashioned creative play and spontaneous learning provide a foundation for later academic efforts and are much more beneficial during the early years. Although it will be filled with newly acquired responsibilities, frustrations, and concerns, it will be full of countless joys and immeasurable rewards as well. Being a good parent requires time, effort, and patience. It will be challenging due to the various demands and situations you will encounter.
