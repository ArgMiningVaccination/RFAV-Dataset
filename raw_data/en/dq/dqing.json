Fighting: Yolanda's global trek to find alternative treatments has taken her to South Korea, In 2013 - a year after she was diagnosed with Lyme - she spent a month in Switzerland for natural remedies. 'One of the things was I did a whole month without any makeup, no creams, no hair products because I found out, which they taught me there, is there are so many heavy metals in all of these products,' she revealed to [OK!](http://okmagazine.com/get-scoop/yolanda-foster-reveals-how-shes-coping-with-lyme-disease/) magazine at the time.

'Crossing all borders as the Quest for a CURE continues #LymeDisease #Tijuana #DallasBuyersClub,' she tweeted.

The pop star hinted last year that she was suffering from an illness, but opened up about the disease in a People magazine cover story this month. Yolanda credits her husband David Foster for being her 'guiding light,' and her children - supermodel daughters Gigi and Bella Hadid, and son Anwar Hadid - for acting as 'shining stars' during her hard times.
