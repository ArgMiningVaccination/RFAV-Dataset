CooneyEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / NOVEMBER 2015 III EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2016 III Meet 2016 AAEP President Dr. Kathleen Anderson Hometown: Merritt, British Columbia, Canada Current Residence: Fair Hill, Md. Current Position: Partner/practitioner at Equine Veterinary Care working with Thoroughbreds from weanlings to retirees and English sport horses with a primary focus on eventing. Describe how you ventured into equine veterinary medicine. As a horse-crazy young girl, I decided at an early age that my future lay working with horses. After a stint riding, grooming, training and teaching in the three-day eventing world, I pursued veterinary medicine because I believed that the profession could provide me a lifelong career with horses where I would be challenged and be able to make a difference in the lives of the horses I worked with. A total bonus in retrospect is that I can also make a difference in the lives of horses I have never met\u2014through AAEP! What issues in equine veterinary medicine are top priorities for you and why? Near and dear to my heart is ensuring the health and welfare of competition horses before, during and after their primary careers. This is best achieved directly through private practice on a local level and by playing an active role in the spectrum of equine industry management practices, medication reform, placement and care of second-career horses on a more global level. Another top priority is communicating with and educating the public on the many positive impacts that equine veterinary medicine has on so many horses and, by extension, people nationwide and worldwide. Horses once played a central role in the lives of many citizens but as the rural economy has diminished so has that firsthand knowledge of horses\u2014we need to tell our story. Engaging our communities and sharing the value of equine veterinary medicine is key. How has your AAEP membership influenced your career? The early mentorship I received from AAEP members Drs. Roxy Bell, Dan Flynn and Marty Simensen set the stage for the limitless scope and opportunities my career has seen. The AAEP educational resources and industry support propelled my practice growth; and the opportuni-ties under the AAEP umbrella to contribute to public policy and equine welfare issues have instilled in me a deep satisfaction that what we do does make a difference. How have your experiences as a veterinarian and AAEP member prepared you to lead the association? I think AAEP leadership comes in many different flavors and my flavor is \"hands-on practitioner,\" practice owner, parent and mentor. The AAEP provides a wonderful orga-nizational umbrella with a vast network of individuals joined in the focus to provide for stewardship of the horse and members. Leading the association will allow me to consider the challenges our members face and to try to find emerging solutions and opportunities for col-laboration to improve the lives of both horses and members. What are you most proud of during your veterinary career? Still being passionate about the horse and equine veterinary medicine! I started working for Dr. Simensen 30 years after he graduated from veterinary school and he looked at every horse and every case with the excitement of a new grad. I always wanted to be able to feel that way when I reached a similar point in my career, and now I am able to share that same enthusiasm with the next generation of horse doctors. What's the best piece of advice you've ever been given? In 1988, when Waquoit became the first millionaire Thoroughbred earner in Massachusetts, Dr. Simensen told me, \"If you are lucky you will work with a half dozen 'great' horses in your career, so when they show up you need to recognize them and enjoy the ride because it can be over in the blink of an eye.\" I have had my share of the \"greats,\" and I have tried hard to enjoy each and every one of them before they left my practice sphere. Please describe your interests outside of veterinary medicine. Parenting of course has been my greatest passion. I also enjoy beauty in many different forms\u2014an ideal day off for me would be to watch a spectacular sunrise, sip an early morning cup of tea with a good book, go for a long ride on a homebred, work in the garden, cook a great dinner, watch a foreign film and early to bed. Final thought: \"You must live in the present. Launch yourself on every wave. Find your eternity in each moment.\" -Henry David ThoreauDr. Kathleen Anderson IV EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2016 61st Annual Convention goes down as 2nd largest in history Practical CE, abundant networking opportunities and a premier entertainment destination were an engaging combination as 7,394 equine veterinarians, students, techs, exhibitors and guests converged on Las Vegas, Nev., for the AAEP's 61st Annual Convention. Convention attendance ranked behind only the 2009 edition that also was held in Las Vegas. Attendees had a choice from among 135 hours of CE in diverse but relevant areas, including a sold-out Podiatry Workshop on Dec. 5. Daily social and networking events along with a trade show featuring the latest technologies and services from 352 exhibitors complemented the educational offerings to provide a comprehensive forum for professional growth and practice success. Meanwhile, the next generation of practitioners benefited from an expansive slate of student programming that included hands-on labs, professional development sessions and opportunities to network with veteran practitioners and potential employers. Thanks for your investment in AAEP continuing education, and we hope to see you at the 2016 Annual Convention, which will be held in Florida at Orlando's Orange County Convention Center. Keynote speaker emphasizes mind over matter Care providers are trained to take care of others but not themselves, which helps explain why veterinarians have a significant burnout rate and, unfortunately, the highest suicide rate among all care provider groups. Against this backdrop, acclaimed neuropsychiatrist Dr. Dan Siegel shared methods to help practitioners deal with challenges to emotional well-being during his compelling keynote presentation, \"The Art and Science of Resiliency in Our Lives.\" Among the keys to creating a resilient and integrated mind, according to Dr. Siegel, are: r\u0001&OTVSJOH\u0001ZPV\u0001IBWF\u0001TPDJBM\u0001OFUXPSLT\u0001PG\u0001TVQQPSU \u0001 including friends and professional groups r\u0001.BJOUBJOJOH\u0001B\u0001XPSL\u000eMJGF\u0001CBMBODF \u0001XIJDI\u0001JOGMVFODFT\u0001 not only your well-being but that of your family, staff and patients r\u0001*NQSPWJOH\u0001ZPVS\u0001SFMBUJPOTIJQ\u0001XJUI\u0001ZPVSTFMG\u0001CZ \u0001BNPOH\u0001 other things, writing in a journal, which is proven to strengthen the immune system and help alleviate stress To create more integration in the brain, Dr. Siegel recommends several minutes per day of \"daily presence practice\" that yields physiological improvements and strengthens the circuits in the brain that regulate mood, emotion, thought and behavior. Such \"mental hygiene\" exercises can be found under the \"Resources\" tab at www.drdansiegel.com and at http://marc.ucla.edu. Equine liver under the scope at Milne Lecture Renowned large animal internist Dr. Thomas Divers led attendees on an exploration of equine liver disease and failure during his Dec. 7 Frank J. Milne State-of-the-Art Lecture, \"The Equine Liver in Health and Disease.\" A transcript of Dr. Divers' presentation is available in the 2015 AAEP Convention Proceedings beginning on page 66. The paper is also available through the Convention app. Annual awards bestowed upon five Four AAEP members and a longtime association executive were honored during the Dec. 8 President's Luncheon for their outstanding contributions toward the betterment of the horse, profession or association.

Touch Point: New 'Difficult Conversations' video series helps you discuss tough topics The AAEP Touch program is excited to kick off the New Year with a new resource to help you communicate more effectively with clients and colleagues. The Difficult Conversations video series delivers advice from veteran practitioners about topics that can often create challenging communication situations in daily practice. The titles in the series are \"Ending a Client Relationship\"; \"Euthanasia\"; \"Discussing Service Fees\"; and \"Introducing a New Veterinarian to Clients.\" According to market research with horse owners and trainers, the No. 1 reason why a client fires a veterinarian is because the client did not like the veterinarian's commu-nication style or demeanor. In addition, when asked to rank the attributes most valued in a veterinarian, owners and trainers placed high importance on a veterinarian showing compassion towards the horse and listening to the client's opinion.The Difficult Conversations series will help you navigate the sensitive topics that so strongly affect your relation-ships with your clients.

A total of $100,000 in cash and prizes was awarded to the top-10 event hosts in each division as measured by newcomers reached.Finishing fourth in the small division was Alpine Animal Hospital in Carbondale, Colo., which introduced 143 newcomers to a horse experience. The four-doctor practice, which includes AAEP members Dr. Chuck Maker and Dr. Jolee Stegemoller, twice held events at the weekly Carbondale Wild West Rodeo.The practice set up two areas: one in which children could groom a horse and speak with a veterinarian or technician about horse care and general horse information; and another in which the children could ride on a safe horse for approximately five minutes. The participants also were given coupons for riding lessons with two local riding facilities.\"It makes you feel good,\" said Dr. Maker. \"We have a strong local heritage of ranching and horsemanship, but as the valley has expanded and grown, a lot of kids in the school system don't have exposure to that. So we expose some of those kids who go to the rodeo but have never touched a horse and give them that opportunity.\"According to Dr. Maker, the $2,000 award for the practice's fourth-place finish will likely go into a fund to help defray some of the costs of the event and, hopefully, allow for expansion of the event in 2016. \"Over 20 years we've been trying to do different things and this, without a doubt, is the most well-received event by staff and the community that we've ever done.\" Time to Ride is an initiative of the American Horse Council's marketing alliance, of which the AAEP is among 20 members, to address the long-term growth of the horse industry by connecting parents with family-friendly horse activities in their area.

This study by A.L. Stieler and colleagues in the USA aimed to investigate whether this adverse effect was caused by drug- induced anhydrosis (inhibition of sweating). Ten pony foals aged 2 -3 months received either erythromycin or a control (lactose solution) 3 times daily. For the rst 10 days they were kept with their dams in covered shaded stalls and from Day 11 to Day 20 they were kept out at pasture with both shaded and non-shaded areasavailable. Rectal temperature was measured 3 times daily in stalls and twice daily while turned out. Respiratory rate, heart rate and faecal consistency were recorded and the foals were monitored closely for signs of heat stress. To investigate the effects of erythromycin treatment on sweat production, intradermal terbutaline sweat tests were performed in both treated and control groups on Days 1, 3, 10 and 20. This involved intradermal injection of serial dilutions of terbutaline in saline at 6 sites on the neck and placement of an absorbent pad over the injection sites. After 30 minutes the pad was removed and the weight change measured to assess the amount of sweat produced. Terbutaline-induced sweating was signi cantly lower in erythromycin treated foals at all time points in the study compared to Day 1 levels. At all time points except Day 20, sweat weight was signi cantly lower in the erythromycin treated group than in the control group. Sweating function partially recovered after 10 days of treatment; however, at Day 20 (10 days after the end of treatment), mean sweat weights were still lower than 50% baseline values. Maximal rectal temperatures were higher in erythromycin-treated foals than those in the control group, and treated foals appeared more susceptible to higher environmental temperatures. Hyperthermia in erythromycin-treated foals is related to a drug-induced anhydrosis. This is most prominent in the rst few days of treatment, after which sweating function partially recovers, but sweating remains inhibited for more than 10 days following the end of treatment. Appearance of ossi ed ungular cartilages In this retrospective case series, UK-based Laura Jones and Sue Dyson describe the radiographic appearance of ossi ed ungular cartilages in horses and evaluate the usefulness of a flexed dorsolateral-palmaromedial oblique ( flexed oblique) ungular cartilages. Radiographs of 1255 front feet were evaluated and ossication of the ungular cartilages was graded on a scale from 0 to 5; 386 feet (271 horses) with cartilages with an ossication grade 2 were included in this study. The shape was determined and the view on which abnormalities werebest identi ed was documented. All abnormalities were recorded and associations with grade were compared. Fractures were most common in feet with cartilages with an ossi cation grade of 4 or 5 and were best identi ed in flexed oblique images, compared with more commonly recommended images. Multivariable logistic regressionshowed a signi cant positive association of ossi cation grade with modelling or adaptive changes; feet with cartilages with an ossi cation grade of 4 or 5 were more likely than those with an ossi cation grade of 2 or 3 to have modelling or adaptive changes. Abnormally shaped cartilages were more likely to have modelling or adaptive changes, compared with normally shaped cartilages. Extensive ossi cation and the presence of inward or outward curvature as well as palmar curvature or a bulbous shape were signi cant risk factors for modelling and adaptive changes. Flexed oblique images provided clinically useful information, including detection of abnormal shape and fractures, that may not be evident on other currently recommended images. Such images are recommended for complete radiographic appraisal of ossi ed ungular cartilages of the foot in horses. Limbal squamous cell carcinoma in Haflingers The aim of this recent study by Mary Lassaline and colleagues in the USA was to describe the prevalence of limbal squamous cell c a r c i n o m a( L S C C )i nH a flinger horses and to analyse affected horses 'pedigrees investigating the genetic mode of inheritance. Medical records of 19 horses (11 male and 8 female) diagnosed with LSCC were reviewed. The North American Haflinger Registry was used to con rm that 15 of the horses were of the Haflinger breed. Pedigrees could not be obtained for 4 horses that had been identi ed as Ha flingers. The 4-generation pedigrees available for 15 of the horses were used to perform pedigree analysis. The average age at diagnosis with LSCC was 8.7 years. Thirteen of 15 affected horses for whom pedigrees were available shared a common ancestor within 5 generations, and all 15 shared a common ancestor from the A stallion line in the breed pedigree. Pedigree analysis identi ed a common sire of 2 of the affected male horses; this sire had no history of LSCC and showed no current clinical signs of LSCC, suggesting an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Haflingers may be over-represented amongst horses with LSCC and may be diagnosed at a younger age than other breeds. Affected Haflingers appear closely related, suggesting a possible heritable basis for LSCC. The authors are planning further investigation into the genetic basis for LSCC using a genome-wide association study approach. Antimicrobial use survey In this study Megan Jacob and colleagues reported the ndings of their survey of clinical veterinarians at a US veterinary teaching hospital regarding antimicrobial use and antimicrobial-resistant infections. An online survey which included 23 questions regarding demographic information, educational experiences, current prescribing practices, and personal opinions related to antimicrobial selection, antimicrobial use, restrictions on antimicrobial use, and antimicrobial resistance was sent to all veterinarians with clinical service responsibilities at the North Carolina State University veterinary teaching hospital. Responses were received from 71 (43%) of the 167 veterinarians eligible to participate. Most respondents (41/70; \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd7 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 201659%) rated their level of concern as 1 (very concerned =1; not concerned =5) about antimicrobial-resistant infections. The mean score for all respondents was 1.5. Most survey participants rated their immediate colleagues (mean score 1.9) as more concerned than other veterinary medical professionals (mean score, 2.3) and their clients (mean score 3.4). Fifty-nine of 67 (88%) respondents felt that antimicrobials were overprescribed at the hospital, and 32/69 (46%) respondents felt uncomfortable prescribing at least one class of antimicrobials (e.g. carba- penems or glycopeptides) because of public health concerns. Findings indicated that veterinarians at this teaching hospital were concerned about antimicrobial resistance, thought antimicrobials were overprescribed, and supported restricting use of certain antimicrobial classes in companion animals. These results may be useful in educating future veterinarians and altering prescribing habits and antimicrobial distribution systems in veterinary hospitals. Effective duration of tetanus vaccination In this study A. Kendall and colleagues in Sweden and the UK investigated the duration of tetanus immunoglobulin G titres following basic immunisation of horses. Tetanus vaccination protocols vary widely, and there is no evidence-based consensus for the frequency of tetanus boosters. This study aimed to determine the ef cacy of a commercial tetanus vaccine (Equilis Prequenza TE) atproviding protective levels of immunity over a 3-year studyperiod. Thirty-four horses received the rst dose of vaccine aged between 5 and 11 months, a second dose 4 weeks laterand a third between 15 and 17 months after the second dose.Serum samples were obtained before the rst dose, 2 weeks after the second dose and 14 -16 months after the second dose and then yearly for 3 years following the third dose. Serum antibody titres to tetanus were determined by a tetanus-toxin binding ELISA, the limit of detection for which was 0.04 iu/ml. The recognised minimum IgG titre for protection in horses is 0.01 iu/ml, based on studies in other species. Therefore the test could not determine whether immunity was adequate (>0.01 iu/ml) in one horse with an antibody titre of less than 0.04 iu/ml after the complete vaccination course, so this horse was excluded from further study and vaccinated. Before the rst dose, 38% of the group (median age of 7.5 months) had no detectable antibody titres. The rest (median age 6 months) had detectable titres related to maternally derived antibodies. All horses had detectable antibodieswhen sampled 2 weeks after the second dose. Horses with no detectable antibodies pre-vaccination mounted a greater immune response compared to those that had detectable pre-vaccination antibodies suggesting that maternally derived antibodies in younger animals may interfere with the development of a strong vaccine response. For reasons unrelated to the study, the number of horses declined throughout the study. When sampled 14 -16 months after the second dose, 28 of 33 (85%) had detectable antibody titres. One year after the third dose, 96% of 26 horses had detectable antibodies. Two years after the third dose, 16 of 16 horses had detectable antibodies and at the end of the study (3 years after the third dose) 8 of 8 horses remaining had detectable antibodies suggesting that after a primary course of 3 doses, protective levels of immunity to tetanus are maintained for 3 years. The authors suggest that current booster guidelines may require revision.Acute phase proteins in horses with colic In this study Francesco Dondi and colleagues in Italy evaluated the role of acute phase proteins (APPs) in horses with colic. Equine colic may be associated with an acute phase response (APR). Measurement of APPs allows the detection of an APR and may help clinicians to monitor the disease; however, the role of APPs in colic is unclear. The clinical usefulness of serum amyloid A (SAA), haptoglobin and ferritin in combination with an extended clinicopathological pro le in equine colic were evaluated in this study. Data was obtained from the medical records of 54 horses. Horses were grouped based on outcome (survivors vs. nonsurvivors), diagnosis (ischaemic/strangulating vs. nonischaemic/nonstrangulating), and treatment (medical treatment vs. surgery). Laboratory data were compared, and a logistic regression analysis was performed for outcome prediction upon admission. A high proportion of horses had abnormal SAA (29/54), haptoglobin (20/54), and ferritin (31/54)concentrations, with haptoglobin below the reference interval in 13/54 horses. Nonsurvivors had signi cantly decreased haptoglobin and increased ferritin concentrations compared with survivors. The ischaemic/strangulating group had signi cantly increased creatinine and ferritin and decreased haptoglobin concentrations compared with the nonischaemic/ nonstrangulating group. Creatinine was the only signi cant predictor of mortality in the regression analysis. Acute phase proteins including SAA, haptoglobin, and ferritin combined with clinicopathological variables may help clinicians to understand the pathogenesis of APR and underline potential complications of equine colic. The reduction in haptoglobin concentration may suggest haemolysis or muscle bre damage; ferritin may indicate alteration in iron metabolism and tissue damage. Further prospective studies are needed to assess diagnostic and prognostic values of APPs in colic horses. S. WRIGHT EVE Editorial Of ce References Dondi, F., Lukacs, R.M., Gentilini, A.

The need for further research on the topic initiated this meeting that brought together clinicians, immunologists, epidemiologists and respiratory biologists to focus on IAD. In the 10 years since the rst Havemeyer symposium on IAD, there have been great advances in the understanding of chronic airway disease in people and basic science investigations have revealed the interactions between the various pro- and anti-in flammatory pathways within the airways of the lung. It has become clear that multiple environmental agents can act individually or in concert so that what might appear initially as an allergic phenomenon can then be aggravated by other nonantigenic stimuli. Despite the latter growth in knowledge, diagnosis and management of airway disease in horses still relies greatly on the patient 's history and airway cytology. With this background in mind, the focus of the symposium was How to go beyond cytology to characterize IAD . At a Congress held before the Symposium (supported by the Hippolia Foundation, Association V /C19et/C19erinaire /C19Equine Telemaq), invited presented the state of knowledge on airway in flammation and IAD to practicing veterinarians. These presentations are summarised herein and presented inmore detail with a complete list of references in Supplementary item 1 . In the subsequent Symposium (sponsored by The Dorothy Russell Havemeyer Foundation) the invited experts addressed speci c questions and planned future research ( Supplementary item 2 ): abstracts of original research also were presented ( Supplementary item 3 ). State of knowledge of IAD Human asthma and equine chronic airway disease The similarities between equine and human chronic airway disease and their relationship to the environment have been recognised for centuries. The term recurrent airway obstruction (RAO, heaves) is reserved to describe horses with environmentally triggered airway in flammation that demonstrate dif cult breathing at rest. In flammatory airway disease describes horses with less severe airway obstruction,which is still suf cient to affect performance, but not clinically obvious in the resting animal. RAO is characterised byneutrophilic in flammation with excess mucus accumulation and proliferation of airway smooth muscle. In flammatory airway disease is a less severe form of chronic airway inflammation. Clinical signs of IAD are variable but generally include varying degrees of cough, exercise intolerance andexcess mucus accumulation in the large airways. Obstruction can be demonstrated by sensitive pulmonary function tests and the disease can impair gas exchange. Airway inflammation is best diagnosed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL); tracheal lavage is less valuable because many apparently normal horses can have >20% neutrophils in the tracheal wash. IAD in sport horses may not be the same syndrome as that described in young racehorses because the latter may have a more important infectious component. Like IAD and RAO in the horse, human asthma is characterised by airway in flammation and obstruction. The diverse presentations and treatment responses to asthmahave been recognised for over 50 years and classically, patients have been divided into those whose asthma is or is not associated with allergic triggers; extrinsic and intrinsic asthma, respectively. The former is corticosteroid responsive, the latter less so. Recent evidence questioned this classi cation, however. Based on sputum cytology, asthma can be classi ed as eosinophilic, neutrophilic, mixed and paucigranulocytic but, when examined longitudinally, these are not stable phenotypes. However, activity of disease in asthmatic patients is re flected in changes in these cells in sputum. Because of the important role of in flammation in asthma, treatments designed to reduce in flammation are superior to empirical treatment based on symptoms and presence of airway obstruction detected by spirometry. Persistent eosinophilia ( >2%) is a marker of risk of exacerbation and selective inhibition of airway eosinophilia by biologics directed at IL-5 has reduced rates of exacerbation. Blood elevation of an epithelial gene periostin predicts responsiveness to anti-IL-13 treatment with the biologic lebrikizumab. IL-17 is associated with severe neutrophilic asthma and is more likely associated with irritants and viral infections. Although bioactive molecules (lipids, cytokines, chemokines, enzymes etc.) associated with eosinophils and neutrophils play multiple roles in asthma pathogenesis, they have not been found useful to classify types of asthma. Unsupervised statistical cluster analysis can identify asthma subgroups but these overlap considerably and are not stable over time. Airway remodelling (proliferation of airway smooth muscle, and increased deposition of extracellular matrix), which occurs in both asthma and RAO, is considered a consequence of airway in flammation. In some human patients, declines in lung function can become irreversible and are a consequence of excess smooth muscle in the airways. These changes in lung function are not always progressive and suggest that declinesin lung function may occur as discrete events rather than being progressive over time. In summary, asthma is a heterogeneous disease with a variety of aetiologies. Attempts to classify subjects have not been very useful but have reaf rmed the notion of Th2- mediated (allergic) and Th17- and Th1-mediated (nonallergic) asthma. Once asthma is established, non-allergic triggers may be equally or more important than allergic stimuli in evoking airway reactions. Classi cations The symposium was in Cabourg, Normandy, France on 13 -15 October 2014. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd9 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / on in flammatory pathways and causative factors are required. Clinical presentation of IAD Cough is the most sensitive indicator of lung in flammation and observant horse owners are better able to judge this sign than is a veterinarian during a brief visit. The more frequent the cough, the more severe the neutrophilic in flammation. Horses with moderate and severe lung in flammation cough signi cantly more at the start of exercise than do horses with normal BAL fluid cytology. Until sensitive and portable means to measure lung function become available to practitioners,endoscopy of the lower airways is vital to identify IADbecause it is the only way to reliably quantify the amount ofaccumulated tracheal mucus. Coalescent drops of trachealmucus visible in the resting horses are associated withreduced racing performance and with perceived lack ofwillingness to perform in sport horses. More investigations arerequired to describe the association between subtlerespiratory clinical signs and different types of lunginflammation (neutrophilic vs. mast cells vs. eosinophilic), cell types and airway hyperresponsiveness, and even the effectsof age on airway cytology. In the clinical situation, IAD is often accompanied by other respiratory and non-respiratory conditions that are likelyto affect performance. Endoscopic examination of horsesperforming at speed have revealed that pharyngealinstability and dorsal displacement of the soft palatefrequently accompany IAD but whether the former are riskfactors for the latter is unknown. However, the importance ofIAD should not be overlooked just because an upper airwayproblem has been diagnosed. Exercise-induced pulmonaryhaemorrhage (EIPH) also is often comorbid with IAD but thereis no evidence that IAD is a risk factor for EIPH or vice versa . Assessment of the performance effects of IAD is highly dependent on the type of athletic activity: the more intensethe exercise, the more likely the effect will be detectable. Inracehorses, there are multiple measures of performance andsome of these have been used to demonstrate that horseswith more than just a few drops of visible tracheal mucustend to race less well. Furthermore, as a group, horses with acontinuous stream of mucus in the trachea show poorwillingness to perform in both dressage and showjumping.How the presence of mucus is linked to performance is notknown, but it may be through impaired oxygen exchangedue to ventilation-perfusion mismatching. The critical phenotypic de nition of RAO is the presence of visible respiratory distress in the resting horse. In terms oflung function, this translates into airway obstruction that isreadily detectable by measurement of maximal change inpleural pressure, pulmonary resistance and dynamiccompliance. IAD-affected animals do not show respiratorydistress at rest and are less likely to have measurablechanges in the former variables. However, more sensitivemeasures of lung function such as use of forced oscillatorymechanics or open plethysmography can demonstrateairway obstruction in IAD. These techniques are more sensitivewhen combined with histamine bronchoprovocation(measurement of airway reactivity) and/or use ofbronchodilators to demonstrate reversibility of obstruction. Accurate evaluation of the in flammatory status of the intrapulmonary airways requires BAL, which must be performed according to a standardised technique if data areto be compared between laboratories. A description of the procedure can be found in Supplementary item 1 . The choice of tracheal or BAL aspirate depends on the clinician 's level of comfort for the each procedure and the expectations for cytological interpretation. Marked differences exist between the 2 procedures with respect to results of bacteriological culture and cytology differentials. In the absence of use of a guarded endoscope, bacterial culture of the lower airways can be a consequence of transfer of bacterial inhabitants from the upper airways. There are generally more neutrophils in tracheal lavage than in BAL samples. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from young horses with poor performance may show an increased mast cell population with or without an increase in the eosinophil population. Elevations in the numbers of either of these types of cells are associated with airway hyperreactivity. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid with large numbers of nontoxic neutrophils tends to contain more flocculant debris representing mucopurulent materials. Some poorly performing young horses may also have an increased proportion of lymphocytes without any clinical indication of active infectious airway process. Exfoliation of columnar mucosal epithelial cells accompanied by numerous free cilia and detached ciliary tufts is common in young athletic horses with respiratory viral infection. Alveolar macrophages and lymphocytes are elevated during the active infectious process and are accompanied by a gradual increase in the neutrophil population from Days 3 -15 post infection. IAD pathogenesis Mild but persistent respiratory signs of IAD such as occasional coughing and nasal discharge can be early phenotypic indicators for an increased risk to develop RAO, a disease that has a genetic basis. Multiple genes are involved in RAO and they differ between affected families but, so far, the IL-4 receptor is the major candidate gene. Because some horses with IAD will develop RAO, this complexity of immunogenetics will become apparent when the genetic basis of IAD is investigated in-depth. In relation to infectious causes of IAD, variations in the gene for transferrin, an iron-binding protein that has bacteriostatic properties in the blood, protect against Streptococcus zooepidemicus infections in recently weaned ponies. Thus it is clear that multiple different genotypes are likely to converge within functional immunological pathways to result in the clinical phenotype of IAD. As has already been shown in RAO, some of these genes may also be involved in susceptibility to allergic skin disease and internal parasites. Comorbidities of airway in flammatory cell recruitment and activation, and the overproduction and hypersecretion of mucus, are common sequela of a variety of airway diseases of diverse origins. Chronic stimulation, either by persistence of inflammation or prolonged exposure to external irritants or endogenous mediators, can induce transformation of therespiratory and hyperplasia. Airway mucus hypersecretion is a hallmark of allergic airway disease involving eosinophils, mast cells, epidermal-derived growth factor, and interleukins-4, -5 and -13. However, a variety of nonallergic stimuli such as biogenic materials, bacterial products, particulate matter and oxidant gases working through neutrophils, elastase, TNF- aand reactive oxygen species, can induce the same hypersecretory phenotype. Furthermore and pertinent to IAD, studies of laboratory animals \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd10 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2016have shown that coexposure or coexistence of these disparate stimuli can interact to induce pathologies that are not readily predictable. For example, ozone exposure elicits mucus hypersecretion in the nose while endotoxin induces hypersecretory epithelium in the lung. Each toxicant can augment the effect of the other at the speci c airway site, in part by altering the kinetics and activation of neutrophils. Inallergic airway disease, ozone exacerbates eosinophilinltration and mucus production in nasal airways but inhibits the same responses in the lung. When mice with allergicairway disease are exposed to endotoxin, mucous cellmetaplasia and airway hyperresponsiveness are attenuatedand data suggest that nitric oxide pathways may becontributing to these results. Recent investigations in mice withozone-induced in flammatory and mucus cell responses in the nose have documented a switch from neutrophilic recruitmentto eosinophilic in flammation accompanied by mucus cell hyperplasia. This appears to be mediated by a small subset oflymphocytes that can activate TH2 pathways withoutinvolvement of the classic adaptive immune responses. The respiratory epithelial cell surface of the horse presents a large interface for interactions of ambient environmentalantigens that are highly immunogenic but generally harmlessbecause airway homeostasis is maintained by regulation ofboth the inmate and acquired immune systems.Dysregulation of this process leads to uncontrolledinflammation, for example in IAD. Currently, little is known of the immunological pathways responsible for this syndromebut there is evidence of both innate and acquired systemsmay be involved. Comparisons between IAD subclasses(neutrophil-vs. mast cell-characterised) have revealeddifferences in cytokine gene expression, most notably agreater expression of IL-4 mRNA (the prototypic TH2-typecytokine) in horses with increased numbers of mast cells, anda greater expression of IL-17 and IL-8 in neutrophilic cases. IL-17 is the archetype cytokine for the TH-17 cells, which havebeen shown to drive many human neutrophilic diseases.Interestingly, both of these pathways have also been shownto be upregulated in RAO. The high prevalence of IAD in some cohorts suggests that neutrophilic in flammation may be biologically appropriate under certain environmental conditions. Assuming identicalexposure, heterogeneity in horse airway in flammation could be a re flection of the normal variation of animal responses to the inhaled dust components. These components include not only type I and type II allergens, but also pathogen- associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), comprising CpG DNA, endotoxin, muramic acid, b-glucan and bacterial peptides. Many of these PAMPs activate toll-like receptors, which are highly conserved innate immune signal transducers, typically inducing an in flammatory cascade. Response to PAMPs does not require prior sensitisation and variation in response depends on the dose and genetic variation in the individual 's immune response, which is a consequence of toll- like receptor polymorphisms. The underlying geneticdeterminants of the magnitude of the innate immuneresponse to common organic dust components and their rolein IAD should therefore be a focus of future investigations. The role of bacterial infections in IAD aetiology remains controversial, largely due to the limitations of eld sampling and the failure to ful l Koch 's postulates and demonstrate causality. The following evidence is, however, supportive of an infectious cause of IAD in racehorses: (1) epidemiologicalinvestigations have demonstrated a reduction in the prevalence of IAD in racehorses with age, with evidence that this is related to time exposed to the training environment rather than age per se , consistent with the development of immunity to infections; (2) across many studies, association between bacterial infections and IAD are consistently limited to certain species, particularly S. zooepidemicus , Actinobacillus/Pasteurella species and Streptococcus pneumonia ; (3) the reduction in prevalence of both S. zooepidemicus infections and IAD with age, and the absence of reduction in frequency of other streptococcal species also support a role for S. zooepidemicus as a cause of IAD; (4) there is a higher prevalence of IAD in horses with larger numbers of colony forming units; and (5) similar bacteria cause respiratory disease in other species. It should be emphasised, however, that IAD is likely to involve many factors that act synergistically or sequentially to initiate or perpetuate airway in flammation. Investigations recording a range of both infectious and noninfectious factors will be required to understand the relative importance of different agents in different contexts. Inflammatory airway disease management It is important to recognise that IAD and RAO are both chronic in flammatory airway diseases resulting in airway obstruction and that both are to a large degree environmentally induced. The 2 syndromes differ only in the severity of airway obstruction in the resting horse. Although useful for de ning research populations, IAD and RAO should not be thought of as separate diseases but rather differences in severity of the same syndrome. For this reason, it may be useful to think of IAD and RAO as part of a larger syndrome that might be termed 'equine asthma '. Use of the latter term may facilitate adherence to therapeutic recommendations because most horse owners know someone with asthma and recognise that it is triggered by environmental factors and treated with corticosteroids and bronchodilators. The management of IAD cannot be limited to medical therapy and improving the horse 's environment is key to long- term management of IAD cases. In IAD-affected performance horses, disease management must also take into account frequent travelling, regular environmental changes, doping control and tight treatment schedules. While 24 h turn out at pasture is ideal, it is often not practical and many horses are housed most of the day. The concentration and number of airborne particles varies with stable design, location of stall within the building, management practices, time of day and season of year. Speci c details on building design, bedding, forage and management practices to reduce particulate exposure can be found in Supplementary item 1 . It is also important to remember that some horses develop airway in flammation in response to outdoor environments, for example horses with summer pasture-associated obstructive pulmonary disease. Doses and treatment schedules used with bronchodilators and corticosteroids can be found in most recent equine medical texts and were not the topic of this symposium. Most of the drugs and dosages recommended are based on studies performed in horses with RAO: in these animals, systemically administered corticosteroids are highly effective and bronchodilators are of primary bene t in the relief of severe airway obstruction. There are no controlled studies reporting the ef cacy of bronchodilators in the treatment of IAD and the investigations of the ef cacy of aerosol \u00a92015 AE / JANUARY 2016corticosteroids have produced equivocal results. A recent investigation found that feed supplementation with an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplement provided additional bene t to a low dust diet in terms of clinical signs lung function and BAL fluid cytology. Although antibiotics are frequently used in the treatment of IAD, there have been nocontrolled clinical trials on this topic.

Left to right, front row: Anne Courouc /C19e-Malblanc, Jackie Cardwell, Emmanuelle Van Mazan row: Romain 2016A NEW dual ingredient injectable corticosteroid approved by the FDA exclusively for use in horses INDICATION: BetaVet\u00ae is indicated for the control of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis in horses. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION For Intra-Articular (I.A.) Use in Horses. CONTRAINDICATIONS: BetaVet\u00ae is contraindicated with hypersensitivity to betamethasone. Intra-articular injection of corticosteroids for local effect is contraindicated in the presence of septic arthritis. WARNINGS: Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. Clinical and experimental data have demonstrated that corticosteroids administered orally or parenterally to animals may induce the first stage of parturition when administered during the last trimester of pregnancy and may precipitate premature par turition followed by dystocia, fetal death, retained placenta, and metritis. Additionally, corticosteroids administered to dogs, rabbits and rodents during pregnancy have resulted in cleft palate in offspring and in other congenital anomalies including deformed forelegs, phocomelia and anasarc a. Therefore, before use of corticosteroids in pregnant animals, the possible benefits to the pregnant animal should be weighed against potential hazards to its developing embryo or fetus. Human Warnings: Not for use in humans. For use in animals only. Keep this and all medications out of the reach of children. Consult a physician in the case of accidental human exposure. PRECAUTIONS: Corticosteroids, including BetaVet \u00ae, administered intra-articularly are systemically absorbed. Do not use in horses with acute infections. Acute moderate to severe exacerbation of pain, further loss of joint motion, fever, or malaise within several days following intra-articular injection may indicate a septic process. Because of the anti-inflammator y action of corticosteroids, signs of infection in the treated joint may be masked. Due to the potential for exacerbation of clinical signs of laminitis, glucocorticoids should be used with caution in horses with a history of laminitis, or horses otherwise at a higher risk for laminitis. Use with caution in horses with chronic nephritis, equine pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID), and congestive heart failure. Concurrent use of other anti-inflammatory drugs, such as NSAIDs or other corticosteroids, should be approached with caution. Due to the potential for systemic exposure, concomitant use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids may increase the risk of gastrointestinal, renal, and other toxicity. Consider appropriate wash out times prior to administering additional NSAIDs or corticosteroids. ADVERSE REACTIONS: Adverse reactions reported during a field study of 239 horses of various breeds which had been administered either BetaVet \u00ae (n=119) or a saline control (n=120) at five percent (5%) and above were: acute joint effusion and/or local injection site swelling (within 2 days of injection), 15% BetaVet \u00ae and 13% saline saline control. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Shake well immediately before use. Use immediately after opening, then discard any remaining contents. RX ONLY References: 1. Houdeshell, JW.

From the manufacturer of Adequan\u00ae (polysulfated glycosaminoglycan)increased lameness (within swelling of treated joint (5 or more days after injection), 2.5% potent glucocorticoid steroid with anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Depending upon their physico-chemical properties, drugs administered intra-articularly may enter the general circulation because the synovial joint cavity is in direct equilibrium with the surrounding blood supply. After the intra-articular administration of 9 mg BetaVet \u00ae in horses, there were quantifiable concentrations of betamethasone (above 1.0 ng/mL) in the plasma. EFFECTIVENESS: A negative control, randomized, masked field study provided data to evaluate the effectiveness of BetaVet \u00ae administered at 1.5 mL (9 mg betamethasone) once intra-articularly for the control of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis in horses. Clinical success was defined as improvement in one lameness grade according to the AAEP lameness scoring system on Day 5 following treatment. The success rate for horses in the BetaVet \u00ae group was statistically significantly different (p=0.0061) than that in the saline group, with success rates of 75.73% and 52.52%, respectively (back-transformed from the logistic regression). ANIMAL SAFETY: A 3-week target animal safety (TAS) study was conducted to evaluate the safety of BetaVet \u00ae in mature, healthy horses. Treatment groups included a control (isotonic saline at a volume equivalent to the pound bodyweight; BetaVet\u00ae). Treatments were administered by intra-articular injection into the left middle carpal joint once every 5-days for 3 treatments. Injection site reactions were the most common observations in all treatment groups. Injection site reactions were observed within 1 hour of dosing and included swelling at the injection site, lameness/stiffness of the left front limb, and flexing the left front knee at rest. The injection site reactions ranged from slight swelling (in many horses on multiple days in all treatment groups) to excessive fluid with swelling, pain, and lameness (4x group only). Injection site reactions were observed most commonly on treatment days, and generally decreased in number and severity over subsequent days. The incidence of injection site reactions increased after the second and third injection (number of abnormalities noted on day 10 > day 5 > day 0). In the BetaVet \u00ae treated groups the number and severity of the injection site reactions were dose dependent. The 4X BetaVet\u00ae group had the highest overall incidence of and severity of injection site reactions, which included heat, swelling, pain, bleeding, and holding the limb up at rest. The control group and 4X group (which received similar injection volumes) had a similar incidence of injection site reactions; however, the severity of reactions was greater in the 4X group. Absolute neutrophils were statistically significantly higher in the BetaVet \u00ae treated groups as compared to the control group. Trends toward a decrease in lymphocytes and eosinophils, and an increase in monocytes were identified in the BetaVet \u00ae treated groups after the initial dose of BetaVet\u00ae. Individual animal values for white blood cells generally remained within the reference range. BetaVet \u00ae treated horses also had a trend toward increased blood glucose after the initial dose. Some individual animals showed mild increases in blood glucose above the reference range.

Moore* Moore Equine Medical and Dental Services, Georgetown, Summary Shear mouth is a rare and poorly described dental condition observed in horses. This report outlines 2 cases of unilateral shear mouth with ipsilateral painful dental disease. Both cases are young horses diagnosed with idiopathic 409 cheek tooth fractures associated with shear angles on the 100 and 400 cheek teeth rows. Corrective odontoplasty was performed in both cases to correct the cheek tooth occlusal surface angle following exodontia of the diseased molars. Introduction The anisognathic nature of the equine mandible combinedwith the lateromedial direction of the masticatory cycle create a normal angulation of the cheek teeth (CT) occlusal surface (Dixon et al. 2000) that is variably described to be 10-15\u00b0(Easley 1996; Rucker 2002), 15 -40\u00b0(Brigham and Duncanson 2000) while more recent work (Brown et al. 2008) provides a range of 12.5 -30\u00b0. One study found that CT occlusal angles (OA) between 6 \u00b0and 19 \u00b0did not have any adverse effects on feed digestibility (Carmalt et al. 2005) while another source suggested that a premolar OA of 10-18\u00b0is ideal (Ralston et al. 2001). The movement associated with mandibular lateral excursion during mastication brings the mandibular CT laterally across a signi cant portion of the maxillary CT thus resulting in the maintenance of the OA (Dixon et al. 2000). Shear mouth is a term used to describe a relatively rare condition of the equine CT that is reported to occur in <1-2.6% of horses (Uhlinger 1987; Brigham and Duncanson 2000; Peters et al. 2006). Uhlinger (1987) reported a 12% prevalence in a group of horses that presented with signs of dental disease compared with 2.6% from a group with no external signs of oral disease. Most reports of the incidence of shear mouth fail to specify whether the condition was bilateral or unilateral, although Brigham and Duncanson (2000) reported 2 unilateral cases in a study of 100 horses, which is consistent with the cases described in this report. There is no clear consensus on what the OA must measure to be de ned as shear. The criteria are variably de ned as: 'a condition in which the lingual points of the lower arcade make contact with the hard palate '(Lowder and Mueller 1998), 'the occlusal surface is worn to the level of the gingiva on the lingual surface of the upper arcade and the labial surface of the lower arcade '(Uhlinger 1987), both of which are clinical descriptions of the condition. Other authors have used a numeric classi cation system de ning shear as an OA >15\u00b0(Dixon et al. 2000), >40\u00b0(Brigham and Duncanson 2000), >45\u00b0(Dixon et al. 2011), although some authors have alsosuggested that OAs >30\u00b0constitute a shear mouth (Carmalt 2004). A study by Brown et al. (2008) found that some normal horses had OA of the caudal mandibular CT of >30\u00b0. Biomechanically, a shear mouth appears to be the result of a reduction or in some cases, a complete absence of mastication on one side, which allows the buccal margins of the maxillary cheek teeth and the lingual margins of the mandibular cheek teeth to no longer undergo normal attrition. A range of aetiologies is proposed for this rare disorder. One hypothesis is that most cases develop from a lack of floating of the sharp enamel overgrowths, which can eventually lead to a reduction of the normal masticatory pattern (Dixon et al. 2000, 2011; Dixon 2003; Dixon and Dacre 2005), while some cases of shear mouth can be found with ipsilateral painful dental disease such as displaced CT or apical CT infection that may lead to a restriction of normal mandibular movement (Dixon et al. 2000). These ndings are consistent with those of Baker (1991), who reported: 'any forces that interrupt or disrupt normal occlusal contact will result in irregularities of wear '. Some authors have proposed that a greater than normal disparity in width of the mandible compared to the maxilla can be responsible for a shear OA (Mueller 1991; Rucker 2002). Horses suffering from shear mouth are reported to have an impaired ability to masticate feed effectively, especially hay (Dixon et al. 2011), and may be prone to abnormal eating habits such as head tilting or refusal to eat hay (Lowder and Mueller 1998). There is very little written regarding the speci c treatment for this condition, although one study stated that a 10 -15\u00b0angle could be restored in many of the cases treated (Dixon et al. 2000). This report presents 2 cases of shear mouth associated with ipsilateral painful dental conditions that presented to Moore Equine Medical and Dental Services. The Modi ed Triadan system of equine dental nomenclature is employed throughout this report (Floyd 1991), and common dental abnormalities are abbreviated according to the system described by Easley and Tremaine (2011). Case 1 A 6-year-old Dutch Warmblood gelding was referred forevaluation of a shear mouth. He was recently imported from the UK and was being used as a 3-day event horse. The attending veterinarian noticed the presence of a severe dental malocclusion and referred the horse for further evaluation. Clinical ndings Physical and oral examination revealed moderate atrophy of the right temporalis muscle ( Fig 1 ), a diagonal malocclusion on the incisors, left displacement of the mandible \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd13 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE 2016relative to the maxilla and incisive bone ( Fig 2 ). A closed mouth examination with a cheek retractor revealed that the 100 and 400 dental quadrants were completely offset and no lateral excursion of the mandible to the right was possible. Further evaluation with a full mouth speculum showed severely steep cheek tooth table angles on the 100 and 400 quadrants with the buccal alveolar bone and mucosa having migrated ventrally ( Fig 3 ). The 100 and 400 CT OA were estimated at 60 -70\u00b0. The hard palate near the 100 quadrant was severely asymmetric and much steeper on the right than on the left side ( Fig 3 ). Calculus accumulation was present on the buccal aspects of the premolars and molars in the 100 quadrant ( Fig 4 ). A smooth non-functional occlusalsurface affecting all CT on the shear side ( Fig 5 ) was noted. The clinical crown height was signi cantly greater on the lingual aspects of the 400 quadrant cheek teeth compared to those on the contralateral side ( Fig 3 ). An idiopathic fracture of the 409 CT with the lingual margin of this tooth extending dorsally and making contact with the palatal mucosa of the opposing 109 molar was also noted. The space between the occlusal surfaces of the 100 and 400 quadrant CT was greatly reduced compared to the 200 and 300 quadrants ( Fig 3 ). Invasion of granulation tissue that covered part of the fractured 409 CT crown combined with the deep necrosis affecting multiple pulp horns suggested chronicity to the dental disease affecting the 409 CT. The 109 CT was protuberant as it was erupting into the space created by the diseased 409 CT ( Fig 3 ). Following intravenous sedation, occlusal surface odontoplasty was performed to begin the process of correcting the OA. The work focused on the buccal half of the 100 quadrant and the lingual half of the 400 quadrant. Because of the severity of the shear OA, the space between the 100 and 400 quadrants was too narrow even after the initial occlusal adjustment to allow for the insertion of elevators and forceps for extraction of the 409 CT. Approximately 4 weeks later, further odontoplasty helped create adequate access and oral extraction of the 409 was attempted. Due to a lack of clinical crown, limited access, and chronic disease causing weakness of the tooth, oral extraction failed and a minimally invasive repulsion with aSteinman pin was performed standing with local anaesthesia combined with intraoperative radiographic guidance to ensure proper pin placement ( Fig 6 ). No intraoperative or post operative complications were experienced. The horse was re-examined 6 weeks following the repulsion and the majority of the alveolar socket had lled in with healthy granulation tissue. The OA had also improved signi cantly. At this time further adjustments were made to correct the OA of the 100 and 400 CT rows. A few hours post odontoplasty, a video was obtained of the horse masticating on its right side, which had not been witnessed in the previous months. Similar adjustments were repeated 3.5 months later and revealed gradual continued improvement ( Fig 3b ). Eleven months post initial presentation the horse was examined and the owner reported that he had routinely been eating using his right side. His temporalis musculature was completely symmetrical. During lateral excursion, the cheek teeth on the affected side were able to engage freely. Oral examination revealed nearly symmetrical appearance of the hard palate as well as the OA of the 100 and 400 quadrants ( Fig 3c ). Very little odontoplasty was performed on the occlusal surfaces at this time. Case 2 A 6-year-old Quarter Horse gelding was referred to Moore Equine Medical and Dental Services for extraction and further evaluation of dental disease related to a fractured 409 molar. An oral examination revealed a diagonal incisor maloc- clusion combined with a left lateral displacement of the mandible relative to the maxilla ( Fig 7 ). The mandibular shift resulted in the 103 and 403 incisors being nearly out of occlusion. A shear angle was present on the 100 and 400 CT rows ( Figs 8 and 9). The gingiva and periodontal tissue surrounding the 100 and 400 quadrant cheek teeth were Fig 1: Case 1. Atrophy of the right temporalis muscle. Note the rounded contours of the left musculature compared to a flatter more linear shape on the right. Fig 2: Case 1. Diagonal incisor malocclusion and displacementof the mandible to EQUINE flamed ( Fig 8a ). The buccal aspects of the maxillary cheek teeth had evidence of calculus accumulation combined with a yellowish stain that is signi cant when compared to the contralateral quadrants ). The supragingival crown was signi cantly greater on the 400 cheek teeth than on the 300 CT row ( Fig 9 ), especially along the lingual margin. Further examination revealed a large idiopathic slab fracture of the 409 CT with severeinternal necrosis and loss of normal hypsodont tooth morphology ( Fig 10 ). The majority of the dentin that sits within the peripheral enamel was absent and no individual pulphorns could be identi ed. A large portion of the tooth wasdisplaced buccally resulting in a loss of the buccal alveolar bone and periodontal structures of the 409 ( Fig 10 ). Treatment Following intravenous sedation and local anaesthesia, the infected fractured 409 molar was extracted orally using dental picks and root fragment forceps under endoscopic guidance ( Fig 11 ). Odontoplasty was performed to partially correct the shear angle by reducing the buccal aspects of the maxillary cheek teeth and lingual margins of the mandibular cheek teeth. To ensure that no damage was done to the pulps, the appearance of the secondary dentin Fig 4: Case 1. Cheek tooth occlusal surface angle estimated between 65 -70 degrees.

Within days of treatment, the horse was consistently seen masticating on his right side and continued to do so over the proceeding 30 days. The owners reported an increase in appetite and an overall improvement in disposition. Long- term follow-up is not available as the horse was sold and moved to a different state. Discussion Unopposed teeth have been reported to erupt at double the normal rate or in excess of 5 mm/year (Dixon and Dacre2005), which supports the relatively rapid development of moderate to severe shear mouth in such young horses with ipsilateral CT fractures. If teeth are not in opposition, whether it is a single tooth due to an extraction on the opposing quadrant or a whole arcade as seen with severe shear mouths, it is reasonable to expect some degree of CT hypereruption to occur. Both horses presented in this report had some degree of mandibular offset combined with a diagonal incisor malocclusion with the protuberant lower incisor being on the contralateral side of the shear ( Figs 2 and 7). It is likely that the diagonal incisor malocclusion is secondary to the abnormal wear pattern that occurred due to a painful dental lesion of the CT thus resulting in a limited mandibular excursion, which is consistent with reports by Fig 6: Case 1. Extracted 409 molar. Internal necrosis affecting multiple pulp horns. Needle case is 5 cm in length. Fig 7: Case 2. Diagonal incisor malocclusion. a) b) Fig 8: Case 2. a) Gingivitis, periodontitis, and calculus depositionon the buccal aspect of the 106 cheek tooth in a 5 year old QHgelding with shear mouth. Note Porter 2006; DeLorey 2007). The gingiva associated with the 100 quadrant CT was affected by gingivitis and calculus accumulation along the buccal aspects of the 100 quadrant CT that developed secondary to food stasis and a disruption of the masticatory process -both conditions are known to occur secondary to abnormal chewing patterns due to CT malocclusions (Baker 1991; Dixon 2003). As detailed in the introduction, there is a lack of clear consensus on what parameters de ne a shear mouth, and studies measuring OA in a controlled environment have failedto provide consistently repeatable OA ndings between various research groups (Brigham and Duncanson 2000;Carmalt 2004; Brown et al. 2008). As such, it is likely to beimpractical to expect practitioners to be able to quantify a shear mouth OA while working under more strenuous conditions in daily practice. Perhaps a classi cation system based not on exact OA but rather on clinical ndings would help achieve a more uniform nomenclature within the profession. The rst horse in this report was de ned as severe based on: deviation of the hard palate ventrally; increased Fig 9: Case 2. Increased supragingival crown of CT in 400 quadrant compared to 300 quadrant CT. Fig 10: Case 2. Shear OA with slab fracture of 409 CT.

Appearance of secondary dentin staining was used to prevent any exposure of the vital pulp. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd17 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY crown on mandibular CT; presence of calculus and gingivitis on 100 quadrant; smooth nonfunctional occlusal surface of 100 and 400 quadrant CT; presence of diagonal incisor malocclusion; and the complete absence of mandibular lateral excursion to the right due to the fact the maxillary CT and mandibular CT were side by side instead of being opposed to each other horizontally. The second case was classi ed as moderate and had similar ndings as Case 1 except that the arcades were able to engage during lateral excursion, and some roughness -albeit very mild -was still present on the occlusal surfaces. Mild cases seen by this author have presented with no gingivitis or tartar on the affected maxillary quadrant, combined with a limited -but present -lateral mandibular excursion and coarse occlusal surfaces ( Fig 13 ). The occlusal surfaces in the moderate to severe case were smooth and lacked the characteristic transverse ridgesthat are usually present from the differential wear of theprimary dentin, secondary dentin, teeth only)(Fig 5 ). The cases in this report suggest that if a primary painful dental lesion responsible for the secondary shear angle canbe isolated and removed, there is a good probability that theshear can be corrected with odontoplasty over time. Inabsence of pain and with no biomechanical restrictions, thedental morphology can return to a healthier status as thenormal salivary and masticatory pattern is re-established(Dixon and Dacre 2005). During the process of performing odontoplasty it is essential to exercise caution to prevent iatrogenic exposureof pulp horns. The colour and appearance of the secondarydentin overlying each pulp horn was closely monitored andodontoplasty was discontinued when a light brownappearance was noted. Secondary dentin is avascular andany appearance of pink or red over the pulp horns indicatesvital pulp exposure (White and Dixon 2010) and should be avoided by working systematically and constantly using visual assessment to avoid any iatrogenic tooth damage. This is especially true in the caudal mandibular teeth, which can be more dif cult to visualise and thus may be at greater risk of pulpar exposure. Furthermore, if using motorised equipment, the burr should be kept clean and sharp to reduce the generation of heat during odontoplasty -it is best to routinely cool the teeth and instrumentation to avoid the potential of a secondary pulpitis (O 'Leary et al. 2013). The work should be staged and the horses examined routinely. The 30 -60 day intervals for evaluation and further occlusal adjustment were selected based on the work of others (Nowak 2013) and may not be suitable for correcting shear mouth in older horses where the rate of eruption may be reduced. At the time of writing, there are few data in the peer- reviewed literature regarding horses with shear mouths. There is a great deal that is not yet understood about this condition and more work is needed that carefully documents aetiology, clinical ndings, treatment protocols, and outcomes to help further understand the various presentations and responses to treatment.

Easley* Equine Veterinary Practice, Shelbyville, disease Historically, equine dental disease has been described using terms for abnormal wear patterns, i.e. sharp enamel points, wave mouth, step mouth and shear mouth (Merillat 1909). Most other dental pathologies were grouped together as 'diseased teeth '. This emphasis on abnormal wear patterns was the result of early equine practitioners having only a float or rasp and molar cutter to treat dental conditions. Maslow 's Law of the Instrument (1966) takes over and like the carpenter with only a hammer ...everything is a nail; so, for the equine 'dentist '...everything is a long tooth ! Shear mouth was a debilitating dental condition described in early veterinary literature. Synonyms used to describe this condition include scissor mouth, parvignathism, overlapping molars and bevelling Barrier 1892; Clarke 1886; Merillat 1909). William Clarke in his textbook (1886) on horses 'teeth described a specimen from the Veterinary College at Alfort (France). 'The teeth on one side come together like the blades of shears. As there is no friction to wear the teeth down, they grow to a height of 3 inches. The 4th and 5th mandibular teeth on the affected side are missing, perhaps due to caries. Also, the jaw bone indicates disease adjacent to these teeth. The opposite side is the only side used for mastication '. Clarke had observed two cases in living horses. He had only in retrospect thought to ascertain whether the defect was due to a 'deformity of the entire arcade owing to a defect of a grinder or disease of the bone '. He stated, 'the solution to the question would be an important acquisition to the science of dental pathology '. Similarly, two additional references from the 1800s (Goubaux and Barrier 1892; Hinebauch 1889) describe shearmouth, providing details regarding any condition that causespain on one side of the mouth that interferes with masticationon the same side can lead to shear mouth (periostitits, caries,stula, lesions of the cheek, the tongue, etc.). The teeth on the opposite side will remain normal while the unworn side willbecome elongated and bevelled like the blades of shears.This condition can present as unilateral or bilateral andinvolve the entire arcade or individual teeth within thearcade. Goubaux and Barrier (1892) found that the gravity of the condition depended upon how mastication is affected and ifit extends to causing lesions of the soft tissues. He stated,'these horses may pass unperceived on a purchase examination if the mouth is not examined. The incisors inlongstanding cases are usually irregular in meeting and wear.The state of the incisors should arouse suspicions, as theseteeth appear long on one side and short on the other. 'From the 1800s until only recently, we, as veterinarians, have concentrated on treating wear abnormalities and have neglected diagnosing the causative underlying pathology. This has primarily been due to the lack of good diagnostic instruments, safe animal sedation and restraint, adequate knowledge of dental pathology, and professional neglect in caring for the horse 's mouth. In the early 1990s, P.M. Dixon and others began to raise the level of interest and science in the equine dental eld (Dixon 1993). Since that time research and publications in this eld of veterinary medicine have proliferated. The paper by Nicholas Moore (2016) in this issue describes two cases of unilateral shear mouth accompanied by anipsilateral painful diseased tooth. He rightly based hisdiagnosis on the case background, history, results of a physical examination and an oral examination using modern examination techniques (Menzies 2013). Moore understood that most abnormal occlusal wear is the result of some masticatory system abnormality (a symptom) rather than a primary diagnosis. He did not complete his diagnostic work- up after detecting the wear abnormality, but instead, continued the examination including radiographic imaging, until the root cause of the wear abnormality was diagnosed. Ultimately, Moore planned and carried out treatment for both the diseased tooth and the secondary wear abnormality. While the article by Moore (2016) correctly describes and discusses the clinical ndings and treatment of two cases of unilateral shear mouth with ipsilateral painful dental disease, it is important to detail other causes of shear mouth seen in clinical practice. These two cases point out the fact that while dental abnormal wear patterns do become more severe over time, shear mouth is seen in horses of all ages and has been incorrectly described as an \"uncommon disorder of geriatric equids \"(Dixon et al. 2010). Unilateral shear mouth can occur secondary to congenital deviation of the premaxilla, a condition most commonly referred to as wry nose or campylorrhinus lateralis. This condition, if severe, can inhibit lateral excursion of the mandible toward the incisor deviation, limiting mastication to the contralateral cheek tooth row ( Fig 1 ). The steep occlusal angle on the concave side of the deviation will become more pronounced with time. Less severe forms of deviation of the maxilla and incisive bone have been associated with incisor diagonal wear, asymmetry of the vomer and hard palate, and steep molar table angles on one side (Earley and Rawlinson 2013). It is unclear at this time whether thecause of the deviation of the facial bones in these less severe cases are congenital or acquired secondary to trauma or long-term abnormal mastication. Studies have only recently been launched to better determine how normal \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd20 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / mastication and chewing-side preference affect molar occlusal wear (Pares-Casanova and Morros 2014). Shear mouth can be seen secondary to severe parrot mouth. The overjet and overbite in some horses can trap the lower incisor teeth, preventing lateral excursion in one or both directions leading over time to a unilateral or bilateral shear mouth ( Fig 2 ). These longstanding wry nose and parrot mouth cases are extremely frustrating to manage because the downward drift of the upper jaw limits or at times prevents access to the oral cavity for examination or treatment. The author has seen two cases of unilateral shear mouth in horses diagnosed with chronic neurological disease secondary to equine protozoal myelitis. Both exhibited severe unilateral atrophy of all muscles of mastication on the affected side ( Fig 3 ). These horses were treated with medication for the neurological disease followed by frequent (every 2 -3 months) corrective odontoplasty to correct the occlusal abnormality. Both cases responded positively over a 12-24 month period; however, one had some residual neurological problems. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disease has also been associated with the development of shear mouth. Betterunderstanding of the anatomy and function of thetemporomandibular joint coupled with the development of 3-dimensional imaging -both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, is beginning to shed new lighton earlier confusion of cause and/or effect of abnormal wearpatterns on the temporomandibular joint (Carmalt 2015). Individual teeth or several teeth in an arcade may also become sheared or develop a steep occlusal table angle.This is usually secondary to individual tooth displacements ormalocclusions. Teeth can become displaced from the normal position in the row for various reasons. As the crown tilts, the occlusal surface begins to wear at a steep angle. These teeth are usually associated with diastemata and some degree of periodontal disease (Casey and Tremaine 2010). All occlusal wear abnormalities will become more severe over time and with age if the underlying cause is not identi ed and corrected. It should be clear to today 's equine veterinary practitioners that equine dentistry can be Fig 1: Transverse computed tomography image at the level of the second deciduous premolars, from a 7-month-old foalcadaver with a wry nose. The upper incisors are deviated to theleft and mechanically prevent the lower jaw moving in thatdirection. The left premolar occlusal table angles are at 45 \u00b0with a pronounced buccal enamel ridge. The right side is at a morenormal 15 \u00b0.

Prior to treatment with ReBalance Antiprotozoal Oral Suspension, EPM should be distinguished from other diseases that may cause ataxia in horses. Injuries or lameness may also complicate the evaluation of an animal with EPM. In most instances, ataxia due to EPM is asymmetrical and affects the front and/or the hind limbs. Treatment may cause generalized bone marrow suppression, anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. A complete bloo d count (CBC) should be performed monthly to monitor horses for development of these conditions. The administration of the drug m ay need to be discontinued and/or treatments for bone marrow suppression initiated. Other, less frequent side effects included decreased appetite, loose stools, and mild colic. In most cases, the gastrointestinal signs were self-limiting and did not require discontinuation of treatment. Worsened neurologic deficits (treatment crisis) may be observed during a period beginning with the first few days of treatment wi th ReBalance and ranging out to 5 weeks. This neurologic deficit exacerbation may be the result of an inflammatory reaction to the d ying parasites in the CNS tissue.

The safe use of ReBalance Antiprotozoal Oral Suspension in horses used for breeding purposes, during pregnancy, or in lactating mares has not been evaluated. The safety of ReBalance Antiprotozoal Oral Suspension with concomitant therapies in horses has not been evaluated. ADVERSE REACTIONS: Seventy-ve horses (37 horses in the 1X group; 38 horses in the 2X group) that were treated with test article for at least 90 days were evaluated for adverse reactions. Bone marrow suppression:Anemia: ReBalance Antiprotozoal Oral Suspension administration caused overall anemia (classication of anemia based on RBC, Hgb, and PCV/HCT values) in 12% of the observations in the 1X group and 21% of the observations in the 2X group. In the 1X group, anemia was noted in 22%, leukopenia in 19%, neutropenia in 5%, and thrombocytopenia in 3% of the cases. In the 2X group, anemia was noted in 58%, leukopenia in 55%, neutropenia in 29% and thrombocytopenia in 5% of the cases. The incidence of bone marrow suppression in the 2X treatment group was two or more times that of the 1X group and the degree of suppression was more serious (mild to severe vs. mild to moderate). Because of these blood dyscrasias, test article was interrupted over four times more often in horses treated at the 2X dosage than those treated at 1X, although both groups were off treatment for about the same amount of time (approximately 20% of the treatment period). In some instances of bone marrow suppression, diet was supplemented with folinic acid. GI: Anorexia was observed in two horses in the 1X group and one horse in the 2X group. One horse in the 1X group and one horse in the 2X group were observed to be off feed. Observations of anorexia and decreased appetite occurred predominantly during the rst 90 days of the treatment period.tObservations of anorexia/decreased appetite in two of the above-referenced cases were due to unrelated illnesses. Loose stools were observed in three horses in the 1X group and ve in the 2X group. The majority of these observations occurred in the rst thirty days of treatment. Diarrhea was observed in one horse in the 2X group on Day 4 of the study. The appearance of loose stool/diarrhea observations was self-limiting and resolved without treatment or discontinuation of test article. Brief, mild colic was observed in three cases (one in the 1X group and two in the 2X group). Colic was treated conservatively or not at all and resolved without sequelae. Integument: Urticaria was observed in one horse in the 1X group and two horses in the 2X group. One horse was treated topically, two were untreated. All cases resolved without sequelae.Treatment crisis (marked worsening of the neurological condition) was reported in one horse in the 1X treatment group. Depression/lethargy was observed infrequently, occurred during the early part of the study in both groups and was primarily associated with the EPM syndrome. In one case, depression was associated with acute onset of a liver disorder. Seizure: One horse in the 1X treatment group suffered from seizures. Seizure activity may be associated with CNS damage from EPM. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Sulfonamides (a specic group of antimicrobial agents) and pyrimethamine are two different antimicrobial agents which inhibit folic acid synthesis at two different sites, in the same synthetic pathway. The combination of a sulfonamide and pyrimethamine is synergistic, with the drug combination having an antiprotozoal effect. EFFECTIVENESS SUMMARY: A eld effectiveness study was conducted at eight sites with eight investigators across the United States. The study was conducted using historical controls. In this study, each animal's response to treatment was compared to its pre-treatment values. The following standardized overall neurological dysfunction (OND) scale was used to grade the horses: 0 = Clinically normal. No detectable dysfunction. 3 = Marked decit. Dysfunction strikingly conspicuous. 1 = Slight decit. Dysfunction barely perceptible. 4 = Severe decit. Profound dysfunction. 2 = Moderate decit. Dysfunction easily detectable. 5 = Recumbent. Ninety-seven horses were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups and administered a daily oral dose of ReBalance Antiprotozoal Oral Suspension for a minimum of 90 days. The two treatment groups were as follows: (1) 1X labeled dose, 20 mg/kg sulfadiazine and 1 mg/kg pyrimethamine (48 horses); or (2) 2X dose, twice the labeled dose, 40 mg/kg sulfadiazine and 2 mg/kg pyrimethamine (49 horses). A physical examination and neurological evaluation and complete blood prole were conducted at the end of each 30-day treatment period for the rst 90 days of treatment. At the end of the 90-day treatment period, a videotape recording of the neurological condition and CSF and serum sample immunoblot and protein electrophoresis analyses were made. Based on the degree of clinical improvement and results of the CSF immunoblot analysis on test day 90, treatment in 30-day increments up to a period of 180 days was continued. In fourteen cases, the treatment was extended beyond 180 days (up to 270 days). A 30-day follow-up evaluation was made following cessation of treatment. Treatment success was dened as: (1) a horse that became CSF Western Blot Test negative with or without clinical improvement; and (2) a horse that remained CSF Western Blot Test positive but demonstrated marked clinical improvement (two or more grade improvement from baseline OND score). Only the 1X dose was evaluated for effectiveness due to the toxicity (bone marrow suppression) seen at the 2X dose. Of the forty-eight horses assigned to the 1X group, 26 horses completed the study. Based on the improvement in the OND scores and/or a negative CSF immunoblot, 16 out of 26 horses (61.5%) were considered successes. Five of the 26 horses (19.2%), had a negative CSF immunoblot by day 150 of the study. Three of these ve horses were also clinical successes based on the improvement in OND scores. Fourteen of the 26 horses (53.8%) were corroborated as successes by masked expert evaluation of videotapes. ANIMAL SAFETY: ReBalance Antiprotozoal Oral Suspension was administered to ten horses (5 males and 5 females) at a dosage of 8 mL/50 kg (110 lbs) a day (2X the labeled dose) for 92 days. Four horses (2 males and 2 females) were untreated controls. Complete physical examinations, CBCs and serum chemistry values were determined on test day (TD) minus 14, TD minus 7, TD 0, biweekly throughout the 92 day treatment period and 14 and 29 days following the end of treatment. Declines in RBC, HCT, Hgb and PCV were greater in the treated group and reached statistical signicance. Twenty-nine days after cessation of treatment, blood parameter values returned to baseline levels. No clinical signs of anemia were observed in either group. Most serum chemistry values remained within normal limits throughout the study in both groups. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) values were evaluated (slightly above the upper end of the normal range) in three treated horses on study days 84 and 105. Loose stools, along with infrequent diarrhea, were noted in the treatment group. The conditions were transient and required no medical intervention. A depressed appetite of 1 to 2 days duration occurred infrequently in all but one of the treated horses. One horse became anorexic and required a change in diet. ReBalance Antiprotozoal Oral Suspension administered at 2X the recommended label dose for 92 days resulted in clinical signs of toxicity including transient anemia and loose stools; however, medical intervention was not necessary.

Original Article Ultrasound-guided lipoaspiration for mesenchymal stromal cell harvest in the Lawver* and R. Thaler Metamora (MSC) are being used to treat a variety of conditions in the horse. Traditional lipectomy and bone marrow aspiration for MSC harvest have disadvantages including cosmetic issues with lipectomy and extensive time for cell expansion after bone marrow harvests. This article describes a new technique of adipose harvest in the horse, utilising ultrasound and liposuction that can be safely and effectively performed in an ambulatory environment. Ultrasound-guided lipoaspiration offers a minimally invasive technique using small portals and a diffuse area of collection signi cantly improving aesthetic outcome and increasing the likelihood of treating within a matter of days vs. a matter of weeks. Introduction Regenerative medicine is a growing eld of equine ambulatory and referral practice. Adult MSC therapy haswidely gained acceptance in the treatment of a variety of musculoskeletal conditions. The commonality and recurrence of equine tendinopathies (Rooney and Genovese 1981; Dowling et al. 2000; Williams et al. 2001) has motivated MSC research in horses. Recent publications have supported MSC use demonstrating improved healing quality and reduced reinjury in horses with tendonitis (Del Bue et al. 2008; Nixon et al. 2008; Smith 2008; Carvalho et al. 2011; Godwin et al. 2012; Rich 2014). The mechanism by which MSCs improve healing outcomes is likely a combination of anti- inflammatory, immunomodulatory and growth factor effects (Puissant et al. 2005; Dahlgren et al. 2006; Wolbank et al. 2007; Nixon et al. 2008). Additionally, recent work investigating anti-apoptotic effects of MSCs in man and mice(Kim et al. 2012; Lim et al. 2013) offer further support of MSC use as apoptosis appears to signi in in flamed equine tendons (Hosaka et al. 2004). Currently, the two most common sources of adult MSCs are bone marrow and adipose tissue. The choice of adiposetissue (AT-MSC) or bone marrow (BM-MSC) derivedmesenchymal stromal cells is of current debate and clinicianpreference. Historically, wound care, hair deformation andcicatrix inherent of incisional lipectomy have deterred use ofAT-MSC in horses. With the introduction of lipoaspirate as asource of MSCs (Zuk et al. 2001) in man and horses (Bruno et al. 2014) these disadvantages become inconsequential due to minimally invasive skin portals and diffuse collectionsite distant from vital organs.Lipoaspiration is combined with tumescence, a technique that utilises saline, local anaesthetic and epinephrine to provide regional anaesthesia and haemostasis limiting the need for heavy sedation or general anaesthesia. The tumescent lipoaspiration technique in the horse originated from human plastic surgery principles shown to be a safe and effective method of adipose harvesting (Habbema 2009; Boeni 2011). However, lipoaspiration requires surgical techniques not routinely covered in veterinary didactic training or clinical practice; thus the authors advocate utilising diagnostic ultrasound during the procedure. In the authors 'experience, ultrasonographic guidance during tumescent infusion and lipoaspiration improves cosmetic outcome and reduces risk of iatrogenic trauma and contamination of lipoaspirate with other tissues. This paper will provide a detailed review of ultrasound- guided tumescent liposuction in horses. In the author 's experience, knowledge of lipoaspiration of adipose tissue has limited recognition amongst equine practitioners and their clientele and the use of ultrasound guidance throughout the technique has not been published elsewhere in the horse. Materials and methods The procedure was performed on 21 clinical cases (14 geldings, six mares, one stallion) from 2011 to 2014 for AT-MSC application in a variety of musculoskeletal injuries. Age ranged from 1 to 18 years and a diversity of breeds represented including Quarter Horse, Warmblood, Thoroughbred, Andalusian, Arabian and pony. Procedure preparation Prior to the procedure, ultrasonographic examination with alinear 12.5 MHz transducer (SonoSite) 1is performed to con rm appropriate adipose layer for harvest. A variety of other transducers such as a rectal probe also provide adequate imaging. Optimal adipose thickness is 3 -4 cm. If adipose depth is less than 1.5 cm owners are cautioned that cell expansion by culture may be necessary. The depth (4.9 cm is typical for these authors) and gain should be adjusted appropriately in accordance with practitioner preference. A large fat depot is located approximately 8 -15 cm abaxial to the insertion of the tail. A trough formed by the junction of thesemitendinosus and biceps femoris muscles is typically the thickest portion of the adipose eld ( Fig 1 ). The authors place each portal entry site just caudal to the deepest portion of the adipose trough. The trough is followed abaxially, axially and cranially to ensure at least 1 -2 cm of adipose tissue are \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd23 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2016present for harvest and the boundaries are then marked with Wite-Out2(Fig 2 ). After wrapping the tail with cohesive bandage (Vetrap)3 the marked area is clipped with a No. 40 blade andaseptically prepped. The patient is mildly sedated sedation is used as it is necessary to ensure the patient stands still. Ultrasound-guided tumescent infusion After applying a twitch or other appropriate restraint the skinportal site is desensitised with 2 -3 ml (40 -60 mg) of 2%lidocaine 6using a 25 gauge x 16 mm needle ensuring a visible bleb is left behind ( Fig 2 ). After additional scrub is applied and the site rinsed with alcohol, an adhesive sterile surgical drape (Loban)3is applied to the ventral one-half of the preparation area and secured distally to prevent iatrogenic contamination with unclipped hair of the caudal hindlimb. The dorsal one-half is left undraped to allow adequate access for the ultrasound probe to guide the cannulas. After appropriate delay for local anaesthesia the twitch is reapplied and a portal hole for the cannula made with a percutaneous punch (Pocar)7(Fig 3 ) or scalpel blade within the desensitised bleb. The portal entry site should be sufciently sized to allow cannula penetration with minimal tissue drag but small enough to prevent loss of suction and entry of air. A 60 ml Toomey7syringe is then loaded with tumescent fluid and infusion cannula (CellFriendly In ltrator)7 connected and primed to displace air from the cannula lumen. The infusion cannula was chosen in accordance with manufacturer 's recommendations based on the brous nature of equine adipose tissue and intended use of the lipoaspirate. Alternatively, a spinal needle may be used, although the infusion distribution will likely vary. The tumescent fluid consists of 230 ml sterile NaCl 9%8, 20 ml (400 mg) 2% lidocaine and 0.2 ml (0.2 mg) 1/1000 epinephrine9. A small amount of alcohol for acoustic coupling is sprayed above the draped eld and the ultrasound probe applied by a technician. Both transverse (authors 'preference) and sagittal probe orientations can be used to visualise advancement of cannula through the adipose layer. The probe is redirected through practitioner-technician communication, which is quickly mastered even with minimal knowledge of ultrasonography by the technician ( Fig 4 ). The infusion cannula should be advanced in a systematic manner, with the authors preferring to begin by aiming the cannula to the most axial and cranial aspect as determined with ultrasound. The tumescent solution is then slowly infused as the cannula is retracted but not withdrawn from the portal and then re-advanced slightly deeper than the previous stroke staying within the adipose layer as con rmed with ultrasonography. Once empty, the 60 ml syringe is then Fig 1: Side-by-side transverse ultrasonographic images 8 cm abaxial to insertion of with 12.5 MHz linear region: Skin (epidermis, dermis, muscles (c), semitendinosus (d),biceps femoris (e). Axial is to the left. Fig 2: Clipped area demonstrates adipose depot boundaries. Example of portal site location demonstrated by asterisk ( *). Fig 3: From top to JANUARY 2016reloaded with tumescent fluid and infusion repeated aiming in a radial pattern from axial to abaxial. This is repeated with 180-250 ml until the relatively hypoechoic adipose tissue becomes evenly expanded and relatively hyperechoic ultrasonographically, optimal infusion of tumescent inltrate ( Fig 5 ). During infusion, meticulous avoidance of the muscle layer is advocated. If muscle disruption occurs, the area of haemorrhage is readily visible and can be avoided ultrasonographically during harvesting. Once the infusion is complete a timer is set for 15 -45 min to allow distribution of tumescent fluid into the tissue. In the authors 'experience, a minimum of 20 min allows for optimal anaesthesia, haemostasis (via vasoconstriction) and tumescence (i.e. becomes rm). While waiting for the rst infusion to diffuse, tumescent solution is applied to the contralateral side in the same manner. The twitch is then removed and is usually no longer required. Prior to sterile glove removal, manual massage ofthe adipose eld is advocated to enhance distribution of tumescent fluid. During the resting phase the fat pad becomes palpably swollen and rm as tumescent fluid causes the adipose to swell, become turgid and ready for harvest (Dhami 2008; Venkataram 2008). Ultrasound-guided lipoaspiration Using a sterile technique, the aspiration harvest cannula(Cobra Bibevel) 7is connected to a new, dry Toomey syringe ensuring no liquid is present to weaken the seal. A small amount of sterile saline is used to ll the cannula lumen to again prevent air from obscuring ultrasound image quality. Additional alcohol is applied for acoustic coupling and the cannula inserted through the portal hole. Once in place within the adipose layer, the syringe plunger is pulled back to the fullest extent and locked in place with a syringe plunger lock (Johnny Lok)7to create an even, gentle vacuum pressure within the syringe and adipose eld ( Fig 6 ). With scrupulous ultrasound visualisation the cannula is then sharply directed forward into the tumescent adipose tissue. As the cannula is advanced, the wrist is rotated (e.g. from pronated to supinated and back again). This is repeated 25 -40 times to yield 45 ml of lipoaspirate in the same radial pattern used to infuse the tumescent fluid with ultrasound guidance to avoid muscle tissue. Ultrasonographically, gradual depletion of the hyperechoic tumescent-adipose eld occurs as the tissue is aspirated, indicating a need to redirect the cannula to a different location within the fat pad. After completion the lipoaspirate is then carefully deposited into an empty sterile transport container without disconnecting the Toomey syringe and harvesting cannula (to maintain dry, adequate seal for the other side). The cannula manufacturer advises caution when handling to prevent scratching of the specialised cell-friendly coating designed to preserve cell viability. The same steps for aspiration are then repeated on the contralateral side, yielding a total harvest of 90 ml of lipoaspirate. Generally, after between 30 and 45 ml the surgeon will notice a signi cant reduction in volume extraction per stroke and an increase in serosanguinous character of the lipoaspirate. When this occurs the authors generally discontinue lipoaspiration on that side. Fig 5: Left: Transverse image of partial infusion of tumescent solution centrally with normal adipose tissue dorsally (axial to the left). Middle: Longitudinal image of infusion cannula with acoustic shadowing ventrally. Tumescent fluid is seen as the hyperechoic, scalloped shaped tissue above and slightly cranial to the infusion cannula.

Fig 4: Example of adhesive drape placement 2 cm above portalincision leaving ample clipped area for probe placement.Infusion cannula and VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2016Post operatively, the portal holes are left open to heal by second intention to allow drainage of any tumescent fluid left behind after aspiration post operatively (Dhami 2008; Venkataram 2008). Mild serosanguinous drainage is normal and expected for 2 -3 days. Portals may be sutured closed; however, performing this procedure in an ambulatory environment assumes some level of contamination in the authors 'opinion. With this in mind, the authors 'surmise primary closure may actually lead to more complications such as prolonged swelling, pain, seroma or infection (Dhami 2008). Antimicrobial and nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory administration is based on veterinary discretion. The harvested lipoaspirate is typically shipped overnight on ice to a processing laboratory. Samples are then processed aseptically to separate the adipocytes from other nucleated cells as reported in the literature (Bunnel et al. 2008; Carvalho et al. 2009; Taylor and Clegg 2011). The resulting heterogenous cell population, termed the stromal vascular fraction (SVF), can either be injected as is or subjected to cell expansion to produce a relatively purepopulation of MSCs. The cell processing laboratory 10used by this practice monitors all samples for contamination. To date, all ultrasound-guided samples we have performed have been free of contamination. Samples were tested for aerobic bacteria, anaerobic bacteria and fungi via USP 71 (http:// www.pharmacopeia.cn/v29240/usp29nf24s0_c71.html) as well as tested for mycoplasma. Additionally, this laboratory has unpublished internal data validating lipectomy and lipoaspirate samples in the horse. The cells produced meet the minimal criteria for MSC de ned by the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) (Dominici et al. 2006) and International Federation of Adipose Therapeutics and Science (IFATS) (Bourin et al. 2013) based on plastic adherence, CD markers and differentiation assays. Current literature also supports lipoaspirate meeting ISCT minimum criteria for MSC in dolphins (Johnson et al. 2012). Results At the time of writing this article none of the 21 patients demonstrated complications during adipose collection or portal wound healing. Subtle, diffuse depressions over theaspiration elds are noted transiently ( Fig 7 ), which lls in over time. Owner satisfaction with the procedure has been excellent with no aesthetic complaints up to 2 years post operatively. The average adipose-derived nucleated cells collected in this lipoaspirate cohort was 383,460 cells/g. Greater than 85% (18/21) of lipoaspirates resulted in treatment within 48 h of harvest, while the remainder (3/21) required cell expansion prior to therapy. Discussion Tumescent lipoaspiration is widely used in human plastic and reconstructive surgery and considered extremely safe (Alexander 2011). Early in the developmental phase of human lipoaspiration surgeons attributed increased yields to increased vacuum force. It is now understood the addition of a tumescent solution allows the adipose matrix (a mixture of adipose cells and stroma) to become suspended within the fluid, allowing for reduced suction force with an apparatus as simple and cost effective as a syringe and plunger. The use of gentle, constant suction with a closed syringe system reduces cell damage and signi cantly improves fat grafting results in man (Alexander 1992). Modi cation of human lipoaspiration for use in horses has proven to be a safe and effective means of AT-MSC harvest in this practice. The use of ultrasound provides improved assurance of adipose tissue collection and intentional cannula avoidance of surrounding tissues and blood vessels limiting complications. This is especially advantageous for veterinarians learning a new technique. None of the 21 patients experienced infection, excessive drainage or soreness whereas dehiscence, infection and prolonged wound healing were occasionally experienced with lipectomy in this practice (R. Thaler, unpublished data 2011). In addition to reduced complications, owner compliance and satisfactionsigni cantly improved with lipoaspiration due to reduced cicatrix and tissue deformation when compared to lipectomy. The improved aesthetics are secondary to minimally invasive portal incisions and a more diffuse, bilateral Fig 6: Left image: Depiction of AT-MSC harvest cannula being operated under sonographic guidance. 45 ml of tumescentadipose tissue is collected from the right and left gluteal fat pad.Right image: Bright white cannula with acoustic shadow in centreof relatively hyperechoic adipose tissue after 20 min of tumescentdiffusion.

This practice has experienced a signi cant increase in client acceptance of AT-MSC therapy since adopting a minimally invasive technique, possibly due to the loss of marketability and poor owner perception inherent of an animal with a scar. Lipoaspiration additionally offers the advantage of expedited time to treatment compared to techniques that require cell expansion. Disadvantages over lipectomy include lower cell counts [average 28% fewer nucleated cells per gram (C. Orava, unpublished data 2014)], increased procedure time and cost. Arguably, the 90 ml harvest is a mixture of adipose tissue and tumescent fluid which is the primary cause for lower cell counts when compared to incisional en bloc lipectomy harvests. If allowed to settle gravitationally, the cell layer will separate from the tumescent fluid and it has been proposed to decant the top layer. However, literature supports MSC presence in both the fluid and fatty layers of the lipoaspirate and decantation prior to shipment is not currently advocated (Yoshimura et al. 2006). Other probable factors include cell trauma from repeated cannula advances. The infusion and harvest cannulas were chosen based on manufacturer recommendation due to the brous nature of equine adipose tissue. There are a variety of cannula options and the optimal choice is an area for future research. Additionally, tumescent fluid itself may impose negative effects on cell homeostasis. Recent in vitro work with human adipose lipoaspirates did not nd deleterious effects of epinephrine but determined a dose and time dependent cytotoxicity with lidocaine (Girard et al. 2013). Mepivacaine has also been shown to signi cantly reduce equine chondrotoxicity when compared to lidocaine and bupivacaine (Park et al. 2011). This practice has shown success with lipoaspiration in the horse despite using lidocaine as a local anaesthetic. However, cellular results may be optimised with alternatives and should be explored in the future. Lastly, human tumescent lipoaspiration procedures advocate 'pretunneling 'where the infusion cannula is repeatedly advanced within the adipose layer to prevent pooling of tumescent fluid, improve adipose suspension and ease harvest collection (Alexander 2011). Although, the authors have good success using the technique described here and currently do not advocate pretunneling, these data suggest future research regarding instrumentation, local anaesthetics and manipulation techniques are warranted to optimise equine MSC yield and viability. The lipoaspirate is enzymatically digested to produce the SVF. Based on lipectomies in the horse, approximately 43% of the cells in the SVF are MSCs (Vidal et al . 2007). The percentage of MSCs from lipoaspirate has not been published in the horse; however, a comparable average of 35% was reported from lipoaspirate in man (Varma et al. 2007). Lipoaspiration may still occasionally require cell expansion by culture and 3/21 (15%) of our lipoaspirate cohort required cell expansion. Expansion was expected in one horse with 0.7 cm adipose depot thickness. The second case was an 18-year-old mare with a metabolic condition while the third horse was a middle aged, healthy, but lean gelding with a very brous feel during aspiration harvest. Retrospectively, the rst two cases may have been better candidates for an alternative source of MSC but would have likely required cell expansion regardless. The third case wasunexpected and may be explained by the inherent individuality of adipose tissue. For example, even lipectomyoccasionally requires cell expansion as a select few horses have low resident MSC within adipose but this is relatively uncommon (R. Thaler, personal observations 2014). The majority (85%) of lipoaspirates yielded an average of twofresh doses, allowing rapid initial treatment 48 h after sample harvest with ample time for cell expansion prior to the next scheduled treatment should this serve as an issue. The dose used in this practice was adopted from processing laboratory recommendations based on internal data. Standardisation of dosage regimens is needed to provide comparison reliability amongst future treatment protocols and success outcomes and is beyond the scope of this technique paper. Patient age and body condition score may also affect adipose MSC harvest as research on BM-MSCs and AT-MSCs has shown an inverse relationship with age and stem cell regenerative potential in equine, murine and human models (Zhou et al. 2008; Chen et al. 2012; Choudhery et al. 2012; Carter-Arnold et al. 2014). The authors currently allot 60 -75 min for actual procedure time in an ambulatory setting. Procedure duration depends highly on veterinarian competence with the technique and will improve with increasing familiarity. This is prolonged when compared to unilateral lipectomy (15-30 min). The cost of infusion and harvest cannulas also add expense when compared to a scalpel and suture material required for lipectomy. The harvest cannula can be resterilised and used approximately 10 times prior to replacement. Beyond 10 uses, the manufacturer cites areduction in cell viability may be noted due to deterioration of the cell-friendly coating. The infusion cannula can be reused indiscriminately. It is of strong author opinion that these shortcomings are worth the extra nancial investment and time commitment in exchange for a minimally invasive technique that conserves aesthetic appeal, reduces patient discomfort and improves client satisfaction while preserving an expedited time to treatment. Conclusion This paper outlines a novel procedure combining ultrasoundand minimally invasive techniques adapted from human plastic surgeons for use in equine adipose harvests. Consistent with human tumescent lipoaspiration, equine ultrasound-guided lipoaspiration is a safe and effective technique for AT-MSC harvest and should be considered when aesthetic outcome or imminent treatmentof the injury is a primary concern. Further investigation to determine effects of lipoaspiration instrumentation, technique and tumescent interaction on equine MSC health to optimise cell viability is warranted. Analysis of MSC handling post harvest and treatment dose regimens in horses are also needed to reliably compare therapy outcomes by investigators in the future.

Rasotto Centre for Equine Studies, Animal Health Trust, Newmarket, Suffolk, UK; andCentre for Preventative Medicine, Animal been no analysis of a hopping-type forelimb lameness syndrome seen in ridden horses. The objectives of this retrospective study were to describe the clinical features of this syndrome, response to diagnostic analgesia andimaging ndings and to document post mortem ndings. Clinical records from 2002 to 2014 were reviewed and data concerning signalment, history, lame limb(s), lameness characteristics, response to diagnostic analgesia and diagnostic imaging were recorded. There were 46 horses from 4 to 13 years of age, 6 of which had a history of known or suspected trauma immediately before the onset of reduced performance or lameness. Lameness seen when ridden was characterised by an intermittent shortened cranial phase of the step of the lame forelimb at the trot and marked elevation of the head as the affected limb was protracted, with the horse appearing to 'hop '(on the contralateral limb) as if trying to break to canter. When lameness was at its worst horses were unwilling to trot. Three horses showed sporadic severe stumbling. Local analgesia of the affected limb did not improve the lameness and in 16 horses lameness deteriorated. Three of 5 horses showed some improvement (2/8 grades) in the hopping-type lameness after intra- articular analgesia of the articular process joints of the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae, ipsilateral to the lame forelimb. Radiographic, ultrasonographic and nuclear scintigraphic examinations were inconclusive. Two of 4 horses responded to treatment with gabapentin.

Introduction Historically, the equestrian world has coined the term 'bridle lameness 'to describe many forelimb lamenesses evident when a horse was ridden but not apparent under other circumstances (Dyson 2002). The implication was that this was not a pain-related problem but a training or rider-induced problem. It has become increasingly apparent that ridden exercise is an important part of lameness investigation and that there are many pain-related forelimb and hindlimb lamenesses exacerbated by riding or which may only be apparent when a horse is ridden (Dyson 2009, 2011, 2013a,2014). A hopping-type forelimb lameness, characterised by intermittent marked elevation of the head as the lame forelimb is protracted, which feels to the rider that the horse hops as if it was going to break into canter, has been previously observed (Dyson 2003, 2010a, 2013b). Affectedhorses usually show no lameness trotting lunge. The term idiopathic hopping-type forelimb lameness syndrome in ridden horses has been ascribed. There has been no detailed description of idiopathic hopping-type forelimb lameness syndrome in ridden horses. The purposes of the study were to describe the clinical features of this syndrome, response to diagnostic analgesia and imaging ndings; to record the response to treatment and document post mortem ndings in a small subset of horses. Materials and methods Horses were examined at the Animal Health Trust (AHT)between 2002 and 2014 and selected for inclusion in the study if they showed a hopping-type forelimb lameness only when ridden. All horses underwent a comprehensive clinical evaluation including palpation and manipulation (repeatedon several occasions), neurological examination, assessment moving in-hand on a hard surface, flexion tests, evaluation on the lunge on both soft (waxed sand and rubber, geltrack 1) and rm (rolled road planings) surfaces and ridden. Horses were assessed moving from the side, in front and behind. Ridden exercise was usually performed both by the normal rider and a member of the AHT staff (competent riders trained to make observations about lame horses) and in 22 horses also by the rst author (a competition rider to upper national level and British Horse Society Instructor). The influence of neck position on lameness was assessed by lungeing the horse with and without side reins (n =16), adjusted so that the horse worked to a contact (with the cranial aspect of the head approximately vertical) or a Pessoa Training Aid (n =1) and also riding the horse to a contact 'on the bit 'and on a long rein. Fit of the tack (saddle, numnahs, girth, bridle, bit and martingale [if used]) was assessed and if it was thought to t poorly it was replaced by more appropriately tting equipment. The potential in fluence of a bit was investigated by riding the horse in a hackamore (a bitless bridle). The effect of the diagonal on which the rider sat in trot on the lameness was documented. Ten horses were assessed ridden bareback to assess the potential in fluence of a girth. Lameness characteristics were documented and the lameness graded \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd30 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2016on a scale of 0 -8( 0 =sound; 2 =mild; 4 =moderate; 6 = severe; 8 =nonweightbearing) (Dyson 2011). The presence of stumbling was recorded. Most horses were assessed on several occasions and the consistency or variability in lameness assessed and documented. Video recordings were acquired of the majority of horses, which have also been reviewed retrospectively, both in real-time and slow-motion and in selected horses, frame by frame. All examinations were performed by one experienced clinician (S.J.D.), a Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons Specialist in Equine Orthopaedics. Diagnostic analgesia was performed in all lame limbs (Bassage and Ross 2010). In the forelimb with the hopping- type lameness (the lamer limb in bilaterally lame horses), sequential perineural analgesic techniques from palmar (at the base of the proximal sesamoid bones) to median and ulnar ( Table and intra-articular analgesia of the humeroradial and scapulohumeral joints were performed. In 5 horses, intrathecal analgesia of the intertubercular bursa was performed. In 5 horses with radiological evidence of osteoarthritis of the articular process joints of the fth and sixth and/or sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae, intra-articularanalgesia of the affected joint(s) was performed underultrasound guidance. The in fluence of abolition of any concurrent lameness in all limbs on the hopping-type gaitwas recorded. In the less lame limb perineural analgesia ofthe median and ulnar nerves was analgesia of the humeroradial andscapulohumeral joints. Radiographic examination was performed of the scapulohumeral (mediolateral and craniomedial-caudolateral oblique images) and humeroradial(mediolateral and craniocaudal images) joints, the sternumand cranial ribs (lateral-lateral images) and the cervical andcranial thoracic vertebrae (at least the third cervical tosecond thoracic vertebrae) (lateral-lateral images and ifabnormalities were identi ed also lateral 40 -50\u00b0ventral - lateral dorsal oblique images from left to right and from right to left) (Butler et al. 2008). Enlargement of the articularprocess joints was graded according to Down and Henson (2009): mild ( grades 2 and 3a), moderate ( and 4a) and marked ( grades 4b, 5a and b). Nuclear scintigraphic examination of the cervical and thoracic regions (from left to right and from right to left), forelimbs, ribs and sternum was performed. Bone phase images were acquired dynamically over 2 min using a 53939 cm eld of view gamma camera and general purpose collimator, using a 128 9128 matrix, 2.5 h after injection of 99mtechnetium methylene diphosphonate (1 GBq/ 100 kg bodyweight [bwt]). A motion correction programme was used to obtain static images (Hermes).2 Ultrasonographic examination of the soft tissues of the caudal aspect of the neck, shoulder region and elbow (all accessible muscles, the intertubercular bursa, supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons and collateral ligaments of the elbow) was performed using a variable frequency (8 - 12 MHz) linear array or virtual convex array transducer (LOGIQ e)3. Follow-up information was acquired by re-examination of horses and information required from owners and referring veterinarians by detailed questionnaires. Post mortem examination of the lame limb was performed in 7 horses soon after death (maximum 1 h later). In all 7 horses the examination included inspection of limb joints, muscles and the brachial plexus and cervical and cranial thoracic vertebrae; in 4 horses the cervical and cranial thoracic spinal cord and corresponding spinal nerveroots were also assessed. The muscles were dissected, cut through at multiple sites and selected samples of subscapularis muscle, triceps digital extensor collected for histology. The brachial plexus was dissected and principle nerves (the axillary, ulnar, radial, median, super cial pectoral, lateral thoracic and musculocutaneous nerves) were identi ed and preserved in formalin for histology. Samples from the same nerves of the contralateral limb were also collected for comparison.

The spinal cord was inspected, sectioned in segments (C1 - C2\u00bd,C 2 \u00bd-C3\u00bd,C 3 \u00bd-C4\u00bd,C 4 \u00bd-C5\u00bd,C 5 \u00bd-C6\u00bd,C 6 \u00bd-T2\u00bd) and its consistency carefully assessed by gentle palpationwith one nger. The spinal nerve roots were removed from the foramina and examined. Samples from each segment ofspinal cord and nerve roots were also collected for histology.In these 4 horses specimens of cerebrum, cerebellum andbrain stem were also collected. Histological sections were all stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Luxol fast blue stain was also performed onselected samples of nervous system to better visualise themyelin sheaths. Results Signalment There were 46 horses in the study, ranging in age from 4 - 13 years (mean 7.2 years /C61.3; median 6 years), in weight from 278 -728 kg (mean 549.5 kg /C632; median 574 kg) and in height from 127 -176 cm (mean 160.5 cm other n =3 n =2 [4.3%]). There were 37 (80.4%) geldings and 9 (19.6%) mares. Horses were used for general purposes (n =19, 41.3%; horses used for unaf liated competition Horses were referred for investigation of lameness or poor performance. Six (13.0%) horses had a history of known or suspected trauma immediately before the onset of reduced performance or lameness (a witnessed fall, n =4; pulling back when tied-up, n =1; found sweating and nonweightbearing, n =1). The latter horse was examined twice at an 8 months 'interval when the hopping-type lameness had deteriorated and signs suggestive of lower motor neuron dysfunction had developed (severe episodic stumbling). The duration of lameness ranged from 0.25 to 18 months in 31 horses (mean 4.5 /C60.5 months, median 4 months). In 9 horses the duration of lameness was unknown because the horses were presented for assessment of poor performance, with no prior recognition of forelimb lameness. In a further 6 horses, all of which had undergone a 5 stage prepurchase examination (BEVA and RCVS, 2011), the duration of lameness was unknown because the horses had performed poorly since immediately after purchase. Video evidence of lameness prior to the prepurchase examination was available for one of these 6 horses. Clinical observations No horse had any signi cant palpable abnormality of the lame forelimb(s). There was no obvious muscle atrophy of the forelimbs or neck and no resentment of any manipulation of the forelimbs or neck (Ross 2010). One horse with heterotopic ossication between biceps brachii and braciocephalicus consistently stood with the lame limb caudal to the contralateral limb immediately after ridden exercise (Dyson 2013b). Oral examination revealed no signi cantabnormality. Forty-four (95.7%) horses showed no forelimb lameness or neurological abnormality in hand in straight lines. Two horses with concurrent foot-related or meta- carpophalangeal joint pain showed lameness in hand, which was abolished by distal limb nerve blocks. One horse showed lameness after distal limb flexion of the lame forelimb. Thirty- (76.1%) horses showed no forelimb lameness or neurological abnormality on the lunge on soft or rm surfaces. Eleven horses (23.9%) with concurrent sources of pain contributing to forelimb lameness showed lameness on the lunge abolished by appropriate local analgesia. Two horses (4.4%) had a concurrent source of pain contributing to forelimb lameness only apparent when ridden. All horses showed a hopping-type forelimb lameness when ridden. The lameness seen ridden varied in consistency among horses and among different examination periods within horses. The worst lameness grade observed ridden ranged from 3 -7 (median 6). Twenty-two horses (47.8%) had concurrent hindlimb joint region pain; 7 horses had hindlimb lameness and an additional cause of forelimb lameness and 6 horses (13.0%) had an additional cause of forelimb lameness alone. Appropriate local analgesic techniques improved these concurrent lamenesses with little change in the hopping-type forelimb lameness seen when ridden in the majority (34/35, 97.1%). In 4 horses with foot-related pain, palmar (at the base of the proximal sesamoid bones) nerve blocks substantially improved the baseline lameness whenridden; however, intermittent hopping-type steps persisted. In 31 (67.4%) horses the rider reported that the horse was unwilling to go forward freely, despite resolution of any concurrent lameness, especially on the rein on which the hopping-type lameness was most severe. Forty horses (87%) pinned their ears back, had a facial grimace /C6flared nostrils when lameness was most severe ( Fig 1 ). The lameness seen when ridden was characterised by an intermittent shortened cranial phase of the step of the lame forelimb at the trot and marked elevation of the head as the affected limb was protracted, with the horse appearing to 'hop '(on the contralateral limb) as if trying to break to canter ( Figs 2 -4;Supplementary item videos 1 -4). Four horses did at times spontaneously break to canter. When the hopping was severe both forelimbs could be off the ground simultaneously ( Fig 1 ). The lame limb was placed to the ground more vertically than normal. The rider often felt that the horse hopped, forcing them to change the diagonal on which they were sitting. Determination of which was the lame limb was sometimes challenging to observers because of the marked elevation of the head as the lame limb was protracted and dropping of the head and neck when the lame limb was bearing weight mimicking a contralateral limb lameness. In some horses, the head was at its lowest point during load bearing on the lame limb (n =15), whereas in others the head sank lower as the nonlame limb started to bear weight (n =31). Unless the horse was observed carefully it could be construed that the horse had a bilateral forelimb lameness. The lameness often varied in degree among or within work periods; when less severe the lameness had moreconventional characteristics, facilitating identi cation of the lame limb. Despite these variations in lameness to an observer, to a rider the lameness felt consistently unilateral inhorses with unilateral forelimb lameness (n =38; left forelimb 18, lamenesses, was \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd32 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2016predominantly a swinging leg lameness when most severe; however, when less severe a typical head nod was observed when the nonlame limb was bearing weight. When severe the forelimb lameness had an effect on the hindlimb gait. On the diagonal of the lame limb during severely lame steps there was advanced diagonal placement of the hindlimb; on the diagonal of the nonlame limb there was advanced diagonal placement of the forelimb. The lameness was usually worse on turns but could vary within a work period. Interpretation was even more dif cult in horses with bilateral lameness (n =8), although one forelimb was usually the predominantly lame limb on one rein. The frequency of hopping varied; in many horses some degree of baseline lameness was always present with a variable tendency to hop, either several steps in succession or just a single step. In others the horse could take a series of apparently normal steps followed by lame steps, with or without hopping. However, in a minority of horses (n =5) on the rst day of examination only occasional hopping-type lame steps were seen but with continued work more continuous lameness became apparent and the horses became progressively less willing. In 12 (26.1%) horses lameness was only apparent on one rein. In 21 (45.6%) horses lameness was consistently worse with the lame forelimb on the outside, whereas in 17 (37.0%) horses lameness was always more severe with the lame forelimb on the inside. This was independent of the diagonal on which the rider sat. Lameness was more obvious when the horse was ridden on a long rein rather than to a contact in 9 (19.6%) horses,despite subjectively maintaining the same speed, whereas in 9 (19.6%) horses lameness was less severe on a long rein compared with ridden to a contact. Of these 18 horses, one horse consistently appeared sound when ridden to a contact but on a long rein showed lameness, whereas 3 other horses showed no lameness on a long rein but always showed lameness when ridden to a contact. Four of 17 horses with no concurrent cause of lameness showed no lameness on the lunge initially but if side reins (n =3) or a Pessoa Training Aid (n=1) were used, altering the neck posture, mild forelimb lameness was apparent. In the remaining 13 horses no lameness was seen. Three horses showed repeated or occasional severe stumbling on either the lamer forelimb or both forelimbs, only when ridden. Slow-motion video analysis showed that at times the forelimb was placed normally to the ground and then the horse had apparent loss of extensor muscle function and knuckled forwards ( Supplementary Item video 4a ) or there was hesitation before placing a foot to the ground with the horse then pitching forwards on the contralateral limb ( Supplementary Item video 4b ) or foot placement was abnormal followed by failure to extend the limb. Two horses were extremely uncomfortable in canter and were reluctant to go forwards freely, one of which had a hopping-type canter. Ten horses ridden bareback showed lameness similar to when ridden in a saddle. Replacement of ill-tting tack (n =8) did not alter the lameness. Use of a hackamore (n =12) did not in fluence the lameness. Horses with relatively mild lameness (n =3) could be improved when ridden by a more skilled rider than the owner, especially if ridden at a faster speed, but lameness was never abolished. Diagnostic analgesia Local analgesia did not alter the hopping-type gait in 28horses. In 13 horses there was improvement in lameness but a hopping-type forelimb lameness persisted after palmar (base of proximal sesamoid bones) nerve blocks, n =8;'low 4 point block ',n=1; median and ulnar nerve blocks, n =3 and intra- articular analgesia of the scapulohumeral joint, n =1. Three of 5 horses showed some improvement ( 2 grades) in the hopping-type lameness after intra-articular analgesia of the articular process joints of the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae, ipsilateral to the lame forelimb. Deterioration in the hopping-type lameness of 1 grade /C6increased frequency of lame steps was seen after nerve blocks performed in the lame forelimb in 16 (34.8%) horses ( Table 2 ). Diagnostic imaging No radiological abnormality was detected of the humeroradial joint (n =46), scapulohumeral thoracic vertebrae (n=16/17) and cervical vertebrae (n =31). One horse had a plate of heterotopic ossi cation between biceps brachii and braciocephalicus with mild increased radiopharmaceutical uptake (IRU) (Dyson 2013b). One horse had incongruity of the glenoid of the scapula and humeral head and modelling of the ventral angle of the scapula consistent with osteoarthritis, with mild IRU in the distal aspect of the scapula. There was no change in lameness after intra-articular analgesia of the scapulohumeral joint. Seven horses had mild symmetrical enlargement of the articular process joints of the f t ha n ds i x t ha n d / o rs i x t ha n d seventh cervical vertebrae, including one with spurs on the ventral aspect of the articular process joints of the fourth and fth Fig 1: This horse had an intermittent hopping-type right forelimb lameness only apparent when ridden, feeling as though it wastrying to break to canter. The horse has its ears flat back with the neck extended as the right forelimb is protracted. The nostrils areflared and the mouth is open. There is advanced diagonal placement of the left hindlimb and premature breakover of theleft forelimb, so that both forelimbs are off the groundsimultaneously. When the horse did not take lame steps the headcarriage was more normal, with the ears forward and mouth shut.The running martingale is too tight; however, the horse showedidentical when the martingale was removed. \u00a92015 EVJ VETERINARY EDUCATION images of idiopathic hopping-type forelimb lameness syndrome in ridden horses. The images were captured from a slow-motion video recording from a stride sequence of a horse with a severe right forelimb lameness characterised by markedelevation of the head and neck as the lame forelimb is protracted. There is advanced diagonal placement of the left hindlimb, while both forelimbs are off the ground. The cranial phase of the step of the right forelimb is short. The head starts to be lowered before the right front foot is loaded and continues to go down throughout the stance phase of the right forelimb and remains fairly similarthroughout the early stance phase of the left forelimb. Fig 4: Fig 3: \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd34 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2016<fth and sixth <sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae. The latter horse showed improvement in lameness after intra-articular analgesia of the articular process joints between the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae ipsilateral to the lame limb. Three horses had moderate enlargement of the articular process joints of the fth and sixth and/or sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae and 5 horses had marked enlargement of the articular process joints of the fth and sixth and/or sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae with ventral buttressing and obliteration of the intervertebral foramina, including one with subluxation of the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae (also mildly ataxic). Oblique images revealed that in only one of these 8 horses enlargement was greater on the side of the lame limb. Intra-articular analgesia resulted in partial improvement of the hopping-type lameness in 2 of 4 horses with marked enlargement of the articular process joints in which it was performed. Nuclear scintigraphy was performed in 35 horses and was negative in 28; mild IRU was identi ed in the summits of thoracic spinous processes (n =1; incidental), the navicular bones (n =2; in association with foot pain), the body of the seventh cervical vertebra (n =1; incidental), the distal aspect of the scapula (n =1; in association with radiological evidence of osteoarthritis), in heterotopic ossi cation (n =1) and there was an increased area of RU in the articularprocess joints of the sixth and seventh cervical vertebraebilaterally (n =1; incidental). Ultrasonography revealed no abnormality in 43 horses. Heterotopic ossi cation was identi ed in one horse (Dyson 2013b), focal brosis of braciocephalicus (n =1; incidental) and extensive brotic myopathy of braciocephalicus (n =1; no response to in ltration of local anaesthetic solution, therefore probably incidental). Response to treatment Lameness persisted despite prolonged periods of rest ( >1y e a r ) (n=23). No horse responded with nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (phenylbutazone [Equipalazone4]4 . 4m g / k g bwt twice daily for 1 week, followed by 2.2 mg/kg bwt twice daily for 3 weeks) (n =16). Treatment by acupuncture, physiotherapy or chiropractic manipulation performed by quali ed professionals made no difference to the lameness (n=18). An attempt to 'work through the lameness 'was =6). Intra-articular hyaluronan, 40 mg (Hylartil Vet)6into the scapulohumeral joint of 2 horses, one with radiological evidence of osteoarthritis but which showed no response to intra-articularanalgesia and a second which showed improvement in baseline lameness but no change in hopping after intra-articular analgesia and no detectable radiological abnormality, was ineffective. Three of 7 horses with radiological evidence ofosteoarthritis of the articular process joints showed temporary (up to 6 weeks) improvement in lameness after medication of the articular process joints of the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae with methyl prednisolone acetate (DepoMedrone) 6.T w oo f4 horses treated with gabapentin (5 mg/kg twice daily per os ) showed improvement in clinical signs during treatment and deterioration if medication was stopped. One horse which failed to respond after 6 weeks subsequently received 15 mg/kg bwt twice daily for 6 weeks and lameness persisted unchanged. Post mortem examination In one horse the post mortem examination of the lame limb revealed asymmetrical enlargement of the articular processjoints between the fth and sixth and sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae and ventral buttressing was con rmed, although the nerve roots at these locations were normal. However, the dorsal ganglion of the left second thoracic nerve root, ipsilateral to the lame limb, had mild multifocal lymphocytic ganglioneuritis. A similar in flammatory process was identi ed in another horse in the dorsal ganglion of theTABLE 2: Summary of deterioration in lameness after local analgesia in 16 of 46 horses with a hopping-type forelimb lameness only seen ridden Nerve block No. horses Comment Palmar (base of proximal sesamoid bones)4 One also worse after IA analgesia of scapulohumeral joint; 1 also worse after both median and ulnar nerve blocks and IA analgesia of scapulohumeral joint 'Low 4 point block ' 1 Palmar metacarpal (subcarpal) 4 Two also worse after IA analgesia of scapulohumeral jointMedian and ulnar 5 Two also IA analgesia of scapulohumeral jointIA analgesia of scapulohumeral joint 8 Including 5 worse after more distal nerve blocks IA=intra-articular. Figs 5: Dorsal ganglion of the left sixth cervical nerve root from a horse with left forelimb lameness. There is in ltration of small numbers of lymphocytes (arrows) surrounding the neuronalbodies 2016left sixth cervical nerve root, ipsilateral to the lame limb. This inflammation was associated with mild hyperplasia of the satellite cells of the ganglion ( Fig 5 ). In one horse there was mild chronic lymphocytic perivascular in flammation in the connective tissue surrounding the dorsal ganglia of the right fth and sixth cervical nerve roots, ipsilateral to the lame limb. Histological evidence of demyelination, axonal degeneration, neuronal necrosis, vasculopathy or brosis was not detected in the nerve roots, spinal cord, brachial plexus, cerebrum, cerebellum and brainstem of these horses. The fourth horse which underwent complete post mortem examination of the limb did not have obvious macroscopic or histological lesions. The macroscopic examination of the joints and muscles and macroscopic and histological examination of the brachial plexus in the remaining 3 horses only revealed the presence in one horse of a rhomboid-shaped plate of bone with very sharp edges between brachiocephalicus and biceps brachii, commonly recognised and was identi ed in 46 horses during the study period, in which approximately 3200 horses were assessed for lameness or poor performance. Although Warmbloods predominated this re flects the recent clinic population. Geldings (81.9%) were over-represented compared with theclinic population in the same period (70.0%) and horses wereyounger (mean 7.2 years, median 6 years vs. 8.6 and 8 years,respectively). Correct identi cation of the lame limb was sometimes challenging to an observer if a horse wasexamined for a short period and lameness was severe. Manyhorses showed a variable degree of lameness and with theless lame steps the head dropped as the sound limb wasbearing weight. When severe the lame limb wassubsequently veri ed by careful slow-motion analysis of video recordings. The lame limb was easily determined by a skilledrider used to identi cation of lameness. Many horses, using conventional subjective criteria for lameness assessment,super cially appeared lame on the contralateral limb and historically one author has blocked the contralateral limb rst with negative results (S. Dyson, unpublished data). Inaccordance with the results of the current study the onlychange in lameness that was seen was deterioration in thelameness when the correct lame limb was blocked.Uncharacteristic gait abnormalities masquerading aslameness have been attributed to neurological lesionscaused by equine protozoal myelitis (Foreman et al. 1990). However this study was based in the United Kingdom and no horses had been in the American continent so equine protozoal myelitis seems highly unlikely. Two horses underwent objective gait assessment using inertial measurement units (IMUs) (Robartes et al. 2013). In one unilaterally lame horse the lame limb was veri ed; in a second horse with episodic bilateral lameness of variable severity the data were inconclusive. It remains to be seen how useful IMU data will be for assessing these challenging lamenesses, especially if bilateral. In contrast to so-called bridle lameness, a lameness induced by riding related, horses with idiopathic hopping-type forelimb lameness syndrome when ridden showed many features consistent with pain. A largeproportion (67.4%) was unwilling to go forwards freely, despite resolution of other contributing sources of pain by local analgesia. Reluctance to go forwards freely when ridden is a common manifestation of lameness; when lameness is eliminated by local analgesia horses go forwards willingly, indicating that resistances are frequently pain-induced (Dyson 2013a). Horses in which the hopping-type gait was sporadic tended only to resist going forwards when the hopping-type gait was present. It appeared that these horses were experiencing severe pain when lameness was worst. Many of the horses (87.0%) exhibited a painful expression when lameness was worst ( Figs 1 -4and Supplementary Item video 2 ), with their ears back, mouth open /C6flared nostrils, consistent with pain (Dalla Costa et al. 2014). Thirty- ve per cent showed deterioration in lameness following diagnostic analgesia of the lame forelimb. A small proportion of horses were treated successfully using gabapentin, a drug used to help to control neuropathic pain in people (Baron et al. 2010). A better response may have been achieved with a higher dose in view of the limited bioavailability of gabapentin in the horse (Terry et al. 2010). Temporary improvement in clinical signs following medication of an articular process joint also supports pain as one of the underlying causes of symptoms. Lameness could not be abolished by more skilled riding, whereas with so-called bridle lameness (lameness induced by a rider because of failure toride the horse forwards properly, or unsteady hands, or the result of nonpain related resistance), lameness is resolved bybetter riding (Dyson 2002). The absence of a response to phenylbutazone does not preclude pain; human patients with neuropathic pain do not respond to nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (Vissers 2006; Dieleman et al. 2008; Baron et al. 2010). There may also be a neurological component to the lameness in some horses. What is unclear is why lameness should generally only be seen when the horses were ridden. It did not appear to be tack-related because those horses ridden bareback or with a bitless bridle showed similar clinical signs. The interaction of the muscles of the thoracic sling, caudal cervical and cranial thoracic nerve roots, rst rib and brachial plexus may be influential and may be altered by the weight of a rider. However, in the current study, individual horses were ridden by riders ranging in weight from 44 kg to approximately 65 kg with little difference in clinical signs. In some horses there was an in fluence of neck position; within individual horses changes in neck position had consistent effects. However, among other horses riding to a contact (cervical flexion) vs. on a long rein (cervical extension), had variable effects. This could be related to the site(s) of primary or referred pain. Similarly, in some horses the lameness was in fluenced by whether the lame limb was on the inside or outside of a circle but there was no consistent pattern among horses. It is speculated that the extreme elevation of the head and neck seen in some horses facilitated protraction of the lame limb while trying to minimise pain. The biomechanical differences between walk, trot and canter are clearly in fluential. In no horse was lameness detectable at the walk, a 4 beat gait in which 3 limbs are often bearing weight at any stage in the stride cycle. This is in contrast to horses with injuries of the biceps brachii or braciocephalicus muscles which may only show lameness atthe ridden walk (Dyson 2010a,c). Lameness was consistently worst in the 2 beat trot and in a small proportion of horses \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd36 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2016discomfort was clearly present in canter. Propulsion from and protraction of the lame limb induced pain, but this could be highly inconsistent from stride to stride. Some inexperienced owners had not recognised the problem as a forelimb lameness and believed that the horse was trying to break spontaneously into canter, sometimes as a re flection of their lack of riding skill. The post mortem identi cation of lymphocytic inflammation within or around the dorsal root ganglia in 3 horses cannot necessarily be considered causal; however, there is some evidence from both experimental studies (Moalem et al. 2004) and observations in human patients (Austin and Moalem-Taylor 2010) that in flammatory cells have the potential to release cytokines that may generate ectopic impulse activity in sensory neurons and so may play a role in the generation of chronic pain. In one horse the in flammation was also associated with mild hyperplasia of the satellite cells which are believed to play a role in the initiation and maintenance of neural changes that underlie neuropathic pain (Ohara et al. 2009). In the cases examined there was no histological evidence of axonal and myelin pathology. However, these types of changes are not always visible at histology and ultrastructural investigations are sometimes necessary to reveal damage to, or dysfunction of, the nerve bres (Surchev et al. 2009). Future studies might also consider the collection of samples for electron microscopy from horses presented with hopping-type forelimb lameness. In some people chronic pain is believed to be of complex aetiology and pathogenesis and the term complex regional pain syndromes has been introduced (Gierthm \u20acuhlen et al. 2014). Whether a similar syndrome exists in the horse is currently unknown. Although there was marked similarity in the clinical features among horses, there was a considerable variability in the severity of clinical signs. It would be inappropriate to suggest that there is necessarily a single unifying type of lesion. Six horses had a known history of trauma immediately prior to the onset of clinical signs, suggesting that this was an inciting cause. The presence of apparent extensor muscle dysfunction characterised by severe stumbling was a prominent feature in 3 horses and could be related to lower motor neuron dysfunction (Mayhew 2008). Radiological evidence of osteoarthritis of the scapulohumeral joint was present in one horse; the absence of any improvement in lameness after intra-articular analgesia does not preclude the joint as a source of pain contributing to lameness. Subchondral pain is not necessarily in fluenced by intra- articular analgesia (Bassage and Ross 2010). heterotopic ossi cation between biceps brachii and braciocephalicus identi ed in one horse is open to speculation (Dyson 2013b); the bone had very sharplypointed margins which would be expected to cause pain.Moreover, this was the only horse to stand abnormally afterexercise, with the lame limb caudal to the contralateral limb.Focal and extensive brotic myopathy were identi ed in 2 horses respectively but in neither was this thought likely to beof clinical signi cance; however, a mechanical component to lameness cannot be excluded de nitively. Fibrotic myopathy has previously been associated with lamenesswhich was only apparent ridden but with no hopping-typegait (Dyson 2010a,c). It has also been seen bilaterally inunilaterally lame horses in which pain causing lameness hasbeen localised to a different location (S. Dyson, unpublished data). Osteoarthritis of the caudal cervical articular process joints could potentially result in nerve root compression in the intervertebral foramina, as previously demonstrated (Ricardi and Dyson 1993). Compression of the seventh cervical nerve was con rmed post mortem in a horse with forelimb lameness associated with severe osteoarthritis of the articular process joints between the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae and between the seventh cervical and rst thoracic vertebrae (Ricardi and Dyson 1993). Nerve root compression with severe osteoarthritis has also been demonstrated using contrast- enhanced computed tomography both post mortem (Moore et al. 1992) and premortem (M. Kristoffersen, personal communication 2014). However, none of the horses in the current study showed hypoaesthesia, dermatomal sweating or neurogenic muscle atrophy which can be associated with nerve root pathology. Electromyography may have given further information (Wijnberg et al. 2004). The mechanism for deterioration of the hopping-type forelimb lameness after perineural or intra-articular analgesia in the lame limb, as seen in 34.8% of horses, is unknown. It is a common observation that if the foot is not the source of pain causing lameness, lameness may be exacerbated after desensitisation of the foot (Dyson 2010b). It has been assumed that this was the result of removal of some proprioceptive function of the foot, thereby allowing more normal loading of the limb and accentuation of pain.However, in this case series the local analgesic technique(s) that resulted in lameness exacerbation varied among horses and the deterioration was sometimes severe. Eight of the 16 horses that showed deterioration did so after intra-articular analgesia of the scapulohumeral joint. One author (S. Dyson, unpublished data) has never seen this phenomenon with other causes of forelimb lameness, despite regularly using this technique for 35 years. Intrathecal analgesia of the intertubercular bursa was not performed routinely because of previous experience of false negative results in the presence of lesions of the tendon of biceps brachii (S. Dyson, unpublished data). The bursa and its contents were evaluated ultrasonographically in all horses with negative results. No abnormalities were identi ed in the 7 horses which underwent post mortem examination. However, we cannot denitively exclude biceps brachii as a source of pain. It has a role in both protraction of the forelimb and in the stance phase, contributing to the stay apparatus by its continuation as lacertus brosus that blends with extensor carpi radialis (Watson and Wilson 2007). Malfunction could potentially impair both forelimb protraction and the stance phase, contributing to stumbling. The presence of lameness only during ridden exercise highlights the potential importance of observing horses ridden at all paces during a prepurchase examination. It is notable that in the current study 6 horses had performed poorly from immediately after purchase, despite having undergone a prepurchase examination. In conclusion, idiopathic hopping-type lameness syndrome in ridden horses may be a pain-related condition or conditions with a neurological component in some horses and which currently has a guarded prognosis. Identifying the lame limb(s) can sometimes be confusing because of theeffects on head and neck movement. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd37 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2016Authors 'declarations of interest No competing interests have been declared.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate potential distribution of local anaesthetic solution following injection of radiodense contrastmedium as performed for a mid-pastern ring block. Twelve mature horses were used and 1.5 ml radiodense contrast medium injected over the medial or lateral palmar digital nerve at the level of the proximal aspect of the ungular cartilages. A dorsal ring block was performed on the ipsilateral side, 1.5 cm proximal to the palpable palmar aspect of the proximal eminence of the middle phalanx, using 2 or 5 ml contrast medium. Both forelimbs were injected on 2 days (48 injections). Four standard radiographic views of the pastern were obtained immediately, 10 and 20 min after injections. Images were analysed subjectively and objectively. After dorsal injections, the contrast medium was distributed in a diffuse patch over the ipsilateral half of the proximal phalanx (P1), extending proximally over the half of the length of P1 in all limbs (greatest proximal extension: 89.0% of the length of P1 [from distal] after 2 ml, 94.2% after 5 ml). There was signi cant proximal diffusion in the rst 10 min after injection and signi cant dorsal diffusion between all time points (P <0.01). There was signi cant positive association between injected volume and the proximal extension of the dorsal contrast patch (P =0.01). The median dorsal diffusion was to the dorsal midline of P1; 5 ml contrast medium resulted in signi cantly greater dorsal diffusion than 2m l( P <0.01). The dorsal and palmar contrast patches did not merge. In conclusion, diffusion to the proximal aspect of P1 following a mid-pastern ring block may occur even if only 2 ml of local anaesthetic solution is used. Introduction Palmar nerve blocks at the base of the proximal sesamoidbones (abaxial sesamoid nerve blocks) are traditionally performed if palmar digital nerve blocks do not result in improvement or abolition of lameness. It has previously been shown that abaxial sesamoid nerve blocks can improve fetlock region pain (Dyson and Murray 2006; Nagy et al. 2009). In certain clinical situations (e.g. racehorse and endurance horses), it can be crucial to differentiate foot pain from fetlock region pain and the clinician may not have access to, or the time for, advanced diagnostic imaging of the entire distal aspect of the limb to rule out potentially career or even life-threatening injuries of the fetlock region. Inthese situations the clinician has to make a decision based on clinical ndings and the results of diagnostic analgesia and basic diagnostic imaging techniques (i.e. radiography and ultrasound). A mid-pastern ring block added to palmar digital nerve blocks is believed to desensitise the entire footwithout in fluencing fetlock region pain and is therefore advocated by some clinicians. However, to date, the potential diffusion of local anaesthetic solution following a mid-pastern ring block has not been assessed. Moreover, textbooks describe different volumes of local anaesthetic solution and different techniques for a dorsal ring block (Bassage and Ross 2010; Baxter and Stashak 2011; Moyer et al. 2011). The aim of this study was to document distribution of 2 different volumes of radiodense contrast medium following injection performed as for a mid-pastern ring block. We hypothesised that the larger, but not smaller, volume would diffuse up to the proximal quarter of the proximal phalanx and that both volumes would cover the region of the dorsal nerve branches in the mid-pastern region. Materials and methods Twelve mature client-owned horses with no current lameness were included in the study. A written informed consent had been obtained from the clients. There were 7 Thoroughbred racehorses and 5 Arabian horses used for endurance riding. Physical restraint (nose twitch or lip chain) was used when necessary and no horses were sedated for the procedure. Two injections were performed in all forelimbs to mimic a real-life situation where a dorsal ring block is performed following palmar digital nerve blocks. All injections were performed by the same clinician (R.M.) with the limb held off the ground. Perineural injection of the palmar digital nerve was performed rst: 1.5 ml of radiodense contrast medium (iohexol: Omnipaque 300)1was injected using a 23 gauge 1.6 cm needle. The needle pointed distally and was inserted at the level of the proximal aspect of the ipsilateral ungular cartilage. The dorsal ring block ( 'dorsal injection ') was performed 1.5 cm proximal to the palpable palmar aspect of the proximal eminence of the middle phalanx. This distance was determined by the width of the index nger of the clinician, which measured 1.5 cm. A 20 gauge 2.5 cm needle was inserted just dorsal to the neurovascular bundle pointing dorsally and advanced subcutaneously towards the dorsal aspect of the limb. Injection of contrast medium was started when the needle penetrated the skin and continued until the needle was inserted to its full length. In the rst horse, \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd40 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 20163 ml contrast medium was injected in the left forelimb and 6 ml in the right forelimb. Dif culties were encountered when injecting the larger volume and clinically and radiographically both volumes resulted in a large patch covering the ipsilateral half of the pastern. Therefore, in subsequent horses, either 2 (routinely used by R.M.) or 5 ml contrast medium was used. The rst horse was excluded from statistical analysis. On Day 1, injections were performed in the medial or lateral side of the left forelimb (randomly selected) and on the contralateral side of the right forelimb. Apart from the rst horse, 2 ml contrast medium was used for dorsal injection in the left forelimb and 5 ml (apart from the rst horse) used in the right forelimb. On Day 2, the contralateral side of each forelimb was used: 5 ml contrast medium was used for the dorsal injection in the left forelimb and 2 ml in the right forelimb. On Day 2 the bleb resulting from the dorsal injection was massaged and on Day 1 no manipulation was performed. Forty-eight hours elapsed between injections on Days 1 and 2. Lateromedial, dorsopalmar (DPa), dorsolateral- palmaromedial and dorsomedial-palmarolateral oblique radiographic views of the pastern were obtained immediately and 10 and 20 min after injection2. Horses stood squarely with the third metacarpal bones in a vertical position. The distribution of the contrast medium was described subjectively and objectively by the same analyst (A.N.), who was unaware of the injected volume. The proximal and distal extensions of the contrast patch of the dorsal injection were measured onthe DPa view, from the level of the most distal aspect of the intercondylar depression of the proximal phalanx 3. To account for the differences in the size of the pastern among horses, the length of the proximal phalanx was measured on the DPa view as the distance between the distal aspect of the sagittal groove and distal aspect of the intercondylar depression. The proximal extension of the contrast patch was also determined as a ratio related to the size of the pastern (the proximal extension measured from the intercondylar depression divided by the length of the proximal phalanx). To account for potential slight differences in the position of the limb when obtaining subsequent radiographs, the length of the proximal phalanx was also measured on each subsequent DPa view. The dorsal extension of the contrast patch was measured on the DPa radiograph from the dorsal midline (de ned as the line between the most distal aspect of the sagittal groove and most distal aspect of the intercondylar depression of the proximal phalanx) to the greatest medial/lateral extension of the contrast patch. The width of the proximal phalanx was measured at the level of half of the length of the above described dorsal midline. To account for differences in size of the proximal phalanx among horses and limbs, a ratio was established between the dorsal diffusion measurement and half of the width of the proximal phalanx (to demonstrate the relation of the dorsal contrast patch to dorsal midline). The proximal extent of the palmar contrast patch was measured from the ipsilateral distal abaxial aspect of the proximal phalanx. A ratio was also established by dividing the proximal extent of the contrast patch by the length of the ipsilateral aspect of the proximal phalanx (measured between the most medial/lateral aspects proximally and distally). Repeatability of measurements was assessed 3 times on 10 radiographs. To investigate the pattern of the distribution of contrast medium seen on radiographs, injections were performed in 2cadaver limbs. A mixture of methylene blue and radiodense contrast medium (1:1) was used. For perineural injection of the palmar digital nerve, 1.5 ml of the mixture was injected as described above. In one limb, 2 ml mixture was used for the dorsal injection in the lateral side of the limb and in the other limb 5 ml was injected in the medial side of the limb. Radiographs were obtained as in live horses and limbs dissected. Normality of data was assessed using a Shapiro-Wilks test4. The proximal and distal extensions of the dorsal and palmar contrast patches, respectively, between subsequent radiographs were compared using a paired ttest or a Mann- Whitney U test, depending whether or not the data were normally distributed. A Mann-Whitney U test was used to test whether there was a difference in proximal and dorsal diffusion between limbs where different volumes had been injected and between limbs that had been massaged or not massaged. A Mann-Whitney U test was also used to compare median diffusion between left and right limbs and medial and lateral sides. Data were categorised (proximal extension [from distal] <60%; 60 -75%; >75% of the length of the proximal phalanx) and associations between diffusion and volume, massage, injection site (medial vs. lateral) and limb were also assessed using a Chi-square test. Statistical signi cance was set at P <0.05. Results The mean age of the horses was 9.5 years (median: 9, range: 4-16), the mean height 159.8 cm (median: 160.5, range: 150 - 166) and the mean weight 473.3 kg (median: 469, range: 393-571). The procedure was well tolerated by most horses. In general, more horses showed discomfort and resistance when the larger volume was used for the dorsal injection than the smaller volume. One of the horses that resisted the dorsal injection developed mild swelling the day after injection, which resolved within a few days. No lameness or pain was observed in any of the horses following injections. Repeatability of measurements was con rmed; the coef cient of variance was 3%. Dorsal injection The basic pattern of distribution of the contrast medium was similar in all limbs. On lateromedial radiographs there was a diffuse patch extending over the dorsal aspect of the proximal phalanx ( Figs 1a and 2), regardless of the injected volume. On the oblique view highlighting the dorsal aspect of the contrast patch, there was a thick radiopaque line dorsal to and parallel with the dorsal aspect of the proximal phalanx with a relatively radiolucent area between this line and the proximal phalanx ( Fig 1b ). On the DPa view there was a diffuse patch superimposed over the proximal phalanx and also a thick radiopaque line abaxial to and parallel with the abaxial aspect of the proximal phalanx on the side where the contrast medium had been injected (Figs 1c and 3). In most limbs there were numerous horizontal and oblique radiolucent lines crossing the contrast patch, suggesting distribution around blood or lymphatic vessels ( Figs 1 -3). The contrast patch often extended palmar to the palmar aspect of the proximal phalanx, but not as palmar as the palmar contrast patch and not in a pattern that would indicate distribution in or around the neurovascular bundle. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd41 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2016The pattern of the contrast patch did not change with time; however, on radiographs obtained 20 min after injection, the de nition of the margins of the patch was less well de ned than on previous radiographs.In all limbs the contrast patch extended proximally over the level of the half of the length of the proximal phalanx. The proximal extension expressed as the % of the length of the proximal phalanx after injection of different volumes of contrast medium is shown in Table 1 . There was signi cant proximal diffusion with time when the proximal extension of the contrast patch was compared between the radiographs obtained immediately and 10 min after injection (P <0.01); no signi cant difference was seen between measurements at 10 and 20 min. The larger volume resulted in signi cantly greater proximal diffusion of the dorsal contrast patch than the smaller volume (P=0.01). Massaging the subcutaneous bleb of the dorsal injection did not affect either dorsal (P =0.08) or proximal diffusion (P =0.94). The dorsal diffusion, expressed as the percentage of half of the width of the proximal phalanx after injection of different volumes of contrast medium, is shown in Table 2 . In one limb the dorsal contrast patch remained abaxial to the proximal phalanx; this limb and the rst limb in which 3 and 6 ml of contrast medium had been injected were excluded from measurements and analysis. Injection of 5 ml contrast medium resulted in signi cantly greater dorsal diffusion than injection of 2 ml and there was signi cant dorsal diffusion between all time points (P <0.01). After injection of 2 ml contrast medium, the contrast patch reached the dorsal midline in 11/22 (50.0%) of limbs immediately after injection, 12/22 (54.5%) limbs at10 min and in 14/22 (63.6%) limbs at 20 min. After injection of 5 ml contrast medium, the contrast patch reached the dorsal midline in 16/23 (69.6%) of limbs immediately after injection and in 18/23 (78.3%) limbs at 10 and 20 min.

There were radiopaque lines of various thicknesses extending proximally and palmar from the dorsal contrast patch in 36/48 (75%) limbs on the radiographs obtained immediately after injection and in 40/48 (83.3%) limbs on radiographs obtained 10 and20 min after injection. When these lines were present, they were also seen on subsequent radiographs and often merged with the radiopaque lines extending from the palmar contrast patch. Palmar injections Detailed description of distribution of contrast mediumfollowing perineural injection of the palmar digital nerve is published elsewhere (Nagy and Malton 2015); only principle ndings and results related to a mid-pastern ring block are presented here. In one limb radiographs were not distal enough to allow accurate measurements of the palmar contrast patch. The contrast patch extended proximally up, or proximal to, the level of the ipsilateral aspect of the proximal interphalangeal joint in 19/47 (40.4%) limbs on the DPa radiograph obtained immediately after injection, in 24/ 47 (51.1%) limbs at 10 min and in 25/47 (53.2%) at 20 min. The maximum proximal diffusion recorded on a radiograph obtained 20 min after injection of contrast medium was to the 25.1% of length of the proximal phalanx (measured from distally). The palmar contrast patch did not merge with the dorsal contrast patch in any limbs. Numerous radiopaque lines of varying thicknesses extended proximally from the palmarcontrast patch in 41/48 (85.4%) limbs on the radiographs obtained immediately after injection, in 45/48 (93.8%) limbs on the 10 min radiographs and in 46/48 (95.8%) limbs on the 20 min radiographs.Cadaver limbs The contrast medium was distributed in the same pattern onthe radiographs as in live horses. Dissection revealed that methylene blue was diffusely distributed subcutaneously over the ipsilateral half of the proximal phalanx, without accumulation around any speci c structure. The dye was distributed in a larger area than had been expected based on the radiographs. The methylene blue from the palmar injection was diffusely distributed in a patch just axial to the ipsilateral ungular cartilage. The dorsal branch of the palmar digital nerve was located just dorsal to the palmar digital vein and surrounded by methylene blue in both limbs. Methylene blue was also seen in numerous lymphatic vessels, extending from both contrast patches into the metacarpal region. Discussion This is the rst study to document potential diffusion of local anaesthetic solution following a mid-pastern ring block. The radiographic appearance suggested that the contrast medium was diffusely distributed over the ipsilateral aspect of Fig 3: Dorsopalmar radiograph of a front pastern region obtained immediately after subcutaneous injection of 2 ml contrastmedium at mid-pastern level as a dorsal ring block on themedial aspect of the pastern (dorsal contrast patch) andperineural injection of 1.5 ml of contrast medium of the medialpalmar digital nerve at the level of the proximal aspect of theungular cartilage (palmar contrast patch, small arrow). The dorsalcontrast patch extends into the lateral half of the proximalphalanx (large arrowheads). The contrast medium isaccumulated in a thick radiopaque line parallel with the medialaspect of the proximal phalanx (large arrows). There are severalne radiolucent lines within the contrast patch, likely representing vascular structures. The radiopaque lines medial to the middlephalanx (small arrowheads) indicate contamination of hair withcontrast medium following needle removal.

The needles havebeen left in position for the radiograph. The dorsal contrast patchextends over the dorsal aspect of the middle phalanx. There areseveral radiopaque lines extending proximally from both contrastpatches in lymphatic vessels. \u00a92015 EVJ VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE JANUARY 2016the proximal phalanx, without accumulation around any speci c structure. Dissection con rmed diffuse subcutaneous distribution of the methylene blue and contrast medium. The area covered by methylene blue was larger than the size of the contrast patch on the radiograph. Diffusion of contrast medium may underestimate diffusion of a thinner material, but it is also possible that a small amount of contrast medium (half of that had been used in live horses) distributed in a large area was not radiopaque enough to be clearly visible on the radiographs. One hypothesised aim of a dorsal ring block is analgesia of nerves which innervate the dorsal aspect of the foot. An additional aim of the ring block when performed at the mid- pastern region, is to provide analgesia of the foot and pastern region whilst reducing the risk of inadvertently, partially or entirely, desensitising the fetlock region. This is awell-recognised limitation of an abaxial sesamoid or basisesamoid nerve block (Dyson and Murray 2006; Daniel et al. 2013; Schumacher et al . 2013). There was greater dorsal diffusion after injection of 5 ml contrast medium than afterinjection of 2 ml. If the clinician wishes to desensitise all small dorsal nerve branches, there may be a greater risk of missing some branches in the dorsal aspect of the pastern if using 2 ml local anaesthetic solution than if a larger volume is used. However, this may be dependent on the injection technique. In the current study, the needle was inserted to full length from just dorsal to the neurovascular bundle and no additional needle insertions were made. If one wishes to restrict the amount of local anaesthetic solution used while ensuring a full ring block, a needle may be inserted at an additional more dorsal site. Contrary to some textbook gures, the dorsal branch of the palmar digital nerve runs just dorsal to the palmar digital vein in the pastern region (Getty 1975; Sack 1975). There are several smaller nerve branches on the dorsal aspect of the pastern, most originating from the dorsal branch of the palmar digital nerve. According to Sack (1975) the majority of these branches are super cial and although they give some deep branches to supply the dorsal pouches of the metacarpophalangeal and the proximal interphalangeal joint, they do not innervate deep structures in the foot or structures distal to the coronet. The dorsal branch of the palmar digital nerve runs on the lateral aspect of the ungular cartilages (Sack 1975) distal to the coronary band. These observations make it questionable whether a dorsal ring block provides additional analgesia of the foot following palmar digital nerve blocks. The anatomical study by Sack (1975) provides the most detailed information aboutinnervation of the distal aspect of the limb to date. However, it was based on equine fetuses and results might not be fully extrapolated to sensory innervation of the adult equine limb. Until further studies are performed to establish detailed sensory innervation of the adult foot, one can only speculate based on these results. Many clinicians massage the skin blebs of a subcutaneous ring block in order to increase local diffusion. Our results do not support that massage has an effect on either proximal or dorsal diffusion of the injected material. The palmar digital nerves and their dorsal branches run parallel and in relatively close proximity to each other in the mid-pastern region; in the dissected limbs this distance was approximately 1 -1.5 cm. The close proximity of the 2 nerves in a great part of the pastern region may indicate that if a palmar digital nerve block is performed proximal to the ungular cartilages, diffusion of local anaesthetic solution may desensitise the dorsal branch of the palmar digital nerve. Moreover, the dorsal branch receives one or more reinforcing branches from the palmar digital nerve in the pastern region (Sack 1975), which may also make analgesia of the dorsal branch by palmar digital nerve blocks possible. In agreement with our hypothesis, 5 ml of contrast medium resulted in signi cantly greater proximal diffusion than 2 ml. However, even the smaller volume extended up to the proximal 20% of the proximal phalanx in some horses. In this region the dorsal branches of the palmar metacarpal nerves and a deep branch of the medial palmar digital nerve from the middle of proximal phalanx that innervate the dorsal proximal aspect of the proximal phalanx can be desensitised (Sack 1975). Therefore, a dorsal ring block using even a relatively small volume of local anaesthetic solution may improve pain originating from the proximal aspect of theproximal phalanx and this possibility appears greater when using a larger volume. Signi cant proximal diffusion onlyTABLE 1: The mean, median, minimum and maximum proximal extension expressed as the % of the length of the proximalphalanx on radiographs obtained immediately, 10 and 20 minafter injection of radiodense contrast medium Time All 2 ml 5 ml Immediately Mean /C6s.d. 69.5 /C69.8 65.8 TABLE 2: The mean, median, minimum and maximum dorsal diffusion expressed as the % of the half of the width of theproximal phalanx at mid-pastern level on radiographs obtained immediately, 10 and 20 min after injection of radiodense contrast medium Time All 2 ml 5 ml Immediately Mean /C6s.d. EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2016occurred in the rst 10 min following injection. However, the margins of the contrast medium often faded by 20 min, which may have in fluenced the measurements. Therefore it cannot be excluded that local anaesthetic solution may diffuse more proximally after 10 min, resulting in desensitisation of a more proximal region of the proximal phalanx. A dorsal ring block at the level of the proximal aspect of the ungular cartilages has been described (Moyer et al. 2011). This technique is expected to result in less proximal diffusion and therefore a smaller possibility of in fluencing pain in the proximal aspect of the proximal phalanx. In our experience, a subcutaneous ring block in this location is more difcult to perform than more proximally at mid-pastern level. Moreover, there may be a greater risk of inadvertent penetration of the coronary plexus or the large dorsal pouch of the distal interphalangeal joint; however, these risks have not been investigated. Perineural injection of the palmar digital nerves was performed in order to assess the relation of the dorsal contrast patch to the contrast patch around the palmar digital nerves. The 2 patches did not merge in any limb, even when parts of the contrast medium of the 2 patches were seen at the same level proximodistally. In none of the limbs did the palmar aspect of the dorsal patch extend as palmar as the palmar contrast patch; however, contrast medium was seen palmar to the proximal phalanx in some limbs. Local anaesthetic solution may diffuse to a greater degreethan the contrast medium and therefore analgesia of the palmar digital nerve at the level of the dorsal ring block cannot be excluded. Radiopaque lines extending proximally from both contrast patches were regularly observed, similarly to those seen in previous studies (Nagy et al. 2009, 2010; Nagy and Malton 2015). The radiographic appearance and their presence on subsequent radiographs suggested distribution in lymphatic vessels, which was con rmed on dissection. Limitations Different sites for a dorsal ring block were not considered in this study and we assessed 2 volumes, which may not re flect the preference of all clinicians. We made all efforts to standardise the injection site and tried different methods to dene mid-pastern level. A location related to the palmar aspect of the middle phalanx appeared to be the most reliable and repeatable site, despite not taking into account the size differences between pasterns. The proximal palmar eminence of the middle phalanx was not always easy to palpate accurately, which may have led to some inaccuracy. However, the same variability is expected in clinical situations. The differences in size and number of horses were considered not high enough to allow investigation of theeffect of the size of the horse/pastern on diffusion of contrast medium. A 2.5 cm needle may not have been sufcient to deposit contrast medium in the dorsal aspect of the pastern in larger horses. In the study population a longer needle was not used because it would have penetrated the skin when inserted at full length. Iohexol is thicker and its chemical and physical characteristics (including osmolality) are different from those of local anaesthetic solutions; therefore this study may underestimate the diffusion of local anaesthetic solution.Conclusions Diffusion to the proximal aspect of the proximal phalanxfollowing a mid-pastern ring block may occur even if a small (2 ml) amount of local anaesthetic solution is used. This smaller volume may not be suf cient to desensitise all dorsal nerve branches. The close proximity of the dorsal branch of the palmar digital nerve to the main branch and lack of evidence for other dorsal branches contributing to innervation of the dorsal aspect of the foot (other than the coronary band) makes justi cation for a dorsal ring block for analgesia of the foot alone, questionable. Its use at the mid-pastern level as a better alternative to palmar (abaxial sesamoid) nerve blocks warrants further investigation.

Lindegaard* Department of Large Animal Sciences, University scale; pain behaviour; pain face Summary Pain management is dependent on the quality of the pain evaluation. Ideally, pain evaluation is objective, pain-speci c and easily incorporated into a busy equine clinic. This paper reviews the existing knowledge base regarding the identi cation and quanti cation of pain in horses. Behavioural indicators of pain in horses in the context of normal equine behaviour, as well as various physiological parameters potentially useful for pain evaluation, are discussed. Areas where knowledge is sparse are identi ed and a new equine pain scale based on results from all reviewed papers is proposed. Finally, the most important considerations in relation to the implementation of a pain scale in a hospital setting are discussed. Introduction Modern equine medicine and surgery have advanced tremendously over the last decades, resulting in highly advanced treatments and surgical procedures. Although both anaesthesia and surgery have progressed concomitantly with a focus on balanced anaesthesia,multimodal analgesia and minimally invasive surgery, some of the procedures performed will inevitably cause moderate to severe pain. Reducing pain to a minimum ensures animal welfare and improves convalescence, consequently resulting in optimised treatment success (Bisgaard et al. 2001; Sellon et al. 2004). However, in order to successfully alleviate pain it is necessary to be able to recognise it and this might pose a greater challenge. Pain is de ned as an emotional experience, consequently rendering objective pain evaluation extremely dif cult (Rutherford 2002) and to date, no universal equine pain scale has been developed. One of the challenges is the subjective nature of the phenomenon in question: what is 'no pain '; what is the magnitude of 'maximum pain 'or'worst imaginable pain 'and what are the levels in-between? Pain evaluation in man is facilitated by the ability of the patient to communicate verbally on the quality, location and intensity of pain. However, self-report is not an option when assessing pain in infants or animals. Consequently, pain detection and quanti cation in these individuals depends on the ability of an observer to detect potentially pain-related changes in behaviour and physiological parameters of the individual in question. In order to make the pain evaluation as objective and consistent as possible, it is imperative to: (i) determine which behaviours and physiological parameters may be associated with pain, (ii) systematise observations of these signs, (iii) specify the degree of pain related to a certain type of behaviour and (iv) combine these observations into a quantitative score, useful for estimating pain intensity overtime; thereby determining any potential need for analgesic treatment and detecting the effects of this treatment. Ashley et al. (2005) stated that, 'An ideal pain scoring system needs to be linear, weighted, sensitive to pain type, breed- and species-speci c, less dependent on observer and closed to misinterpretation. 'However, in reality it is very difcult to construct a pain scale to ful l all these criteria. Adding usability makes it even more unattainable and, in the authors 'opinion, this is an extremely important factor. If a pain-scoring tool is not easily incorporated into a daily routine, it will not be of use in a busy hospital setting and will therefore help neither clinician nor horse. The preconditions must therefore be altered to focus on capturing the most pain-speci c response measures for the equine species and incorporating these in a systematic and easy-to-use pain scale. Detailed knowledge of both normal and pain behaviour in equids is imperative in the construction of a useful pain scale. Great research effort has contributed to identifying speci c behaviours and physiological parameters associated with painful conditions or experiences (Ashley et al. 2005). Some of the rst reports on systematic recognition and registration of behaviours associated with pain included comprehensive registrations of time budgets for various behaviours for horses undergoing surgery in comparison to healthy controls and horses anaesthetised for nonpainful procedures (Raekallio et al. 1997; Price et al. 2003; Pritchett et al. 2003). These studies have formed the basis for further investigation into pain evaluation of horses in the clinic. Registration of certain physiological parameters is compulsory in the clinic and heart rate (HR) in particular is often stated as being closely correlated to pain. However, several studies have concluded that, in general, physiological parameters are weakly associated with pain and that behavioural changes are often easier to evaluate and considered more pain-speci c (Raekallio et al. 1997; Price et al. et al. 2011; Pader et al. 2011; Gleerup et al. 2014). The present review will guide the reader through normal horse behaviour, pain-related behaviour, pain-related physiological parameters and how these can be used for pain evaluation in horses. Finally, we suggest how pain evaluation can be incorporated as a standard in the equine clinic. Normal horse behaviour The horse is a herbivorous, grazing species that originally lived in herds and relied on flight as its primary defence against predators. The equine species has survived feeding on \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd47 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2016EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2016grasslands with low nutritional value, requiring an extreme alertness and adaptability to new environments and potential threats, thus demanding selection for very perceptive animals (Miller 1995b). Aggression is not very frequent in feral horses and is primarily mild and based on subtle communication signals and ritualised displays. This is possible when living in stable groups with a dominance hierarchy and where appropriate skills can be learned by the young horses (Fureix et al. 2012a). To survive on harsh grassland, the horse 's gastrointestinal system has developed to allow for many hours of feeding on roughage of low dietary value as well as continual movement. This 'natural 'behaviour is obviously disturbed in the domesticated horse, as domesticationnecessitates adjusting to con ned spaces as well as an insecure flock structure with constantly changing peers. Behaviour of the domesticated horse is therefore highlyinfluenced by housing and training conditions. Domesticated horses are often fed meals of high energy substrate, resulting in periods of hunger leaving the horsesrestless and thus displaying food-seeking behaviour. Pawingcan be observed, as can aggression towards neighbours,head nodding and mouth movements. These behavioursmay also be seen in conjunction with pain and this is whystarvation prior to surgery is an important considerationwhen evaluating pain in animals in the immediate postoperative period. Horses prefer to eat from the floor, mimicking their normal grazing position, which facilitates thewidest possible visual eld over the pasture. Horses will raise their head often while eating, even when they are in a box-stall, probably because this position will facilitate thedetection of distant predators (Sweeting et al. 1985). When fed on the floor, horses will paw in their hay, perhaps to select the most palatable feed. In feral horses, pawing isperformed in order to remove obstacles (e.g. snow) whilefeeding or to expose roots of plants where only the root isingested (Feist and McCullough 1976). Stabled horses spendaround 50 -70% of their time feeding if roughage is available ad libitum , which is similar to observations in feral horses (Sweeting et al. 1985). Resting constitutes around 25% of their time (Mayes and Duncan 1986). Horses rest with their head lowered, their ears to the sides or forward and one hindlimb resting and at the end of a resting period horses may yawn and stretch. When horses are not feeding or resting, they are alert or moving (Feist and McCullough 1976). Pain evaluation is most often conducted in a box-stall environment, with the nonpained horse generally occupied by eating roughage, drinking, eating concentrate, resting/ sleeping or being attentive to the surroundings (Raekallio et al. 1997; Price et al. 2003; Pritchett et al. 2003). Generally, horses prefer to stand at the front or in the middle of the box- stall in order to follow activities in the stable and, if possible, interact with humans or neighbour horses (Price et al. 2003; Pritchett et al. 2003). In a hospital setting, the horse may consider unfamiliar people (i.e. vets and nurses) as potential predators and avoiding predators is a high priority behaviour overriding the awareness of pain (Caine 1992). Consequently, pain evaluation is most successful when performed by people familiar to the horse; whilst maintaining an appropriate distance from the horse or by use of video- observation. It should also be noted that an unfamiliarenvironment (i.e. the hospital), sedation or the presence of anaesthetic drug residues can affect the behaviour of thehorse in relation to pain evaluation (Seibert et al. 2003). The propensity to flee as an instinctive reaction to dangerous or harmful situations is evident even in the domesticated horse, as this trait is fundamental to the survival of the equine species (Miller 1995a). Pain-related behaviour Pain is a protective mechanism, helping horses to survive.Acute pain will induce withdrawal or even attempts to escape in order to reduce injury and will lead to future avoidance of the painful stimulus, while subacute pain encourages protection of the wounded area to aid healing(Bateson 1991). Behaviour therefore illustrates experienced pain, making it a suitable measure for pain evaluation. For the horse experiencing pain, there seems to be some general changes in behaviour, regardless of the type of pain. This general pain behaviour might then be accompanied by more pain-speci c behaviours and possibly by changes in physiological parameters. Examples of pain behaviours related to speci c pain types include decreased weightbearing in relation to orthopaedic pain (Jones et al. 2007; Bussieres et al. 2008; Lindegaard et al. 2010), as well as pawing, flank watching and rolling in relation to colic pain (Mair and Smith 2005; Graubner et al. 2011; Sutton et al. 2012). General pain may be expressed as restlessness or as depression with decreased physical activity ,decreased appetite and a diminished interest in socialisation (Raekallio et al. 1997; Price et al. 2003; Pritchett et al. 2003). Furthermore, pained horses tend to stand with their head lowered; not resting or foraging (Raekallio et al. 1997; Pritchett et al. 2003; Lindegaard et al. 2010). Horses in pain tend to spend more time at the back of the box-stall (Jones et al. 2007) and show no interest in their surroundings. This was characteristic for a group of riding school horses which Fureix et al. (2012b) speculated may be depressed. These depression-like symptoms may be caused by pain as Hall et al. (2013) described a group of horses as 'lazy 'and suggested that they were suffering low grade pain as it is recognised that chronic pain and depression are very closely interlinked in man (Bair et al. 2003). Another known pain- related behaviour is self-mutilation, which is a normal behavioural response to intense or chronic pain from various sources such as limb pain, gastric ulcers, urogenital problems, etc. (McDonnell 2008). Whenever horses display changes in attitude and/or performance, it may be that pain is the underlying cause. A well known example of this is the reduced quality performance in horses with pain originating from the vertebral column (Jeffcott et al. 1982; Girodroux et al. 2009; Jonckheer- Sheehy et al. 2012). Rearing when ridden may be an expression of pain in horses with problems of the vertebral column, neck or back. A rearing horse will often be interpreted as a disobedient horse, yet it may in fact be displaying avoidance behaviour. Only a careful clinical investigation may reveal the true source of the problem (Jonckheer-Sheehy et al. 2012). Another less common example of pain-induced behavioural changes in horses is referred pain caused by in flammation of the urogenital tract. By viscerosomatic convergence, this in flammation causes hyperalgesia of the flanks, which in turn may lead to poor performance or unwillingness to work (Christoffersen et al. 2007; Lindegaard et al. 2009). \u00a92015 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2016Poor performance and unwillingness to work may, however, also develop into aggression if pain is not diagnosed and treated in time (McDonnell 2005) and aggression should therefore always be considered an important indicator of pain. Aggressive prefeeding behaviour and increased pawing in anticipation of feed can be seen in horses with gastric ulcerations, possibly due to the acidic milieu in the ventricle (Andrews et al. 2005; Malmkvist et al. 2012). Aggression is also seen in conjunction with chronic painin horses with severe vertebral problems (Xie et al. 2005; Fureix et al. 2010) and in horses with hoof pain. Mansmann et al. (2011) showed that horses that required sedation in relation to farriery had a mild and/or chronic problem that was not believed to cause signi cant pain but the sedation was no longer required after corrective shoeing resulted in improved gait and resolution of the foot pathology. Horses tend to be sincere in their behaviour, which means that if a certain type of behaviour is induced by a painful condition, this behaviour quickly returns to normal when pain is eliminated (McDonnell 2005). This was clearly demonstrated in horses with presumed bit-induced pain, causing behavioural problems like fear, flight, aggressiveness and head shaking, as these problems improved or resolved after substituting the bitted bridle with a bitless bridle (Cook 2003). Aggression may, however, also be linked to the skills of the rider causing signal confusion or in flicting pain by the use of unsuitable training techniques such as devices for applying positive punishment (McLean and McGreevy 2010). Negativeassociations are apparently stronger than positive associations for horses and aggression towards man is a good predictor of reactions in other situations. This may explain why horses react very strongly in relation to saddle tting or riding when suffering from of gastric ulcers, chronic lameness or head and dental pain (Fureix et al. (2012a). Accordingly, pain is a very common cause of changed behaviour in horses and should always be ruled out as a primary cause of behavioural changes like aggression and/or poor performance. Facial expressions of pain The most recent advance in the recognition of subtlebehavioural changes associated with pain is the investigation of facial expressions. Our group has described the equine pain face for horses subjected to acute somatic pain as consisting of six different features (Gleerup et al. 2014). Dalla Costa et al. (2014) investigated the pain face of horses undergoing routine castration and developed the Horse Grimace Scale, consisting of six features in three levels. The two descriptions of the facial expressions of pain in the horse are very similar; the expressions are summarised in Table 1 and Figure 1 . Although training and practice are necessaryto effectively recognise and potentially quantify the facial cues of pain, many clinicians already use these cues subconsciously and unsystematically in the evaluation of pain.

(Photos Karina B.Gleerup). \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd49 EQUINE parameters in equine pain scales A number of physiological parameters ( Table 2 ) are often referred to as being signi cantly correlated with the degree of pain. The best example is HR, which historically has been believed to have an almost linear correlation to equine pain in general and colic pain in particular. Many of these physiological parameters are therefore included in some pain scales ( Table 2 ). In relation to pain, HR increased with pain in some horses (Pritchett et al. 2003; Bussieres et al. 2008; Lindegaard et al. 2009), respiration rate (RR) increased in patients with induced synovitis (Bussieres et al. 2008) and noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) increased in horses with induced synovitis and in horses with induced somatic pain (Gleerup et al. 2014). Serum cortisol has a signi cant correlation to pain (Raekallio et al. 1997; Pritchett et al. 2004; Bussieres et al. 2008); b-endorphins had a positive correlation to pain in horses after arthroscopy (Raekallio et al. 1997), whereas no correlation is found between serum amyloid A and pain (Pader et al. 2011). In horses with colic and other moderate to severe disease, HR, RR and blood pressure may well be affected by pain but may also be altered by endotoxaemia, cardiovascular compromise and/or dehydration. This might also be the case for other hospitalised horses where the effects of bleeding, drug treatment and/or anaesthesia may affect physiological parameters. These 'insults 'might all in fluence HR, RR, blood pressure, serum cortisol and cathecholamine levels. Furthermore, it may be necessary to stress the animal in order to measure physiological parameters as these are generally obtained in more or less invasive manners including bloodsamples or tail cuffs (for NIBP). In addition to the invasive nature of the sampling, test results may not be available until the result is no longer relevant with regards to analgesic decision making and treatment. This limits the utility of physiological parameters for pain evaluation in clinical cases where horses present with disease. Physiological parameters might, however, be useful for clinical experimental studies with many xed parameters, crossover designs or repeated measures where decision making on analgesic treatment is not the primary goal of the analyses. Pain evaluation methods Analgesic testing Analgesic testing is routinely used by most clinicians as regional/local or intrasynovial in ltration of local anaesthetics for lameness localisation. However, this method will not be discussed here. Another, perhaps underused method for pain recognition is systemicanalgesic testing. With this type of test, the horse is treated systemically with an analgesic (NSAID, opioid or similar) in order to determine whether an altered or unwanted behaviour might be associated with a painful condition. This type of analgesic testing mainly applies to horses with poor performance or riding problems where no obvious diagnosis can be established. In these horses, training under analgesic treatment might be introduced in order to evaluate whether the poor performance or riding problems are pain-induced. If the poor performance or pain behaviour is reduced or eliminated after the treatment (and speci cally if it recurs after the effect of the treatment TABLE 2: Physiological outcome measures reported in relation to pain Physiological parameters Correlation to pain Pain type Source Heart rate Correlated Post operative (colic) Acute synovitisAcute pain (somatic)Pritchett et al. 2003 Bussieres et al. 2008 Lindegaard et al. 2009 Graubner et al. 2011 Not correlated Post operative (arthroscopy) Acute pain (somatic)Post operative (colic)Post operative (ovariectomy)Raekallio et al. 1997 Price et al. 2003 Gleerup et al. 2014 Sellon et al. 2004 Pader et al. 2011 Respiratory rate Correlated Acute synovitis Bussieres et al. 2008 Not correlated/ poorly operative Post operative (colic)Acute pain (somatic)Post operative (colic)Post operative (ovariectomy)Price et al. 2003 Graubner et al. 2011 Gleerup et al. 2014 Sellon et al. 2004 Pader et al. 2011 Noninvasive blood pressure Correlated Acute synovitis Acute pain (somatic)Bussieres et al. 2008 Gleerup et al. 2014 Serum cortisol Correlated Post operative (arthroscopy) Post surgical (colic) Acute synovitisRaekallio et al. 1997 Pritchett et al. 2003 Sellon et al. 2004 Bussieres et al. 2008 Serum endorphins ( b-endorphin) (arthroscopy) Raekallio et al. 1997 Intestinal sounds Not correlated Post operative (colic) Acute synovitisRaekallio et al. 1997 Sellon et al. 2004 Bussieres et al. 2008 Rectal temperature Not correlated Acute synovitis Acute pain (somatic)Bussieres et al. 2008 Gleerup et al. 2014 \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd50 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2016a clear vision for something better.

Brief Summary (For Full Prescribing Information, see package insert) CAUTION: Federal (USA) law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian. DESCRIPTION: Clodronate disodium is (dichloromethylene) salt and is manufactured from the tetrahydrate form. INDICATION: For the control of clinical signs associated with navicular syndrome in horses. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Horses with hypersensitivity to clodronate disodium should not receive OSPHOS. WARNINGS: Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. HUMAN WARNINGS: Not for human use. Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children. Consult a physician in case of accidental human exposure. PRECAUTIONS: As a class, bisphosphonates may be associated with gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. Sensitivity to drug associated adverse reactions varies with the individual patient. Renal and gastrointestinal adverse reactions may be associated with plasma concentrations of the drug. Bisphosphonates are excreted by the kidney; therefore, conditions causing renal impairment may increase plasma bisphosphonate concentrations resulting in an increased risk for adverse reactions. Concurrent administration of other potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be approached with caution and renal function should be monitored. Use of bisphosphonates in patients with conditions or diseases affecting renal function is not recommended. Administration of bisphosphonates has been associated with abdominal pain (colic), discomfort, and agitation in horses. Clinical signs usually occur shortly after drug administration and may be associated with alterations in intestinal motility. In horses treated with OSPHOS these clinical signs usually began within 2 hours of treatment. Horses should be monitored for at least 2 hours following administration of OSPHOS. Bisphosphonates affect plasma concentrations of some minerals and electrolytes such as calcium, magnesium and potassium, immedi - ately post-treatment, with effects lasting up to several hours. Caution should be used when administering bisphosphonates to horses with conditions affecting mineral or electrolyte homeostasis (e.g. hyper-kalemic periodic paralysis, hypocalcemia, etc.). The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in horses less than 4 years of age. The effect of bisphosphonates on the skeleton of growing horses has not been studied; however, bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity which impacts bone turnover and may affect bone growth. Bisphosphonates should not be used in pregnant or lactating mares, or mares intended for breeding. The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in breeding horses or pregnant or lactating mares. Bisphosphonates are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of months to years. The extent of bisphosphonate incorporation into adult bone, and hence, the amount available for release back into the systemic circulation, is directly related to the total dose and duration of bisphosphonate use. Bisphosphonates have been shown to cause fetal developmental abnormalities in laboratory animals. The uptake of bisphosphonates into fetal bone may be greater than into maternal bone creating a possible risk for skeletal or other abnormalities in the fetus. Many drugs, including bisphosphonates, may be excreted in milk and may be absorbed by nursing animals. Increased bone fragility has been observed in animals treated with bisphosphonates at high doses or for long periods of time. Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption and decrease bone turnover which may lead to an inability to repair micro damage within the bone. In humans, atypical femur fractures have been reported in patients on long term bisphosphonate therapy; however, a causal relationship has not been established. ADVERSE REACTIONS: The most common adverse reactions reported in the eld study were clinical signs of discomfort or nervousness, colic and/or pawing. Other signs reported were lip licking, yawning, head shaking, injection site swelling, problem is most likely due to an undiagnosed painful condition. However, analgesic testing in this way may also be employed for horses with depression, reduced food intake or other subtle signs of reduced wellbeing where a thorough clinical examination does not lead to a diagnosis. Nevertheless, it should be noted that this 'test 'has a good speci city in case of improvement but a poor sensitivity as pain cannot be ruled out if the analgesic testing is negative; this might simply be the result of a drug which is inef cient for the speci c type of pain in question, insuf cient dosing and/or insuf cient duration of the test. Mechanical nociceptive threshold testing Another very simple method for pain evaluation includestouching or pressing an area in order to determine whether the horse reacts. More objective methods involving this principle include the use of pressure algometers in studies with backpain (Haussler and Erb 2006) and von Frey laments for analgesic testing after epidural treatment in an experimental setting (R /C19edua et al. 2002; Lindegaard et al. 2009). These methods may be very useful for research purposes, objectively comparing sensitivity or hyperalgesia after different painful procedures or different analgesic treatments (Love et al. 2011). Methods (including simple palpation) to quantify the degree of soreness of a potentially painful area have been incorporated into various pain scales in both small and large animals (Holton et al. 2001; Bussieres et al. 2008; Graubner et al. 2011). The level of the reaction elicited by palpation does not necessarily correlate with the level of pain experienced when the area is left untouched and should therefore be interpreted with caution. However, pain in relation to palpation is important information, for example if palpation or manipulation is painful, the analgesic treatment regime may be changed or local analgesics implemented in relation to wound treatment, dressing changes, etc. Pain scoring scales In order to perform the best possible pain evaluation, onecannot rely on any single behavioural trait or physiological parameter and therefore an abundance of different pain scales have been developed for different species and situations. The most commonly applied methods for painassessment in humans are the Visual Analogue Scale of Pain Intensity (VAS or VASPI) and the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), where patients themselves score their perceived pain intensity in a very simple way. With the VAS, the patient has a 100 mm ruler with the text 'no pain 'at one end and 'worst imaginable pain 'at the other end. The patient then determines her or his perceived pain and marks it somewhere in-between the endpoints; on the back of the ruler, the corresponding pain score can be read as a score between 0 and 100. The NRS and various types of face pain scales are set up in a similar fashion, with more or less well dened endpoints and midpoints on a scale with pain scores between 0 and 10. When applying any of these methods to animals (including horses) or people that lack the ability to communicate, the task of pain scoring obviously has to be undertaken by an observer. However, since these scales only include de nitions of the two endpoints 'no pain 'and 'worst imaginable pain ', the evaluation is extremely dependent on the observer 's own perception of behaviour and his or her previous training withregards to pain scoring. Consequently, different observers will reach different scores for the same patient and situation (known as poor interobserver agreement). This makes these scales inappropriate for a hospital setting with several different observers evaluating the same patient. However, the VAS and NRS scales show good intraobserver agreement and may therefore be useful for owner observations of the same horse over a prolonged course of treatment (Hielm-Bj \u20acorkman et al. 2011). To make a pain scale suitable for hospital use, it should therefore be based on speci c and clearly de ned indicators of pain. The most straightforward type of scale to ful l this criterion is the Simple Descriptive Scale (SDS). An SDS generally ranges from 0 to 4 or 5, with each grade de ned as speci cally as possible in order to improve objectivity and interobserver agreement. An example of an SDS familiar to most equine clinicians is the AAEP lameness scale. It is obvious to most clinicians that this scale has certain shortcomings, as not all components of lameness are covered by the scale and an overlap can occur (i.e. a horse can ful l the criteria of more than one lameness grade). In addition, lameness can only be graded at a trot and theinterobserver agreement is generally poor (Lindegaard et al. 2010). Similar problems exist for any single SDS applied for pain evaluation since the numerous behavioural components displayed by horses in pain are not easily tted into a single ve grade scale. The studies describing the use of SDS for pain evaluation in horses are presented in Table 3 . A single SDS for pain evaluation will thus result in poor inter- and intraobserver agreements. Consequently, substantial effort has been aimed at developing pain scales using several behavioural and physiological parameters that have been identi ed to increase in magnitude or frequency in horses experiencing pain. This type of scale is called a Composite (Measure) Pain Scale (CMPS/CPS). The CMPS is basically a combination of several Simple Descriptive Scales, each describing one speci c behavioural or physiological parameter in four or ve clearly de ned grades. Each SDS is evaluated individually and subsequently all scores are summed up to yield one nal pain score. An overview of the studies describing equine pain scales of the composite type, in addition to the studies applying them, is presented in Table 4 . The majority of these are based TABLE 3: A list of studies that have applied simple descriptive scales (SDS) developed for a speci c purpose/pain type in horses Pain scoring system Source Application Multiple simple descriptivescalesJochle et al. 1989; 152 horses with abdominal pain Simple descriptive scale of aversivebehaviour (0 -5)Fjordbakk and al. 2011Clinical laminitis Simple descriptive scale (0 -3)Lindegaard et al. 2009 Love et al. 2011Hot iron branding and microchiptransponder injection.

(2003), outlining the behaviours of horses post surgery, post anaesthesia, as well as healthy controls. As described, the composite scales differ in content but, more importantly, they differ in the way they quantify pain. The pain scales described by Sweeting et al. (1985), Jochle et al. (1989), Sutton et al. (2012) and Bussieres et al. (2008) are nonweighted, meaning that all parameters are gradedequally and are thereby considered to be of equalsigni cance; while in other scales, the different parameters are weighted according to the perceived signi cance, thereby attributing extra importance to more pain-speci c parameters and less importance to other parameters. Raekallio et al. (1997) and Pritchett et al. (2003) described a weighted CMPS, including eight behavioural parameters and one physical intervention (lifting the leg), graded in 2 -4 levels on a 1 -4 grade scale. This scale has been applied to horses undergoing exploratory celiotomy and ovariectomy(Sellon et al. 2004; Pader et al. 2011). The scale has also served as inspiration for the scales developed by Lindegaard et al. (2010) and Graubner et al. (2011). Lindegaard et al. (2010) aimed at further developing the scale for horses with orthopaedic pain and further weighted the included parameters, grading them in 3 -5 levels on a scale ranging from 0 -4. The highest possible score (4) in this scale is reserved for only severe signs of pain de ned as: continual gross pain behaviour (tooth-grinding, lip-curl, pawing, sweating, etc.), nonweightbearing on one limb and severe orthopaedic pain on the subjective pain score. The subjective pain score was adopted from (1997) and was included to allow for observation of the face and attitude of the horse, which is argued to be included (consciously orsubconsciously) by most clinicians when performing daily informal pain evaluations. Graubner et al. (2011) described the 'Post abdominal surgery pain assessment scale '(PASPAS) for evaluating pain in horses after emergency laparotomy.

The interobserver reliability was good but it was concluded that validity, reliability and clinical utility of the scale should be investigated further and it was suggested that the physiological measures be excluded for improved reliability. The majority of the above mentioned pain scales have been developed and used for monitoring induced or clinical pain, mainly in university hospital settings. Discussion From the studies presented here, we may infer that using anSDS with only one parameter included for pain scoring is fairly susceptible to personal error or interpretation whencompared to the robustness of a combined CMPS with well dened categories. This has been con rmed by the development of numerous different composite scales that have all proven useful in the evaluation of pain in horses with various pain types over several studies (Pritchett et al. 2003; Bussieres et al. 2008; Lindegaard et al. 2010; Graubner et al. 2011; Sutton et al. 2012). One important difference between these scales is whether or not physiological parameters areincluded. The idea of including physiological parameters istheoretically well founded but has limited success in severalof these studies. The fact that disease manifestations likeendotoxaemia, cardiovascular status, stress and dehydrationhave a signi cant impact on physiological parameters could explain the poor correlation with pain seen in most studies(Raekallio et al. 1997; Price et al. 2003; Graubner et al. 2011). Palpation of the painful area is included in some of thescales, although it is reported to be poorly correlated with thetotal pain score after laparotomy (Graubner et al. 2011). However, this response contains important information inrelation to dressing changes or other procedures concerningthe painful area. As this intervention may be stressful and painful for the horse if carried out repeatedly to monitor pain progression, interventions should be restricted to the clinical examination so as to reduce the frequency and thereby the inconvenience to the patient. Weighting of the parameters was also incorporated in some scales and we consider this weighting highly relevant since some parameters are considered more pain-speci c than others. This weighting is mainly based on clinical experience and empirical knowledge of the signs of severe pain, though since these signs are well recognised in horses, it presumably constitutes a valid estimate. The consensus view is that behavioural parameters are the most useful pain indicators for pain evaluation in horses. Several composite pain scales are based primarily on behaviour and are reported to be simple to use and successful in differentiating between horses with a) b) Fig 2: Gross pain behaviour. a) The horse is in pain and displaying 'mouth playing '. b) The horse is experiencing abdominal pain and is stretching. (Photos Karina B.

Gleerup). \u00a92015 / AE / JANUARY 2016and without pain. Furthermore, pain evaluation based on behavioural parameters does not demand expensive equipment, in flicts no pain or stress on the animal and the result is available immediately. Applicability and future perspectives The overall goal of pain evaluation is alleviating pain forimproved welfare, optimal healing and convalescence. Pain has been referred to as the fth vital sign. It has therefore been suggested that it should be monitored just as often as temperature, HR, RR and blood pressure in order to improve analgesic treatment in man. There is good reason to believe that similar improvements are necessary for our equine patients. This includes prioritising pain monitoring in hospitalised horses. For the individual patient, repeated pain evaluations will make it possible to visualise changes over time, thereby facilitating adjustments of the analgesic treatment in time to maintain pain under an acceptablelevel. Horses admitted for elective and/or minor surgery should be evaluated for pain on a daily basis, while horses subjected to acute or major surgical procedures (including for example horses with traumatic wounds with or without surgery, colic horses and neurological patients) should be more frequently evaluated. If horses are admitted for behavioural changes, they should be evaluated in accordance with the history, e.g. in relation to feeding or riding, etc. Executing repeated pain assessments calls for a pain- scoring tool that is quick and easy to use: van Loon et al. (2010) concluded that the CMPS described by Bussieres et al.(2008) was a promising pain evaluation tool and the pain- scoring time of 10 min was speci cally highlighted as an advantage. However, spending 10 min for every evaluation is not feasible in a busy hospital setting where they are performed frequently. The risk of noncompliance is high and the stress load on the animals following the repeated physical interventions is signi cant. It is important to balance the collection of useful information against the negative impact inflicted on the patient. Although pain evaluation research in horses has been aimed at developing speci c pain-scoring tools for speci c patient groups, it is evident when reviewing the literature that the same behavioural measures are included in composite pain scales, independent of whether they are applied to horses suffering pain of somatic or visceral origin ( Table 5 ). It would therefore appear to be more advantageous to focus all energy on the validation of one robust pain scale, rather than attempting to differentiate between pain types. In summing up the conclusions from all the excellent work conducted thus far on pain evaluation in horses, we propose a composite pain scale that seeks to consider all experiences from previous studies. In summary, the following categories describe the behavioural parameters included in the majority of the reviewed pain scales: gross pain behaviour, activity level, position in the stall, posture/demeanour, weightbearing, a) b) Fig 4: Posture and weight bearing. a) The horse is standing in the back of the box-stall, it is pinched, it displays low head bearing,abnormal weight distribution and a pain face (numbersaccording to Equine Pain Scale, Table 5). b) The horse is lame onthe left front limb and displays no weight bearing, abnormalweight distribution and a pain face.

(Photo Karina B.Gleerup) \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd55 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2016head position, head movement, attention towards the painful area, interactive behaviour and appetite. We have collected these parameters in a proposed common pain scale, the Equine Pain Scale (EPS). The EPS is constructed as a weighted composite pain scale with the above mentioned behavioural parameters but since most pain scales also include an evaluation of either subjective pain or some facial features, the equine pain face is also included in the scale. The EPS is presented in Table 6 and Figures 2 -5. This scale has not yet been tested or validated in this particular form, butwe hope that we and other groups will have the opportunityto work with and validate this scale in the near future.Despite this shortcoming, we consider this scale has thepotential to become a valuable tool for pain evaluation formany equine clinicians. It is quick and easy to use, as painevaluation in one patient can be executed in approximately2 min ( Supplementary items 1 and 2). With a usable pain scale like the proposed EPS, pain scoring may beimplemented as a routine procedure by placing the form onthe stall door and ideally having just one person that isresponsible for lling it in at given predetermined times. Where possible, it may be an advantage if veterinary nursesor technical staff are responsible for the pain evaluations, asthey often spend more time with each animal in the stallcompared to the veterinarians. Conclusion Focus on pain evaluation is important in continuing to improve welfare and outcomes for our equine patients. We propose a new Equine Pain Scale that incorporates and weights knowledge obtained from previous studies within this eld. We have speci cally omitted physiological parameters due to their invasiveness, poor speci city and the potential for a delayed result. However, we do recognise that physiological parameters may be valuable in a research setting. Using any of the reported CMPS pain scales will unequivocally lead to improved pain management in the equine clinic. However, the use of one basic pain scale for all patients, which can be executed within 2 min, will simplify pain scoring. Maintaining simplicity in pain scoring methods may improve compliance of pain evaluation, thereby potentially optimising pain management for all our patients.

J. R. Crabtree Equine Reproductive Services (UK) Limited, Old Malton, UK.Corresponding author email: james.r.crabtree@gmail.com Clinical scenario In practice, clinicians are commonly presented with mares reportedly behaving 'badly' either persistently or at regular orirregular intervals. This behaviour is often presumed by theowners or riders to be due to their mares being in oestrous ortheir reproductive hormone balance. Undesirable behaviour isvaried and includes an unwillingness to respond to riderinstruction or signals, bucking, rearing, overt reproductivebehaviours, aggression and stallion-like (Hedberget al . 2007a; Kamm and Hendrickson 2007; Crabtree 2011). It is assumed that when considering these behavioural problems,the behaviour in question has been confirmed by the clinicianto be temporarily associated with the oestrus cycle or withovarian pain and not musculoskeletal, soft tissue, gastric ordental pain. The question has been refined to exclude thosebehavioural issues experienced due to the presence ofgranulosa cell tumour (GCT; Crabtree 2011). These criteriadefine the population of mares for the question, 'canovariectomy on grounds of behaviour be justified?' Thequestion is not an ethical one, rather whether or not behaviourcan be improved with surgery. Search strategy Pubmed/Medline (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed),the University of Liverpool electronic library search(http://www.liv.ac.uk.ezproxy.liv.ac.uk/library) and IVIS(http://www.ivis.org): ovariectomy AND mare AND behaviour.Hand searching of references in all articles identified and thosewithin the author's knowledge was conducted. In addition arequest for references and opinions was made via a privateworldwide equine reproduction e-mail network. Quantity of evidence Sixteen, 41 and 18 papers were retrieved respectively;relevance screening was conducted based on abstractsidentifying 3 papers applicable to the question in the last 30years. Of the 3 papers there was one randomised controlledtrial (Hedberg et al . 2007b) and 2 (Hooper et al . 1993; Kamm and Hendrickson 2007). Quality of evidence The study by Hooper and co-workers (1993) looked retrospectively at 23 cases of bilateral ovariectomy between1984 and 1990 by client survey. Of the 23 cases, 16 were for thepurpose of behaviour modification and 7 were for otherreasons not including ovarian pathology. Kamm andHendrickson (2007) reported the results of a retrospective studyof 35 cases between 1996 and 2005 by client survey. Thereported data included both bilateral and unilateralovariectomy with the latter being due to ovarian pathology.Twenty-three mares had bilateral ovariectomy for behaviouralproblems. These retrospective observational studies, based on client opinion, represent relatively weak evidence; in additionthey are inherently biased. The study by Hedberg andco-workers (2007b) primarily looked at the effect of ACTH(tetracosactide) on steroid hormone levels in 5 intact vs. 5ovariectomised mares. The mares acted as their own controlsand the study was conducted in successive years (2003-2004).Of the parameters measured, oestrous behaviour wasassessed by daily teasing with a stallion. Teasing behaviour wasassessed using a standardised protocol and scored. Thisprospective case-control design has greater evidentiary valuethan the retrospective study despite the low numbers. Teasingscores however , were not subject to statistical analysis andremained observational. This paper formed part of a greaterwork which looked at the adrenal response to ACTH betweennormal and 'problem' mares (Hedberg . implications Hedberg and co-workers (2007b) demonstrated that ovariectomy resulted in continued displays of sexualreceptiveness in all mares with a loss of normal cyclic activity.Ovariectomised mares showed more days of oestruscompared with when they were intact; 44 days of oestrus for allintact mares compared with 152 days for all ovariectomisedmares during the study period. One ovariectomised mareshowed 78 consecutive days of oestrus. This finding is supportedby the author's experience and earlier published observationsthat ovaries are not essential for oestrus behaviour in the mare(Asa et al . 1980; Wesson and Ginther 1981). Hooper and co-workers (1993) reported that 35% of mares demonstrated continued oestrus behaviour. In 9% of cases thiswas judged to be 'objectionable' by the owners. Of 12performance mares, 10 were judged to be competing atgreater than preoperative levels. In the report by Kamm andHendrickson (2007) 22% of owners reported that they wereeither impartial or dissatisfied mainly due to a failure ofbehavioural change following surgery. More generalisedbehavioural problems were more likely to be corrected withan ovariectomy than more specific behavioural issues.Aggressive behaviour and a generalised disagreeabledemeanour were most commonly corrected (86 and 81%respectively), followed by excitability (75%), kicking and biting(73%), and problems during training that related to oestrus-likebehaviour (72%). Problems with other horses and frequenturination were less likely to be improved after surgery (64%).None of the studies addressed the concept of ovarian pain asa cause of subtle behavioural issues encountered in riddencompetition horses. Clinical message The current data would suggest that if the undesirablebehaviour which prompts presentation is normal sexual \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd58 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JANUARY 2016There are no known contraindications to the use of intramuscular Adequan\u00ae i.m. brand Polysulfated Glycosaminoglycan in horses.

In fact ovariectomy may make thesituation worse as oestrus behaviour may become irregularand/or persistent post surgery. If the behaviour is aggressive incharacter then ovariectomy is more likely to be a successfultherapy but the evidence for this is weak. If ovarian pain isconsidered as a cause of abnormal behaviour then inducingovarian inactivity via the use of a GnRH vaccine may be aviable option that does not require surgery, however , maresvaccinated against GnRH will also demonstrate oestrusbehaviour (Dalin et al . 2002). Future studies with accurate definition of the cause, or characteristics of, the behaviourwith matched controls may enable a more definitive answerto the question.
