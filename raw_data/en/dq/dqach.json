At such moments we must open ourselves to healing. Much we can do for ourselves; and what we can do we must do- healing, no less than illness, is participatory. But even when we do all we can do there is, often, still much left to be done. And so we turn as well to our healers seeking their skill to aid in our struggle for wellness. But even when they do all they can do thereis, often, still much left to be done. And so we turn to Life, to the vast Power of being that animates the universe as the ocean animates the wave, seeking to let go of that which blocks our healing. -Anonymous Many days have passed now, and while my future remains uncertain, there exists within me apeacefulness that enables me to live. meaningfully joyously fully.
