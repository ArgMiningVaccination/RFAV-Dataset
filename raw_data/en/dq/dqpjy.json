Here is an at-a-glance overview of those vaccines and recent developments of candidates in clinical trials. - 12 January 2022 - 73 min read - by [Gavi Staff](/vaccineswork/authors/gavi-staff) Recent updates - Around the world, there are now 137 COVID-19 vaccine candidates undergoing clinical trials and 194 candidates in pre-clinical development. - An oral vaccine developed by DreamTec Research Limited, a Hong Kong based biotechnology company, has completed [a study](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT05057923)which found that the technology team has succeeded engineering Bacillus subtilis with spore coat proteins resembling the proteins of the nucleus and spikes of coronal virus. This product could have a vaccine like activity within the intestinal environment. This is one of the first examples of a bacterial vector vaccine. When candidate vaccines make it to [human clinical trials](/vaccineswork/how-clinical-vaccine-trials-are-speeding-pandemic), they first go through phase 1 trials primarily to test the vaccine's safety, determine dosages and identify any potential side effects in a small number of people. Phase 2 trials further explore safety and start to investigate efficacy on larger groups. Phase 3 trials, which few vaccines ever make it to, are much larger, involving thousands or tens of thousands of people, to confirm and assess the effectiveness of the vaccine and test whether there are any rare side effects that only show up in large groups. The final stage, phase 4 trials, is conducted after national regulatory approval and involves further monitoring in a wide population over a longer timeframe as a form of post-marketing surveillance (pharmacovigilance). However, not all vaccines that have been approved for domestic are in phase 4 trials. Regulators in many countries have their own individual procedures and timelines for providing emergency use authorisations, relying on various types of evidence at different clinical trial phases. Some national regulators, including those in Russia and China, began approving vaccines for (limited or widespread) public use even before phase 3 trials were completed. The World Health Organization (WHO) [lists](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines) candidates at various stages of clinical trials. Here is a more in-depth look at the candidate vaccines that are in phase 1 trials or beyond. Have you read? Filter the different clinical phases - 4 - - MEDIGEN (TAIWAN) PROTEIN SUBUNIT VACCINE Taiwan-based vaccine maker Medigen have produced a two-dose vaccine made of a combination of spike proteins and an adjuvant from Dynavax. The company began phase 2 trials in adults in late January 2021. In July, a phase 2 trial started on people aged 12 to 18 years old. In the same month, a phase 3 trial was authorised to be carried out in Paraguay. On 19 July, this vaccine was authorised for emergency use in Taiwan. A [phase 2 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05054621)was registered on 23 September 2021 to assess the immunogenicity of heterologous prime-boost immunization with AstraZeneca/University of Oxford (AZD1222) vaccine and Medigen (MVC-COV1901) vaccine in adults. The trial has plans to recruit 110 participants and is due to be completed in August 2022. The company started [a phase 4 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05097053)on 7 October to measure the level of antibodies produced in adults in order to demonstrate the immunogenicity and safety of the company's vaccine as a booster dose. [A phase 4 clinical trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05097053)started on 7 October 2021 to measure the anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody titers in adult participants in order to demonstrate the immunogenicity and safety of a third booster dose with Medigen's COVID-19 vaccine. - MODERNA (USA) RNA VACCINE The Moderna vaccine is also known as Spikevax or mRNA-1273. It was funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which is part of the US National Institutes of Health. The vaccine is administered in two doses with four weeks apart. It was tested in phase 1 trials on volunteers at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. Moderna has run phase 2 trials on participants of a wide range of ages and started phase 3 trials in July 2020. The final trial enrolled 30,000 healthy people from across the United States. In February, [a phase 4 trial](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04760132?term=vaccine%2C+phase+4&cond=Covid19&draw=2&rank=1)was launched as part of a national cohort study in collaboration with the Danish Ministry of the Interior and Health. The United States currently authorises its use for people 18 and older, while the [Europe Medicines Agency](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/covid-19-vaccine-spikevax-approved-children-aged-12-17-eu)authorised giving it to children aged 12 to 17 years in July. A [phase 2 study](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04969263)was carried out in August 2021 to elicit an antibody response in kidney transplant recipients who have failed to respond to two doses of vaccine. This vaccine needs to be kept in refrigerators, or freezers for longer storage. The Faculty of Medicine Ramagthibodi Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand, under the sponsorship of the National Research Council of Thailand, registered [a phase 3 trial](https://www.thaiclinicaltrials.org/show/TCTR20211102003)in November 2021 to study the immunogenicity of an additional dose of either viral-vectored or mRNA vaccine in kidney transplant recipients. Another [phase 3 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05119855)was registered in November 2021 to study the safety and immunogenicity of 9-valent HPV co-administered with Moderna's [phase 1 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05132855)was registered in November 2021 with the aim to determine the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of heterologous 3rd booster of mRNA and COVID-19 vaccines, including Pfizer/BioNTech's BNT162b2, Moderna's mRNA-1273 and Medigen's MCV COVID-19 vaccine. A [phase 3 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05142319)started in October 2021 to to compare short and long-term immunogenicity of different COVID-19 vaccine combinations against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 as well as different variants of concern. Involving 600 participants, the trial is due to be completed by April 2023. In November 2021, the company registered [a phase 2 study](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05137236?term=NCT05137236&draw=2&rank=1)to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the company's mRNA-1283 COVID-19 vaccine boosters to boost antibody responses to the ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2 virus, the B.1.351 variant, and potentially other SARS-CoV-2 variants. - ASTRAZENECA/UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD (UK) The AstraZeneca vaccine is administered in two doses. It was developed by the University of Oxford, and has been granted emergency use authorisation by the European Medicines Agency, [the WHO](https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2021/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-authorised-for-emergency-use-by-the-world-health-organization.html)as well as national regulators worldwide. This vaccine is fridge-stable meaning that it can be easily transported anywhere in the world. At about US$ 4 per dose for lower-income nations, it is also being made available for a fraction of the cost of others . It was tested in phase 3 clinical trials with more than 10,000 people from across the UK, including children and older people. The vaccine was also tested in Brazil, the United States and India and South Africa started the first COVID-19 vaccine trial in Africa. In February 2021, a phase 4 trial was launched as part of a national cohort study in collaboration with the Danish Ministry of the Interior and Health. A [phase 2/3 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05059106)was started on 1 June 2021 to study the effectiveness, safety and immunogenicity of a half dose of the vaccine. On 27 September 2021, the company registered a [phase 4 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05057897)to assess the immunogenicity and safety of the vaccine for prevention of COVID-19 in immunocompromised adults. [A phase 2 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05087368)was registered on 21 October 2021 to compare the immunogenicity and safety of heterologous and homologous booster schedules in individuals who received AstraZeneca's ChAdOx1-S or Sinovac's CoronaVac vaccination previously. With plans to enrol 520 participants, the study is due to be conducted from 1 December 2022. [A phase 1/2 study](https://www.thaiclinicaltrials.org/show/TCTR20211102006)was registered in November 2021 to evaluate and compare the safety and immunological response of the third dose of AstraZeneca's ChAdOx1 vaccine and Pfizer's mRNA vaccine. The Faculty of Medicine Ramagthibodi Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand, under the sponsorship of the National Research Council of Thailand, registered [a phase 3 trial](https://www.thaiclinicaltrials.org/show/TCTR20211102003)in November 2021 to study the immunogenicity of an additional dose of either viral-vectored or mRNA vaccine in kidney transplant recipients. [A phase 1/2 study](https://www.thaiclinicaltrials.org/show/TCTR20211102006)was registered in November 2021 to evaluate and compare the safety and immunological response of the third dose of AstraZeneca's ChAdOx1 vaccine and Pfizer's mRNA vaccine. The Faculty of Medicine Ramagthibodi Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand, under the sponsorship of the National Research Council of Thailand, registered [a phase 3 trial](https://www.thaiclinicaltrials.org/show/TCTR20211102003)in November 2021 to study the immunogenicity of an additional dose of either viral-vectored or mRNA vaccine in kidney transplant recipients. A [phase 1/2 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05133609)was registered on 24 November 2021. The longitudinal study will include health professionals and patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) who will receive the AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, to assess the safety, efficacy and duration of the short- and long-term humoral and cellular immune response after vaccination and compare the vaccine response between individuals who have or have not had previous COVID-19 infection. A [phase 1 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05132855)was registered in November 2021 with the aim to determine the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of heterologous 3rd booster of mRNA and COVID-19 vaccines, including Pfizer/BioNTech's BNT162b2, Moderna's mRNA-1273 and Medigen's MCV COVID-19 vaccine. In March 2021, the University of Oxford registered a further [phase 1 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04816019)in the UK with 30 adult participants to investigate the delivery of its ChAdOx1 vaccine using a nasal spray. ChAdOx1 is currently being delivered by intramuscular injection as part of the UK's national rollout. By using a different technique that administers the vaccine to the site of infection, researchers at Oxford intend to [investigate](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-03-25-university-oxford-study-nasal-administration-covid-19-vaccine)whether this results in enhanced protection, especially against transmission and mild disease. On 27 June, a new [phase 2/3 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04973449)was carried out to demonstrate the safety and characterise the immunogenicity of the Beta variant vaccine, called AZD2816. A [phase 2/3 study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00499-5/fulltext)result was published on 29 November 2021. Aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the AstraZeneca's SII-ChAdOx1 vaccine in adults in India, the study found that the vaccine has a non-inferior immune response compared to the company's AZD1222 vaccine and an acceptable safety/reactogenicity profile. [A phase 2 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05162482?term=vaccine&type=Intr&cond=COVID-19&strd_s=12%2F28%2F2021&strd_e=01%2F04%2F2022&draw=2&rank=8)was registered in December 2021 aims to evaluate the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 CanSinoBIO and AstraZeneca ChAdOx. - PFIZER/BIONTECH (GERMANY) RNA VACCINE The vaccine is administered in two doses that are given three weeks apart. In December 2020, the UK became the first country in the world to approve this vaccine and began rolling out an initial 800,000 doses at the start of the month, and is now in use worldwide. BioNTech, working together with Pfizer, started testing its BNT162 vaccine in humans in global trials, initially in Germany, and then started trials in the USA. BioNTech has also entered into a \u20ac 100 million debt financing agreement with the European Investment Bank in order to scale-up the production of the vaccine in Europe. On 27 July 2020, it announced the launch of a phase 2/3 trial with 30,000 volunteers in the USA and other countries including Argentina, Brazil and Germany. In September, it said it would expand its phase 3 US trial to 44,000 participants. At the start of October 2020, BioNTech and Pfizer started recruiting for a phase 3 trial in South Africa and by early November had reported promising interim results. Its final efficacy analysis confirmed strong efficacy. In February, a phase 4 trial was launched as part of a national cohort study in collaboration with the Danish Ministry of the Interior and Health. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorised its use for 12 to 15 years olds in the United States. On 23 August 2021, the FDA granted full approval to the vaccine for people 16 and older, moving it beyond the emergency-use status in the US - the first vaccine to do so. A [phase 2 study](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04969263)was carried out in August 2021 to elicit an antibody response in kidney transplant recipients who have failed to respond to two doses of vaccine. On 12 August 2021, the United States FDA authorised the use of booster shot in transplant recipients. This vaccine requires freezer storage. On 27 September 2021, a [phase 4 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05057182)was registered to study a third dose of the vaccine to boost COVID-19 immunity. On the same day, a separate [phase 4 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05057169)was registered to study the comparison effects of third dose with Sinovac or mRNA vaccine (Comirnaty) to boost the immune response in adults who previously received two doses of Sinovac or BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, BioNTech/Fosun Pharma). [A phase 4 on 12 October 2021 and expects to enrol 525 participants. The study is expected to start in November 2021. This trial aims to measure the humoral and adaptive immune response in patients with cancer diagnosis undergoing mRNA vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. On 14 October 2021, [a phase 2 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05077254)was registered with plans to enrol 400 participants. The purpose of the study is to induce an enhanced antibody response to COVID-19 in kidney and liver transplant recipients who have negative or indeterminate anti-spike antibody after at least two Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Participants will be randomized to receive a Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 booster dose, or receive the booster dose together with a temporary, prescribed reduction in their maintenance immunosuppression (IS) regimen. In November 2021, [a study was registered to evaluate the effect of sirolimus-based immunosuppression and inulin dietary fibre supplementation on booster COVID-19 vaccine responses in kidney transplant recipients. A phase 1/2 trial](https://www.thaiclinicaltrials.org/show/TCTR20211102006)was registered in November 2021 to evaluate and compare the safety and immunological response of the third dose of AstraZeneca's ChAdOx1 vaccine and Pfizer's mRNA vaccine. On 17 November 2021, [a phase 2 trial](https://www.thaiclinicaltrials.org/show/TCTR20211027002)has started to evaluate the immunogenicity after a Pfizer booster dose among elderly or adult with underlying diseases who had received AstraZeneca's AZD1222 vaccine using standard versus low dose. The Faculty of Medicine Ramagthibodi Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand, under the sponsor of the National Research Council of Thailand, registered [a phase 3 trial](https://www.thaiclinicaltrials.org/show/TCTR20211102003)in November 2021 to study the immunogenicity of an additional dose of either viral-vectored or mRNA vaccine in kidney transplant recipients. [A phase 3 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05124171)was registered in November 2021. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety induced by a homologous vaccine booster (Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine booster) and a heterologous vaccine booster (one of the two experimental Sanofi/GSK vaccines booster), on the D614 (Wuhan) strain and on the SARS-CoV-2 variants, in adults who received 2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine in November 2021 to study the immunogenicity of an additional dose of either viral-vectored or mRNA vaccine in kidney transplant recipients. A [phase 1 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05132855)was registered in November 2021 with the aim to determine the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a 3rd booster of mRNA and protein COVID-19 vaccines, including Pfizer/BioNTech's BNT162b2, Moderna's mRNA-1273 and Medigen's MCV COVID-19 vaccine. registered in November 2021 to evaluate the post-vaccination immune response to COVID-19 in the New Caledonian Population (COVCAL). The importance of the study lies in the fact that the response of non-European non-Asian Oceanian populations to Pfizer vaccination has not been specifically studied at this time. Some recent data are in favour of a significant variability of susceptibility to pathogens in Oceanian populations, stemming from a genetic inheritance from Neanderthal man and his cousin Denisova man. In the context of vaccine hesitancy, it is therefore important to ensure that the immune response of the New Caledonian population (Melanesian, Polynesian, European or other communities) to vaccination against COVID-19 is similar to that of populations studied in large clinical trials. A [phase 3 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05142319)was started in October 2021 to compare short and long-term immunogenicity of different COVID-19 vaccine combinations against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 as well as different variants of concern. Involving 600 participants, the trial is due to be completed by April 2023. A [phase 1/2 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05132855)was started in November 2021 to study the immune response of heterologous boost third dose of mRNA and protein COVID-19 vaccine, including Pfizer's BNT162b2, Moderna's mRNA-1273 Medigen's COVID-19 vaccine. - SINOVAC (CHINA) INACTIVATED VACCINE Sinovac conducted phase 3 trials involving volunteers in Brazil, Indonesia and Turkey. Although it is not yet approved by regulators, shipments have already arrived in Indonesia, ready for rollout. A report in July said that the Chinese government has given the Sinovac vaccine emergency approval for limited use. The city of Jiaxing has reportedly offered the vaccine to health workers and other high-risk groups for US$ 60. The company began phase 4 trials in February 2021. A [Phase 2 study](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT04979949)was carried out on 12 July 2021 to determine the safety and immunogenicity of booster doses. A phase 3 study is due to be conducted in late August 2021 to evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine in participants aged 6 months to 17 years. A [study report](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3909773)on a phase 4 clinical trial was published on 23 August 2021 which found that simultaneous administration of the vaccine and seasonal influenza vaccine would be feasible. On 27 September 2021, [a phase 4 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05057169)was registered to study the comparison effects of a 3rd dose with Sinovac or mRNA vaccine (Comirnaty) to boost the immune response in adults who previously received two doses of Sinovac or BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, BioNTech/Fosun Pharma). [A phase 3 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05077176)was registered on 14 October 2021 to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of two inactivated vaccines as booster dose, CoronaVac and Turkovac, in individuals who received the second dose of Sinovac's CoronaVac vaccine after 90 days to 270 days. On 21 October 2021, [a phase 2 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05087368)was registered to compare the immunogenicity and safety of heterologous and homologous booster schedules in individuals who received AstraZeneca's ChAdOx1-S or Sinovac's CoronaVac vaccination previously. With plans to enrol 520 participants, the study is due to be conducted on 1 December 2022. [A phase 3 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05142319)was started in October 2021 to compare short and long-term immunogenicity of different COVID-19 vaccine combinations against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 as well as different variants of concern. Involving 600 participants, the trial is due to be completed by April 2023. In November 2021, the company registered [a phase 4 clinical trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05107557)in children aged 3-5 years old. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the company's COVID-19 vaccine (Vero cell) when co-administered with the EV71 vaccine manufactured by Sinovac Biotech Co. Another [phase 3 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05137418)was registered in November 2021 to evaluate the company's COVID-19 vaccine's use in healthy populations aged from 3 to 11 years against that in adults aged 18-26 years.

(CHINA) The Ad5-nCoV vaccine candidate uses a harmless non-replicating viral vector to carry vaccine antigens into the human body - this is the same platform that the vaccine developer CanSino Biologics Inc, based in Tianjin, used for its Ebola vaccine. The COVID-19 vaccine was jointly developed with the Institute of Biotechnology of the Academy of Military Medical Sciences. On 25 June 2020, the Chinese military approved the vaccine for a year as a \"specially needed drug\", which is unusual given that at that point phase 2 results had not been collated. On 9 August 2020, the Saudi health ministry announced that CanSino would run a phase 3 trial in Saudi Arabia; later in the month the company also started a trial in Pakistan and Russia. In May 2021, the company registered [a phase 4 trial](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04892459?term=NCT04892459&draw=2&rank=1)with 300 adult participants who have been primed with either one or two doses of inactive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. On 5 August 2021, [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/cansinobio-covid-19-says-booster-shot-can-reverse-drop-antibodies-2021-08-06/)reported that antibody levels in people inoculated with this vaccine could drop to around 30 percent after six months. A [phase 2 trial report](https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab845/6374123)published on 22 September 2021 confirmed a single dose of the vaccine was safe and induced robust immune responses in individuals aged 6-17 years. A total of 2000 participants will be equally divided into the two study countries, Chile and Mexico.

The vaccine specifically targets the SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant, which was first identified in the Republic of South Africa. The mRNA-1273.351 vaccine candidate will be given to trial participants in vaccination schedules alone, sequentially, or co-administered with Moderna's first candidate, mRNA-1273, which has already been approved and rolled out in the US. A [phase 2 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04847050), which is also testing the efficacy of the vaccine against COVID-19 in cancer patients, was launched in April 2021 with 120 participants. In June, Moderna launched a [phase 4 trial](https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2021-000930-32/BE)for mRNA-1273.351 in Belgium. On 11 August 2021, results from a [phase 2/3 trial](https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa2109522?articleTools=true)suggested that the vaccine was safe to use and efficacious in preventing COVID-19 in adolescents between 12 and 17 years old. On the same day, results from a [phase 3 trial](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2111462)of a third-dose vaccine in adult transplant recipients showed that the booster enhanced their immune response. The United States [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-additional-vaccine-dose-certain-immunocompromised)has authorised the use of booster shot in transplant recipients. A [phase 4 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05030974)was registered on 1 September 2021 to study the efficacy of booster vaccination in kidney transplant patients who did not sero-convert after two doses of vaccine. [A phase 4 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05075538)was registered on 12 October 2021 and expects to enrol 525 participants. The study is expected to start in November 2021. This trial aims to measure the humoral and adaptive immune response in patients with cancer diagnosis undergoing mRNA vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. On 14 October 2021, [a phase 2 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05077254)was registered with plans to enrol 400 participants. The purpose of the study is to induce an enhanced antibody response to COVID-19 in kidney and liver transplant recipients who have negative or indeterminate anti-spike antibody after at least two Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Participants will be randomized to receive a Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 booster dose, or receive the booster dose together with a temporary, prescribed reduction in their maintenance immunosuppression (IS) regimen. In November 2021, the company registered [a phase 2 study](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05137236)to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the company's mRNA-1283 COVID-19 vaccine boosters to boost antibody responses to the ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2 virus, the B.1.351 variant, and potentially other SARS-CoV-2 variants. - WUHAN INSTITUTE OF BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS (CHINA) INACTIVATED VACCINE The United Arab Emirates became the first foreign country to approve this vaccine, after interim phase 3 trials showed 86% efficacy.

The trial aims to recruited thirty six participants from two groups of unvaccinated people and vaccinated volunteers to observe the vaccine's efficacity as a vaccine and a booster respectively. This is one of the first examples of a bacterial vector vaccine. Study found that the technology team has succeeded engineering Bacillus subtilis with spore coat proteins resembling the proteins of the nucleus and spikes of coronavirus. This product could have a vaccine-like activity within the intestinal environment. ABANDONED TRIALS - CUREVAC (GERMANY) RNA VACCINE Phase 2 trials began in Panama and Peru in July 2020, and phase 3 trials launched in Germany in December 2020 with around 36,500 volunteers. The company is hoping to make up to 300 million doses in 2021. CureVac has collaborated with Elon Musk's company Tesla to develop mRNA \"micro-factories,\" which could be sent worldwide to make billions of doses of the vaccine. A [phase 1/2 study report](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309921006770?via%3Dihub)was published on 23 November 2021. Funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and CureVac, the study aimed to analyse the efficacy and safety of the CureVac's CVnCoV SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine candidate. The study found that CVnCoV was efficacious in the prevention of COVID-19 of any severity and had an acceptable safety profile. However, taking into account the changing environment, including the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, and timelines for further development, the decision has been made to cease activities on the CVnCoV candidate and to focus efforts on the development of next-generation vaccine candidates. - SANOFI PASTEUR AND TRANSLATE BIO (FRANCE) RNA VACCINE Sanofi developed an mRNA vaccine in partnership with Translate Bio. After preclinical trials found that the vaccine produces a strong antibody response in mice and monkeys, the companies launched a [phase 1/2 trial](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04798027?term=vaccine&type=Intr&cond=Covid19%2C+sars&strd_s=03%2F01%2F2021&strd_e=06%2F01%2F2022&draw=2)in March 2021 with over 400 participants and have since registered a phase 2 trial. The two-dose vaccine, known as MRT5500, is the second candidate from Sanofi that is now in clinical trials, with the first being a protein-based vaccine developed with GSK. In September 2021, Sanofi and Translate Bio [announced](https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2021/2021-09-28-18-44-47-2304800)they have abandoned trials for their vaccine MRT5500 \"given sufficient mRNA COVID-19 vaccine supply.\" - UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND (AUSTRALIA) PROTEIN SUBUNIT VACCINE In December 2020, the University of Queensland abandoned its v451 COVID-19 vaccine candidate with CSL Limited, because people were testing positive for HIV even though they were not infected with the virus. Now, in collaboration with Syneos Health and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the university has continued investigating its MF59 adjuvanted COVID-19 Sclamp vaccine. The vaccine is administered as an injection directly into the muscle of the upper arm of healthy participants. In April 2021, they published the results from their abandoned Phase 1 trial indicating that the candidate could still be effective against COVID-19. The Sclamp vaccine phase trials were suspended in March 2021. - ALTIMMUNE, INC (MARYLAND, USA) This Maryland-based biopharmaceutical company was testing a nasal spray vaccine for COVID-19, which delivers the Ad5 adenovirus to human airways but has just halted trials after phase 1 trials showed it produced substantially lower immunity than other COVID-19 vaccines in use. - UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND & CSL LIMITED (AUSTRALIA) PROTEIN SUBUNIT VACCINE This was the first COVID-19 vaccine candidate to be abandoned. Researchers at the University of Queensland, in Brisbane, were using a patented vaccine-development technique called a 'molecular clamp' that the researchers designed to stop the coronavirus's spike protein from denaturing. As this clamp is similar to a protein on HIV, it triggered some participants to produce antibodies to HIV even though they were perfectly healthy. The researchers launched phase 1 trials in July. In September, the vaccine makers made [an agreement](https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2020/09/csl-signs-agreement-australian-government-uq-vaccine-supply)with the Australian government to deliver 51 million doses, a contract that has now been cancelled. - MERCK/DOHME/IAVI (USA) Merck joined forces with non-profit organisation IAVI to produce a vaccine candidate that used the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) technology that is the basis for Merck's Ebola Zaire virus vaccine, ERVEBO. The Ebola vaccine worked as well in older people as it did in young, healthy adults. On 25 January, Merck announced it was abandoning its vaccine trials because the vaccine failed to trigger a comparable immune response to what happens in a natural COVID-19 infection. - MERCK/INSTITUTE PASTEUR (USA) Merck acquired the Austrian firm Themis Bioscience in June and was also working on an alternative vaccine originally developed at the Institut Pasteur. The vaccine used the weakened measles virus to carry genetic material into cells. A phase 1 trial [launched](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04497298?term=vaccine&cond=COVID-19&draw=2&rank=1)in August 2020 but was abandoned this month, because the vaccine provoked a response that was weaker than when naturally infected with COVID-19. - ORGANIZATION OF DEFENSIVE INNOVATION AND RESEARCH (IRAN) INACTIVATED VACCINE In March, the Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research, a subsidiary of Iran's Ministry of Defense, launched a [phase 1 trial](https://en.irct.ir/trial/54133)for the country's third locally developed vaccine, FAKHRAVAC (MIVAC). FAKHRAVAC, which was tested at two different dose strengths each injected as part of a two dose schedule two and three weeks apart, is named after Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, one of Iran's top nuclear scientists who was [killed in late November](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/16/iran-starts-human-trials-on-third-locally-developed-vaccine)2020. In June 2021, FAKHRAVAC underwent a [phase 2 trial](https://en.irct.ir/trial/56027). Although FAKHRAVAC was given emergency authorisation in September, Iran announced that it would be abandoning the vaccine in October 2021 due to lack of demand. | | "}
