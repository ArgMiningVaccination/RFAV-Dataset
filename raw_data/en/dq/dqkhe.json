The lab provides hands-on experience with bacterial transformation and culture, protein extraction and chromatography, centrifugation, spectrophotometry, SDS and Native gel electrophoresis and analysis. Course Learning Outcomes The objectives of this biochemistry laboratory course(aka CLOs) are to help students learn and apply a variety of fundamental and essential protein-based laboratory techniques. To do so, the students will be required to express, purify, quantify, and identify the "}
