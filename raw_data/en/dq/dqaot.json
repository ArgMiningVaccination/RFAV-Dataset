What You Need to Know The CDC recommends everyone stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccines for their age group: The CDC recommends: - Children 6 months through 5 years who have completed the two-dose Moderna primary vaccine series may receive a single Moderna omicron dose at least two months after their primary series completion. - Children 6 months through 4 years who have either not started or completed the three-dose Pfizer primary vaccine series may receive a single Pfizer omicron dose as the third dose in the Pfizer primary series. - Children 6 months through 4 years who already received the three-dose Pfizer primary vaccine series are not recommended to receive the omicron vaccine at this time. Data to support giving an omicron dose to this subset of children are expected in January. - People ages 5 years and older receive one updated (bivalent) booster if it has been at least 2 months since their last COVID-19 vaccine dose, whether that was: - Their final primary series dose, or - An original (monovalent) booster - People who have gotten more than one original (monovalent) booster are also recommended to get an updated (bivalent) booster. - Getting a COVID-19 vaccine after you recover from COVID-19 infection provides added protection against COVID-19. - If you recently had COVID-19, you may consider delaying your next vaccine dose (primary dose or booster) by 3 months from when your symptoms started or, if you had no symptoms, when you first received a positive test. - People who are moderately or severely immunocompromised have [different recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html), including boosters.
