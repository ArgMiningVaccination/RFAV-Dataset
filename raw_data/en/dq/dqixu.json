To address these questions, the contributors to this volume come together to examine spiritual healing from a number of disciplinary perspectives. How can such healing be explained through a scientific or medical lens? What do biblical and historical instantiations of it tell us today? And how are we to think of it as anthropologists, philosophers, or theologians? Finally, what does all this mean for those seeking spiritual healing for themselves, or pastors walking alongside the afflicted? Deftly edited by theologian Sarah Coakley, Spiritual Healing offers a composite narrative that investigates the many intermingled factors at work in this intriguing phenomenon. The result is a human story as much as it is a theological one, satisfying discerning believers and skeptics alike in its rigorous pursuit of truth and meaning.

Sarah Coakley REVIEWS \"This groundbreaking study of spiritual healing probes the scientific and philosophical issues with clarity and insight. Essential for anyone looking for trustworthy guidance on these issues.\" \u2014 Keith Ward University of Oxford \"Coakley's fine interdisciplinary collection of essays by scholars in philosophy, theology, history, anthropology, neuroscience and pastoral counseling should attract a range of readers (secular and religious) interested in the various ways interpretive analysis clarifies the abidingly important yet still murky question of how meanings heal. With an expert editorial hand, Coakley compares, contrasts, and brings into engagement divergent and, in a few instances, seemingly unassimilable studies, asking their authors to confront each other in search of more capacious and availing answers. No small achievement!\" \u2014 Arthur Kleinman, MD Harvard University \"By making the 'spiritual' not an alternative to the physical but a window on the divine, and by making 'healing' not a synonym for magic but a way of encapsulating our longing for salvation, Sarah Coakley and her companions offer an intelligent, accessible, and inspiring study of perhaps the greatest interdisciplinary subject of them all. Highly recommended for anyone who cares about body, mind, and spirit\u2014in local parish or theological seminar alike.\" \u2014 Samuel Wells vicar, St. Martin-in-the-Fields, London The Expository Times \"Much can be gleaned from this rich volume for readers capable of suppressing the constant irritation produced by the language of 'spiritual healing.'\" Modern Theology \"As one might expect from an interdisciplinary master class, this book will yield new insights even for readers with longstanding interest in theology and science "}
