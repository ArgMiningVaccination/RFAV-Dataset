Individuals for whom a medical or religious exemption applies may seek exception to the COVID-19 vaccine requirement, and if granted, may be subject to ongoing COVID-19 surveillance testing and other public health measures. In reaching this decision, Salem Academy and College has carefully considered the guidance of public health authorities and other health agencies, as well as the decisions made by other colleges, universities, and schools to require COVID-19 vaccination. Residential schools and college campuses are among the most vulnerable settings for COVID-19 due to congregate living, social activities, and other factors. With the protections afforded by the COVID-19 vaccine and booster, we can look forward to resuming many campus activities that took place pre-pandemic and providing students with a safer living and learning environment that substantially minimizes the significant disruptions, illness, and challenges posed by COVID-19. Proof of being fully vaccinated or exempt and any supportive documentation is due to Salem Academy and College via the Magnus Health Portal by July 1st for Fall semester and January 10th for Spring semester for review and processing. Students should submit their documentation as soon as it is available. Please fully review the following COVID-19 Vaccine and Booster FAQ and Guidelines for additional information about this requirement and the process for submitting your vaccine record or exemption form. Everyone 5 years of age and older are now eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Individuals who received the two-dose series vaccine at least five months or more ago are eligible for the booster. Those Individuals who received the Moderna vaccine must be 18 years of age and older and those who received the Pfizer vaccine must be 16 years of age and older. Recipients of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine must wait at least two months and be at least 18 years of age, to be eligible for the booster. COVID-19 is a serious and very easily communicable disease. Research has shown that the COVID-19 vaccine and the booster is effective at preventing the COVID-19 disease, especially severe illness and death. The vaccine also reduces the risk of persons spreading the COVID-19 virus. As we are learning more about the waning efficacy of the vaccine, we know that the COVID-19 vaccine booster is needed to increase an individual's immunity and further help prevent severe illness and community spread. For purposes of meeting the vaccine requirement, Salem Academy and College will accept COVID-19 vaccines authorized for emergency use by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or the World Health Organization (WHO). To find a vaccine provider nearest you, you may visit [vaccines.gov](https://www.vaccines.gov/), text your zip code to 438829, or call 1-800-232-0233. Vaccine providers local to the Salem Academy and College campus include: The COVID-19 vaccine is an intramuscular injection(s) given by a healthcare provider. In the United States, the FDA-authorized Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are given in a two-dose series a certain number of weeks apart, and the FDA-authorized Johnson & Johnson / Janssen vaccine is a single dose injection. The COVID-19 vaccine is given free of charge to all persons living in the United States, regardless of immigration status. At this time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, persons are considered to be fully vaccinated two weeks after their second dose of a two-dose series COVID-19 vaccine (such as the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines), or two weeks after receiving a single dose vaccine (such as the Johnson & Johnson / Janssen vaccine), however, the CDC now recommends anyone 5 years of age and over should receive a booster dose as soon as they are eligible. Booster vaccines are said to begin providing protection 7 days after being received. The CDC defines being \"up to date\" with the COVID vaccine to mean receiving a booster as soon as eligible. Salem Academy and College is closely monitoring local and federal health agencies for the most up to date information regarding full vaccination status. Salem College has partnered with Magnus Health to allow for receipt of students' immunization records and health forms. Students will receive an introductory email from Magnus Health to create a password for their account and to upload a clear copy of their records. Vaccination documentation must include your name, the vaccine(s) you received, and the date(s) you received it. [Instructions for How to Upload COVID-19 Immunization Records to Magnus Portal](/sites/default/files/downloads/page/instructions_for_how_to_upload_covid-19_vaccine_records_to_magnus_a11y.pdf) Anyone found to have submitted a false or counterfeit vaccine record will be subject to disciplinary action. As a community of honor, Salem Academy and College expects individuals to show respect for their campus members by maintaining integrity and honesty, and this includes compliance with COVID-19 related requirements that are designed to promote the health and wellbeing of the Salem community. Yes, research has shown that immunity from the COVID-19 vaccine is more effective than the natural immunity achieved from contracting the COVID-19 disease. Individuals who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 are encouraged to speak with a healthcare professional before receiving the COVID-19 vaccine to determine the appropriate timing. It is safe for an individual to receive the booster vaccine after they have recovered from their infectious period from a breakthrough infection. Individuals are encouraged to speak with their healthcare provider if they have questions or concerns related to receiving the booster vaccine after a COVID infection. Students who are admitted after the semester due date should promptly submit their proof of vaccination or exemption request following admission. Salem will review and accept documentation for students only through the Magnus Health portal. Newly admitted students will receive a welcome message from Magnus Health for this purpose. Individuals who need to seek an exemption for such reasons may do so pursuant to the following process: Medical Exemption: Individuals with documented medical contraindications to COVID-19 vaccines as specified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or a qualifying disability may submit exemption request documentation. This would include situations such as a history of severe, life threatening allergies to vaccines or any ingredient in the vaccine documented by a medical provider. Students requesting a medical exemption must have their medical provider complete the Salem [COVID-19 Vaccine Exemption Form](/sites/default/files/covid_vaccine_exemption_request_form.pdf). Religious Exemption: If the bona fide religious beliefs of an individual (or the parent/guardian if under age 18) are contrary to the COVID-19 immunization requirement, the individual may seek an exemption to the requirement through the submission of a written statement of their bona fide religious beliefs and opposition to the immunization requirement. Individuals requesting a religious exemption must complete the [COVID-19 Vaccine Exemption Form](/sites/default/files/covid_vaccine_exemption_request_form.pdf). All exemption requests are subject to review and approval by Salem Academy and College and may require additional specialty evaluation as part of that process. Completed COVID-19 Vaccine Exemption Forms and any supporting documentation must be uploaded to the Magnus Health Portal for review by Salem Health Services. [Instructions for How to Upload COVID-19 Immunization Records to Magnus Portal](/sites/default/files/downloads/page/instructions_for_how_to_upload_covid-19_vaccine_records_to_magnus_a11y.pdf) Currently available COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and studies have shown they prevent severe illness and death from the virus. In accordance with public health guidelines, fully vaccinated students will be eligible for these additional benefits: Students who fail to comply with the COVID-19 vaccine requirement (and do not have an approved exemption or extension) will not be permitted to reside in campus housing or participate in in-person classes, studies, or activities until they satisfactorily comply. In this situation, students will be withdrawn from in-person classes. Pro-rata refunds of tuition, room, board, and other charges will not be given to students for the period of time when the student was not permitted to reside in campus housing or attend in-person classes, studies, and activities due to non-compliance with the COVID-19 vaccine requirement. Students who officially withdraw will be given refunds in accordance with the applicable Refund Policy.
