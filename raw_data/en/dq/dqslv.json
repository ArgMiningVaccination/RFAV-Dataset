It contains about 12% almond oil and 21% fibre. Suitable for making pastries and biscuits. Use: - The flour is gluten-free and is suitable as an addition to porridge and desserts, sauces, ice cream and more! - When baking, 10% -20% of the flour can be replaced with almond flour. Since it has a very good swelling capacity, just adjust the amount of liquid in the recipe accordingly! Note: - The colour of the flour depends on the availability of the raw materials. Sometimes the almonds are processed with their brown seed coat, which gives the flour a slightly darker colour. Sometimes we use peeled almonds, which produce a lighter flour. The colour of the flour does should not impact your recipes! |Brand:|| | Ingredients - Almond Flour [[1]](#cite_note-95fd8aede3a428925-1) - From certified organic farming Nutritional Information |Nutritional Information||per 100 g| |Energy Solling Partially De-Oiled Almond Flour Customer Reviews 0 English reviews written for \u00d6lm\u00fchle Solling Partially De-Oiled Almond Flour 1 customer review in all languages 5,0 out of 5 stars | | 5 stars | ||3||(100%)| | | 4 stars | ||0||(0%)| | | 3 stars | ||0||(0%)| | | 2 stars | ||0||(0%)| | | 1 Stars | ||0||(0%)| 3 reviews We do not have any reviews in English yet, but we do have 1 review available in another language. - No reviews available Related products Customers also bought Magazine Articles: Discover Ayurveda 101 : Free delivery in Germany from 49,90 \u20ac Free returns 24-hour shipping More than 6.950 products "}
