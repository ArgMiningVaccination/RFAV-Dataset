DEACTIVATION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK POLICY AND PROCEDURES CONCERNING TELEPHONE CREDIT CARDS (SENATE DOCUMENT #19 - 20-43) (INFORMATION) Lanford noted that the Senate leadership, in collaboration with the President's Office and the Office of General Counsel developed a formal process for deactivating the University's policies and procedures because over time, the principles upon which they were developed, or the circumstances to which they applied have changed significantly or n o longer exist, such that the original policy and procedure is moot or no longer needed. The process is similar to the one developed for technical amendments with two important distinctions: they can only be initiated by the administrative unit responsible for implementation; and they will not be formally removed until the Senate is notified and the President has approved the deactivation. Lanford stated that the request to deactivate the University of Maryland, College Park Policy and Procedures Concerni ng Telephone Credit Cards came from the University IT Council in collaboration with the Division of IT. The recommendation for removal of the policy is because it is an outdated functionality that has not been used for many years.

ADJOURNMENT The meeting was adjourned at 4: 45 p.m. Procedures for the Remaining Spring 2020 Senate Meetings (Senate Document #19- 20-45) I am pleased to forward the Senate Executive Committee's proposal on Procedures for the Remaining Spring 2020 Senate Meetings (Senate Document # 19-20-45) for your consideration and approval . This proposal revises the Bylaws of the University Senate to allow the Senate to meet virtually, as needed, during the State of Emergency related to COVID -19. The Senate Executive Committee (SEC) approved this item at its meeting on March 26, 2020 on behalf of the University Senate, under its authority in 4.3.a of the Bylaws of the University Senate. Please inform the Senate of your decision and any administrative act ion related to your conclusion. 03-30-2020 Wallace D. Loh President Copies of this approval and the accompanying legislation will be forwarded to: Mary Ann Rankin, Senior Vice President and Provost Reka Montfort , Executive Secretary and Director, University Senate Michael Poterala, Vice President and General Counsel Cynthia Hale, Associate Vice President for Finance and Personnel John Bertot , Associate Provost for Faculty Affairs Elizabeth Beise, Associate Provost for Academic Planning & Programs Sylvia B. Andrews, Academic Affairs Rhonda Smith, Academic Affairs Laura Dugan, Senate Chair -Elect Stephen Henry , Senate Parliamentarian TO Wallace D. Loh | President FROM Pamela Lanford | Chair, University Senate Approved: Date: UNIVERSITY SENATE LEGISLATION APPROVAL | #19- 20-45 Approved by the Senate Executive Committee on March 26, 2020 Procedures for the Remaining Spring 2020 Senate Meetings ISSUE On March 5, 2020, the Governor of the State of Maryland declared a State of Emergency due to the COVID -19 pandemic. Over the course of the month of March, the Governor, the University System of Maryland, and the University of Maryland announced several restr ictions on gatherings, travel, and University activities in the interest of slowing the spread of the virus and protecting the health and safety of the State and campus community . The University of Maryland announced that it would be moving to an online en vironment for all coursework for the remainder of the spring 2020 semester and encouraging telework for faculty and staff functions wherever possible for the majority of the spring 2020 semester . The University also announced that all gatherings over ten people should be cancelled if appropriate social distancing could not be maintained . The Bylaws of the University Senate require Senators to be physically present in order to participate in Senate meetings. As a result, the Senate is unable to meet virt ually. Given that the current restrictions prevent a Senate meeting from being held in person , the Senate Executive Committee met on March 26, 2020 to discuss how to address the Senate's business for the remainder of the spring 2020 semester or until the r estrictions are lifted, in this new environment. RECOMMENDATION (S) The Senate Executive Committee recommends that the Bylaws of the University Senate be amended as shown in the document immediately following this transmittal . The Senate Executive Commit tee recommends that the Elections, Representation, and Governance (ERG) Committee be charged with developing formal provisions for virtual meetings of the Senate by the end of the Fall 2020 semester. COMMITTEE WORK The SEC met virtually on March 26, 2020, and considered all options for moving forward. The SEC weighed the need for the Senate to be able to continue its work and address any urgent needs that arise with the reality that Senators , committee members, and administrators have primary PRESENTED BY Pamela Lanford , Chair REVIEW DATES SEC - March 26, 2020 VOTING METHOD In a single vote RELEVANT POLICY/DOCUMENT Bylaws of the University Senate NECESSARY APPROVALS President UNIVERSITY SENATE TRANSMITTAL | #19-20-45 Senate Executive Committee responsibilities to attend to during the pandemic and are likely undertaking a great deal of work to revise and reconfigure their work to fit an online environment. The SEC reviewed the Bylaws of the University Senate and discussed the intentions of the Plan of Organization Review Committee during its discussion. The Senate Bylaws require Senators to be physically present in order to participate in meetings. The relevant provision would prevent the Senate from holding virtual meetings or from allowing absentee voting : 3.5 Senators must be physically present in order to participate in meetings. The Senate Bylaws also allow the SEC to act on behalf of the Senate when nee ded: 4.3.a Where time or the availability of the membership precludes a meeting of the Senate, as, for example, during the summer or between semesters, the Executive Committee may act for the Senate. 4.3.b A report of all actions taken by the Executiv e Committee when acting for the Senate, with supporting material, shall be included with the agenda of the next regular meeting of the Senate. By written request of ten (10) Senators, received by the Chair of the Senate prior to the call to order of that m eeting, any Executive Committee action on behalf of the Senate shall be vacated and the item in question placed on the agenda as a special order. If any such item is not petitioned to the floor, it shall stand as an approved action of the Senate. The prov ision on physical presence was added by PORC in 2015 after a detailed discussion on whether to allow Senators to vote without attending the Senate meeting . PORC felt it was important for Senators to be engaged in the discussion in order to vote, and added the language to prevent absentee voting or proxy voting. PORC did not consider situations like the current pandemic, which could require holding an entire meeting of the Senate through a virtual platform. After an in -depth discussion, the SEC determined that the Senate should have the option of moving forward with virtual meetings or other mechanisms to address its work. The SEC indicated that Senate committees and councils should be given the opportunity to finalize pending charges on which they have exp ended a great deal of effort so far. The SEC also acknowledged that it is unclear how long the pandemic restrictions will last, so having the flexibility to conduct business in virtual meetings would be prudent. In developing pathways for addressing Senate business, the SEC noted that concerns related to equity, accessibility, and availability of Senators should be acknowledged and addressed wherever possible. The SEC voted to exercise its authority under 4.3.a . to amend the Bylaws by striking the language on physical presence and adding language allowing for virtual meetings and alternate solutions for voting , as follows: 3.5 Senators must be physically present in order to participate in meetings. The Senate m ay hold virtual meetings instead of in -person meetings when there is a declared State of Emergency in Maryland and the University has restricted operations in place. Once the State of Emergency and University restrictions on normal operations for all const ituencies have ended, the Senate will resume regular operations for its meetings. Alternative voting methods, including absentee voting, may be considered under these conditions. The SEC also voted to charge the Senate Elections, Representation, & Governa nce Committee with developing formal provisions for virtual meetings of the Senate by the end of the Fall 2020 semester in order to develop a permanent amendment to the Bylaws to prepare for any future situations that would prevent meetings from being held in person . ALTERNATIVES The President or a group of ten Senators could reject the proposed amendment to the Bylaws. If rejected, the Senate would not be able to meet virtually to attend to Senate business during the COVID -19 pandemic. RISKS There are no known risks to the University in adopting this recommendation . FINANCIAL IMPLICATIO NS There are no known financial implications in adopting this recommendation.

The ERG Committee's report recommended the creation of a new Special Committee on University Finance (SCUF), which the Senate approved in April 2019. Among its recommendations, the ERG Committee asked that the chair of SCUF provide annual updates to the ERG Co mmittee on SCUF's progress and operations in spring 2020 and spring 2021 in order to allow the ERG Committee to consider modifications to address any issues in implementation, as well as to inform its future work to consider codifying a permanent body. In January 2020 , the Senate Executive Committee (SEC) charged the ERG Committee with reviewing the report that recommended SCUF be created, consulting with the chair of the Special Committee, considering questions related to representation and member replacem ent procedures, and recommending changes to the Senate Bylaws, as appropriate . COMMITTEE WORK Over the course of two meetings in February 2020, the ERG Committee reviewed its report on Enhancing Senate Input on University Planning and Resources (Senate Doc ument #17 -18-20) and met with the chair of SCUF. The committee did not identify any concerns that would necessitate changes to the committee's structure of operations as established in the Senate Bylaws. The committee also reviewed language regarding stude nt term lengths. The committee reviewed the rationale behind the provision in the Bylaws as documented in the committee's report . The ERG Committee reaffirmed its original intention \u2014that the provision in the Bylaws should permit student members to decide t o continue serving on the committee for up to two additional years without having to run for re -election \u2014and recommended that the Senate Office adopt this interpretation in implementing the Bylaws.

The ERG C ommittee 's report recommended the creation of a new Special Committee on University Finance (SCUF), which the Senate approved i n April 2019 (Appendix 1) . Among its recommendations, the ERG C ommittee asked that the chair of SCUF provide annual updates to the ERG Committee on SCUF's progress and operations in spring 2020 and spring 2021 in order to allow the ERG Committee to consider modifications to address any issues in implementation , as well as to inform its future work to consider codify ing a permanent body . In January 2020 , the Senate Executive Committee (SEC) charged the ERG Committee with reviewing the report that recommended SCUF be created, consulting with the chair of the Special Committee, consid ering questions related to representation and member replacement procedures, and recommending changes to the Senate Bylaws, as appropriate (Appendix 3). COMMITTEE WORK Over the course of two meetings in February 2020, the ERG Committee reviewed its report on Enhancing Senate Input on University Planning and Resources (Senate Document #17 -18-20) and met with the chair of SCUF . The chair reported that t he task of becoming knowledgeable about the University's budget has proven a significant undertaking (the chair also provided an overview of SCUF's operations to the Senate at its meeting on March 3, 2020, which may be found in Appendix 2). The Special C ommittee's progress was impacted by the departure of the University's Associate Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), who had been instrumental in planning to help members establish a baseline of knowledge on the budget. T he Special C ommittee is methodically accumulating knowledge and expertise, and is starting to consider the question of what role it might play in informing the broader campus community about budget issues. SCUF members are also consider ing the most effective ways to channel campus input to the administration. In the future, it may e stablish and expand a collection of budget -related resources on the Senate webpage. 2019-2020 Committee Members Date of Submission UNIVERSITY SENATE REPORT | #19-20-40 Senate Elections, Representations, & Governance Committee Report for Senate Document #19-20-40 2 of 2 The chair shared that it has been challenging to gather budget information that moves from the aggregate to the granular. The Special C ommittee needs to avoid becoming focused on particular spending decisions rather than the overall budget , but granular data can help illuminate broader questions . The University and USM budgets are not public until they have already been submitted to the governor. SCUF is considering whether there would be value in analyzing the previous year's budget and consider ing it in relation to the University's Strategic Plan . That review could then inform recommendations on priorities to emphasize in the following year's budget planning process . SCUF has not had any issues with attendance, nor has it identified any additional individuals with unique knowledge who should be added as ex-officio members . Some members of the ERG Committee expressed concern that not every College and School is represen ted on SCUF. In discussion with the SCUF chair it became clear to the ERG Committee that ensuring representation from every College and School would make SCUF unworkably large . It is also the case that when envisioning SCUF, the ERG Committee did not intend that members would represent particular interests or units, but instead hoped that members would be selected for their willingness to engage in the difficult task of developing a familiarity with the University's complex budgeting process. The ERG Committee reviewed the membership of SCUF and provisions in the Senate Bylaws for filling vacancies. The Bylaws establish different procedures depending on when in the academic year a vacanc y occur s. Replacements for any mid -year vacancies are selected from the original pool of nominees for the committee, while vacancies that occur after the Senate's annual Transition Meeting are selected through a new nomination process. To date, SCUF has not had an y vacancies. The ERG Committee also reviewed language regarding student term lengths. The Bylaws indicate that students serve one -year terms that may be \"renewed \" up to two times ; the terms for faculty and staff members are three years . It is unclear fro m the text itself whether students may be re -elected up to two times, or whether they may extend their membership beyond their one-year term at their discretion. The ERG Committee reviewed the rationale behind the provision on student term lengths. In keep ing with a desire to create a body that could develop expertise over time, the ERG Committee's intention had been to allow student members to serve as long as their faculty and staff colleagues on the committee. To avoid dissuading juniors and seniors from running , however, ERG decided not to require three -year terms , but to leave decisions on how long to serve to the individual student members . As the committee's 2019 report notes: \"G iven the importance of building knowledge of the budget, the student term s can be extended up to two times if the members are interested in continuing \" (Appendix 1). The ERG C ommittee reaffirmed its original intention \u2014that the provision in the Bylaws should permit student members to decide to continue serving on the committee for up to two additional years without having to run for re -election \u2014and recommended that the Senate Office adopt this interpretation in implementing the Bylaws . The committee did not identify any concerns that were pressing enoug h to justify changes to the Senate Bylaws. APPENDICES Appendix 1 \u2014ERG Report on of SCUF's Operations Appendix 3 \u2014Charge from the Senate Executive Committee Enhancing Senate Input on University Planning & Resources ISSUE In February 2018, several Past Senate Chairs submitted a proposal on the need for Senate engagement in institutional budgetary matters to the Senate Executive Committee (SEC). The proposal noted that the University of Maryland is one of the only Big 10 institutions without a Senate or Senate -equivalent body that addresses some aspect of the institution's budget. The proposal asked the Senate to consider creating a body that could develop the knowledge nece ssary to help it make informed recommendations on matters with financial ramifications and advise the President on institutional planning. In August 2018, the SEC charged the Elections, Representation, & Governance (ERG) Committee with reviewing the propos al and consulting with the proposers; conducting research on relevant bodies at Big 10 and other peer institutions; consulting with the Executive Secretary and Director of the Senate and a range of campus administrators; and recommending revisions to the S enate Bylaws to establish any new body, as appropriate . RECOMMENDATION S The Elections, Representation, & Governance (ERG) Committee recommends that Article 7 of the Senate Bylaws should be revised to create a Special Committee on University Finance, as defined in the document immediately following this report. The University Senate should charge the Elections, Representation, & Governance Committee with conducting a comprehensive review of the Special Committee on University Finance in fall 2021 to determine whether it should be codified as a permanent Senate body. As part of its review the ERG Committee should assess the special committee's charge, membership, and operations and recommend revisions to the Senate Bylaws, as appropriate, by March 30, 2022. The chair of the Special Committee on University Fi nance should provide annual updates to the ERG Committee on the special committee's progress and overall operations in spring 2020 and spring 2021, which will allow the ERG Committee to make any necessary adjustments and will provide context for the ERG Co mmittee's comprehensive review in 2021 -2022. PRESENTED BY Andy Horbal , Chair REVIEW DATES SEC - April 8 , 2019 | SENATE - April 24 , 2019 VOTING METHOD In a single vote RELEVANT POLICY/DOCUMENT UMD Plan of Organization for Shared Governance , University Senate Bylaws NECESSARY APPROVALS Senate , President UNIVERSITY SENATE TRANSMITTAL | #17-18-20 Senate Elections, Representation, & Governance Committee COMMITTEE WORK The ERG Committee began considering the charge in September 2018. It met with one of the proposers and distributed a survey to senate leaders at Big 10 and other peer institutions asking specific questions about com mittees that consider aspects of their institutional budgets. The committee reviewed responses and conducted follow -up interviews with senate leaders at three peer institutions. The committee also consulted with the Assistant President & Chief of Staff; th e Assistant Vice President for Finance and Personnel for Academic Affairs; the Associate Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer; and the Associate Provost for Academic Planning & Programs. After determining that there was value in creati ng a body like the one called for in the proposal, the committee considered various models that align with existing Senate structures. The most significant challenge that the committee faced throughout its review was the prospect of creating a new body tha t could develop a deep understanding of the budget without having that understanding itself. After consulting with the Senate Office and Senate Parliamentarian, the ERG Committee determined that forming a special committee would be an ideal way to pilot a new body before it is codified. A 3 -year life -cycle for the special committee would allow the body to be informed by the upcoming transition in University leadership and continue to operate while a comprehensive review to develop a formal body is conducted prior to the special committee's dissolution. This model would also allow the ERG Committee to craft specific provisions for the body that could differ from those of standing committees. The committee developed charge elements for a new Special Committ ee on University Finance and identified the body's regular and ex -officio membership. It drafted a new article for the Senate Bylaws to incorporate the special committee and shared the approach with various administrative stakeholders and the proposer. The ERG Committee considered feedback it received, made additional adjustments to the proposed revisions to the Senate Bylaws, and developed several administrative recommendations. After due consideration, the ERG committee voted to approve the Senate Bylaws revisions and administrative recommendations at its meeting on March 29, 2019. ALTERNATIVES The Senate could choose not to establish the Special Committee on University Finance . RISKS There are no associated risks. FINANCIAL IMPLIC ATIONS There are no financial implications. Enhancing Senate Input on University Planning and Resources Andrew Horbal (Chair ) Leigh Ann DePope (Faculty ) Jonathan Herrington (Ex-Officio Director of Human Resources Rep) Wendell Hill (Faculty ) Alexander Houck (Staff) Christine Johnston (Facult y) Sharon La Voy (Ex-Officio Associate VP IRPA Rep ) Lisha Reichard (Underg raduate Student ) April 2019 BACKGROUND In February 2018, several Past Senate Chairs submitted a proposal on the need for Senate engagement in institutional budgetary matters to the Senate Executive Committee (SEC). The proposal explained that the University of Maryland is one of the only Big 10 institutions without a Senate or Senate -equivalent body that addresses some aspect of the institution's budget. The proposers also noted that the University of Maryland Plan of Orga nization for Shared Governance (University Plan of Organization) exp licitly identifies budgetary matters as within the purview of the Senate. The proposal asked the Senate to consider creating a body that could develop the knowledge necessary to help it ma ke informed recommendations on matters with financial ramifications and advise the President on institutional planning. In August 2018, the SEC charged the Elections, Representation, & Governance (ERG) Committee with reviewing the proposal and consulting w ith the proposers; conducting research on relevant bodies at Big 10 and other peer institutions; consulting with the Executive Secretary and Director of the Senate and a range of campus administrators; and recommending revisions to the Senate Bylaws to est ablish any new body, as appropriate (Appendix 4) . CURRENT PRACTICE There is currently no Senate body that directly considers budgetary matters. Many Senate standing committees have ex -officio representatives from various administrative units who can provid e some level of information on the financial implications of matters being considered by the committees, though such information is rarely specific or precise. Transmittal sheets for legislation presented for the Senate's consideration characterize the fin ancial implications of any recommendations, though in similarly general terms . COMMITTEE WORK The ERG Committee began considering the charge in September 2018, when it reviewed the proposal and began planning its work. The committee distributed a survey to senate leaders at Big 10 and other peer institutions (peer institutions) asking specific ques tions about bodies that consider aspects of their institutional budgets; responses were reviewed along with other research on peer institution practices. The comm ittee met with one of the proposers and learned that the y envision a 2018-2019 Committee Me mbers Date of Submission UNIVERSITY SENATE REPORT | #17-18-20 Senate Elections, Representations, & Governance Committee Report for Senate Document #17-18-20 2 of 7 body that would not participate in the actual budgeting processes of the University , but would rather serve as an advisory body that explains/interprets the budget and reports to the Sena te. The body would also develop deep historical context for the University budget in order to understand how it has changed over time, and would operate on a macro level, focusing on the broader principles behind long -term allocations rather than specific details. The committee's chair and coordinators conducted follow -up interviews with senate leaders at three peer institutions that the committee felt might provide useful models: Ohio State University, Indiana University (Bloomington), and the University of Minnesota (Twin Cities). They also met with the Assistant President & Chief of Sta ff; the Assistant Vice President for Finance and Personnel for Academic Affairs; the Associate Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer; and the Associate Pr ovost for Academic Planning & Programs. The committee received reports on the institu tional interviews and administrator meetings, and determined that a majority of members were in favor of proposing some form of new body. The committee discussed at lengt h the most appropriate model for any new body and considered several approaches that align with existing Senate structures, including University Councils and standing committees. University Councils are sponsored by and report to the Senate and particular members of the administration or to a dean. While councils establish a clear pathway for advising administrators, their engagement with the Senate is more limited, and they can only be created by a taskforce. Senate standing committees represent another po ssible approach, though the Bylaws establish general characteristics of every standing commit tee, not all of which would be appropriate for the body ERG was considering. Term lengths, for example, are too limited. Perhaps most importantly, the mechanism fo r selecting members would not allow the committee to meet over the summer when important budg et-related activities take place, given slates of candidates for committees are not approved by the Senate until the first meeting of the fall semester. The most significant challenge that the committee faced throughout its review was the prospect of creat ing a new body that could develop a deep understanding of the budget without having that understanding itself. While the committee could consider models at other i nstitutions, it was difficult to envision how any of those models would function and be most effective within the University's structures and budget model. With the upcoming transition in the University's leadership, the committee recognized the critical importance of establishing a body that could engage with both the outgoing and incoming admin istrations. The University Plan of Organization allows for the creation of special committees \"of limited scope and term of duration.\" After consulting with the Se nate Office and Senate Parliamentarian, the ERG Committee determined that the special committ ee model would be an ideal way to essentially pilot the new body before it is codified. The committee agreed that a 3 -year term of duration would allow the special committee to be informed by the transition in leadership and allow it to continue to operate while a comprehensive review to develop a permanent body is conducted prior to the special committee's dissolution. This model would also allow the ERG Committee to craft specific provisions for the body that could differ from those of standing committees . The committee agreed to develop those provisions for the special committee , including a charge, membership, and set of procedures that would provide the most val ue to the Senate, the University , and the administration. The committee drafted potential char ge elements and considered feedback from the administrative stakeholders it consulted earlier. It also began discussing the special committee's membership. A subcommittee was formed to develop potential membership models. Following a review an d Report for Senate Document #17-18-20 3 of 7 feedback from the full committee, revisions to the Senate Bylaws to incorporate the new special committee were drafted and shared with various administrative stakeholders a nd the proposer. The committee considered feedback from the administrative stake holders, the Senate Office, and the Senate leadership . It also made additional changes to the proposed revisions to the Senate Bylaws, and developed several administrative re commendations that will allow the ERG Committee to recommend adjustments to the specia l committee's charge, membership, and operations, as necessary . The ERG Committee will also be charged with a comprehensive review of the special committee to determine w hether or not to establish it as a permanent Senate body prior to its dissolution. After due consideration, the ERG committee voted to approve the Senate Bylaws revisions and administrative recommendations at its meeting on March 29, 2019. COMMITTEE FINDIN GS Peer Institution Research As noted in the proposal, all but two of the University's Big 10 peers have bodies that are engaged with some aspect of the institutional budget (Appendix 1). In order to gather richer information than what could be gleaned fro m websites, the committee sent a survey to its peer institutions; eleven o f them responded, and eight expressed a willingness to speak further (Appendix 2). Interviews with three of those institutions provided additional information on how these bodies fun ction and what their officers feel make them in/effective. The committee a lso reviewed the specific charge elements under which each body operates. In its research, the committee identified a range of characteristics that vary across relevant bodies at pe er institutions. Some committees, such as Indiana University's Budgetary A ffairs Committee, regularly advise the Provost on funding requests from academic units. Others simply receive updates on the budget and fulfill an implicit oversight function, such a s the University of Minnesota's Finance and Planning Committee, which its chair describes as \"a watchdog...the dog that doesn't bark.\" Some are quite small, such as Northwestern University's six member Budget and Planning Committee; Rutgers University's Budg et and Finance Committee, in contrast, contains thirty -eight members. Most bodies include representation for faculty, staff, and students, though most are also based in faculty Senates. Most also include ex -officio representation from various administrativ e units. Perhaps most importantly, the budget models used by peer institut ions are not consistent. Some use a responsibility center management (RCM) model, in which funding follows credit hours and colleges are responsible for much of their own overhead. O thers adopt something closer to the historical budget model used by the Un iversity of Maryland, in which units' budgets are generally based on modest adjustments to the previous year's budget. One common theme that emerged from the interviews the committee conducted, however, was the importance of establishing trust between the body and the administration and administrators with which it works. Maintaining an open and collaborative dialogue between involved parties was consistently cited as a key element of an effective body. In light of these variations, and informed by convers ations with other Senate leaders, the committee determined that there was no ideal model offered by a peer institution. However, it is clear that nearly every peer finds value in hav ing a body dedicated to fiscal issues, despite differences in approach. An y new body established for the University of Maryland must align with the University's financial practices and existing shared governance structures. UMD Budget The University has t wo separate and distinct annual budgets : the operating budget and the capi tal budget. The operating budget includes both unrestricted (tuition and fees, state appropriation, Report for Senate Document #17-18-20 4 of 7 auxiliary enterprises, and government/private gifts) and restricted (federal/state /local grants and contracts) funds. However, it is important to note that tuition is also \"controlled\" by the University System of Maryland (USM), the governor, and the state legislature. The capital budget has 5/10 year planning cycles, including annual a sking -year requests. The Capital Improvement Program (CIP), which is state funded, focuses on the construction of new academic facilities to accommodate enrollment growth and enhance instructional programs and the modernization of existing facilities to meet current code, incorporate telecommunications and information technology , and improve safety for the USM. In addition, the System Funded Construction Program (SFCP) supports institutional auxiliary projects (e.g., necessary dormitory renovations) but is contingent on the availability of resources, debt capacity, and recurring funds to cover increased operating costs and annual debt service. The University's total budget (FY2020) is approximately $2.3B with $1.8B from unrestricted revenue and $500M from r estricted revenue that can only be used for designated purposes, primarily research -related. State appropriations make up less than one -third of unrestricted revenue and include funds to support the teaching, research, and public service mission s of the University. An additional one -third of the University's revenues come from t uition/fees; the auxiliary enterprise, government/private gifts, and other sources compose the remainder of the operating budget. The majority of expenditures are focused on salaries , wages, and fringes , but also include fuel and utilities, equipment and s upplies, fixed charges/debt/contracts, land/structures, facilities renewal and maintenance, and travel/communication. The University's annual budgeting process is iterative and star ts each August for the following fiscal year's budget. Planning involves c oordination with the USM, which is responsible for submitting a budget request for the entire system to the state. In December, the governor releases a budget proposal that must be k ept confidential until it is publicly announced in January. The legislatur e can generally change but not increase the governor's budget. The legislative session runs ninety days, from January to April. The University President lobbies for the institution's priorities throughout the session, and campus -level plans are adjusted ba sed on the legislature's deliberations. The final state budget is released in April, and establishes tuition rates and other funding provided by the state. The University has relativ ely little discretion over how money in the budget is spent; revenue strea ms are devoted to specific purposes and even enhancement funding, in years when it is available, is tied to particular projects that address key priorities and issues. The President receives advice on the budget from a range of existing officers and bodies , which are described in Standard VI of the University of Maryland 2016 Middle Sta tes Study . Once the state budget process is complete, the campus begins a more detailed and rigorous working -budget process that runs from April through June. The Division of Adminis tration and Finance administers this process through the University's budg et office , and it includes the setting of detailed operating budgets, including salaries and position budgets, across the University. Institutional priorities for the upcoming fiscal year are typically addressed during this phase of the budget cycle and ar e reflected in the University's divisional and central budgets. The Division of Academic Affairs administers approximately 70% of the funds provided by tuition and the state , which supports the faculty and staff that are responsible for carrying out the institution's mission . The Provost's Office does most of its budgeting work in the summer and fall. The Provost is advised by the Academic Planning Advisory Committee (APAC), which is co mprised of senior faculty appointed by the Provost. The SEC puts forward a list of nominees for the Provost's consideration. APAC was origin ally created by the Senate to advise the Provost on academic issues with significant resource implications, includin g the creation/elimination of Report for Senate Document #17-18-20 5 of 7 academic units or programs, strategic planning, major revisions of the undergraduate curriculum, resource real location, and the distribution of enhancement and research initiative funds. Finally, the budget itself is not read ily accessible or broadly understood. A PDF file of the University's detailed budget can be accessed through computer stations in the librar y, but the file format makes it challenging to extrapolate useful information. There appears to be broad confusion about the budget on the part of faculty, staff, and students. Therefore, educating the campus community on the budget itself and on the budge ting process is of critical importance . SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON UNIVERSITY FINANCE A new Special Committee on Universit y Finance will provide an opportunity for a Senate body to advise the President, the Senior Vice President and Provost, and other University administrators on budgetary matters as they pertain to institutional priorities. It will also provide guidance to t he Senate and can serve as a much -needed resource to help members of the campus community better understand the University's budge t. Charge The special committee is an advisory body with three primary purposes: to serve as a resource to help educate the campus on the University's budget; to serve as a resource to help advise the Senate and its standing committees on any recommendat ions under consideration; and to advise the University administration on short - and long -term planning and priorities. The spe cial committee will regularly report to the SEC, and will report at least twice a year to the full Senate. While the ERG Committee did not define these latter reports, members envision that the first will occur early in the fall semester and focus on provi ding Senators an overview of the University's budget and information on priorities for the upcoming year. The second could take pl ace at the Senate's annual Transition Meeting, where the special committee could provide a similar primer on the budget and report on the final budget approved by the state. The special committee's ability to fulfill its charge will depend on establishing a robust understanding of the University's budget and associated processes, which inform the ERG Committee 's decisions regarding membersh ip and operations. Membership The ERG Committee discussed at length the special committee's membership, and reviewed precedents f rom other Senate and Senate -related bodies (Appendix 3). It generally agreed that ex - officio members with relevant expertise w ould be critical to the work of the body, and carefully selected those members based on feedback from the administrative stakehold ers. Those members include: Past Chair of the Senate : The Past Chair will have served on the SEC for two years (as Chair Elect and as Chair), which will allow them to provide insights on both the operations of the SEC and of the full Senate. As a member o f the SEC, the Past Chair's presence will also facilitate regular communication with the SEC and Senate leadership. Associate Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer : The AVPF is the University's foremost authority on the budget and brings an unparalleled knowledge of the University's finances. The AVPF's insights will be critical in the special committee's early years and will inform its reports to the Senate. Associate Vice President for Finance and Personnel, Academic Affairs : The AVPFP is the chief financial officer of the Division of Academic Affairs, which is responsible for more than two-thirds of the insti tution's budget. Report for Senate Document #17-18-20 6 of 7 The President (or a representative) : Including a representative of the President broadens the special committee' s perspective and establishes a channel to the President to better communicate the special committee's process and thinking on issues under consideration. The Vice President for Student Affairs (or a representative) : The Division of Student Affairs includ es several self -support units, and a representative would provide the special committee important insights into that budget mo del and its interaction with the University's overall operating budget. A representative from among the current and former unit-level budget officers or former department chairs, appointed by the Provost : Budget officers have experience with managing dail y budget operations that would provide a valuable perspective to the special committee. As is the case on many other Senate committ ees, ex -officio members are given both voice and vote. The regular members of the special committee were chosen with several princi ples in mind. First, the body should remain within the ideal membership range identified by the Senate Office (Appendix 3). Second, the major Senate constituencies should all be represented. Finally, tenured/tenure -track faculty should comprise approximate ly the same percentage of the regular membership as they do in the Senate (50%). The committee considered whether some or al l of the members should be Senators, but decided that membership should be open to all , given one of the body's primary purposes is to help educate the broader campus on the budget . The committee settled on term lengths that match those of Senators: three years for faculty and staff, and one year for students. Given the importance of building knowledge of the budget, the student terms can be extended up to two times if the members are interested in continuing. Selection The ERG Committee explored a range of possible methods for selecting regular members. Members initially preferred the same approach as is used for the Senate's standin g committees, which involves a volunteer process conducted each April. Given the special committee would not be incorporated into the Senate Bylaws until after the start of the volunteer period, that option was not viable. The committee decided to allow Se nators to nominate members of the campus. The SEC would then select from among the nominees by constituency (i.e. the underg raduate student SEC members would select the undergraduate special committee members, the exempt staff members the exempt staff memb er, etc.). This parallels a process used in other instances, as when the SEC recently provided nominations for the upcoming presidential search committee. Vacancies will be filled by a similar process using nominees from the most recent nomination period. If there are no interested nominees, a new nomination period will be held. Operations Given the frequency of meetings will likely vary throughout the year based on the University's budgeting cycle, the special committee may establish its own meeting sched ule, with a minimum of one meeting per month during the academic year. Based on feedback from administrators, who emphasized the confidential nature of budget information during particular periods, the ERG Committee decided that meetings of the special com mittee should be closed, though its agendas will be public as with other Senate committees. The special committee may invite guests as necessary to inform its work. The Bylaws also include a provision dissolving the special committee Report for Senate Document #17-18-20 7 of 7 at the end of its thir d year of operation, which will occur whether or not the ERG Committee's comprehensive review recommends that the body be ma de permanent. RECOMMENDATIONS The Elections, Representation, & Governance (ERG) Committee recommends that Article 7 of the Senate By laws should be revised to create a Special Committee on University Finance, as defined in the document immediately following this report. The University Senate should charge the Elections, Representation, & Governance Committee with conducting a comprehen sive review of the Special Committee on University Finance in fall 2021 to determine whether it should be codified as a perm anent Senate body. As part of its review the ERG Committee should assess the special committee's charge, membership, and operations and recommend revisions to the Senate Bylaws, as appropriate, by March 30, 2022. The chair of the Special Committee on University Finance should provide annual updates to the ERG Committee on the special committee's progress and overa ll operations in spring 2020 and spring 2021, which will allow the ERG Committee to make any necessary adjustments and will provide context for the ERG Committee's comprehensive review in 2021 -2022.

Purdue The Committee shall be charged with continuing to collect and analyze data about Purdue's revenues and appropriations and to convey information about Purdue's budgetary policies to the Senate. Furthermore with coordination and consultation with the Univers ity Resources Policy Committee this Committee will work with the fiscal officers of the administration to examine and evaluate budgetary policies. Wisconsin We have a campus planning committee that advises administration on long -range development plans, building priorities, site selection, and aesthetic criteria, regarding facilities for research, instruction, recreation, parking and transportation, and other university functions. We also have a shared governance budget committee that advises administration on institutional budget issues, long -range financial strategies, state biennial budget proposals, and allocations to schools, colleges, and divisions. Both achieve their mission by meeting regularly (several times per semester) with relevant administration officials (up to and including the chancellor), issuing reports and recommendations, and generally serving as a resource both for administration and for sh ared governance bodies. Illinois The UIUC Senate Budget Committee is elected, and was designed to serve as advisor to the provost/chancellor on budget issues. Indiana The Budgetary Affairs Committee is the only committee of the Bloomington Faculty Council that is empowered t o speak to the administration on behalf of the council without necessarily first seeking the council's advice. This, in order to quickly respond to administrative proposals. I hadten to add that this power is used sparingly, and not in the past 6 years. Th e routine business if the BAC, under IU's RCM system, involves sitting in the provost's budget meetings with her deans, vice provosts, and auxiliary fund directors, to review their budget requests, comment on any new initiatives, and focus, especially on i ncremental new spending. Total increments will vary from $4 -11 million a year. The provost generally accepts 85 -95 percent of the committee's recommendations, and provides her rationale for differing on the other 5 -15 percent. Ohio State The Senate Fiscal Committee at Ohio State is a large and active committee th at considers all aspects of the university budget. More can be found about this committee at https://senate.osu.edu/committees/fiscal UCLA ADVISORY; INTERACTS WITH CFO AND HEAD OF ACADEMIC PLANNING ANDF BUDGET Nebraska It provide a review and comment on budget cuts Penn State The Co mmittee on University Planning solely and in consultation with other committees, shall report on and/or propose action on matters of University planning that affect development and alumni relations, physical plant resources, and the academic and financial policies of the University. In accordance with the Constitutional advisory and consultative roles of the Senate, specific areas of responsibilities include but are not limited to: the allocation of resources among units and functions as they relate to educ ational policy; academic planning, strategic planning, development planning, and campus and physical planning including safety and security of persons, buildings, and other facilities. The committee shall be the primary Senate body advisory to the Office of the President, including the Senior Vice President for Finance and Business/Treasurer, Senior Vice President for Development and Alumni Relations, and the Executive Vice President/Provost, for all planning functions; and shall review Appendix 2: Survey of Senate Leaders at Big 10 and Peer Institutions those functions of the University that contribute to the planning processes. The committee shall participate in the development and review of the master plans for each of the University's campuses and be consulted regularly in regards to proposed changes to those plans. In a ddition, this committee shall assist in creating an understanding of the University's planning functions among all units within the University. The committee shall have access to all information necessary to perform their charge. Minneso ta The Finance and Planning Co mmittee serves as the consultative body to the president and senior University officers on all major issues of planning, budget, resource allocation policy, and University operations. What is the level of engagement between the administration and the commi ttee? Do you feel the committee's input is valued by the administration? Purdue We have 5 administrators on the committee as liaisons. I believe that they value the input of the faculty on the committee and Senate. Wisconsin High engagement. The planning committee is chaired by the provost and the budget committee includes our chief budget officer and our vice provost for finance and administration . Both committees have substantial input and it is definitely valued by the administration. This is perhaps somewhat less true of the budget committee because it has only existed for 2 years, but administration and faculty and staff are working together to make it as integral to the budget process as the planning committee is to those issues. Illinois At this point: low to nonexistent. In the mid -1990s, our administration began appointing its own committees rather than calling on Senate committees. Indiana Absolutely, yes. It is part and oarcel of our system of shared governance at IU. Ohio State The chief financial officer of the university is a member of the committee and regularly attends meetings. The vice president of operations is also a member and attends every meeting. The four executive deans are members and take an active part in committee. The chief administrative officer in the office of academic affairs is also a member. So, there is a high level of engagement of administrators in the work of the committee. The office of business and finance puts a high level of value in the committee, and really doesn't make any major decisions without some level of input from the committee. UCLA MEETINGS ARE BIWEEKLY, OFTEN INVOLVE VISITS FROM SENIOR ADMINISTRATORS HANDLING BUDGET; TRADITIONAL LY, THE CFO HAS BEEN RESPONSIVE AND ENGAGED. OUR SENATE OF COURSE HAS NO GOVERNANCE OVER FINANCIAL MATTERS. Nebraska When needed. Yes Penn State Of the 22 members on the committee, including the chair and vice chair (both appointed University Faculty Senators), 3 major administ rators (including the University's Provost) sit on the committee, as does 1 student senator and 4 \"resource\" members (which are also primarily administrative in nature). The committee's design is not only to generate feedback in an attempt to influence a dministration and administrative decisions; the committee is also designed to report back to the Senate on construction projects, space allocation, and budgetary matters. Therefore, the success of the committee is not consider solely as a matter of the adm inistrative responsiveness to our input. That said, the structure at Penn State is designed to put members of the committee at the proverbial table wherein administrative decisions of some import are considered: For example, our University Planning Committ ee has \"LIAISON WITH OTHER SENATE, ADMINISTRATIVE, SPECIAL OR JOINT COMMITTEES\" including (1.) UPC Chair is a member of the Strategic Planning Implementation Oversight Committee; (2) Chair is also representative on Classroom Advisory Committee; (3.) UPC Representative on the Parking Appeal Committee (which must be a faculty member at University Park); and (4.) UPC Representative on the University Energy Conservation Policy Committee. Our feedback in those meetings is possible and available; however, asses sing fully and unambiguously the influence of the committee, its chair, and its representatives is difficult to summarize in any straightforward fashion. Suffice to say, the committee's input is not deemed more or less valuable than the input of any of t he other standing committees of the University Faculty Senate at Penn State. Minneso ta High level, with the Sr. VP for Finance & Operations, the VP for U Services, the assistant VP for Finances, the director of Finances, sitting on the committee as ex officio, no vot e. The committee's input is very much valued. What type of information/data does the committee receive from the administration in order to inform its work and how often does it receive updated information? Purdue salary averages per department; equity; and I'm not sure what else. The committee must request the information they desire. I don't believe that they have any automatic reports. That said, this committee was very active when originally created about 10 years ago. We kept re -electing the chair, however, and at some point he seemed to burn out and quit holding meetings. We have just found a new chair, a few new members, and hope to reinvigorate this committee. Wisconsin Both committees receive continual updates on whatever is relevant to them. Illinois We receive updates from the office of the Provost on a regular basis on budget matters . Indiana Almost anything it asks for. Ut is a \"blue sky\" type of relationship. Very open. Ohio State The committee really works hand and hand with the administration, such that the administration provides the committee and its subcommittees whatever data is needed for the committee to be informed and to provide advice. UCLA WE STRIVE FOR FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY. BUT DATA ON SOME PROJECTS AND OFFICES IS OFTEN HARD TO EXTRACT. OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, THE APB HEAD AQND THE CFP H AVE BEEN MORE FORTHCOMING ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL PRESENT AND OUR FINANCIAL FUTURE. Nebraska A budget plan, no other information Penn State In order to deliver their three annually mandated reports on construction, space allocation, and budgetary matters, the committee works with a dministration with regularity. In addition to mandated reports, the committee has additional charges they receive each year, which, in most if not all cases, require significant discussion with administration. Having the Provost on the committee, questions can be answered directly in committee or, at minimum, can be discovered in time and then shared with the committee at a later date. Also in attendance at each of the 6 meetings per year is our Senior Vice President Finance and Business as well as our Seni or Vice President Development and Alumni Relations. The \"loop,\" as it were, between faculty senators and administration is hardwired into the structure of the committee insuring in ongoing communication line between the two groups and they both seek mutual ly beneficial decisions for the University as a whole and strive to live up to the common goal of shared governance. Minneso ta It receives annual budget info, projected/anticipated issues, collegiate budget info, or whatever else the committee deems necessary. The co mmittee meets monthly for 2 hours and the committee leadership meets regularly with the Sr. VP. Does the committee fulfill a role that is not met by other Senate or university -level bodies? Purdue Yes. Wisconsin Yes. Illinois No. Indiana Yes. We have a well -defined division of labor here. Ohio State The senate fiscal committee plays a ce ntral role in the senate. It works with other committees to provide fiscal information about issues that impact the work of the other committees. UCLA THIS IS THE MAIN SENATE COUNCIL THAT FOCUSES ON FINANCE AND BUDGET. Nebraska Yes. Penn State At Penn State, we share the roles that mus t be met in order to conduct prudent business. The committee is more a complement than a gap -filler. Minneso ta It serves as the key body to address all U wide budget issues. Does the committee serve in an advisory role for other Senate or university -level committees? If so, does it involve formal charges or less formal consultation? Do you feel the committee's input improves the operation of those bodies and in what ways? Purdue Yes. They report to our University Resource Policy Committee (a Standing Committee of our Senate). Wisconsin Two seats on the planning committee are held by people who also serve on the academic planning council. There are also myriad informal ways that the two committees interact with other shared governance committees. Both committees report regularly to the Sen ate and other governance bodies. Illinois It does not serve for other senate committees . Indiana No. The campus committee is paralleled by a university -level committee that deals directly with the VP & CFO, and focuses mainly on university financial policies, such as debt man agement, building and capital improvements, etc. The main and regional campus BAC chairs sit on the university -level committee. I also chair that committee, in addition to the campus BAC. Ohio State Yes, the fiscal committee serves an advisory role for other senate co mmittees. In fact, the chair of the fiscal committee is also a member of the research committee by rule. The consultation with other committees is not formally described in rules. The coordination of the work of different committees is accomplished by th e senate steering committee and the faculty cabinet, which is comprised of the chairs of all 19 committees and councils. UCLA WE HAVE MANY STANDING SENATE COUNCILS AND COMMITTEES. ALL OF THEM INVOLVE PERIODIC INTERACTIONS WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT. SEVERAL INVOLVE MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE ACADEMIC PERSONNEL OFFICE. TWO HAVE THE POWER TO APPROVE ACADEMIC COURSES --THE UNDERGRADUATE COUNCIL AND THE GRADUATE COUNCIL. Nebraska No. Penn State Indeed, as indicated previously, not only is the roster integrated between senators and administrato rs, the committee members that are senators also sit on committees beyond the purview of the senate (for example, in committee work that considers all that constitutes university parking). The extent to which those senators are influential is not easy to e stimate, but Penn State is committed to shared governance, so, at minimum, their voices would not be censored or silenced under most any circumstance. Minneso ta The chair of the Finance & Planning Committee sits as ex officio, voting member on the Faculty Consultativ e and Senate Consultative Committees . What is the nature and extent of the training given to new members of this committee? Purdue None, to my knowledge. But our Nominating Committee requests volunteers so they are self -selected and often come from business, finance , economics, etc. and are quite knowledgeable already. The Nominating Committee looks for expertise, diversity (of all types - gender, racial as well as disciplinary), and interest when making selections. Wisconsin Varies. Illinois Need to take training on Open Meetings act, require d by the State . Indiana None. We coach them as we go. It is purely OJT! Ohio State There is a lot of continuity on the committee, but for those new members, there will be a one meeting orientation session at the start of the academic year. UCLA WE HAVE A TRANSITION MEETING THAT INFOR MS THE INCOMING CHAIR OF THE RELATIONSHIP HE/SHE/THEY HAS WITH THE SENATE OFFICE. Nebraska None. Penn State New senators go through a general orientation program; however, to the best of my knowledge, no special training is provided to individuals cycling onto the University Plannin g Committee (which is not an anomaly -- training usually happens in vivo during senate committee business rather than through a formal process before committee business begins). Minneso ta In the summer prior to the start of fall semester, the out going chair, staff and incoming chair meet to transition leadership; new leadership, staff, meet with ex officio and then at beginning of fall semester, the Senate Office along with the FCC Chair conducts an Committee Chairs' Orientation and then, at the first meeting of the committee, the Senate staff conducts a committee orientation. Is the membership structure (in terms of specific membership composition and term lengths) effective for fulfilling the committee's function? Why or why not? Purdue Yes, other than our continued re -election (arm twisting) of the original chair. We will stay on a 3 -year term limit, with the opportunity for renewal, in the future. Wisconsin Yes. There are representatives of all shared governance groups (including students) on both committees - and the appropriate ex officio administration members are also integrally involved. Illinois yes, there are 5 faculty, one staff, one graduate and one under -graduate student . Indiana Yes. The members are selected by the campus council's nominating committee. Ohio State The senate fiscal committee revised its membership recently to add more students. It is a large committee that is well designed to fulfil its duties. There are 9 faculty, 6 students, 3 staff, and 4 deans. There are also 4 fiscal officers in non -voting positions. The terms are 3 years for fac ulty and staff, 2 years for students, and not termed for administrative members. The committee accomplishes a lot of work (see AY 17 -18 annual report) partly because of its structure of having 4 active subcommittees. UCLA YES. OUR COMMITTEE ON COMMITTEES TRIES TO ENSURE GENDER EQUITY, REPRESENTATIONS OF COLLEAGUES FROM URMS, AND REPRESENTATION FROM MANY DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE CAMPUS, WHICH HOUSES A LARGE COLLEGE, MULTIPLE PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS, AND A LARGE CENTER FOR HEALTH SCIENCES. Nebraska Not sure . Penn State The term lengths on the commit tee are contingent on the senator's general term length, meaning, if a senator has recently won an election for a three -year term, their ability to serve the senate in any capacity is limited to those three years. That said, there is a limit on the number of years a faculty member can serve on the same committee, which is generally seen in a positive light. In terms of the composition of the committee, the combination of administrators, resource members, student senators, and, of course, University Faculty Senators does not appear to be out of balance at this time. The communication lines hardwired into the committee make reporting back to the Senate fairly straightforward, which creates opportunities for dialog between the administration (more generally) an d the senate (also more generally) on topics of relevance to planning, space, and budget. This has been an opportunity for dialog surrounding these issues that otherwise are simply less likely to come up spontaneously during, for example, the President's r emarks address the Senate on the state of the University. The answer, therefore, to the question is yes, for the moment, but we are always conducting self -assessment to think and rethink about our internal structure and access to administrative decision ma kers. Minneso ta Yes, because on a three - five year cycle each committee is reviewed in terms of its charge and membership. If a committee deems it necessary to add membership, it can make a proposal to Committee on Committees and then that goes to the appropriate co nsultative committee and finally to the appropriate senate for action. Is there anything else you would like to tell us? Penn State Reasonable expectations from a planning committee are essential, especially in the e arly years of a committee. Because university senates have primary jurisdiction over academics and curriculum, and to protect academic freedom, our \"final\" (so to say) influence on budgetary decisions can be limited even if our input is vital. It would be a mistake with regard to interpretation to see a planning committee as \"not influential\" because they do not obviously or forcefully shape administrative budgetary plans related to construction. Senate -Related Membership Models The University Senate has several different types of bodies outlined in the University's Plan of University's Plan of Organization and Senate Bylaws . These include the Senate Executive Committee, the Committee on Committees, the Nominations Committee, Standing and Special Committees, and University Councils (see Article 8 of the Plan). Senate Executive Committee (SEC) The regular membership of the SEC is elected by continuing and incoming Senators at the annual Transition Meeting of the Senate. The regular membership includes 15 Senators : Chair of the Senate Chair -Elect of the Senate 7 faculty Senators 2 staff Senators (one exempt, one non -exempt) 2 undergraduate student Senators 2 graduate student Senators In addition, it includes 4 non -voting ex -officio members: President or representative Senior Vice President and Provost or representative Executive Secretary & Director of the Senate Parliamentarian Committee on Committees The Committee on Committees is responsible for the identification and recruitment of individuals for service on Senate and University committees and councils. The membership of the committee is elected by continuing and incoming Senators at the annual Transition Meeting of the Senate. It includes 11 Senators: Chair -Elect of the Senate 6 faculty Senators 2 staff Senators (one exempt, one non-exempt) 1 undergraduate student Senator 1 graduate student Senator Nominations Committee The Nominations Committee identifies candidates for Chair -Elect, members of other elected committees of the Senate, and members of other bodies to which the Sena te sends representatives. The membership of the committee is elected by continuing and incoming Senators at the annual Transition Meeting of the Senate. In addition to the Chair -Elect, it includes 8 outgoing Senators: Chair -Elect of the Senate 4 faculty Senators UNIVERSITY SENATE ERG COMMITTEE Existing Senate -Related Membership Models Appendix 3: Existing Senate-Related Membership Models 2 staff Senators (one exempt, one non -exempt) 1 undergraduate student Senator 1 graduate student Senator Standing & Special Committees The Senate's 10 standing committees have memberships ranging from 11 (Student Conduct) to 23 (Educational Affairs, Staff Affairs, and Student Affairs). The average size is just under 20 members. During the last review of the University's Plan of Organizati on, the ERG Committee determined that the ideal committee size was between 18 and 21 members (see Appendix 1 ). Each spring, members of the campus community can volunteer to be considered for these committees. The Committee on Committees meets in the spring and early summer to develop slates of members, which are voted on by the Senate at its first meeting in the fall. Each standing committee has ex -officio representatives relevant to the committee's charge. In nearly all cases, ex -officio committee members are voting ( the Staff Affairs , Faculty Affairs , and Student Conduct Committees have at least one non-voting ex -officio member). See Appendix 2 for membership details. University Councils Provisions for University Councils are established in Article 7 of the Senate Bylaws. They are jointly sponsored by and report to the Senate and particular members of the administration or to a dean. There are currently three: the University IT Council, th e University Library Council, and the University Research Council. The membership of each Council includes between 9 and 13 regular members, who are jointly appointed by the designated administrator and the Senate . Each Council also has ex - officio represen tatives , who should be non -voting . The Athletic Council is established separately in the University Plan and Bylaws, and has different provisions than the other Councils. See Appendix 3 for membership details. 1100 Marie Mount Hall College Park, Maryland 20742- 4111 Tel: (301) 405- SENATE MEMORANDUM TO: Plan of Organization Review Committee FROM: The Senate Office SUBJECT: Consideration of Senate Committee Size The Senate Office has concerns about the overall size of some of the Senate committees. The Elections, Representation, and Governance (ERG) Committee may be charged with considering Senate committee membership changes on an ad hoc basis as representation issues arise. While the ERG Committee does an excellent job of addressing specific issues, we believe that the Plan of Organization Review Committee should conduct a holistic review of all Senate committee memberships. Specifically, the total membership of large committees should be reconsidered because our experience shows that they historically have scheduling and participation issues. If you look at the overall committee sizes, there are a few committees that have between 23 and 31 members, which has proven to be difficult to manage for the following reasons: 1.Large committees are hard to schedule. It is easier to get a consistent and largermajority with a somewhat smaller committee size. 2.Committee members on large committees are more apt to not show up to meetings because they may feel like there are enough members to make up for their absence. 3.Committee members on large committees do not have as many opportunities to speak in committee meetings and as a result may feel less engaged in the committee's work. 4.Large committees have a difficult time coming to consensus on issues because there are so many voices in the discussion. A spreadsheet of the attendance/participation in all of our committees over the last two years is included for your reference. We believe that the ideal committee size is somewhere in the range of 18-21 members. There are four committees that are larger than that with 23, 27, 29, and 31 members. We think that lowering the overall size of these committees could be beneficial. There are opportunities for the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Committee, the Staff Affairs Committee, the Student Affairs Committee, and the Educational Affairs Committee to be downsized. We believe that slightly downsizing these committees will not drastically affect representation but will allow the committees to be more effective. We propose the following changes that we hope can be discussed when reviewing the committee memberships in the Bylaws: EDI: Currently this committee has 23 members. We propose removing 2 undergrads and potentially 1 staff and 1 faculty member bringing the total to 19. The undergrads are Appendix 1: Committee Size Memo 2 historically at the lower attendance rates and this change would align this committee with student representation on other committees like Campus Affairs and ERG , which have 2 graduate students and 2 undergraduates . Staff Affairs: Currently this committee has 31 members. We already removed 2 staff seats because of the new Senate categories, switched the alternate members of CUSS to be non-voting ex -officios, and removed the University Relations Ex-Officio, so that makes the new total 25. We propose also removing 2 faculty from the committee to align with representation on Faculty Affairs, which only has 1 staff member; we also propose removing 1 student from the committee, leaving 1 student seat (students and faculty typically tend to have less interest in this committee in terms of volunteer rates ). That brings the total down to 22, which is closer to our ideal window. This would allow the main constituent groups on the Faculty Affairs and Staff Affairs Committees to be better aligned. Student Affairs: Currently this committee has 29 members. We already agreed to remove the University Relations Ex-Officio so our new total is 28. We propose that we reduce the undergrads from 10 to 8 for a total of 12 student member s, which is still two more than Faculty Affairs and Staff Affairs have in their main constituency representation. We also propose reducing the faculty from 3 to 2, removing the ex -officio rep for the Provost (because they already have a Grad School rep that could help with graduate life issues , and since academic issues are not typically handled in this committee and would go to APAS, PCC, or Ed Affairs, which all have a Provost's rep already), and removing the Administration and Finance ex-officio rep because they are already represented on the Campus Affairs Committee. That brings our total to 23, which is closer to our ideal window without drastically cutting the committee size or reducing representation. In addition, we propose that PORC consider revisions involving the General Educati on Committee and the Educational Affairs Committee. The General Education Committee was developed in place of the CORE Committee when the new General Education Program was developed. While the committee serves an important role by providing oversight, the committee has not had much else to do since the implementation of the program, and it cancels the large majority of its meetings . The Educational Affairs and Academic Procedures and Standards Committee s are charged to consider other academic issues so there is not much for the Gen Ed Committee to do. One option is to fold the Gen Ed oversight responsibility into the Educational Affairs Committee's charge. If PORC decides to merge Ed Affairs and Gen Ed, our proposal for membership would bring that committee to 28 total members, which is much larger than we would like. Our only suggestion is to remove the Dean for Undergraduate Studies from the membership because the committee would have a different relationship with the Dean once it incorporates the Gen Ed responsibilities and he/she is already represented by three other reps (Honors/Scholars/Gen Ed). Because this merger is a relatively new concept, it is more reasonable to start with a larger committee and reevaluate the membership during the next PORC review. 2013-2014 Staff Affairs Student Affairs Ed Affairs EDI APAS Campus Affairs Gen Ed FAC PCC ERGStudent Conduct Committee Size (Voting Members) 31 29 25 23 21 21 21 18 18 16 10 Quorum 12 12 11 11 10 9 11 8 9 8 6 Total Members: 3 Faculty 12 Staff 0 Graduate 2 Undergrad 13 Ex-Officios 3 Faculty 2 Staff 5 Graduate 10 Undergrad 7 Ex-Officios 1 SGA Ex-Officio 1 GSG Ex-Officio 12 Faculty 2 Staff 1 Graduate 2 Undergrad 7 Ex-Officios (2 non-voting) 1 SGA Ex-Officio 1 GSG Ex-Officio 6 Faculty 6 Staff 2 Graduate 4 Undergrad 4 Ex-Officios 10 Faculty 0 Staff 2 Graduate 3 Undergrad 4 Ex-Officios 6 Faculty 2 Staff 2 Graduate 2 Undergrad 6 Ex-Officios 1 SGA Ex-Officio 1 GSG Ex-Officio 12 Faculty 0 Staff 1 Graduate 3 Undergrad 4 Ex-Officios 10 Faculty 1 Staff 2 Graduate 1 Undergrad 3 Ex-Officios 10 Faculty 0 Staff 1 Graduate 2 Undergrad 4 Ex-Officios 7 Faculty 2 Staff 2 Graduate 2 Undergrad 2 Ex-Officios 4 Faculty 0 Staff 1 Graduate 4 Undergrad 1 Ex-Officio (non-voting) 2013-2014 Number of meetings: 7 5 8 9 0 9 2 10 8 9 8 Faculty Total Attendance 16 7 49 14 n/a 24 12 63 49 29 26 Total Opportunities 18 15 96 54 n/a 54 24 100 70 63 36 Percentage in 11 39 n/a 11 n/a 7 n/a 14 n/a Total Opportunities 72 15 16 54 n/a 18 n/a 10 n/a n/a 5 4 5 n/a 5 1 17 4 8 4 Total Opportunities n/a 20 8 28 n/a 18 2 20 8 18 8 Percentage in Attendance 25% 50% 18% 28% 50% 85% 50% 44% 50% Undergraduate Students Total Attendance 2 16 6 8 n/a 5 2 4 9 11 13 Total Opportunities 14 50 16 36 n/a 18 6 10 16 18 32 Percentage 14 41 29 n/a 28 8 19 23 11 8 Total Opportunities 78 35 56 36 n/a 54 8 30 28 18 9 Percentage in Staff Affairs Student Affairs Ed Affairs EDI APAS Campus Affairs Gen Ed FAC PCC ERGStudent Conduct Committee Size (Voting Members) 31 29 27 23 21 21 21 18 18 16 11 Quorum 12 12 11 11 10 9 11 8 9 8 6 Total Members: 3 Faculty 12 Staff 0 Graduate 2 Undergrad 13 Ex-Officios 3 Faculty 2 Staff 5 Graduate 10 Undergrad 7 Ex-Officios 1 SGA Ex-Officio 1 GSG Ex-Officio 12 Faculty 2 Staff 1 Graduate 2 Undergrad 7 Ex-Officios (2 non-voting) 1 SGA Ex-Officio 1 GSG Ex-Officio 6 Faculty 6 Staff 2 Graduate 4 Undergrad 4 Ex-Officios 10 Faculty 0 Staff 2 Graduate 3 Undergrad 4 Ex-Officios 6 Faculty 2 Staff 2 Graduate 2 Undergrad 6 Ex-Officios 1 SGA Ex-Officio 1 GSG Ex-Officio 12 Faculty 0 Staff 1 Graduate 3Undergrad 4 Ex-Officios 10 Faculty 1 Staff 2 Graduate 1 Undergrad 3 Ex-Officios 10 Faculty 0 Staff 1 Graduate 2 Undergrad 4 Ex-Officios 7 Faculty 2 Staff 2 Graduate 2 Undergrad 2 Ex-Officios 4 Faculty 0 Staff 1 Graduate 4 Undergrad 1 Ex-Officio (non-voting) 2012-2013 Number of meetings: 8 6 8 8 6 10 4 10 7 11 9 Faculty Total Attendance 5 10 53 16 35 27 29 55 56 55 23 Total Opportunities 14 18 96 48 60 60 48 100 70 77 36 Percentage in 14 32 n/a 15 n/a 10 n/a 15 9 Total Opportunities 96 12 16 48 n/a 20 n/a 10 n/a 22 Attendance n/a 15 0 8 7 9 1 4 4 15 9 Total Opportunities n/a 24 8 16 12 20 4 20 7 22 9 Percentage in Attendance Students Total Attendance 4 31 5 6 10 11 6 2 5 4 22 Total Opportunities 16 60 16 32 18 20 12 10 14 22 36 Percentage in Attendance 54 27 32 24 19 31 12 23 20 13 9 Total Opportunities 104 42 52 32 24 60 16 30 28 22 9 Percentage in Percentage 67% 50% 50% Size Members (plus chair) Ex-Officios Academic Procedures & Standards 21 10 faculty 1 staff 1 grad 3 undergrad s Provost, Director of Undergraduate Admissions, Registrar, Dean for Undergraduate Studies, Dean of the Grad School (or rep resentatives of each) Campus Affairs 21 6 faculty 2 staff 2 grad 2 undergrad SGA President, GSG President, Provost, VP Admin & Finance, VP Student Affairs, VP University Relations, Chief Diversity Officer, Chair of Coaches Council (or rep s) Educational Affairs 23 10 faculty (at least 2 each of T/TT, PTK) 2 staff 1 grad 2 undergrad SGA President, GSG President, Provost, Dean for Undergraduate Studies, Dean of the Grad School, VP for IT (or rep s); Associate Dean for General Education ERG 15 6 faculty 2 staff (exempt, non -exempt) 2 grad 2 undergrad Director of UHR, Assoc.

UNIVERSITY SENATE CHARGE Charged: August 27 , 2018 | Deadline: February 8, 2019 Appendix 4: Charge from the Senate Executive Committee1 of 2 Enhancing Senate Input on University Planning and Resources The Senate is the primary shared governance body at the University and includes elected representatives of the faculty, staff, and students. The Senate's primary role is to advise, consult with, and make recommendations to the University's administrators. This is defined in the University of Maryland Plan of Organization for Shared Governance, which states: Subject to the authority of the Board of Regents, the Chancellor, and the President, the Senate shall consider any matter of concern including, but not limited to, educational, budgetary, and personnel matters; campus-community matters; long-range plans; facilities; and faculty, staff, and student affairs. The Senate shall advise the President, the Chancellor, or the Board of Regents, as it deems appropriate. In addition, Article 1 of the Plan defines the Senate and its Functions. In 1.3.p., one of those functions includes: Consult and advise on long-range plans as they relate to institutional budget, physical plant development, and other aspects of campus life including ways in which these aspects may be improved, and provide means to keep such plans under continual review. The Senate's effectiveness as an advisory body hinges on its ability to make informed recommendations. In order to facilitate this, an open and transparent budgeting process is necessary. While the majority of the Senate's work focuses on policy, the campus budget is where policy is put into action. The Senate and its committees should have a clear understanding of the fiscal issues facing the campus in order to fully identify the implications of potential recommendations under consideration. A top priority in the University's budgeting process should be enhancing academic excellence on campus. A well-informed Senate can provide valuable input from the various perspectives of the campus community toward this end, and can provide the advice needed to help the administration make the best possible budgetary and policy decisions. A clear understanding of the budget can also help members of the Senate to understand the fiscal issues facing the campus, provide the campus community the means to ask relevant and informed questions, and aid in developing future campus leaders. This level of clarity would allow the Senate to serve as a valuable conduit for disseminating information and educating the campus community on the complexities of resource realities and could also help reduce false assumptions about how campus resources are being utilized.

The proposed committee would provide transparency in the budgeting process, and ensure the administration has perspectives from the campus community as it considers priorities and implements policies. Proposed Membership: The members of the committee should include students, faculty, staff, and ex-officio representatives of the administration. Members of the committee should be selected by the Committee on Committees primarily from a slate of nominees provided by the Senate Executive Committee, and should include but not be limited to members of the campus community with budgetary experience. Ex-officio representatives on the committee should include members of the administration that are sufficiently knowledgeable on the campus budget such as the Associate Vice President for Finance and Personnel, the Chief Financial Officer, and/or any other representative of the Provost. Proposed Committee Charge: (1) Review, on a continuing basis, the fiscal policies and resources of the university; (2) Act as a vehicle to provide analysis and advice to the administration on strategies for the long-term and short-term allocation of university resources consistent with maintaining the missions of the university; (3) Report annually to the Senate on the budgetary and fiscal condition of the university and upon the request of the Senate Executive Committee; and (4) Act as a resource to other Senate committees on the fiscal implications of proposed legislation. The creation of a new standing committee of the Senate would require a change to the Senate Bylaws. Many other major research universities, including the vast majority of our Big Ten peers have developed effective models for providing budgetary advice to their administrations through comparable committees.

The Special Committee will operate until May 2022, at which time the Senate will decide whether it sho uld be codified as a permanent body. Charge to the Special Committee The Special Committee on University Finance (SCUF) is charged with advising the administration on institutional priorities and with educating the Senate and the campus community on the U niversity's budget and the budget process. Members of the committee are responsible for developing a deep understanding of the University's budget and budgeting processes. SCUF gives the Senate a role in advising the administration on short - and long -term planning, and in ensuring that academic excellence and the University's educational and research missions are key considerations when budgetary priorities are determined. SCUF also serves as a resource to the campus community to help improve understanding of the budget, and advises the Senate and Senate -related bodies on the fiscal implications of recommendations under consideration. SCUF will be integral to the Senate's ability to make informed decisions and recommendations, and will be central in demystif ying the complexities of our current resource tensions. Membership and Election Process The committee's membership includes: A chair, who is a tenured faculty member; five tenured or tenure -track faculty members; one professional track faculty me mber; one exempt staff member; one non -exempt staff member; two undergraduate students; one graduate student; the immediate Past Chair of the Senate; the Associate Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer; the Associate Vice President for Finance and Personnel, Academic Affairs; a representative of the President; a representative of the Vice President for Student Affairs; and a representative chosen from among current and former unit -level budget officers or former depa rtment chairs, selected by the Senior Vice President and Provost. In spring 2019, the University Senate opened a nomination period for faculty, staff, and student seats on SCUF. Senators representing each constituency submitted nominations and were encour aged to ask for nominations from their colleagues. The elected members of the Senate Executive Committee for each constituency voted to elect representatives to SCUF. The full membership of SCUF was announced in June 2019. Fall 2019 Committee Activities SCUF began meeting in September 2019, and decided to focus its efforts in Fall 2019 on developing a deep understanding of University finances. Working in collaboration with its ex - officio representatives from the University administration, SCUF developed a series of educational briefings for committee members. The briefings included the following topics: The Macro View of University Finances The Basics of the Governor's Budget 2 Financial Improvement Initiatives Student Enrollments and Tuition Allocation of R esources across Colleges and Divisions Auxiliaries and Student Support Services Capital Budget and Facilities Renewal Greater College Park Investment Allocation of Resources to Faculty and Staff Overview of the Budget Request Process Progress on Charge El ements: Educational Charge SCUF is charged to \"Develop a deep understanding of the University's budget and budgeting processes and use that knowledge to educate the campus community on these practices.\" In service of this charge element, SCUF spent the fal l semester learning about the various facets of the budget. This will allow the committee to educate the campus community and advise the administration from a more informed perspective. Progress on Charge Elements: Advisory Charge SCUF is charged to \"Con sult with and advise the President, the Senior Vice President and Provost, and other University administrators on short - and long -term institutional priorities, particularly as they relate to the University's mission and Strategic Plan.\" SCUF is reviewing the priorities in the University's Strategic Plan and developing a list of data needed to appropriately assess budget priorities. Data that show trends over time along various dimensions will help the committee better understand how the Strategic Plan is r eflected in budget decisions. The committee expects to work collaboratively with the University administration to gather the appropriate data that it needs to make the budget more transparent and so the committee can be effective in its role in providing p erspectives and advice on alignment of the budget with the Strategic Plan. This open exchange of information and collaboration is a critical element to ensuring the success of the committee. As the committee works to collect the data needed to ensure the quality and accuracy of its recommendations, SCUF is also considering how to develop processes and timelines that will ensure its recommendations have an impact on the University's budgeting process. SCUF is reviewing the budget timeline to determine wheth er there are specific points in the budget process where recommendations would have the most significant impact. Plans for Future Development SCUF plans to develop informational materials about the University's budget and share them publicly on the Sena te website. This information will be updated annually so that it remains current, and it will be shared with Senators. As part of this effort, the committee plans to develop a Frequently Asked Questions list, featuring some common questions and myths about the budget process. The committee will work with the University administration to find answers to those questions and will share information about those topics in a user -friendly way. SCUF will also begin assessing trends over time based on the data it receives from the administration. This will allow the committee to gain a deeper understanding of how the Strategic Plan has been implemented through the budget and provide opportunities for the committee to identify how best to leverage budget opportuniti es to further the goals identified in the Strategic Plan. SCUF began its first year with the intention of learning and developing plans.

The program has graduated more than 300 students now working in government agencies, academic settings, and private research firms. JPSM proposes to rename its M .S. program in \"Survey Methodology \" to \"Survey and Data Science .\" The field of survey methodology has evolved over the years as data about opinion and behavior has become available in large quantities. The courses in the program have also evolved over time to reflect the rise of big data. Consequently, the name change wi ll better reflect the current state of the field and training that the program provides. This name change will help the program to recruit more students to the program and increase the employment opportunities for graduates as the new title reflects the br oader scope of the program to employers . The proposed name change was endorsed by the Graduate School Programs, Curricula, and Courses committee on March 26 , 2020 , and by the Senate Programs, Curricula, and Courses committee on April 3 , 2020 . RECOMMENDAT ION(S) The Senate Committee on Programs, Curricula, and Courses recommends that the Senate approve this name change . COMMITTEE WORK The committee considered this proposal at its meeting on April 3 , 2020 . The committee met with the program's Executive Director , Jody Williams , and Wayne McIntosh, Associate Dean of the College of Behavioral and Social Sciences. The two made a brief presentation and responded to questions . The committee voted unanimously to endorse the name change.

It should be specically acknowledged that students enrolled in the program prior to the effective date of any curriculum change may complete their program under the old requirements if they wish. The courses required must remain available, or suitable substitutions specically designated. Yes, we agree. Linked Programs Renaming Program Provide a rationale for renaming the program. There are only two programs in the United States that offer graduate training in survey methodology, the Joint Program in Survey Methodology at the University of Maryland and the MIchigan Program in Survey Methodology at the University of Michigan which whose curricula, instructions, and admissions are highly integrated. The eld has been changing over time, with a growing interest in naturally occurring data about opinion and behavior, often available in large quantities, i.e. big data. Our programs have adjusted our curriculum to include this expanded focus, and we are considering a corresponding name change to reflect this evolution in the eld and in the training we provide. Our goal is to identify increase enrollment and employability of graduates as well as the programs' visibility by clearly communicating to the appropriate communities what we do and what our prospective students can expect to learn. The name M.S. in Survey and Data Science will: -Reflect the current curriculum, communicating that the program has expanded to address the fast-paced changes in survey research. -Describe the focus of the program more accurately to our peers and colleagues, including potential employers of the graduates -Increase ability to recruit students who are interested in data science, without reducing our ability to recruit students who are interested in survey methodology (and without alienating alumni).

The policy was created and approved in spring 2019 (Senate Document # 18-19-09). The proposal noted concerns raised in implementation discussions regarding earned credits for repeated courses . In November 2019, the SEC voted to charge the Academic Procedures and Standards (APAS) Committee with review of the proposal (Appendix 1). COMMITTEE WORK The APA S Committee began its review of the charge at its meeting on February 19, 2020 . It reviewed the current policy and the proposal . APAS consulted with the proposer , as well as with the Undergraduate Student Ombudsperson and the Office of the Registrar. The c ommittee also consulted with the Office of General Counsel (OGC) during its review . In development of the policy during the 2018 -2019 academic year , the APAS Committee determined that students should only receive credit for one attempt at any course. APAS developed language for the policy that indicates that the earned credit from the most recent attempt of the course will be applied . However, in discussing how to implement the new policy, advisors noted that this practice could disadvantage students and result in a reduction of their credits . There may be instances where a student takes a four-credit course and then takes a three -credit duplicate course in which content and learning objectives overlap sufficiently with those of the original course ; in these cases, the policy states that credit should not be earned for both courses . Under the current policy, th e student would have one credit removed from their transcript , since the second attempt at the course was for fewer credits than the first attem pt. 2019 -2020 Committee Members Date of Submission UNIVERSITY SENATE REPORT | #19-20-27 Academic Procedures & Standards (APAS) Committee Report for Senate Document # 19-20-27 2 of 2 APAS learned that the loss of credit in these cases may not be found until the transcript is reviewed when a student applies for graduation, so there may be students who are kept from graduating because they did not know how earned credit is impacted by repeated courses. The committee agreed that this would be an unintended consequence of its prior work, and recognized the significant impact this could have on students . The committee also noted that the impact of this could be uneven, depending on whe ther students and advisors are aware of the rule or whether they discover the discrepancy in credits during their review of the transcript in the years prior to graduation. APAS found that there was no underlying principle reason for applying the credits from the final attempt rather than the highest number of earned credits. The committee affirmed its prior determination that students should only earn credit from one attempt at a course, but agreed that it would be appropriate to ensure that students reta in the higher number of credits. The committee developed a minor revision to the policy to address the issue. After consideration, the APAS Committee voted to approve the proposed revisions to the policy in an email vote concluding on March 20 , 2020. RECOMMENDATIONS The APAS Committee recommends that the proposed revisions to the University of Maryland Undergraduate Student Course Repeat Policy (III-1.50[A ]) as shown immediately following this report be approved. APPENDICES Appendix 1 \u2014 Charge from the Senate Executive Committee Proposed Revisions from the APAS Committee New Text in Blue/Bold ( example ), Removed Text in Red/Strikeout ( example ) III-1.50(A) UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT COURSE REPEAT POLICY (Approved by the President May 3, 2019) I. Purpose Undergraduate students at the University of Maryland may repeat courses within the guidelines specified in this policy. The University acknowledges that students may not realize success in an initial attempt at a course for a variety of reasons. This pol icy aims to address those challenges while promoting timely progress towards completion of degree programs and the efficient use of instructional resources. II. Policy A. It is the policy of the University of Maryland that undergraduate students may repeat courses that were initially attempted at the University in accordance with the following guidelines: 1. A course that was previously attempted at the University can be repeated once. 2. A maximum of 18 attempted credits may be repeated . B. Exceptions to Section II-A 1. A student may request an exception to this policy due to extenuating circumstances by appealing to the dean of the student's primary advising college and by providing the following: a) A well -documented justification for granting such an exception; b) The student's plan for successfully completing the course and degree; and c) The student's planned course of action should the exception not facilitate the desired outcome. III. Definitions A. An \"Attempt\" of a course refers to a course taken at the University for which a student received a grading symbol or marking (A+ through F, XF, P, S, W, I, NG, or AU) identified in the University of Maryland Grading Symbols and Notations Used on III-1.50(A) page 2 Academic Transcripts ( III-6.20[A]). An \"Attempt\" also refers to a course taken at another institution subsequent to an Attempt taken at the University of Maryland. An \"Attempt\" does not refer to a course taken during a semester in which a complete withdrawal (designated with a WW) was processed. B. An \"Initial Attempt\" of a course refers to the first time the course was attempted at the University of Maryland. C. \"Prior Learning Credit\" refers to academic credit awarded for knowledge and achievements gained through prior learning, or competency -based education experiences as described in the University of Maryland Policy and Procedures Concerning Credit for Prior Learning (III -1.41[A]). D. \"Repeated Course\" refers to a subsequent Attempt of a course initially attempted at the Univers ity of Maryland that ha s not been designa ted as repeatable for additional credit, as described in Section IV below . E. \"Transfer Credit\" refers to academic credit awarded for post -secondary courses generally completed at regionally accredited institutions of higher education. IV. Types of Repeated Courses A. A course is considered a repeat if it is: 1. the same course with the same course number; 2. the same course offered under a new number (indicated in the Schedule of Classes as \"Formerly\"); 3. the same course offered using a cross -listed number (indicated in the Schedule of Classes as \"Also offered as\" or \"Credit only granted for\"); 4. a different c ourse in which content and learning objectives overlap sufficiently with those of the original course, such that course credit should not be earned for both courses (indicated in the Schedule of Classes as \"Credit only granted for\"); or 5. a transfer course that is determined to be equivalent to a University of Maryland course, and is taken after the Initial Attempt at the University. B. Some courses may not be available for a subsequent Attempt, or may have restrictions in place that do not a llow a student to retake them. III-1.50(A) page 3 V. Impact of Repeated Courses on Total Credits Earned and GPA Calculation All University of Maryland grades and course Attempts will remain on the student's transcript . A. Total Credits Earned: students earn credit for only one Attempt of a course. The earned credit comes from the most recent Attempt of the course. In cases where the earned credit for multiple Attempts differs, the highest number of earned credits will be used. B. GPA Calculation: students' cumulative GPA calculations will include all credits attempted in courses at the University of Maryland, except as described in section VI below. VI. New Student Provision A. To assist in the transition to the University of Maryland, cumulative GPA s for undergraduate students will be calculated using only the most recent grade from Repeated Courses attempted at the University in accordance with the following conditions: 1. When the Initial Attempt of the Repeated Course was taken within the student's f irst semester (Fall or Spring semester) at the University of Maryland; or 2. When the Initial Attempt of the Repeated Course was taken prior to or within the term in which the student reaches their 24th credit hour attempted, including transfer credits earne d after high school graduation. B. Students may decline the New Student Provision for any course(s) by notifying the dean of their primary advising college at any time prior to the graduation application deadline of the student's term of graduation. The decision to decline the New Student Provision is final and will result in all corresponding grades being included in the GPA calculation . C. The New Student Provision can only be exercised for Attempts and repeats of courses taken at the University of Maryland and do es not apply to Transfer or Prior Learning Credit. Amendment to the University of Maryland Undergraduate Student Course Repeat Policy (Senate Document # 19-20-27) Academic Procedures & Standards (APAS) Committee | Chair: William Reed The Senate Executive Committee (SEC) and Senate Chair Lanford request that the Academic Procedures & Standards (APAS) Committee review the proposal entitled, \"Amendment to the University of Maryland Undergraduate Student Course Repeat Policy\". Specifically, the APAS Committee should: 1. Review the University of Maryland Undergraduate Student Course Repeat Policy ( III-1.50[A] ). 2. Consult with the proposer, the Associate Dean for General Education. 3. Consult with a representative of the Office of the Registrar. 4. Consult w ith the Undergraduate Ombudsperson. 5. Consider whether the current policy disadvantages undergraduate students with regard to earned credit. 6. Consult with a representative of the Office of General Counsel on any proposed changes to University policy or associ ated guidelines. 7. If appropriate, recommend whether the policy should be amended based on the committee's consideration of the above items. We ask that you submit a report to the Senate Office no later than March 13, 2020. If you have questions or need assi stance, please contact Reka Montfort in the Senate Office at reka@umd.edu or 301.40 5.5804. UNIVERSITY SENATE CHARGE Charged: January 30, 2020 | Deadline: March 13, 2020 NAME/TITLE EMAIL PHONE UNIT CONSTITUENCY DESCRIPTION OF ISSUE DESCRIPTION OF CHANGE YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE UNIVERSITY SENATE Submitted on:PROPOSAL SUGGESTION FOR HOW YOUR PROPOSAL WOULD BE PUT INTO PRACTICE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Review of the UMD Policies and Procedures Concerning Tuition Remission ISSUE In November 2019, the Senate Executive Committee (SEC) received a proposal calling for the revision of two University policies addressing tuition remission for employees, their spouses, and dependent children. The proposal noted that neither policy has been updated since 1991, and neither accur ately reflects current practice or University System of Maryland (USM) policies. In January 2020, the SEC charged the Staff Affairs Committee with reviewing both policies, consulting with relevant stakeholders, reviewing similar policies and procedures at Big 10 and peer institutions, considering whether certain elements of the policies should be aligned with current practice, and recommending changes to the policies, as appropriate . RECOMMENDATION The Staff Affairs Committee recommends that the University of Maryland, College Park Policy and Procedures Concerning Tuition Remission for Faculty and Staff be revised as indicated in the document immediately following this report. The Staff Affairs Committee recommends that the University of Maryland, College Pa rk Procedures Concerning Tuition Remission for Spouses and Dependent Children of Faculty and Staff be revised as indicated in the document immediately following this report. The Staff Affairs Committee recommends that the University consider reviewing the fees paid by employees who take courses at the institution and determ ine which should be considered mandatory . COMMITTEE WORK The Staff Affairs Committee consulted University Human Resources on the policies and on current practice regarding tuition remission for employees and their spouses and dependent children. The committee also reviewed USM policies covering tuition remission, and considered policies and procedures at other USM institutions. The committee developed revisions to more closely align with USM policies and current University practice, and that more directly focus on employees at this institution . PRESENTED BY Jane Hirshberg , Chair REVIEW DATES SEC - April 10, 2020 | SENATE - April 22, 2020 VOTING METHOD In a single vote RELEVANT POLICY/DOCUMENT VII-4.10(A) Policy and Procedures Concerning Tuition Remission for Faculty and Staff VII-4.20(A) Procedures Concerning Tuition Remission for Spouses and Dependent Children of Faculty and Staff NECESSARY APPROVALS Senate, President UNIVERSITY SENATE TRANSMITTAL | #19-20-25 Staff Affairs Committee The committee also considered the mandatory fees that are charged to employees who take courses, which are the same fees as are charged to undergradua te and graduate students. In some cases, employees have been charged separately for services and privileges that should have been covered by their mandatory fees, due to their dual roles as employees and students. While the USM policy requires that employe es pay mandatory fees, the committee noted that it may be possible for the University to consider establishing a new category of mandatory fees that are specific to employees who take courses, which led to the committee's administrative recommendation . After due consideration, the Staff Affairs Committee voted to approve the revised policies and an administrative recommendation by an email vote concluding on April 6, 2020 . ALTERNATIVES The Senate could choose not to approve the revisions to the Policy and Procedures Concerning Tuition Remission for Faculty and Staff and the Procedures Concerning Tuition Remission for Spouses and Dependent Children of Faculty and Staff . However, the University would lose the opportunity to ensure that these policies align with current practice and USM policies . RISKS There are no associated risks to the University in adopting these recommendations . FINANCIAL IMPLICATIO NS There are no known financial implications for revising the two policies. There cou ld be financial implications depending on the outcome of the University's review of the recommendation related to mandatory fees paid by employees who take courses .

The proposal noted that neither policy ha s been updated since 1991, and neither accurately reflect s current practice or University System of Maryland (USM) policies. In January 2020 , the SEC charged the Staff Affairs Committee with reviewing both policies , consulting with relevant stakeholders , reviewing similar policies and procedures at Big 10 and peer institutions, considering whether certain elements of the policies should be aligned with current pra ctice, and recommending changes to the policies , as appropriate (Appendix 3). CURRENT PRACTICE The University's current policies and its approach to tuition remission align with the general principles and intent of the USM policies , but they have not been updated in thirty years to incorporate revisions to the USM policies that occurred during that period. The USM policies provide broad discretion to each institution to implement specific practices related to tuition remission. University Human Resources' (UHR) practices offer more flexibility and expand access to tuition remission in order to align with USM policies and to reflect evolvi ng trends in education. COMMITTEE WORK The Staff Affairs C ommittee consulted with UHR on the revised policy drafts included with the proposal. The committee gathered information on how tuition remission is currently administered for employees , their spouses , and their dependent children , and identified key elements of the current policies that should be revised. The committee worked to identify differences between the University's 2019-2020 Committee Members Date of Submission UNIVERSITY SENATE REPORT | #19-20-25 Staff Affairs Committee Report for Senate Document #19-20-25 2 of 3 current policies and the corresponding USM policies, and between the University's current policies and UHR's practice surrounding tuition remission. The major differences between the University's policies and the USM policies include: The USM policy covering employees provides remission of up to 8 credits per semeste r. The University policy for employees remits up to 7 credits per semester . Dependents and spouses are required to pay mandatory fees. The University policy for spouses and dependents does not address fees. The major differences between the University's policies and UHR's practice surrounding tuition remission include: UHR provides remission for credits taken during winter and summer sessions, and for twelve - week courses. The University policy for employees only allows remission during \"semesters. \" UHR provides remission for up to 8 credits over the course of the summer sessions. The University policy for employees remits up to 6 over the two sessions . UHR provides remission for eligible CII employees. The University policy for employees does not permit remission for CII employees . UHR provides remission for the entirety of differential tuition for undergraduate courses . The University policies do not address differential tuition . The University policies do not indicate under what circumstances an employee, their spouse, or their dependent is required to reimburse tuition remission if the employee leaves the University. UHR requires employees to reimburse the institution if they leave the University before the drop/add de adline for the relevant term. For graduate courses, UHR only remits tuition based on the standard graduate credit hour, and students are responsible for any tuition costs above that. The University policy for employees only addresses the number of credits covered by tuition remission, while the policy for spouses and dependents references \"100% tuition remission\" for graduate courses. UHR provides tuition remission for winter terms (4 credits for the standard term, 6 for the twelve -week term). UHR also pr ovides remission for courses taken over the summer sessions (8 over the course of the two sessions). The University policy for employees only references semesters, while the policy for spouses and dependents does not address semesters or terms at all, and instead indicates that it provides \"100% tuition remission. \" The committee reviewed similar tuition remission policies and procedures at other institutions. Given that the Senate's ability to propose changes is constrained by the USM policies , and given the limited scope of its charge, the committee decided to focus its peer research on similar policies at other USM institutions. Nearly all of those institutions simply reference the USM policies. Of the two institutions that do have standalone policies , neither includes a level of detail approaching that of the University's current policies . Rather than following approaches taken by other USM institutions, the committee revised the proposed drafts by adapting language from the USM policies , framing them to be more Report for Senate Document #19-20-25 3 of 3 applicable to employees at this institution , and aligning them with current UHR practices as described above . The committee also struck references to graduate assistants in the University policy for employees, as remission for graduate assistants is now addressed by the USM Policy on Graduate Assistants (III -7.11). The committee also considered the fees that are charged to employees who take courses at the University. In the past, the University has waived mandat ory fees for employees. In 2019, the USM announced that this practice was not permitted under the USM policy covering tuition remission for employees; since fall 2019, employees have been responsible for paying mandatory fees. Committee members reported in stances of employees being charged separately for services and privileges that should have been covered by their mandatory fees, due to their dual roles as employees and students. At present, the University has two categories of \"mandatory fees,\" one for undergraduate students and one for graduate students . Committee members noted that some of the fees within each category are not a pplicable to faculty and staff who are taking classes. The USM policy requires that faculty and staff who take courses pay mandatory fees. However, the committee noted that it may be possible for the University to consider which fees should be considered m andatory for employees who take courses, which led to the committee's administrative recommendation. The revised policies were reviewed by UHR, the Office of the Registrar, the Graduate School, and the Office of General Counsel, none of whom had concerns. After due consideration, the Staff Affairs Committee voted to approve the revised policies and an administrative recommendation by an email vote concluding on April 6, 2020 . RECOMMENDATIONS The Staff Affairs Committee recommends that the University of Maryland, College Park Policy and Procedures Concerning Tuition Remission for Faculty and Staff be revised as indicated in the document immediately follow ing this report.

Revision to the Policy on Smoking at the University of Maryland ISSUE In September 2019, the Senate Office was asked whether the definition of \"smoking\" in the Policy on Smoking at University of Maryland restricts the use of vaping devices and e -cigarettes. After consulting with stakeholders involved in implementing the policy , the Senate leadership found that the current policy lacks clarity on whether it prohibits or permits the use of such devices , and determined that the Campus Affairs Committee should consider whether vaping should be explicitly addressed in the policy . The SEC charged the committee with reviewing past Senate action on the University's approach to smoking, reviewing recent actions at the state and federal level addressing vaping devices and e -cigarettes, examining definitions of smoking at Big 10 and peer institutions, considering the impact of vaping devices and e -cigarettes on members of the campus community and whether their use is consistent with the principles of the University's Policy on Smoking, and recommending whether the policy should be r evised to prohibit the use of vaping devices and e - cigarettes . RECOMMENDATIONS The Campus Affairs Committee recommends that the Policy on Smoking at University o f Maryland (VI-8.10[A]) be revised as indicated in the policy document immediately following this report. The Campus Affairs Committee recommends that the University should consider whether current smoking cessation resources will be adequate to meet the needs of incoming cohorts of students disproportionately affected by vaping and e -cigarette use . COMMITTEE WORK The committee reviewed a range of resources identified in its charge, and consulted with the Office of General Counsel (OGC) and the Divi sion of Administration and Financ e on the current policy and its implementation . After reviewing recent research on the effects of secondhand emissions from vaping devices and e -cigarettes, the committee determined that explicitly prohibiting the use of vaping devices and e -cigarettes was clearly consistent with the intention of both the USM and University policies on smoking, which were designed to create a smoke -free environm ent and reduce risks to bystanders. The committee worked to develop a new definition that was sufficiently flexible to address new technologies and mechanisms that simulate smoking. PRESENTED BY Jo Zimmerman , Chair REVIEW DATES SEC - April 3, 2020 | SENATE - April 22, 2020 VOTING METHOD In a single vote RELEVANT POLICY/DOCUMENT Policy on Smoking at University of Maryland NECESSARY APPROVALS Senate, President UNIVERSITY SENATE TRANSMITTAL | #19-20-17 Senate Campus Affairs Committee The committee also consulted with a representative of the University Health Center (UHC) , and learned that c urrent staffing levels in the UHC do not allow it to meet the existing demand for smoking cessation services . The committee noted that the significant rise in the use of vaping devices and e - cigarettes among middle - and high -school students will result in large cohorts of matriculating students who may need nicotine -cessation services, which led to the committee's administrative recommendation. In addition to revising the definition of smo king, the committee made technical changes to the policy and shared its proposed revisions with the OGC, which had no concerns. After due consideration, the Campus Affairs Committee voted to approve the revised Polic y on Smoking at University of Maryland and an administrative recommendation at its February 26 , 2020, meeting . ALTERNATIVES The Senate could reject the proposed revised policy and the University would retain the current policy . However, the University would lose the opportunity to better protect the health and safety of members of the campus community . RISKS There are no associated risks to the University in adopting these recommendations . FINANCIAL IMPLICATIO NS Depending on how the recommendation is implemented, financial resources may be required to provide nicotine -cessation services for those who use vaping devices or e -cigarettes.

After consulting with stakeholders involved in implementing the policy , the Senate leadership found that the current policy lacks clarity on whether it prohibits or permits the use of such devices , and determined that the Campus Affairs Committee should be charged with considering whether vaping should be explicitly addressed in the policy . The SEC charged the committee with reviewing past Senate action on the University's approach to smoking, reviewing recent actions at the state and federal level addressing vaping devices and e - cigarettes, examining definitions of smoking at Big 10 and peer institutions, and considering how the definition of smoking in the current Policy on Smoking could be revised to more clearly indicate that it encompasses vaping devices and e -cigarettes (Appendix 8). After initial work by the committee, the SEC adjust ed the scope of the committee's review . The revised charge focuse s on considering the impact of vaping devices and e -cigarettes on members of the campus community, assessing whether the use of such devices is consistent with the principles of the University's Policy on Smoking, and recommending whether the policy should be r evised to prohibit the use of vaping devices and e - cigarettes (Appendix 9). CURRENT PRACTICE In June 2012, the University System of Maryland (USM) instituted a policy requiring smoke -free environments across the USM . The policy was intended primarily to protect non -users from the risks associated with secondhand smoke, rather than focused on the impact of smoking on individual tobacco users . Institution s were given until June 30, 2013 , to establish policies that would ensure smoke -free environments . In August 2012, the SEC charged the Campus Affairs Committee with 2019-2020 Committee Members Date of Submission UNIVERSITY SENATE REPORT | #19-20-17 Senate Campus Affairs Committee Report for Senate Document #19-20-17 2 of 3 developing a new policy consistent with the USM directive. In April 2013, the Senate voted to approve the com mittee's report calling for a new Policy on Smoking at University of Maryland (Appendix 1) . The policy prohibits \"smoking,\" which is defined as \" carrying or smoking a lighted tobacco product or the burning of any material to be inhaled including, but not limited to, cigarettes, cigars, hookahs, and pipes .\" The policy indicates that the University Health Center will provide smoking cessation services for students, faculty, and staff. The policy also permits the President to establish designated areas on campus where smoking will still be permitted; four such locations have been established . COMMITTEE WORK To address its charge, t he Campus Affairs C ommittee reviewed past Senate action on smoking and considered definitions of smoking in policies at Big 10 and other peer institutions (Appendix 2). The committee consulted with the Office of General Counsel (OGC) and the Division of Administration and Finance on the current policy and its implementation. The committee also considered recent state legislation regulating the sale of electronic smoking devices , and testimony by the acting commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration addressing federal regulation of electronic nicotine delivery systems (Appendi ces 3 and 4). In the course of its work, the committee recei ved letters from Public Health Action Through Civic Engagement (PHACE) and the Student Government Association advocating for the prohibition of vaping devices and e -cigarettes (Appendices 5 and 6). The committee considered recent research on the effects of secondhand aerosol (SHA) emissions from vaping devices and e -cigarettes (Appendix 7). The literature indicates that vaping devices and e-cigarettes represent a much less harmful method of ingesting nicotine for those attempting to stop smoking traditional tobacco products . It is also the case, however, that SHA emissions include volatile organic compounds that are exhaled by those using vaping devices and e -cigarettes. While the long - term effects of exposure to SHA remain to be determined, there is evidence that preventing SHA exposure would have protective benefits for members of the camp us community . The committee determined that explicitly prohibiting the use of vaping devices and e -cigarettes was clearly consistent with the intention of both the USM and University policies on smoking, which were designed to create a smoke -free environm ent and reduce risks to bystanders. The committee worked to develop a new definition that was sufficiently flexible to address new technologies and mechanisms that simulate smoking. Its proposed definition of smoking includes a prohibition on \"b urnin g, vaporizing, or aerosolizing tobacco, nicotine, or any other material or substance to be inhaled .\" The committee carefully considered whether such a definition would prohibit legitimate activities and therapies, such as nebulizers. The committee determined that when the revised policy is read in its entirety, the full context of the language is clear. The committee's in tent is to prohibit activities that have the potential to harm others, and the policy is not intended to restrict legitimate medical therapies authorized for use on campus . The committee also consulted with a representative of the University Health Center (UHC) on current smoking cessation services. In addition to serving students who voluntarily seek out such services, the UHC also receives referrals from the Department of Resident Life when students are found responsible for using vaping devices or e -cigarettes in the residence halls. Current staffing levels in the UHC do not allow it to meet the existing demand for smoking cessation services, and students are often directed to outside resources, such as Maryland Quitline ( mdquit.org ), for support . The committee noted that the significant rise in the use of vaping devices and e -cigarettes among middle - and high -school students will result in large cohorts of matriculating students who may need nicotine - cessation services, which led to the committee's administrative recommendation. Report for Senate Document #19-20-17 3 of 3 The committee made additional , technical changes to the policy and shared its proposed revisions with the OGC, which had no concerns. After due consideration, the Campus Affairs Committee voted to approve the revised Polic y on Smoking at University of Maryland and an administrative recommendation at its February 26 , 2020, meeting. RECOMMENDATIONS The Campus Affairs Committee recommends that the Policy on Smoking at University of Maryland (VI-8.10[A]) be revised as indicated in the policy document immediately following this report.

To endorse entire report Statement of Issue: In June 2012, t he Board of Regents (BOR ) instituted a policy requiring smoke -free e nvironments at each institution throughout the University System of Maryland (USM ). Each institution must implement this policy prior to June 30, 2013. The Senate Executive Committee (SEC) charged the Campus Affairs Committee (CAC) with reviewing the USM p olicy on smoking and making recommendations on a related campus policy and an implementation process for the University of Maryland. Relevant Policy # & URL: USM Policy VI -8.10 \"Policy on Smoking at USM Institutions.\" http://www.president.umd.edu/policies/vi810.html Recommendation: The CAC recommends that the attached policy entitled , \"VI - 8.10 (A) Policy on Smoking at University of Maryland\" be adopted as official University of Maryland p olicy and be added to the Consolidated USM and UMD Policies and Procedures Manual. In addition, the CAC presents thirteen recommendations on the implementation of the policy for Senate consideration. These recommendations are organized under the followin g categories: Communication; Policy Management, Assessment, and Evaluation; Enforcement; ntion, Education, and Treatment; and Reporting Responsibilities. Committee Work: The CAC began reviewing the charge and the USM policy at its meeting on Septembe r 6, 2012. The committee devoted six meetings to consideration of the charge. In order to organize its research and discussion over the course of the semester, the CAC formed a number of subgroups focused on different aspects of the policy and its implem entation. The subgroups were charged with studying peer institutions, creating and disseminating a survey, researching prevention, education, and treatment resources on campus, exploring models of enforcement at institutions with smoke -free policies, consi dering the management, assessment, and evaluation of the policy, and considering communications strategies related to the new smoke - free policy. These subgroups performed research and made recommendations to the full committee. Over the course of its work , the CAC reached out to various units and groups on campus to better understand how the new policy would affect the community and its operations. The CAC spoke with representatives from the University Health Center, Resident Life, Residential Facilities, the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics, University Human Resources, and the Office of Legal Affairs, and also asked for feedback from the Senate Staff Affairs Committee. After much review and discussion, the Campus Affairs Committee voted to approve the recommendations and send them forward for consideration at its meetings on December 13, 2012 and January 24 , 2013. Alternatives: The Senate could reject the proposed policy and the recommendations for implementing a policy tailored to the University of Maryland campus. The USM policy would remain as the official policy for the campus. Risks: There are no associated risks. Financial Implications: Financial resources may be ne eded to carry out some of the recommendations for implementation , particula rly those affecting the University Health Center and its services. Further Approvals Required: Senate approval, Presidential approval. Senate Campus Affairs Committee Senate Document # 12- 13-07 Implementation of the Policy on Smoking at USM Institutions January 2013 BACKGROUND In June 2012, the Board of Regents (BOR) of the University System of Maryland (USM) instituted a policy that requires smoke-free environments at each institution throughout the system (Appendix 4). Each institution is required to implement this policy prior to June 30, 2013. The University of Maryland (UM) Senate Executive Committee (SEC) charged the Campus Affairs Committee (CAC) with reviewing the USM policy on smoking and making recommendations on a related campus policy and an implementation process for UM (Appendix 5). CURRENT PRACTICE The University Senate has previously considered whether to ban smoking on campus, and has received a number of proposals related to smoking policies over the past few years. In 2009-2010, the CAC was charged with reviewing a proposal to ban smoking from campus and chose not to recommend the adoption of a smoke-free campus policy. The CAC did, however, make administrative recommendations regarding the existing smoking policies on campus. In response, the Division of Administration and Finance (then known as the Division of Administrative Affairs) proposed that the campus smoking policy be amended to adjust the distance from buildings in which smoking is allowed. The CAC reviewed the proposal and recommended its adoption, which was subsequently approved by the Senate and the President in September 2011. The recently approved USM policy on smoking (Appendix 4) prohibits smoking on all institution grounds and pr operty. As a USM policy, this new initiative takes precedence over the current UM campus policy. However, the new policy allows each campus the latitude to establish limited designated areas in which smoking would be allowed at its discretion. COMMITTEE WORK Over the course of five months during the 2012-2013 academic year, the CAC considered its charge regarding the implementation of the policy banning smoking at UM. Throughout its review, the CAC discussed the complexity of implementing a campus-wide ban. The CAC recognizes that smoking is not illegal, and the committee is sensitive to the fact that smoking is an addiction that is difficult to quit. It is also cognizant of the campus climate and the message that the University wants to send about being smoke-free. From September 2012 to January 2013, the CAC focused on consideration of the smoking policy and its implementation. At its initial meeting, the CAC developed a plan and timeline for studying the issue. In order to organize its research and discussion over the course of the semester, the CAC formed a number of subgroups focused on different aspects of the policy and its implementation. These subgroups performed research and made recommendations to the full committee. The Peer Institutions Subgroup was charged with researching policies and practices related to smoking at peer institutions. This group reviewed the experiences of Towson University, Montgomery College, University of Missouri, Ball State, University of North Carolina, Oregon State University, and University of Michigan in their implementation of a smoke-free campus. The CAC discussed experiences at other universities, which sent conflicting messages when they included designated areas for smoking in their smoke-free policy. For example, the University of Michigan designed a policy with designated areas that included smoking pavilions, and specifically changed its policy after its implementation to remove the designated areas on campus, because it felt the existence of smoking pavilions weakened the smoking policy and made it less effective. The Survey Subgroup was charged with creating a survey to measure campus-wide awareness of the USM policy and attitudes towards a smoke-free campus policy. A survey was created by the subgroup, with the committee's advice, and was sent to a random sample of faculty, staff, and students. The survey was also advertised on the Senate website, Facebook, and Twitter, and promoted at the Great American Smoke-Out event hosted by the University Health Center ( UHC ). The smoking ban survey received over 2,900 responses (Appendix 3). Significant findings from the survey include the following: Only a small percentage (21.76%) of respondents were familiar with the USM policy; More than half (58.09%) of the respondents were in favor of banning smoking on campus; 58% of respondents would approve of having designated smoking areas; Respondents do not feel comfortable asking others to stop smoking - only 35.28% would feel com fortable doing so; and 21.48% of the respondents indicated that they were smokers. Of those who smoke, only 7.74 % would be encouraged to quit because of the ban, and only 3.63% indicated they would take advantage of smoking cessation services on campus. The Prevention, Education, and Treatment Subgroup was charged with researching smoking cessation resources available on campus through the UHC. It reported that services are provided free of cost by the UHC to students, faculty, and staff, and include smoking cessation counseling, nicotine patches, acupuncture, and the other services. These services are provided primarily in English, as well as in Spanish to some extent. The subgroup reported a concern that the UHC may have to impose a fee for these services if the smoking ban results in a great number of campus members seeking services. It noted that additional financial support for the UHC for increased staffing may be needed to continue to provide these servic es. An Enforcement Subgroup focused on enforcement of the policy and explored models at peer institutions, while considering what scenarios may be appropriate for use at UM. It reported on the policies at University of Michigan, Frostburg State University, and Towson University, and found differing levels of enforcement at each institution, ranging from emphasis on a climate of respect and wellness to more severe enforcement methods involving fines and infractions as part of the staff performance, review, and development (PRD) process. The CAC discussed UM's campus climate and agreed that a policy focused on respect and wellness, rather than punitive actions, would be a better fit. The CAC agreed that communication, education, social norming, and a strong focus on the health benefits of a smoke-free environment would be better suited to the University than strict enforcement methods. The CAC also ag reed that efforts to change the campus culture may prove more effective in aiding enforcement of the policy than punitive measures, and discussed ways to utilize the influence and passion of student groups to affect such change. The Enforcement Subgroup also led a lengthy discussion on designated smoking areas. It presented the challenges of enforcing the smoking ban on UM's large, non-contiguous campus. It also noted that it would be difficult to prohibit activity on UM property that is legal on the property surrounding campus. The CAC discussed whether designated areas would weaken the policy and noted that th e USM policy intentionally provides the option of designated areas. The Policy Management, Assessment, and Evaluation Subgroup was charged with reviewing the exact specifications of the BOR policy and reporting on what a campus policy might entail. This subgroup presented its finding that it would be difficult to enforce designated smoking areas, and advocated that the committee recommend following the BOR's intent to create a smoke-free campus. It cited the University of Michigan's experience, where smoking pavilions were initially created in designated areas and then eliminated. Michigan's continued requests for additional pavilions eventually made them realize the smoke-free policy seemed to be moving in the opposite direction of its original intent. The subgroup recognized the difficulties in changing the culture on campus, and recommended that the first year of implementation should focus on education and communication tailored to each campus constituency to explain that UM is now a smoke-free campus. The CAC discussed communications strategies at length and noted how important communication will be to implementation of the policy. Committee members agreed that communications should have a supportive and positive tone, and that they should be put in the context of a \"smoke-free environment,\" while being sensitive to the challenges that smokers will face. The CAC discussed a phased-in communications campaign to start immediately, which would focus on awareness of the new policy and campus resources, involvement of the campus community, and implementation of the policy. A marketing campaign, similar to the \"Nothing is Slower than a Sick Turtle\" or the sustainability awareness campaigns, was discussed. In the course of its work, the CAC reached out to various units and groups on campus to better understand how the new policy would affect the community and its operations. The committee spoke with representatives from the University Health Center, Resident Life, Residential Facilities, and the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics, to make them aware of the smoking ban and learn how this might affect their operations. The CAC met with representatives of University Human Resources (UHR) on their perspective on the new USM policy. UHR had concerns about ho w it might affect faculty and staff differently, in terms of enforcement and possible disciplinary action. For instance, staff members have limited breaks in their schedule, and requiring them to leave campus to smoke may place more of a burden on staff than on faculty or students who smoke. The CAC also reviewed feedback that it received from the Senate Staff Affairs Committee about the smoking ban and its potential impact on staff members. The Staff Affairs Committee noted that there has been little co mmunication about the impending smoking ban, and committee members felt that more should be done to inform the campus community of the upcoming changes. Members of the committee also agreed with the idea of a progressive system of implementation that focuses on communication and education first. In addition, the CAC consulted with the Office of Legal Affairs on the text of a draft policy on smoking at UM (Appendix 2). RECOMMENDATIONS At its meetings on December 13th, 2012 and January 24th, 2013, the Campus Affairs Committee voted in favor of recommendations on the implementation of the smoke-free campus policy. The Campus Affairs Committee recommends that the attached policy (Appendix 2) entitled \"VI - 8.10 (A) Policy on Smoking at University of Maryland\" be adopted as official University of Maryland policy and be added to the Consolidated USM and UMD Policies and Procedures Manual. In addition, the CAC presents the following recommendations on the implementation of the policy for Senate consideration. Communication - The Campus Affairs Committee recommends that the Division of Administration and Finance and University Relations lead the development and dissemination of an appropriate communication and signage strategy for the campus, beginning with awareness communication to start immediately. A smoke-free campus identity campaign should be promulgated throughout campus, and adequate and appropriate signage should be located at all entrances to campus, as well as at major public thoroughfares and spaces, and in campus buildings. An emphasis should also be placed on the area in front of McKeldin Library. - The Campus Affairs Committee recommends that the smoke-free policy be continually communicated to the University community in a simple, positive, and respectful manner throughout each phase of implementation. - The Campus Affairs Committee recommends that the smoke-free policy be adequately communicated to external constituents, including but not limited to, applicants for admission and employment, contractors, visitors to campus, and vendors. Policy Specifications, Management, and Evaluation - The Campus Affairs Committee recommends that all University of Maryland property be smoke-free. Any limited and specific designated areas in which smoking may be permitted would be subject to the designation of the President. - The Campus Affairs Committee recommends that the new smoking policy be administered by the Division of Administration and Finance, with appropriate involvement of relevant groups on campus, including University Relations, the University Health Center, the Division of Student Affairs and other appropriate units as designated by the President. The committee recommends that the Division of Administration and Finance have responsibility to oversee implementation and manage enforcement of the policy, and recommends that it involve faculty, staff, and students in its processes when appropriate. - The Campus Affairs Committee recommends that the Division of Administration and Finance develop a centralized reporting mechanism for concerns regarding the policy from the campus community. - The Campus Affairs Committee recommends that the University conduct periodic evaluations of effectiveness of the policy during the first five years of its implementation. The data collected could include measurements of the utilization of health and educational services, and annual surveys of random faculty, staff, and students, among other sources. - The Senate recommends placing at least one fireproof garbage receptacle near each major building, but at least 25 feet away from any building air intake. Enforcement - The Campus Affairs Committee recommends that enforcement and administration of the smoking policy focus on respect and wellness as opposed to discipline and punitive measures by utilizing a progressive enforcement program whereupon we seek voluntary compliance before any strict sanctions. Such a program should focus on warnings and persuasion first; referrals to resources second; and punitive measures as a last resort in situations of blatant or repeated violation of the policy. The committee recommends that any punitive enforcement be delayed during the initial year of the policy to allow the University to first focus on communication and preparation. - The Campus Affairs Committee recommends that the Division of Administration and Finance (or other appropriate units as designated by the President) work with University Human Resources and the University Health Center to develop resources for faculty, staff, and students that empower them to assist in achieving campus compliance with the smoke-free policy through peer interaction. Prevention, Education, and Treatment - The Campus Affairs Committee recommends that the University Health Center continue to be designated as a centralized resource for information regarding both on-campus and off-campus smoking cessation resources and peer education programs for faculty, staff, and students. - The Campus Affairs Committee recommends that prevention, education, and treatment strategies be equally geared towards all constituencies and that steps be taken to ensure that faculty, staff, and students all have access to the services provided. One way to accomplish this goal would be to effectively promote services to faculty, staff, and students through concerted communication efforts. - Campus Affairs Committee recommends that sufficient resources be allocated to the University Health Center to support smoking cessation efforts for faculty, staff, and students, and that the current smoking cessation services offered by the University Health Center be expanded, where appropriate. Reporting Responsibilities - The Campus Affairs Committee recommends that the Division of Administration and Finance (and other appropriate units as designated by the President) provide status reports to the University Senate on the progress and outcomes of implementation as well as on campus compliance with the policy each year for the first five years of the smoking policy. APPENDICES Appendix 1 - Suggestions for Implementation Appendix 2 - Proposed Policy on Smoking at University Of Maryland (VI - 8.10(A)) Appendix 3 - Campus Affairs Committee Smoking Ban Survey - Abbreviated Results Appendix 4 - University System of Maryland (USM) Policy VI - 8.10 Policy on Smoking at USM Institutions Appendix 5 - Senate Executive Committee Charge on Implementation of the Policy on Smoking at USM Institutions SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION The Campus Affairs Committee discussed implementation scenarios and options in depth from September 2012 through January 2013. As a result, the CAC would like to share suggestions for how implementation could proceed, while ultimately encouraging the administration to conduct its implementation efforts however it feels appropriate outside of the recommendations the CAC has previously presented. Communication The CAC stresses that communication should be the first priority of implementation of the smoking policy, and it should begin immediately. The CAC has found that most faculty, staff, and students are not familiar with the policy and do not know that the University will be smoke-free by June 30, 2013. There is a great deal of confusion over whether it will in fact be implemented. Understanding this reality, the CAC developed its recommendations regarding communication with the consensus that these are the most critical for implementation of the policy. In its committee work, the CAC discussed many options for implementation of its communication recommendations. The committee discussed breaking communications strategies into phases, to appropriately focus efforts at specific points before and during implementation. It suggests focusing first on awareness and education about the policy, next on engaging the campus community in discussions about the policy, and then focusing on the actual details of the policy and its implementation. Immediate communication efforts could start small and grow as appropriate. The CAC found the countdown ticker on the UHR webpage, and suggests incorporating a similar effort into other critical websites, such as the UM homepage. Websites and promotional materials that reach external constituents, such as applicants for admission and employment and visitors to campus, could incorporate notices about the smoke- free policy. Email messages or other communications from the University administration may raise the profile of the policy and greatly assist in spreading awareness across campus. Also, common venues that communicate campus news to faculty, staff, and students - such as Between the Columns , Faculty Voice , and The Diamondback , -- could be utilized as well. Physical signage campaigns take a great deal of time, so the CAC suggests that other strategies be utilized for quicker dissemination of information while physical signage is created. The committee suggests maximizing use of social media messaging, FYI advertisements, email messages, website announcements, and other digital methods as appropriate. In discussing the content of communications, the CAC stresses a focus on positive language and the phrase \"smoke-free environment\" can be more effective than messages that single out those who smoke or focus on negative language, such as \"smoking strictly prohibited.\" Using such language is also one way of shaping the context for the policy and building a campus identity that could lead to a genuine acceptance of the policy. As an example of a simple, positive, and respectful messaging campaign, the CAC discussed the \"Nothing Slower Than a Sick Turtle\" flu prevention campaign and suggests development of a similar messaging tool that can be placed on windows, doors, or elsewhere throughout campus to serve as a positive daily reminder of the smoke-free policy. Policy Specifications, Management, and Evaluation The CAC believes that the leadership of the Division of Administration and Finance (DAF) in administering the policy will help provide centralization for the efforts associated with the smoking policy and significantly impact its success. The committee feels that many of the critical aspects of the policy will involve different departments in DAF - from UHR to Facilities Management to Finance and Community Engagement - and that it warrants the oversight of the Vice President for Administration and Finance (VPAF). However, the CAC would not suggest that the DAF work alone in its efforts and offers the following suggestions for implementation process: The CAC suggests that the DAF work closely with other groups across campus as necessary to implement and enforce the policy. o Other universities have found it helpful to form smoke-free environment implementation committees or work groups with all of the relevant departments represented. Such a committee could be useful in: Carrying out implementation details, Tracking the progress of implementation across campus, and Making decisions as new developments unfold. The DAF should engage with faculty, staff, and students whenever possible as it makes decisions about implementation and policy assessment. The DAF could: o Conduct surveys where the campus or specific constituencies are asked to rate their preferences on different implementation options; o Invite representatives of different constituencies to meetings; or o Hold specific meetings or open forums with each constituency. The CAC stresses the importance of continual evaluation of the smoking policy. By evaluating the effectiveness of the policy on an annual basis, the University will have an opportunity to identify pieces that are not working and adjust its procedures over time. The CAC suggests that evaluations: Examine the violations of the policy, including violations resulting in \"formal\" action (such as referral to smoking cessation resources or further measures) and the trend of violations over the years; Attempt to illustrate the extent to which smoking remains a problem on campus over time; and Seek to determine whether the campus culture is changing to incorporate a smoke-free identity. Enforcement The CAC stresses a policy based on respect and wellness, and feels that, consistent with policies at other campuses, such a policy will be more likely to be respected. However, the committee also understands that further enforcement options should be available for more serious violations of the policy. It recommends a progressive enforcement system, and presents the following suggestions for such a program. The CAC found that in most peer institutions, implementation of a smoke-free policy is a multi-year process, and the CAC is concerned about the level of understanding of and preparation for the new policy in the UM community. The CAC suggests that any aspects of implementation that involve punitive enforcement measures be delayed initially, and that the University place emphasis on awareness and preparation within the first year of the policy. The CAC feels that persuasion and peer interaction should be the basis of the first level of enforcement. Peer interaction is a powerful tool, and the CAC regards it as an important enforcement mechanism. While CAC's survey results show that most people would not feel comfortable addressing smokers, the committee believes that if individuals are given appropriate tools, they will be more likely to address situations they see arising across campus. The CAC suggests that tools and language specifically geared towards faculty, staff, and students be developed to give the campus community constructive ways to address smoking and smokers on campus with the goal of encouraging compliance with the policy. The CAC also suggests developing a friendly reminder system that can be used by all campus members to encourage adherence to the smoking policy. Similar to the previously discussed communications strategies, the CAC suggests creating a simple, positive tool that each person can use to encourage others to adhere to the policy. The CAC discussed the friendly warning tickets used for first-time parking violations as a guide. The tools developed should be widely shared and the community should be encouraged to use them appropriately. While the CAC is hesitant to suggest involving campus police too heavily in enforcement, the committee considered that the Police Auxiliary might be involved in dissemination of communications and friendly reminders about the policy. Likewise, student groups could be called upon to assist in spreading information about the policy in particular areas where smoking has been reported as a problem. These could be either existing groups that focus on smoking cessation or related activities that wish to be involved, or new groups created specifically for this purpose. The second and third levels of enforcement would be reserved for repeat instances of violation of the policy. The CAC feels that referring individuals to the resources available to them is a critical step in enforcement of the policy. Referring individuals to the UHC or other resources on campus for smoking cessation, stress relief, or other assistance should be prioritized. In situations of blatant or repeated violations of the policy, additional intervention may be necessary and disciplinary measures can be considered. However, the CAC strongly rejects the idea that smoking should enter into any PRD discussions for faculty or staff. Prevention, Education, and Treatment During its review of the smoking policy, the CAC found that th e UHC already has programs in place to provide resources and information about smoking cessation opportunities, and the CAC recommends that it continue to do so. The CAC was very pleased to hear that their services are open to all campus constituencies, and was also pleased to learn that some of the services are currently provided with Spanish translations. The CAC offers the following suggestions for enhancing the services already offered in the wake of the new smoking policy. The committee recommends that the UHC be given the resources it needs to appropriately fulfill their responsibilities under this new policy. The CAC feels that an expansion of UHC services may be warranted o In its review, the CAC found that some smoking cessation services are not provided due to cost considerations. The CAC suggests considering whether these services would be possible with appropriate additional funding. o The committee's survey results included many comments that asked for more options for smoking cessation services. Specifically, Additional smoking cessation workshops and seminars, Campus support groups, Resources on how to adapt smoking habits around new schedules, Extra stress management and reduction services as a component of smoking cessation o The committee also received many concerns that staff members feel that they are unable to take advantage of the services available to them. The UHC could consider: Providing more Spanish-language services and assessing whether additional languages would be appropriate, Tailoring some services more effectively to staff members, Offering certain events or resources at different hours to reach those with different schedules, Offering more services and resources online, and Communicating with supervisors about encouraging st aff and faculty who choose to take advantage of these services. o The CAC suggests that peer education on smoking cessation be added to existing Peer Education programs. The CAC suggests that UHC evaluate the marketing of its smoking cessation programs and consider how to use the new policy to enhance awareness of its services. o The committee's survey showed that only 49.39% of those who reported that they smoked were familiar with the smoking cessation services offered by the UHC. o The CAC suggests that UHC work with the DAF to combine communication efforts where possible. Reporting Responsibilities Due to a short time-frame for implementation, it is unrealistic to expect full implementation and campus acceptance immediately. The CAC anticipates this reality, and will remain interested in the i mplementation and success of the policy as it progresses. To encourage communication between the representatives for the University's diverse constituencies and the administrators of this policy, the CAC recommends that the DAF report to the SEC once every year for the first five years of implementation of the smoking policy. The committee suggests that these reports contain a brief status update on how the implementation is progressing, what the DAF's internal evaluations of the policy find on its acceptance across campus, and what future steps need to be taken to successfully implement the policy. These updates can also serve as an opportunity for the DAF to ask the Senate for further review of any aspect of the smoking policy if such reviews become necessary.

(in dollars) $41,900 $0 $0 $0 $0 Net Note:() = decrease; GF = general funds; FF = federal funds; SF = special funds; - = indeterminate increase; (-) = indeterminate decrease Local Effect: Revenues increase significantly from additional licensing fee revenues . Enforcement can be handled with existing resources. Small Business Effect: Meaningful . HB 1169/ Page 2 Analysis Bill Summary: Tobacco Products and Electronic Smoking Device s - Definitions Electronic Smoking Device s: The bill renames an ENDS to be an ESD and makes further revisions to the definition . Accordingly, an \"ESD\" is a device that can be used to deliver aerosolized or vaporized nicotine to an individual inhaling fr om the device. \"ESD\" includes an electronic cigarette , an electronic cigar, an electronic cigarillo, an electronic pipe , an electronic hookah , a vape pen, vaping liquid, and any component, part, or accessory of such a device, regardless of whether the component is sold separately, including any substance intended to be aerosolized or vaporized during the use of the device. \"ESD\" excludes a drug, device, or combination prod uct authorized for sale by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Tobacco Products: The bill alters the definition of \"tobacc o product\" to include ESDs and makes other revisions to the definition. Accordingly, \"tobacco product\" means a product that is intended for human inhalation, absorption, ingestion, smoking, heating, chewing, dissolving, or any other manner of consumption that is made of, derived from, or contains tobacco or nicotine. \"Tobacco pro duct\" includes cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, chewing tobacco, snuff, and snus; ESDs ; and filters, rolling papers, pipes, and liquids used in ESD s, regardless of nicotine content. \"Tobacco product\" excludes a drug, device, or combination product authorized for sale by FDA under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. License Fees The bill increases existing annual fees for State cigarette retailer, other tobacco products (OTP s) retailer or tobacconist, ENDS (under the bill, ESD ) retailer, and ENDS (under the bill, ESD ) wholesaler licenses. Accordingly: the fee for a cigarette retailer license increases from $30 to $300; the fee for an OTP or tobacconist license increases from $15 to $300; the fee for an ENDS (under the bill, ESD) retailer license increases from $25 to $300; and the fee for an ENDS (under the bill, ESD) wholesaler license from $150 to $300. Tobacco Products - Minimum Age The bill raises, from 18 to 21, the minimum age for an individual to purchase or be sold tobacco products and makes conforming changes. The bill affects several sections of the HB 1169/ Page 3 Annotated Code of Maryland, including the Criminal Law, Health -General, Local Government, and State Finance and Procurement articles. References to \"minor\" or \"18\" are modified to be \"an individual under the age of 21 years\" or \"21.\" In addition, the bill repeals a provision of criminal law that prohibits a minor from using or possessing a tobacco product, cigarette rolling paper, or an ENDS or from using a false form of identification to obtain a tobacco product, cigarette rolling paper, or an ENDS. Furthermore, the bill repeals an authorized defense for a violation of a criminal prohibition against the distribution of tobacco products to a minor that the defendant examined the purchaser's or recipient's employer-issued or school identification. Inspections of Retailers by the Maryland Department of Health The bill authorizes MDH to conduct unannounced inspections of a licensed cigarette, OTP, or ESD retailer to ensure the licensee's compliance with the criminal prohibition against the distribution or sale of tobacco products to underage individuals (under the bill, the criminal prohibition pertains to individuals younger than age 21) . MDH may use an individual younger than age 21 to assist in conducting the inspections. Required Signs for Retail Licensees A cigarette, OTP, or ESD retailer must post a sig n in a location that is clearly visible to the consumer that states, in letters that are at least one half-inch high, \"No person under the age of 21 may be sold tobacco products.\" Restrictions on the Sale of Tobacco Products through a Vending Machine In the State, a person may not sell, dispense, or offer to sell or dispense a tobacco product through a vending machine unless the vending machine is located in an establishment that individuals younger than age 21 are prohibited by law from entering at any t ime. Civil Fines for Unlawful Sale of Tobacco Products to Underage Individuals The bill specifies that if a person acting on behalf of a retailer violates specified prohibitions against the sale or distribution of tobacco products or ESD s, the retailer must pay the civil penalty. HB 1169/ Page 4 Current Law: Definitions Electronic Nicotine Delivery System s: \"ENDS\" means an electronic device, a component for an electronic device, or a product used to refill or resupply an electronic device that can be used to deliver nicotine to an individual inhaling from the device. \"ENDS \" includes an electronic cigarette, an electronic cigar, an electronic cigarillo, an electronic pipe, and vaping liquid. \"END S\" excludes a nicotine device that contains or delivers nicotine intended for human consumption that is approved by FDA for sale as a tobacco cessation product and is being marketed and sold solely for that purpose; cannabis oil or any other unlawful substance; or an electronic device that is being used to deliver cannabis oil or other unlawful substance. Tobacco Products: \"Tobacco product,\" as it applies to provisions of the Business Regulation, Criminal Law, Health-General, and Local Government articles, means any substance containing tobacco, including cigarettes, cigars, smoking tobacco, snuff, or smokeless tobacco. Business Regulation Article - Licensing and Fees Generally, a person must obtain a license to engage in the retail sale or wholesale distribution of cigarettes, OTPs, or ENDS. Licenses are subject to annual renewal. To renew a license, a licensee must pay the applicable license fee. Retail Licenses: The Comptroller issues cigarette retailer licenses, OTP retailer and tobacconist licenses, and ENDS retailer and vape shop vendor licenses through the local clerks of the court. To obtain one of these licenses, a person must (1) obtain a county license; (2) file an applicati on with the clerk; and (3) pay the clerk a specified fee, a portion of which is distributed to the Comptroller. The fee for a cigarette retailer license is $30; for an OTP retailer or a tobacconist license, $15; and for an ENDS or vape shop vendor license, $25. An applicant for an OTP retailer or tobacconist license need not pay the specified fee if the applicant holds a specified cigarette retailer license. In addition, a person need not obtain an ENDS retailer or vape shop vendor license if the person has a license to act as a cigarette or OTP retailer or tobacconist. Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems Wholesaler Licenses: The Comptroller issues ENDS wholesaler distributor and wholesaler importer licenses. An applicant for an ENDS wholesaler distributor or wholesaler importer license must (1) obtain a county license, (2) file an application with the Comptroller, and (3) pay to the Comptroller a fee of $150 . A person need not obtain an ENDS wholesaler license if the person has a license to act as a cigarette or OTP wholesaler. HB 1169/ Page 5 Sale of Tobacco Products through Vending Machines: In the State, a person may not sell, dispense, or offer to sell or dispense a tobacco product through a vending machine unless the vending machine is located in an establishment that minors are prohibited by law from entering; is located in a bona fide fraternal or veterans organization; or can only be operated with a token, card, or similar device that an individual can only obtain or purchase from the owner or an employee or agent of the owner. A violator is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a maximum fine of $100. Criminal Law Article - Tobacco Products and Minors A commercial tobacco distributor may not distribute a tobacco product, tobac co paraphernalia, a coupon redeemable for a tobacco product, or an ENDS to a minor unless the minor is acting solely as the agent of his or her employer if the employer distributes such products for commercial purposes. Likewise, someone else may not purchase for, sell to, or distribute to a minor a tobacco product, tobacco paraphernalia, or an ENDS. A person that violates these provisions is guilty of a misdemeanor and is subject to a maximum fine of $300 for a first violation, $1,000 for a second violation occurring within two years after the first violation, and $3,000 for each subsequent violation occurring within two years after the preceding violation. However, in a prosecution for a violation, it is a defense that the defendant examined the purchaser's or recipient's license or other valid identification that positively identified the purchaser or recipient as being at least age 18 . A minor may not use or possess tobacco products, cigarette rolling paper, or an ENDS unless he or she is acting as th e agent of the minor's employer within the scope of employment. Additionally, a minor is prohibited from using false forms of identifica tion to obtain tobacco products, cigarette rolling paper, or an ENDS, including a form of identification that identifies someone other than the minor. A minor who violates these provisions is guilty of a civil offense. Health -General Article - Tobacco Products and Minors Funding: State funds are used to (1) conduct media campaigns aimed at reducing s moking initiation, encouraging smokers to quit, and educating the public about the dange rs of secondhand smoke exposure; (2) enforce existing laws banning the sale and distribution of tobacco products to minors; (3) promote and implement smoking cessation programs; and (4) implement school-based tobacco education programs. Restrictions on Distribution of Tobacco Products and E lectronic Nicotine Delivery Systems to Minors: A person may not distribute a tobacco product, tobacco paraphernalia, or a coupon redeemable for a tobacco product to a minor. In addition, a person may not sell, distribute, or offer for sale to a minor an ENDS as defined under the Business Regulation Article. County health officers and designees of county health officers may HB 1169/ Page 6 issue civil citations for violations. A violator is subject to a maximum civil penalty of $300 for a first violation; $1,000 for a second violation occurring within 24 months after the previous violation; and $3,000 for each subsequent violation occurring within 24 months after the preceding violation. However, in a prosecution for a violation, it is a defense that the defendant examined the purchaser's or recipient's license or other valid identification that positively identified the purchaser or recipient as being at least age 18. The District Court must remit any penalties collected to the county in which the violation occurred. The imposition of a civil penalty precludes prosecution for a violation of criminal laws relating to the distribution of tobacco products or ENDS that arises out of the same violation, and vice versa. Local Government Article - Tobacco Products and Minors In Carroll, Cecil, Garrett, and St. Mary's counties, a person may not (1) distribute a tobacco product to a minor unless the minor is acting solely as the agent of the minor's employer who is engaged in the business of distributing tobacco products, (2) distribute cigarette rolling papers to a minor, or (3) distribute to a minor a coupon redeemable for a tobacco product. Civil penalties vary depending on the county. It is a defense if the person examined the recipient's driver's license or other valid government-issued identification that positively identified the recipient as at least age 18. A county health officer or the county health officer's designee may issue civil citations for violations (except in Cecil County, where only a sworn law enforcement officer may do so). The District Court must remit any penalties collected to the county in which the violation occurred. State Finance and Procurement Article - Cigarette Restitution Fund The Cigarette Restitution Fund is used to fund the Tobacco Use Prevention and Cessation Program; the Cancer Prevention, Education, Screening, and Treatment Program; and other various programs aimed at reducing the use of tobacco products by minors, education and public school campaigns to decrease tobacco use, promoting smoking cessation, and other public purposes. Background: Rise in Youth Tobacco Use FDA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report that, between 2017 and 2018, use of tobacco products by high school and middle school students in the United States increased by 27.1% and 7.2%, respectively. The increase in youth tobacco use is largely attributable to a rise in youth e-cigarett e use; between 2017 and 2018, e-cigarette use by high school and middle school students in the United States increased by 78% and 48%, respectively. HB 1169/ Page 7 Minimum Age for Tobacco in Other States According to the Campaign for Tobacco -Free Kids, as of January 2019, six states (California, Hawaii, Maine, New Jersey, Oregon, and Massachusetts) have raised the minimum age to purchase tobacco to 21, as have at least 430 localities (includin g New York City, Chicago, San Antonio, Boston, Cleveland, Minneapolis, both Kansas cities , and Washington, DC). Tobacco Taxes in Maryland Chapter 121 of 1999 increased the cigarette tax from 36 to 66 cents. In addition, Chapter 121 imposed a 15% tax on the wholesale price of OTPs such as cigars and smokeless tobacco. Chapter 288 of 2002 increased the cigar ette tax from 66 cents to $1.00 per pack. Chapter 6 of the 2007 special session increased the cigarette tax to $2.00 per pack. Chapter 2 of the first special session of 2012 increased the OTP tax rate from 15% to 30% of the wholesale price for all products except cigars, effective July 1, 2012. The tax rate f or cigars that are classified as premium cigars remained at 15% of the wholesale price; all other cigars are taxed at 70% of the wholesale price. Cigarette and OTP tax revenues accrue to the general fund. In addition, the State sales tax rate of 6% is imposed on the final retail price of cigarettes and OTPs. In fiscal 2018, cigarette tax revenues totaled $ 331.2 million, and OTP tax revenues totaled $41.3 million . State Revenues: The bill raises the minimum age to purchase tobacco products, tobacco paraphernalia, and ESDs from age 18 to 21. Based on prior-year estimates of the continued use among a portion of this cohort and the tax revenues apportioned to their current use, general fund revenues decrease, likely significantly, due to a decrease in the collection of the various taxes imposed on such products (cigarette and OTP excise taxes and sales tax). The State does not currently tax ESDs as tobacco products. Any decrease in sales tax revenue resulting from the increased minimum age for purchasing ESDs under the bill cannot be reliably estimated at this time . Nevertheless, Exhibit 1 is illustrative of the potential revenue loss stemming from the bill's alteration of the minimum age to purchase tobacco products from fiscal 2020 through 2024; the estimate for fiscal 2020 reflects the bill's October 1, 2019 effective date. This illustrative estimate is based on the following facts and assumptions: HB 1169/ Page 8 The Comptroller's Office advised in 2018 that the excise tax rate for OTP varies by product, but its weighted average is 43.5%. OTP tax collections are generally 10.9% of the amount collected for cigarettes. Thus, the reduction in OTP excise tax revenues is assumed to be 10.9% of the reduction in cigarette excise tax revenues. The Comptroller's Office estimated in 2018 that 25% of individuals ages 18 through 20 will continue to consume tobacco products - with purchase in Maryland - the f iscal year the increased minimum age takes effect. This amount is estimated to decrease to 15% in the second year and by approximately five percentage points annually for the next two years - as current users are more likely to purchase illegally - until it stabilizes at 5%. The Comptroller's Office based this estimate on U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data regarding youth cigarette use and population projections. Exhibit 1 Illustrative Tax Revenue Decreases Fiscal 2020 -2024 ($ in $6.1 Sales Tax 1.1 1.4 General Fund $4.8 $6.9 $7.2 $7.5 $7.5 Note: Includes excise and sales taxes for both cigarettes and other tobacco products. The fiscal 2020 projection reflects the bill's October 1, 2019 effective date. Source: Comptroller's Office (based on an estimate from the 2018 legislative session) The Department of Legislative Services (DLS) further advises that the impact of the bill's minimum age provision on tobacco tax revenues depends on rates of tobacco use among young adults that would be observed in the absence of the bill. In addition to moderating use among young adults, the bill likely changes the initiation age. For example, a ccording to a 2015 report by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), approximately 90% of adults who are daily smokers report first use before reaching age 19. In that report, IOM also estimated that raising the minimum age to 21 may result in a 12% decrease in the prevalence of smoking by the time current teenagers reach adulthood, and that smoking initiation rates among those ages 18 to 20 may decrease by 15%. However, IOM notes that these estimates are based on national models and do not take into account variations in tobacco use, HB 1169/ Page 9 initiation rates, tobacco control activities, or the effects of new products ( e.g., ESD) on future smoking and tobacco use rates. General fund revenue losses due to foregone taxes are slightly offset by increased licensing fee revenues under the bill. The bill doubles the fee, from $150 to $300, for an ENDS (ESD under the bill) wholesaler license. Revenues from these licensing fees accrue to the general fund. Accordingly, general fund revenues increase minimally from this provision. Generally, revenues from business licenses issued by local clerks of the court are split between local government (92%) and the State general fund (8%). Accordingly, 8% of the additional licensing fees collected under the bill's alteration of cigarette retailer, OTP retailer and tobacconist, and ENDS (ESD under the bill) retailer and vape shop vendor licenses accrue s to the State general fund. The Judiciary advises that, in 2018, there were a total of 6,782 cigarette retailer licenses, 6,601 OTP retailer and tobacconist licenses, and 123 ENDS retailer licenses issued in the State. Assuming that the number of licensees in each license category remains constant in future years, general fund revenues increase by approximately $147,400 in fiscal 2020 and $148,000 annually thereafter. This estimate accounts for the bill's October 1, 2019 effective date and the annual expiration of cigarette retailer and OTP retailer an d tobacconist licenses on April 30. However, as stated above, general fund revenue increases stemming from the bill's alteration of licensing fees only slightly offset general fund revenue decreases stemming from the bill's alteration of the minimum age for purchasing tobacco products. State Expenditures: Judiciary Programming Changes The Judiciary advises that the alteration of fees for specified retail licenses under the bill require s programming changes to its revenue collection system at a one-time cost of $11,490 in fiscal 2020. Thus, general fund expenditures increase accordingly. Maryland Department of Health Administrative Expenses MDH advises that, under the bill, training and educational materials for tobacco retailers and local health departments must be updated to reflect the bill's changes. These costs are anticipated to total $30,390, which include necessary mailings and modifi cation to enforcement and educational materials. Thus, general fund expenditures increase accordingly in fiscal 2020 only. HB 1169/ Page 10 Comptroller's Office Enforcement The Comptroller's Office did not respond to a request for information for this fiscal and policy note. However, it is assumed, for the purposes of this fiscal and policy note, that the Comptroller's Office can enforce the bill's provisions with existing resources. Potential Medicaid Expenditure Decrease The Maryland Association of County Health Officers has historically advised altering the minimum age for purchasing tobacco products to 21 likely results in Medicaid savings in the near term, particularly from a potential reduction in preterm births and related hospital stays (as smoking during pregnancy is a contributing factor to such preterm births) and in smoking-related health care costs ( e.g., asthma treatment and related emergency department visits), and that out-year savings are also likely realized through a reduction in health care costs associated with tobacco-related diseases ( e.g., cancer, heart disease, and stroke). Thus, to the extent the bill results in reduced health care costs covered by Medicaid, general fund expenditures decrease. Medicaid-eligible services are subject to a federal match rate (which varies depending on the coverage group of the individual). Therefore, federal fund expenditures also decrease; federal fund revenues decrease correspondingly. However, DLS advises that the extent of this impact cannot be reliably estimated at this time, as it depends on whether and to what extent the bill reduces tobacco use in the State . Local Revenues : As discussed above, local governments generally collect 92% of revenues from business licenses issued through the clerks of the court. Based on the number of cigarette retailer, OTP retailer and tobacconist, and ENDS retailer and vape shop vendor licenses issued in the State in 2018 (as discussed above), local revenues in the State increase, in the aggregate, by approximately $1.7 million in fiscal 2020 and annually thereafter from the bill's alteration of specified licensing fees, assuming the number of licensees in each license category remains constant. In addition, the bill expands the definition of tobacco product (to include ESDs) as it applies to several provisions of State law, including provisions pertaining to civil offenses for the unlawful distribution of tobacco products in Carroll, Cecil, Garrett, and St. Mary's counties. Accordingly, Carroll, Cecil, Garrett, and St. Mary's County revenues increase minimally from civil penalties to the extent that additional citations are issued under the bill's expansion of the definition of tobacco products. DLS notes that Montgomery Count recently imposed its own excise tax on electronic cigarette products , which became effective August 2015. The tax rate is 30% of the wholesale price. To the extent the bil l results in reduced sales of electronic cigarette products, Montgomery County revenues decrease. However, the extent of this decrease cannot be reliably estimated at this time . HB 1169/ Page 11 Small Business Effect: To the extent that small businesses in Maryland currently sell cigarettes, OTPs, and ESDs to young adults younger than age 21, sales decline. These businesses are subject to civil and criminal penalties if they continue to do so. Additional Comments: According to the Department of Juvenile Services, in fiscal 2018, citations issued for tobacco -related violations accounted for only 0.7% of juvenile offenses. Accordingly, the bill's repeal of provisions prohibiting minors from possessing tobacco products or attempting to obtain tobacco products with false identification is not likely to materially impact State or local operations.

Thank you for the opportunity to be here today to discuss the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA or the Agency) regulation of electronic nicotine delivery systems, or ENDS, which include e-cigarettes, and the Agency's role in the ongoing investigation into severe respiratory lung injury associated with e-cigarette use or vaping. I am Ned Sharpless, Acting Commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). FDA is deeply concerned by the severe respiratory lung injuries and reported deaths associated with e- cigarette use or vaping, and the Agency is working very closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state officials to investigate these incidents. FDA is committed to taking appropriate actions to protect the public as the facts emerge. To date, most patients have reported a history of using vaping products containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Many patients have reported using products containing THC and products containing nicotine. Some have reported the use of e-cigarette products containing only nicotine. I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to provide an update on FDA's regulation of ENDS, including the Administration's recent announcement to finalize a compliance policy that would prioritize enforcement against flavored ENDS to clear the market of those products, unless and until their marketing has been shown to be appropriate for the protection of the public health, as Congress required, and to provide an update on FDA's efforts to investigate the illnesses associated with the use of vaping products. Background Let me start with some basic background on our tobacco regulatory authorities. Tobacco use is the single largest preventable cause of disease and death in the United States. Each year, more than 480,000 people in the United States die prematurely from diseases caused by cigarette smoking and exposure to tobacco smoke. In 2009, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control ActTestimony of Norman E. \"Ned\" Sharpless, MD Before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations (/node/390633)(Tobacco Control Act) amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) to authorize FDA to oversee the manufacture, marketing, distribution, and sale of tobacco products and protect the public from the harmful effects of tobacco product use. This authority gave FDA comprehensive tools to protect the public from the harmful effects of tobacco use through science-based tobacco product regulation. With limited exceptions, FDA evaluates new tobacco products based on a public health standard that considers the risks and benefits of the tobacco product to the population as a whole, including users and non-users. Similarly, when developing regulations, the law generally requires FDA to apply a public health approach that considers the effect of the regulatory action on the population as a whole, not just on individual users, taking into account initiation and cessation of tobacco use. Under the statute, FDA had immediate authority to regulate cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, and smokeless tobacco. The Tobacco Control Act also authorized FDA to \"deem\" other \"tobacco products\" (which include \"any product made or derived from tobacco that is intended for human consumption\" that is not a drug, device, or combination product under the FD&C Act, \"including any component, part, or accessory\" of that product) to be subject to the Agency's regulatory authority in Chapter IX of the FD&C Act. On May 10, 2016, FDA issued a final rule (the \"deeming rule\") to deem additional products that meet the statutory definition of a \"tobacco product,\" except for accessories, to be subject to FDA's regulatory authority. Deemed products include ENDS, cigars, pipe tobacco, nicotine gels, waterpipe (or hookah) tobacco, and any future tobacco products. The deeming rule, and FDA's regulation of these products, took effect on August 8, 2016. Regulatory Requirements for ENDS Products When the deeming rule took effect in August 2016, many of the regulatory and legal requirements that had been in place for manufacturers of cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigarette tobacco, and roll-your-own tobacco since 2009, as well as several new requirements specific to deemed products, became applicable to makers of e-cigarettes and other ENDS products. These include:Registering domestic establishments and submitting lists of products manufactured at those establishments, including all labeling and representative samples of advertisements; Submitting tobacco health documents; Submitting ingredient listings; Marketing new tobacco products only after FDA review; and Marketing products with direct or implied claims of reduced risk only if FDA confirms that scientific evidence supports the claim and determines that providing a marketing authorization for the product will benefit the health of the population as a whole. In addition, the following regulatory provisions also apply to deemed tobacco products, including ENDS products:Minimum age restriction and identification requirement to prevent sales to underage youth; Requirements to bear certain health warnings on packages and advertisements (including certain ENDS components, such as e-liquids) such as, \"WARNING: This product contains nicotine. Nicotineis an addictive chemical\" and Prohibition of vending machine sales, unless in a facility that never admits youth. FDA recognized that industry would need time to comply with some of the new regulatory requirements triggered by the final deeming rule and announced a compliance policy with staggered timeframes for compliance. Some of the requirements, such as the Federal minimum age of purchase, took effect immediately when the deeming rule took effect on August 8, 2016, while, as an exercise of enforcement discretion, FDA provided industry with additional time to comply with other requirements, such as premarket review of \"new\" tobacco products. Premarket Review of ENDS All deemed products, including ENDS products, became subject to the premarket authorization requirements in the Tobacco Control Act on August 8, 2016. All \"new\" tobacco products are required to obtain authorization from FDA before they can be legally marketed. Pursuant to the Tobacco Control Act, a \"new\" tobacco product is one that was not commercially marketed as of February 15, 2007, or that was modified after February 15, 2007. FDA's initial compliance policy for premarket review stated that the Agency did not intend to enforce the requirements of premarket review against manufacturers of newly-regulated new tobacco products that were on the market as of August 8, 2016, as long as they submitted applications seeking marketing authorization within specific timeframes. As a result, FDA anticipated that many ENDS products would remain on the market without premarket authorization for up to three years. In July 2017, FDA announced a new comprehensive plan for tobacco and nicotine regulation that would serve as a multi-year roadmap in an effort to significantly reduce tobacco-related disease and death. The comprehensive plan was, in part, announced to afford the Agency time to explore clear and meaningful measures outside of premarket review to make combustible tobacco products less toxic, less appealing, and less addictive. One aspect of the plan involved striking a balance between regulation and encouraging development of innovative tobacco products that may be less harmful than cigarettes. The Agency announced that it planned to issue an updated compliance policy further deferring some enforcement timelines described in the final deeming rule. The July 2017 announcement led to publication of the August 2017 Compliance Policy, which was later the subject of litigation. In May 2019, a U.S. District Court in Maryland vacated FDA's 2017 Compliance Policy. In July 2019, the court ordered that applications for deemed \"new\" tobacco products such as e-cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, and hookah tobacco, that were on the market as of August 8, 2016, must be filed with FDA no later than May 12, 2020. The court order also provided for a one-year period during which products with timely filed applications might remain on the market pending FDA review, but subsequently clarified that its order does not restrict the agency's authority to enforce the premarket review provisions against deemed products prior to May 12, 2020, or during the one-year review period. No ENDS product in the United States is on the market legally. To be legally marketed as a tobacco product, the product would need to undergo FDA scientific review and the Agency would have to find that the marketing of the product is appropriate for the protection of the public health. Alternatively, an ENDSproduct that is marketed for therapeutic purposes as a drug would need to be reviewed under FDA's drug authorities, and approved for such marketing. There is no FDA-authorized or FDA-approved ENDS product currently on the market. FDA's Aggressive Actions to Address the Youth Epidemic of ENDS Product Use At the time FDA issued the August 2017 Compliance Policy to modify the enforcement discretion policies regarding premarket authorization, nationally representative data suggested that youth use of e-cigarettes had declined. 1 While no level of youth use is acceptable, FDA took this directional data into consideration, along with the potential for some such products to offer a public health benefit to some individual addicted adult smokers. In the context of these uncertainties and this evidence, and with the potential for FDA to pursue other bold measures, in part by reducing the addictiveness of combustible cigarettes while temporarily delaying the immediate market exit of innovative, potentially less harmful tobacco products, FDA determined that the balancing of public health considerations argued in favor of a different comprehensive approach. However, the NYTS 2018 data showed a significant increase in youth use of e- cigarettes. Data from the NYTS showed that, between 2017 and 2018, current e-cigarette use among high school students increased 78 percent, from 11.7 percent to 20.8 percent. 2 Current e-cigarette use among middle school students also increased by 48 percent over the same time period, from 3.3 percent to 4.9 percent. 3 Moreover, evidence demonstrates that youth are especially attracted to flavored ENDS products. Data from the 2018 NYTS showed that current (past 30-day) use of any flavored e-cigarette increased substantially among high school students who reported current e-cigarette use (60.9 percent to 67.8 percent) in just one year. 4 Preliminary data from the 2019 NYTS show a continued rise and disturbing rate of youth e-cigarette use, especially through the use of non-tobacco flavors that appeal to kids. In particular, the preliminary data show that more than a quarter of high school students were current e-cigarette users in 2019, and the majority of youth e-cigarette users cited the use of popular fruit and menthol/mint flavors. FDA must act to try to reverse these trends. We are committed to keeping tobacco products out of the hands of youth and will not stand idly by as a new generation becomes addicted to nicotine and tobacco products. I am committed to tackling the epidemic of youth e-cigarette use using the regulatory tools at the Agency's disposal. We are taking a number of actions to help address the epidemic: Earlier this month, the President announced that as part of the Administration's ongoing work to tackle the epidemic of youth e-cigarette use, FDA intends to finalize a compliance policy in the coming weeks that would prioritize the Agency's enforcement of the premarket authorization requirements for non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes, including mint- and menthol-flavored products. It is important to note that this does not mean flavored e-cigarettes can never be marketed\u2014if companies think they can show that specific products meet the standards established by Congress, then they can submit that evidence to FDA through a product application, which FDA will then evaluate. It does mean that FDA intends to prioritize enforcement action such that, unless and until the manufacturers of these products meet their burden under the Tobacco Control Act to show that scientific evidencedemonstrates that their marketing is appropriate for the protection of the public health, these products will be expected to exit the market. FDA has been holding retailers and manufacturers accountable for marketing and sales practices that have led to increased youth accessibility and appeal of e-cigarettes. For example, FDA has issued more than 10,000 warning letters and more than 1,400 civil money penalties to retailers, both online and in brick-and-mortar retail stores, for sales of ENDS and their components to youth. FDA has sent letters to about 90 companies seeking information on over 110 brands, including ENDS products, to determine whether those products were not marketed as of August 8, 2016, and therefore not subject to any previous FDA compliance policy. To date, FDA has issued warning letters to five ENDS companies notifying them of the need to remove a combined total of more than 40 products from the market.The Agency has issued warning letters, many in collaboration with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), that resulted in the removal of dozens of e-liquid products resembling kid-friendly foods, such as juice boxes, cereal, and candy. FDA and FTC sent warning letters to firms that make and sell flavored e-liquids for violations related to online posts by social media influencers on their behalf that lacked the required nicotine addiction warnings.On September 9, 2019, FDA issued a warning letter 5 to JUUL Labs Inc. for marketing unauthorized modified risk tobacco products by engaging in labeling, advertising, and/or other activities directed to consumers, including a presentation given to youth at a school, by marketing it for reduced risk or harm from using the product compared to cigarette smoking. Concurrently, the Agency issued a second letter expressing its concern and requesting additional information about several issues raised by Congress regarding JUUL's outreach and marketing practices, including those targeted at students, tribes, health insurers and employers.The Administration has also continued to invest in campaigns to educate youth about the dangers of e-cigarette use. Last year, FDA launched \"The Real Cost\" Youth E-Cigarette Prevention Campaign 6 - a comprehensive effort targeting nearly 10.7 million youth, aged 12-17, who have used e-cigarettes or are open to trying them. The campaign features hard-hitting advertising on TV, digital and social media sites popular among teens, as well as posters with e-cigarette prevention messages in high schools across the nation.FDA joined forces with Scholastic to develop educational resources for high school teachers and administrators. These materials have been distributed to over 700,000 high school educators. Our work with Scholastic continues, and we are currently developing additional resources, including lesson plans, for both middle and high school educators throughout this school year. The Agency also developed posters and resources for doctors, youth groups, churches, state and local public health agencies, and others on the dangers of youth e-cigarette use and has worked to advance discussion and understanding around how to help those kids who are already addicted to e-cigarettes quit. We will continue to take vigorous actions aimed at ensuring e-cigarettes and other tobacco products are not being marketed or sold to kids. In addition, we will continue and expand our public education efforts to get the word out to youth about the harms of e-cigarettes. Investing in Research to Learn More About the Health Impacts of ENDS Products FDA is funding several research projects assessing the health impact of e-cigarettes, including the FDA and NIH Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study. The PATH Study is a national, longitudinal cohort study of almost 46,000 youth and adults in the United States that collected its first wave of data in 2013 and is following study participants over time to learn how and why people start using tobacco products, quit using them, and start using them again after they have quit, as well as how different tobacco products affect health (such as cardiovascular and respiratory health) over time. The PATH Study is tracking potential behavioral and health impacts, including collecting biospecimens to analyze for biomarkers of exposure and harm. 7 In 2016, FDA awarded a contract to National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) to \"conduct an in-depth evaluation of the available evidence of health effects from electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and make recommendations for future federally funded research.\" This work included convening a multi-disciplinary committee of 13 members that met several times and holding an open meeting in order to obtain input from a wide range of stakeholders. The committee's methodology included a comprehensive literature search, literature review and quality assessment, evidence synthesis to assess causality for health effects, and application of a framework for levels of evidence. Over 800 peer-reviewed scientific studies were evaluated and the consensus report, \"Public Health Consequences of E-Cigarettes,\" was released by NASEM in January 2018. 8 Among the conclusions in the NASEM report is that teens who experiment with an e-cigarette are more likely to try conventional cigarettes compared to teens who never used an e-cigarette. As noted in the NASEM report, assessing the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes is challenging given the range of devices and constituents. For example, products can vary widely in terms of device type, mechanism, ingredients and the characteristics of aerosol generation. Variables of ENDS that could affect health impact include factors such as: exposure to metals (including heavy metals), heating capacity, e- liquid substrates, nicotine concentration, flavors and flavoring ingredients, and use of other ingredients or contaminants with unknown inhalation effects. A specific ENDS product's health impact is also likely to be significantly affected by user behaviors (and we know that many ENDS users also use other tobacco products in addition to e-cigarettes). Assessing the short-term health effects is also challenging for these same reasons. To help understand the individual and population impact of ENDS, FDA is funding studies assessing the short- and long-term health effects of e-cigarettes including nicotine dependence, cardiovascular and pulmonary toxicity, potential carcinogenesis, effects of maternal use during pregnancy, and effects in the oral cavity. 9 Investigation of Severe Respiratory Illnesses Associated with Vaping Products In recent weeks, an outbreak of severe respiratory lung injury associated with the use of vaping products has possibly sickened over 530 people from 38 states and one U.S. Territory. Sadly, seven deaths have been confirmed in California, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota, and Oregon. These illnesses do not appear to be due to infectious diseases but rather appear to be associated with a chemical exposure from vaping products. Patients report a gradual start of symptoms including breathing difficulty, shortness of breath, and/or chest pain before hospitalization. Many patients have reported recent use of vaping productscontaining THC. Although these cases seem similar, it is not clear if they have a common cause, or if they involve different diseases with similar presentations. The investigation has not identified any specific product or substance or vaping product that is linked to all cases. FDA is working closely with CDC and the affected states to investigate these cases. FDA's Office of Emergency Operations has activated an Incident Management Group (IMG) and is working alongside CDC's Incident Management System. The IMG serves as FDA's focal point for emergency management and is staffed by experts from across FDA. FDA's work to investigate the illnesses includes field sample collections in coordination with states, sample analysis, criminal and civil investigations, and coordination with state and Federal partners. FDA is also assisting states by collecting and analyzing samples. FDA's Forensic Chemistry Center (FCC) is an accredited laboratory in the field of forensic science testing and has experience in rapid response and specialized analytical services. FDA is analyzing samples for the presence of a broad range of chemicals, including nicotine, THC and other cannabinoids along with cutting agents/diluents and other additives, pesticides, opioids, poisons, and toxins. Many samples received have contained little to no liquid, which limits the amount of testing our laboratory is able to conduct. In most cases, patients have acknowledged recent use of THC-containing vaping products. Many patients have reported using products containing THC and products containing nicotine. Some have reported the use of e-cigarette products containing only nicotine. Similarly, the samples we are continuing to evaluate show a mix of results and no single substance, including Vitamin E acetate, has been identified in all of the samples tested. Importantly, identifying any compounds that are present in the samples will be one piece of the puzzle but will not necessarily answer questions about causality, which makes our ongoing work critical. Investigating this crisis is FDA's Office of Criminal Investigations' top priority. Our agents are following every possible lead, which includes traveling throughout the country and attempting to gather any available evidence, including devices, pods/cartridges, diluting agents, etc. FDA is working with our other Federal partners to investigate the illnesses. For example, we are working with Customs and Border Protection to identify potential illicit FDA-regulated products at the border. It is critical that FDA communicate with the public when we have information to share, and we work to do that as frequently and openly as possible. For example, earlier this month, FDA issued a warning to consumers to avoid THC-containing vaping products. While the investigation is ongoing, we strongly encourage consumers to help protect themselves and avoid buying vaping products of any kind on the street, and to refrain from using THC oil or modifying/adding any substances to products purchased in stores. FDA also encourages the public to submit detailed reports of any unexpected tobacco- or vaping- related product issues to FDA via the online Safety Reporting Portal, which can be found on our website (or at www.safetyreporting.hhs.gov). Conclusion Thank you for the opportunity to testify today about FDA's work to investigate the severe respiratory illnesses associated with vaping and our efforts to regulate ENDS products. It is an ever-changing landscape that FDA is committed to navigating with the goal of vigorously protecting and improving the public health. I am happy to answer any questions you may have.

The mission of PHACE is to facilitate the translation of public health science into policy and change through meaningful stakeholder partnerships and effective civic engagemen t by providing students a platform to advocate for and drive positive change on the campus and within their communities. One of our group's four foundational pillars focuses on the latest concerns and science in public health. The other four pillars include innovation to create new and exciting strategies for civic engagem ent, getting involved with community /organizational partnerships , and developing leadership and facilitating leadership opportunities . We have seen an increase of students using vaping devices in class and throughout the campus. Within the past year more research and information has become available on the potential negative consequences that ENDS usage on individuals as well as on air quality and public health. Changes in access a nd usage continue to be debated and change across the country and locally. In fact, in Spring 2019 the Residence Hall Association passed a resolution to ban ENDS such as Juuling and vaping, which was approved by the Department of Re sident Life. Th e 2019 -2020 UMD Residence Halls Handbook now in cludes Residence Hall Rule #26 which states, \"Using Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (also known as vapes, juuls, e -cigarettes) within any residence hall space, or within 25 feet of any residence hall [is prohibited] . These products and their health effects are under review and current investigation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and Natio nal Institutes of Health. Student use on campus has both personal and environmental impacts. When students vape in class it adds smoke and vapor to the classroom , polluting the air , disturbing other students, and distract ing the stu dents and the instructor from the lecture and from the educational experience. Additionally, students often vape in other campus spaces, as well as litter their used pods on campus, making campus less clean and harming the environment. We believe that updating the language in University of Maryland's smoking policy to explicitly mention and ban ENDS usage would improve our health , the educational experience and preserve the environment , ultimately making the campus cleaner and safer. Maddie News Maddie News President , Public Health Action for Civic Engagement To Whom it May Concern, As representatives of the Student Government Association (SGA), we are writing in support of amending the smoking policy to explicitly ban electronic nicotine device systems (ENDS). This proposal would help students and faculty understand their rights rega rding what is non -permissible smoking product. There are many smoking products introduced that appeal to young adults and they change constantly. ENDS are used heavily on campus, yet with the way the policy is currently worded it is unclear whether or not these devices are allowed. The language proposed in the new policy should be clear to students, yet sustainable so amendments will not have to be made in the future. This proposal aims to tear down any misconceptions and clarify smoking concerns that may b e experienced by students, faculty or staff. SGA strives to promote and advocate for the physical, mental, and social health of the undergraduate student body. This approach proposed by the School of Public Health, combined with collaboration from the Univ ersity Health Center, the Department of Recreation and Wellness, and student leadership can help foster a smoke -free environment, which aligns with the SGA's values on Health and Wellness. In the past, the Residence Hall Association (RHA) has passed a very similar proposal of banning the use of vapes in residence halls. Collaborating with different governing bodies, academic colleges on campus, and departments can lead to a nicotine -free community that benefits the campus and the health of our community. Students, faculty, and staff should understand the smoke -free policy includes ENDS. As we anticipate some students' disagreement with this proposal, we look forward to future discussions and education to facilitate adherence to the policy change. We believe that this has the potential of creating a smoke -free campus leading to improvement in students' mental, physical, and nutritional wellbeing. This proposal is a productive first step to achieve a smoke -free campus. Therefore, we urge the University Senate and the Campus Affairs Committee to look favorably on a proposal and approve an amendment to the smoking policy at the University of Maryland - College Park. _____________________ _____________________ Kelly Sherman Ireland Lesley Director of Health and Wellness Student Body President The opinions in this letter are the authors' own and do not necessarily represent the views of the Student Government Association. VAPING SYNOPSIS - CAC 1 Brief Synopsis of Research on the Second -Hand Effects of Vaping Conventional smoking produces second -hand smoke (SHS), which is well established as a health risk to bystanders. The SHS comes from the end of the burning cigarette (or other tobacco -based products such as cigars, pipes, hookahs) and from the exhalations of the active smoker. Vaping (meaning use of anything in the category of electronic smoking simulation devices) produces a similar effect called second hand aerosol ( SHA) , not from the pa ssive vaping device itself but from the exhalations of the active vaper. There is a great intere st in continuing the evaluation of vaping as a less -risky alternative to conventional smoking, and the evidence is strong at several levels of examination. There is very little disagreement that smoking is extremely harmful to the smoker and also to bystanders, and that vaping in general is substantially less risky for vapers and bystanders. As a step -down from smoking for people who want to reduce personal risk yet still use nicotine or who want to quit smoking entirely, the change to vaping may be a good decision (Nitzkin, 2014) . What is less clear are the risks associated with vaping itself, particularly given its possible role in increases in nicotine consumption and addiction in young adults (Gentzke et al., 2019) . Risks from SHS compared to risks from S HA are very different. SHS contains measurable particulates, including microscopic carbon and heavy metals (Avino et al., 2018) which are produced by the combustion of both tobacco and any possible additives . The authors note that vaping produces water droplet vapor rather than particle -based smoke. While carcinogenic substances can be transmitted in water vapor, the calculated lung cancer risk for tobacco cigarettes is approximately 15 times greater than for e -cigarettes, the risk associate e- cigarettes is estimated as 3 times greater than for non-users. VAPING SYNOPSIS - CAC 2 While SHA is lower risk than SHS, there are specific subst ances that are still very concerning for bystanders. Papaefstathiou et al. (2019) confirm that SHA has little to no particulate components, but the droplets convey volatile organic compound s (VOCs) , including acetone, acetaldehyde, benzene, and formaldehyd e among many others. These are measured in the inhaled and the exhaled vapor, such that these substances can reach bystanders. From Papaefstabhiou et al. (2019) VAPING SYNOPSIS - CAC 3 Testing t hat mimic s real-world environments has shown that SHA causes symptoms of irritation in bystanders. In a s imulat ed office setting , Visser et al. (2019) measured the exhaled air and sampled room air before and after a typical vaping session from 17 volunteer vapers. Across these sessions, levels of nicotine alone were recorded at elevated levels that would cause acute symptoms in bystanders such as heart palpitations and increase blood pressure . The other SHA contents -- propylene glycol , heavy metals, and VOCs -- cause respiratory irritation from acute exposure, but longer -term effects from SHA remain to be seen. While it is abundantly clear that SHS is very harmful, there is growing evidence that SHA is also harmful. This has bearing on governance of shared spaces. While the evidence regarding long -term impact of SHA remains t o be established, there is clear evidence that preventing SHA exposure for bystanders will have protective benefits. Those who choose to be nicotine users have options such as gum, lozenges, or patches that can meet their needs with no effects on bystander s.

Review of the Interim Policy on Use of University of Maryland Facilities by Non - University Users for Research -Related Activities ISSUE In March 2019, the President approved revisio ns to the University of Maryland Policy on Use of University of Maryland Facilities by Non -University Users for Research -Related Activities (VIII - 14.00[A]) on an interim basis, pending University Senate review. In September 2019, the Senate Executive Commi ttee (SEC) charged the Campus Affairs Committee with reviewing the interim policy, consulting with a range of stakeholders, reviewing similar policies at Big 10 and peer institutions, considering whether the interim policy accurately reflects current pract ice and ensures sufficient oversight of research taking place in University facilities, and recommending changes, as appropriate . RECOMMENDATIONS The Campus Affairs Committee recommends that the interim Policy on Use of University of Maryland Facilities by Non -Univer sity Users for Research -Related Activities (VIII -14.00[A]) be revised as indicated in the policy document immediately following this report . COMMITTEE WORK The committee reviewed the interim policy, and over the course of fall 2019 consulted with a wide range of stakeholders. The committee id entified issues with the current policy including, a cumbersome and inefficient review and approval process and a lack of meaningful oversight and accountability. The committee also investigated practices at Big 10 and peer institutions, but did not find a ny comprehensive policies that address the types of agreements covered by the policy. Over the course of spring 2020, the committee revised the policy to address the concerns it identified, emphasize key principles, clarify the responsibilities of both ext ernal users and the University, and align the policy's structure and language with University policy conventions. The most substantive revisions address the overarching concerns involving process and questions of oversight and accountability. The revisions were informed by extensive stakeholder consultation, particularly with representatives of the Division of Research; the Senior Vice President & Provost; the Department of Environmental Safety, Sustainability & Risk; and the Office of General Counsel. The revised policy was shared with the University Research Council, which proposed minor revisions that the committee incorporated.

In September 2019, the Senate Executive Committee (SEC) charged the Campus Affairs Committee with reviewing the interim policy and related documentation; consulting with a range of stakeholders; reviewing similar policies at Big 10 and peer institutions; c onsidering whether the interim policy accurately reflects current practice and ensures sufficient oversight of research taking place in University facilities; and recommending changes, as appropriate (Appendix 3) . CURRENT PRACTICE The policy addresses the use of University f acilities for research -related activities that are unrelated to the University's research mission, as well as other activities that support research that take place in a limited number of areas on or near campus. The policy encompasses research -related act ivities conducted by \"non -University\" or \"external\" users , but it does not address research activities undertaken by University faculty, staff, or students in connection with their own employment or studies. External users can be individuals, companies, or entities that have no affiliation with the institution, or, more commonly, faculty members who have created or are considering creating private companies. The research conducted by these faculty members must be kept separate from their University -related research and cannot involve University students. The research -related activities covered by the policy primarily occur in two types of spaces. The first consists of incubators intended to encourage faculty to explore ways to commercialize their research. Incubators help faculty members identify potential markets for their innovations and support them through the process required to actually bring a product to market. The most significant of these 2019-2020 Committee Members Date of Submission UNIVERSITY SENATE REPORT | #18-19-32 Senate Campus Affairs Committee Report for Senate Document #18-19-32 2 of 5 incubators is the Maryland Technology Enterprise Institute, or Mtech. Mtech is part of the Clark School of Engineering, and includes a range of spaces in the Rabin Building on campus as well as off -campus laboratory and office space. While incubator spaces are designed for purposes that align with this policy, the policy also enables the use of spaces within existing academic facilities that are typically used for University research. External users can use portions of laboratories or office spaces that are not currently in use, or can use them at particular hours w hen such use will not interfere with the normal activities of the University. The University has priority use of these spaces. To use such spaces, external users must sign a Facilities Use License. The current process for creating a license is outlined in an application form accompanying the policy, referred to as Exhibit A (Appendix 2), which is used to gather necessary information and which indicates mandatory meetings with various administrators and University oversight bodies before a license can be ap proved. Steps required by the review process include signatures by : the relevant department chair (or equivalent) and the relevant dean; the Department of Environmental Safety, Sustainability & Risk (ESSR); the Conflict of Interest C ommittee; the Senior Vice P resident & Provost; the Director of Facilities Planning; the Facilities Council; and the Vice President for Administration & Finance (in consultation with the Office of General Counsel, as necessary) . At present, the review and approval process involves transferring physical copies of applications between offices. Facilities Use Licenses are established for one -year terms, with the pos sibility for renewal at the University's sole discretion. The policy does not establish any initial or subsequent reviews or inspections to ensure compliance with the terms of the Facilities Use License. To date, there have been relatively few licenses est ablished under the interim policy, though their number will likely increase in response to the University's focus on entrepreneurship and increasing interest in licensing the University's intellectual property . In March 2019, the policy was revised on an interim basis, pending Senate review. The revisions reflected in the int erim policy were necessary to clarify the policy's provisions and definitions, align the policy with current practice, and more clearly indicate that users are responsible for disposing of hazardous materials upon the expiration of a Facilities Use Licens e. The interim policy also introduced Exhibit A, a more extensive form used to gather the information necessary to consider an application and inform the creation of the Facilities Use License . COMMITTEE WORK The committee reviewed the interim policy and Exhibit A, and over the course of fall 2019 consulted with a wide range of stakeholders, including representatives of the following : A. James Clark School of Engineering Conflict of Interest Committee Department of Environmental Safety, Sustainability & Risk (ESSR) Division of Administration and Finance Division of R esearch Report for Senate Document #18-19-32 3 of 5 Facilities Council Maryland Technology Enterprise Institute ( Mtech ) Office of General Counsel (OGC) Office of Technology Commercialization Office of the Senior Vice President & Provost The committee identified concerns and questions that stakeholders indicated should be resolved, which fall under two general categories : process, and oversight/accountability. The committee also investigated similar policies and practices at Big 10 and peer institutions. While institutions have policies governing the us e of space and how such use is prioritized, most entrepreneurial work by faculty takes place in dedicated incubators rather than academic spaces, and the committee did not find any comprehensive policies that address the types of agreements covered by the interim policy. If the use of non -incubator spaces is permitted, there are agreements to use specialized equipment or space that are handled on an individual basis, and involve conflict of interest reviews and licensing agreements similar to the Universi ty's Facilities Use License . Over the course of spring 2020, the committee revised the interim policy to address the concerns it identified. The committee reorganized and reworded the policy to align with University policy conventions, emphasize principles, and clar ify the responsibilities of both external users and the University. The most substantive revisions address the overarching concerns identified in the course of the committee's review, which involve process and questions of oversight and accountability. The revisions were informed by extensive stakeholder consultation, particularly with representatives of the Division of Research, the Senior Vice President & Provost, ESSR, and the Office of General Counsel. The revised policy was shared with the Research Council, which proposed min or revisions that the committee incorporated. After due consideration, the committee voted to approve the revised Policy on Use of University of Maryland Facilities by Non -University Users for Research -Related Activities by an email vote concluding on Apri l 12, 2020. Key concerns identified by the committee's review and policy revisions that address them are described below. Process The committee found widespread frustration with the current system for considering and approving appli cations, particularly its reliance on paper materials. Applications have been delayed for weeks or even months since the current process of reviewing and approving applications is sequential. Through discussion, the committee and the Vice President for Research ( VPR) agreed that the Di vision of Research should manage and maintain the application in order to reduce this frustration. The Division of Research intends to adopt an electronic approach that will eliminate the need for paper copies, allow for electronic signatures and parallel reviews, permit easy tracking of an application from submission to final approval, and create a more robust archive accessible to all the administrators involved in the review process. This application will be maintained and updated separately from the pol icy, which eliminates the need to retain Exhibit A . The structure of the interim policy has led to some uncertainty over what is involved in each stage of the review, and what precisely is being affirmed by each approval. For example, it is unclear to some stakeholders that the review conducted by the Department of Environmental Safety, Sustainability & Risk (ESSR) is limited to determining what materials or substances may be brought into a particular space. Through its consultations, the committee also learned that Report for Senate Document #18-19-32 4 of 5 the review and approval process may be too extensive. For instance, concerns that would be found in a review by the Director of Facilities Planni ng or the Facilities Council are typically also raised by others involved in the review process. The committee found that the current process is too rigid, and is not appropriate for some activities covered by the policy. For example, applications by exter nal users who are interested in leasing a mailbox or standard office space go through the full review process, including review by ESSR, which is unnecessary. This is partly because the \"research -related activities\" covered by the policy are not defined . The revised policy streamlines the review process by eliminating unnecessary stages and giving the VPR the ability to determine whether a review by ESSR is necessary for each application. The VPR is also given responsibility for o verseeing the application review process, and for ensuring that all necessary approvals are obtained. The policy now identifies what each administrator is responsible for reviewing and verifying, and includes a definition of \"research - related activity.\" Oversight/Accountability The interim policy states that it is intended to \"ensure compliance...with federal, state and local laws and regulations.\" However, concerns were raised that the policy and its implementation do not adequately ensure such compliance due to a lack of oversight and accountability. This potentially endangers both members of the University community and external users, and could expose the institution to liability. The committee found that the policy lacks an administrative owner, in that no office or officer is identified as responsible for administering the policy, overseeing the application review process, or verifying whether the terms of the Facilities Use License are being followed. While several stages involve the Division of Research, and while the Divisio n of Research has typically assumed responsibility for shepherding applications through the review process, stakeholders indicated that there would be value in clarifying lines of authority and responsibility. The revised policy addresses these concerns by identifying the VPR as responsible for administering the policy. The VPR's role will include . certifying that an application is complete and recommending whether it should be advanced to the licensing process; receiving and reviewing documentation of the e xternal user's compliance with any oversight requirements, both during the application process and during the term of the Facilities Use License; reviewing requests for renewal of a Facilities Use License; and overseeing the process of closing out expired or terminated licenses . The committee also found that the policy does not clearly articulate the role and responsibilities of the \"University Sponsor\" who supports the proposed research -related activity. The role of the University Sponsor has now been more fully defined. Sponsors are responsible for ensuring oversight of the space being used for the research -related activity, and for participating in the closeout process. The process for reviewing applications does not include extensive review of safety and regulatory complian ce issues. Multiple stakeholders expressed concerns with the role of ESSR. ESSR's responsiveness and its prompt review of applications was universally praised. However, its review does not involve the same assessments that it makes when considering the use of University facilities for University research activities. For external users, ESSR does not assess Report for Senate Document #18-19-32 5 of 5 whether an environmental health and safety program is necessary, and does not ensure that an external user has identified a qualified vendor to dispose o f regulated waste. ESSR is also not involved in reviewing safety -related compliance prior to the renewal of a Facilities Use License. Without more extensive reviews and assurances that regulations are being followed, the University cannot ensure that risk and compliance issues are being adequately addressed. To address these concerns, the role of ESSR has been expanded. In the course of its review of an application, ESSR will now be responsible for recommending whether the external user should be required t o employ or contract with a qualified environmental health and safety professional and/or develop a plan to dispose of any regulated waste. Any requirements identified by ESSR will be written into the terms of the Facilities Use License, and compliance wit h them verified prior to any license renewal . The revised policy also addresse s how Facilities Use Licenses are renewed and establishes parameters for how they are closed out upon expiration or termination. The policy gives the VPR responsibility for overseeing both processes. The renewal process involves a review by the VPR that pa rallels the initial application review but is tailored to the specific research -related activity. The policy now establishes elements of a closeout process involving the University Sponsor that ensures an external user has left the space in good and secure condition, disposed of any waste or hazardous materials, and generally fulfilled their obligations under the terms of the Facilities Use License . RECOMMENDATIONS The Campus Affairs Committee recommend s that the interim Policy on Use of University of Maryland Facilities by Non -University Users for Research -Related Activities (VIII-14.00[A]) be revised as indicated in the policy document immediately following this report.
