Coinsurance generally refers to a percentage (for example, 20 percent) of the Medicare payment rate for which the beneficiary is liable and is applicable under the PFS, while copayment generally refers to an established amount that the beneficiary must pay that is not necessarily related to a particular percentage of the Medicare payment, and is applicable under the hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS). Waiver of Deductible for Preventive Services and Screening Section 4104(b)of the Affordable Care Act amends section 1833(b)(1) of the Act to waive the deductible for preventive services described in subparagraph (A) of section 1861(ddd)(3) of the Act that have a grade of A or B from the USPSTF. In addition, section 4103(c)(1) of the Affordable Care Act waives the deductible for the AWV. These provisions are effec tive for services furnished on and after January 1, 2011. Section 101(b)(2) of the MIPPA amended section 1833(b) of the Act to waive the deductible for the IPPE effective January 1, 2009. NOTE: Not all preventive services allowed in Medicare and recommended by the USPSTF have a Grade of A or B, and therefore, some of the preventive services do not meet the criteria in sections 1833(a)(1) and (b)(1) of the Act for the waiver of deductible and co insurance. Refer to the Preventive Services Table in section 5.2, of this section, for specific USPSTF ratings for preventive services. 10 - Pneumococcal Pneumonia, Influenza Virus, and Hepatitis B Vaccines (Rev. A/B MACs (B), Part B of Medicare pays 100 percent of the Medicare allowed amount for pneumococcal, influenza, and hepatitis B virus vaccines and their administration. Part B deductible and coinsurance do not apply for pneumococcal, influenza, and hepatitis virus vaccine. State laws governing who may administer pneumococcal and influenza virus vaccinations and how the vaccines may be transported vary widely. Medicare contractors should instruct physicians, supplier s, and providers to become familiar with state regulations for all vaccines in the areas where they will be immunizing. 10.1 - Coverage Requirements (Rev. 1586, vaccine, influenza virus vaccine, and hepatitis B vaccine and their administration are covered only under Medicare Part B, regardless of the setting in which they are furnished, even when provided to an inpatient during a hospital stay covered under Part A. See Pub. 100- 02, Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, chapter 15, for additional coverage requirements for pneumococcal vaccine, hepatitis B vaccine, and influenza virus vaccine. 10.1.1 - Pneumococcal Security Act and regulations at 42 CFR 410.57 authorize Medicare coverage under Part B for pneumococcal vaccine and its administration. Medicare does not require for coverage purposes, that a doctor of medicine or osteopathy order the pneumococcal vaccine and its administration. Therefore, the beneficiary may receive the vaccine upon request without a physician's order and without physician supervision. See Pub. 100- 02, Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, chapter 15, section 50.4.4.2 for complete coverage requirements for pneumococcal vaccine. 10.1.2 - Influenza Virus 08- 08-11, Implementation: 08- 08-11) Effective for services furnished on or after May 1, 1993, the influenza virus vaccine and its administration is covered when furnished in compliance with any applicable State law. Typically, this vaccine is administered once a flu season. Medicare does not require for coverage purposes that a doctor of me dicine or osteopathy order the vaccine. Therefore, the beneficiary may receive the vaccine upon request without a physician's order and without physician supervision. Since there is no yearly limit, A/B MACs (A) and (B) determine whether such services ar e reasonable and allow payment if appropriate. See Pub. 100- 02, Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15, Section 50.4.4.2 for additional coverage requirements for influenza virus vaccine. 10.1.3 - Hepatitis B Vaccine (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) Effective for services furnished on or after September 1, 1984, the hepatitis B vaccine and its administration is covered if it is ordered by a doctor of medicine or osteopathy and is available to Medicare beneficiaries who are at high or intermediate risk of contractin g hepatitis B, e.g., exposed to hepatitis B. See the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15, for additional coverage requirements for hepatitis B vaccines to high risk and intermediate risk groups. 10.2 - Billing Requirements (Rev. 3621, Issued: 10- 07-16, Effective: 10- 01-16, Implementation: 10-03-16) A Edits Not Applicable to Pneumococcal or Influenza Virus Vaccine Bills and Their Administration The Common Working File (CWF) and shared systems bypass all Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) utilization edits in CWF on all claims when the only service provided is pneumococcal or influenza virus vaccine and/or their administration. This waiver does not apply when other services (e.g., office visits) are billed on the same claim as pneumococcal or influenz a virus vaccinations. If the provider knows or has reason to believe that a particular group health plan covers pneumococcal or influenza virus vaccine and their administration, and all other MSP requirements for the Medicare beneficiary are met, the prim ary payer must be billed. First claim development alerts from CWF are not generated for pneumococcal or influenza virus vaccines. However, first claim development is performed if other services are submitted along with pneumococcal or influenza virus vaccines. See Pub. 100- 05, Medicare Secondary Payer Manual, chapters 4 and 5, for responsibilities for MSP development where applicable. B Institutional Claims Chapter 25 of this manual provides general billing instructions that must be followed for institutional claims. The following \"providers of services\" may administer and submit institutional claims to the MACs for these vaccines: Hospitals; Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs); Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs); Home Health Agencies (HHAs); Hospices; Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facilities (CORFs); and Indian Health Service (IHS)/Tribally owned and/or operated hospitals and hospital -based facilities. Other billing entities that may submit institutional claims are: Independent Ren al Dialysis Facilities (RDFs). All providers submit institutional claims for hepatitis B. Providers other than independent RHCs and freestanding FQHCs submit institutional claims for influenza virus and pneumococcal vaccinations. (See \u00a710.2.2.2 of this chapter for special instructions for independent RHCs and freestanding FQHCs.) Institutional providers, other than independent RHCs and freestanding FQHCs, should bill for the vaccines and their administration on the same bill. Separate bills for vaccines and their administration are not required. The only exceptions to this rule occur when the vaccine is administered during the course of an otherwise covered home health visit since the vaccine or its administration is not included in the visit ch arge. (See \u00a710.2.3 of this chapter). C Professional Claims Billing for Additional Services If a physician sees a beneficiary for the sole purpose of administering the influenza virus vaccine, the pneumococcal vaccine, and/ or the hepatitis B vaccine, they may not routinely bill for an office visit. However, if the beneficiary actually receives other services constituting an \"office visit\" level of service, the physician may bill for a visit in addition to the vaccines and t heir administration, and Medicare will pay for the visit in addition to the vaccines and their administration if it is reasonable and medically necessary. Nonparticipating Physicians and Suppliers Nonparticipating physicians and suppliers (including loca l health facilities) that do not accept assignment may collect payment from the beneficiary for the administration of the vaccines, but must submit an unassigned claim on the beneficiary's behalf. Effective for claims with dates of service on or after February 1, 2001, per \u00a7114 of the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000, all drugs and biologicals must be paid based on mandatory assignment. Therefore, regardless of whether the physician and supplier usually accept assignment, they must accep t assignment for the vaccines, may not collect any fee up front, and must submit the claim for the beneficiary. Entities, such as local health facilities, that have never submitted Medicare claims must obtain a National Provider Identifier (NPI) for Part B billing purposes. Separate Claims for Vaccine and Their Administration In situations in which the vaccine and the administration are furnished by two different entities, the entities should submit separate claims. For example, a supplier (e.g., a pharmacist) may bill separately for the vaccine, using the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code for the vaccine, and the physician or supplier (e.g., a drugstore) who actually administers the vaccine may bill separately for the administration , using the HCPCS code for the administration. This procedure results in contractors receiving two claims, one for the vaccine and one for its administration. For example, when billing for influenza virus vaccine administration only, billers should list only HCPCS code G0008 in block 24D of the Form CMS -1500. When billing for the influenza virus vaccine only, billers should list only HCPCS code 90658 in block 24D of the Form CMS -1500. The same applies for pneumococcal and hepatitis B billing using pneum ococcal and hepatitis B HCPCS codes. 10.2.1 - Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) and Diagnosis and their administration are reported using separate codes. The following codes are for reporting the vaccines only. HCPCS Definition 90630 Influenza virus vaccine, quadrivalent (IIV4), split virus, preservative free, intradermal vaccine, inactivated, subunit, adjuvanted, for use Influenza virus vaccine, split virus, preservative -free, for intradermal use, for adults ages 18 - 64; 90655 Influenza virus vaccine, split virus, preservative free, for children 6 - 35 months of age, for intramuscular use; 90656 Influenza virus vaccine, split virus, preservative free, for use in individuals 3 years and above, for intramuscular use; 90657 Influenza virus vaccine, split virus, for children 6 -35 months of age, for intramuscular use; 90658 Influenza virus vaccine, trivalent (IIV3), split virus, 0.5 mL dosage, for intramuscular use 90660 Influenza virus vaccine, live, for intranasal use; 90661 Influenza virus vaccine, derived from cell cultures, subunit, preservative and antibiotic free, for intramuscular use 90662 Influenza virus vaccine, split virus, preservative free, enhanced immunogenicity via increased antigen content, for intramuscular use 90670 Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, 13 valent, for virus vaccine, live, quadrivalent, for intranasal use 90673 Influenza virus vaccine, trivalent, derived from recombinant DNA (RIV3), hemagglutinin (HA) protein only, preservative and antibiotic free, for intramuscular use 90674 Influenza virus vaccine, quadrivalent (ccIIV4), derived from cell cultures, subunit, preservative and antibiotic free, 0.5 mL dosage, for intramuscular use 90682 Influenza virus vaccine, quadrivalent (RIV4), derived from recombinant DNA, hemagglutinin (HA) protein only, preservative and antib iotic free, for intramuscular use 90685 Influenza virus vaccine, quadrivalent, split virus, preservative free, when administered to children 6- 35 months of age, for intramuscular use 90686 Influenza virus vaccine, quadrivalent, split virus, preservative free, when administered to individuals 3 years of age and older, for intramuscular use 90687 Influenza virus vaccine, quadrivalent, split virus, when administered to children 6 -35 months of age, for intramuscular use 90688 90694 Influenza virus vaccine, quadrivalent, split virus, when administered to individuals 3 years of age and older, for intramuscular use Influenza virus vaccine, quadrivalent (aIIV4), inactivated, adjuvanted, Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, 23 -valent, adult or immunosuppressed patient dosage, for us in individuals 2 years or older, for subcutaneous or intramuscular use; 90739 Hepatitis B vaccine, adult dosage (2 dose schedule), for intramuscular use 90740 Hepatitis B vaccine, dialysis or immunosuppressed patient dosage (3 dose schedule), for intramuscular use; 90743 Hepatitis B vaccine, adolescent (2 dose schedule), for intramuscular use; 90744 Hepatitis B vaccine, pediatric/adolescent dosage (3 dose schedule), for intramuscular use; 90746 Hepatitis B vaccine, adult dosage, for intramuscular use; and 90747 Hepatitis B vaccine, dialysis or immunosuppressed patient dosage (4 dose schedule), for intramuscular use. 90756 Influenza virus vaccine, quadrivalent (ccIIV4), derived from cell cultures, subunit, antibiotic free, 0.5mL dosage, for intramuscular use Note: For the Medicare- covered codes for the influenza vaccines approved by FDA for current influenza vaccine season, please go to: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare- Fee-for-Service- Part-B- Drugs/McrPartBDrugAvgSalesPrice/VaccinesPricing.html The following codes are for reporting administration of the vaccines only. The administration of the vaccines is billed using: HCPCS Definition G0008 Administration of influenza virus vaccine; G0009 Administration of pneumococcal vaccine; and *G0010 Administration of hepatitis B vaccine. *90471 Immunization administration. (For OPPS hospitals billing for the hepatitis B vaccine administration) *90472 Each additional vaccine. (For OPPS hospitals billing for the hepatitis B vaccine administration) * NOTE: For claims with dates of service prior to January 1, 2006, OPPS and non- OPPS hospitals report G0010 for hepatitis B vaccine administration. For claims with dates of service January 1, 2006 until December 31, 2010, OPPS hospitals report 90471 or 90472 for hepatitis B vaccine administration as appropriate in place of G0010. Beginning January 1, 2011, providers should report G0010 for billing under the OPPS rather than 90471 or 90472 to ensure correct waiver of coinsurance and deductible for the administration of hepati tis B vaccine. One of the following diagnosis codes must be reported as appropriate. If the sole purpose for the visit is to receive a vaccine or if a vaccine is the only service billed on a claim, the applicable following diagnosis code may be used. ICD-9-CM Diagnosis Code Description V03.82 Pneumococcus V04.81** Influenza V06.6*** Pneumococcus and Influenza V05.3 Hepatitis B *Effective for influenza virus claims with dates of service October 1, 2003 and later. ***Effective October 1, 2006, providers may report ICD -9-CM diagnosis code V06.6 on claims for pneumococcus and/or influenza virus vaccines when the purpose of the visit was to receive both vaccines. NOTE : ICD -10-CM diagnosis code Z23 may be used for an encounter for immunizations eff ective October 15, 2015, when ICD -10 was implemented. If a diagnosis code for pneumococcus, hepatitis B, or influenza virus vaccination is not reported on a claim, contractors may not enter the diagnosis on the claim. Contractors must follow current resolution processes for claims with missing diagnosis codes. If the diagnosis code and the narrative description are correct, but the HCPCS code is incorrect, the A/B MAC (A or B) may correct the HCPCS code and pay the claim. For example, if the reported diagnosis code is V04.81 and the narrative description (if annotated on the claim) says \"flu shot\" but the HCPCS code is incorrect, contractors may change the HCPCS code and pay for the flu vaccine. Effective October 1, 2006, A/B MACs (B) should follow the instructions in Pub. 100- 04, Chapter 1, Section (A/B MAC (B) Data Element Requirements) for claims submitted without a HCPCS code. Claims for hepatitis B vaccinations must report the I.D. Number of the referring physician. In addition, if a doctor of me dicine or osteopathy does not order the influenza virus vaccine, the A/B MACs (A) claims require: UPIN code SLF000 to be reported on claims submitted prior to May 23, 2008, when Medicare began accepting NPIs, only The provider's own NPI to be reported in the NPI field for the attending physician on claims submitted on or after May 23, 2008, when NPI requirements were implemented. AC (A) number, the beneficiary Health Insurance Claim (HIC) number, and the date of service, the influenza virus or 90732, and the administration codes G0008 or G0009. If CWF receives a it already has on record a claim with the same HIC number, same A/B MAC (A) number, same date of service, and any one of those HCPCS codes, the second claim submitted to CWF rejects. If CWF receives a claim with HCPCS codes 90670 or 90732 and it already has on record a claim with the same HIC number, same A/B MAC (A) number, same date of service, and the same HCPCS code, the second claim submitted to CWF rejects when all four items match. If CWF receives a claim with HCPCS administration codes G0008 or G0009 and it already has on record a claim with the same HIC number, same A/B MAC (A) number, sa me date of service, and same procedure code, CWF rejects the second claim submitted when all four items match. CWF returns to the A/B MAC (A) a reject code \"7262\" for this edit. A/B MACs (A) must deny the second claim and use the same messages they currently use for the denial of duplicate claims. If a diagnosis code for pneumococcus, hepatitis B, or influenza virus vaccination is not reported on a claim, contractors may not enter the diagnosis on the claim. Contractors must follow current resolutio n processes for claims with missing diagnosis codes. If the diagnosis code and the narrative description are correct, but the HCPCS code is incorrect, the A/B MAC (A or B) may correct the HCPCS code and pay the claim. For example, if the reported diagnosi s code is V04.81 and the narrative description (if annotated on the claim) says \"flu shot\" but the HCPCS code is incorrect, contractors may change the HCPCS code and pay for the flu vaccine. Effective October 1, 2006, A/B MACs (B) should follow the instruc tions in Pub. 100- 04, Chapter 1, Section (A/B MAC (B) Data Element Requirements) for claims submitted without a HCPCS code. Claims for hepatitis B vaccinations must report the I.D. Number of the referring physician. In addition, if a doctor of medicine or osteopathy does not order the influenza virus vaccine, the A/B MACs (A) claims require: UPIN code SLF000 to be reported on claims submitted prior to May 23, 2008, when Medicare began accepting NPIs, only The provider's own NPI to be reported in the NPI field for the attending physician on claims submitted on or after May 23, 2008, when NPI requirements were implemented. 10.2.2 - Claims Submitted to MACs Using Institutional Formats (Rev. 3621, Issued: 10- 07-16, Effective: 10- 01-16, Implementation: 10-03-16) The applicable types of bill acceptable when billing for influenza virus and pneumococcal revenue codes are used for reporting vaccines and administ ration of the vaccines for all providers except RHCs and FQHCs. Independent and provider based RHCs and FQHCs follow \u00a710.2.2.2 below when billing for influenza virus, pneumococcal and hepatitis B vaccines. Units and HCPCS codes are required with revenue code 0636: Revenue Code Description 0636 Pharmacy, Drugs requiring detailed coding (a) 0771 Preventive Care Services, Vaccine Administration In addition, for the influenza virus vaccine, providers report condition code M1 when roster billing. See roster billing instructions in \u00a710.3 of this chapter. When vaccines are provided to inpatients of a hospital or SNF, they are covered under the vaccine benefit. However, the hospital bills on type of bill 012x using the discharge date of the hospital stay or the date benefits are exhausted. A SNF submits type of bill 022x for its Part A inpatients. 10.2.2.1 - Payment for Pneumococcal Pneumonia Virus, Influenza Virus, and Hepatitis B Virus Vaccines and Their Administration on Institutional Claims (Rev. Vaccines Payment for these vaccines is as follows: Facility Type of Bill Payment Hospitals, other than Indian Health Service (IHS) Hospitals and Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) I II 085x Reasonable cost Skilled Nursing Facilities 022x, 023x Reasonable cost Home Health Agencies 034x Reasonable cost Hospices 081x, 082x 95% of AWP Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facilities 075x of the AWP Independent Renal Dialysis Facilities 072x 95% of the AWP Hospital -based Renal Dialysis Facilities 072x Reasonable cost Payment for Vaccine Administration Payment for the administration of influenza virus and pneumococcal vaccines is as follows: Facility Type of Bill Payment Hospitals, other than IHS Hospitals and CAHs 012x, 013x Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) for hospitals subject to OPPS Reasonable cost for hospitals not subject cost Skilled Nursing Facilities 022x, 023x Agencies 034x MPFS Hospital -based RDFs 072x Reasonable cost Payment for the administration of hepatitis B vaccine is as follows: Facility Type of Bill Payment Hospitals other than IHS hospitals and CAHs 012x, 013x Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) for hospitals subject to OPPS Reasonable cost for hospitals not subject to OPPS IHS Hospitals 012x, 013x, 083x MPFS Skilled Hospital -based RDFs 072x Reasonable cost 10.2.2.2 - Special Instructions for Independent and Provider -Based Rural Health Clinics/Federally Qualified Health Center provider -based RHCs and FQHCs do not include charges for influenza virus and pneumococcal vaccines on Form CMS -1450. Administration of these vaccines does not count as a visit when the only service involved is the administration of influenza virus and/or pneumococcal vaccine (s). If there was another reason for the visit, the RHC/FQHC should bill for the visit without adding the cost of the influenza virus and pneumococcal vaccines to the charge for the visit on the bill. AB MACs (A) pay at the time of cost settlement and ad just interim rates to account for this additional cost if they determine that the payment is more than a negligible amount. Payment for the hepatitis B vaccine is included in the all- inclusive rate. However, RHCs/FQHCs do not bill for a visit when the only service involved is the administration of the hepatitis B vaccine. As with other vaccines administered during an otherwise payable encounter, no line items specifically for this service are billed on the RHC/FQHC claims in addition to the encounter. 10.2.3 - Institutional Claims Submitted by Home Health Agencies and Hospices (Rev. 3621, Issued: 10- 07-16, Effective: 10- 01-16, Implementation: 10-03-16) The following provides billing instructions for Home Health Agencies (HHAs) in various situations: Where the sole purpose for an HHA visit is to administer a vaccine (influenza virus, pneumococcal, or hepatitis B), Medicare will not pay for a skilled nursing visit by an HHA nurse under the HHA benefit. However, the vaccine and its administration are covered under the vaccine benefit. The administration should include charges only for the supplies being used and the cost of the injection. Medicare does not allow HHAs to charge for travel time or other expenses (e.g., gasoline). In this situation, the HHA bills under bill type 034x and reports revenue code 0636 along with the appropriate HCPCS code for the vaccine and revenue code 0771 along with the appropriate HCPCS code for the administration. NOTE: A separate bill is not allowed for the visit If a vaccine (influenza virus, pneumococcal, or hepatitis B) is administered during the course of an otherwise covered home health visit (e.g., to perform wound care), the visit would be covered as normal but the HHA must not include the vaccine or its adminis tration in their visit charge. In this case, the HHA is entitled to payment for the vaccine and its administration under the vaccine benefit. In this situation, the HHA bills under bill type 034x and reports revenue code 0636 along with the appropriate HCPCS code for the vaccine and revenue code 0771 along with the appropriate HCPCS code for the administration. NOTE: A separate bill is required for the visit Where a beneficiary does not meet the eligibility criteria for home health coverage, a home he alth nurse may be paid for the vaccine (influenza virus, pneumococcal, or hepatitis B) and its administration. No skilled nursing visit charge is billable. Administration of the services should include charges only for the supplies being used and the cos t of the injection. Medicare does not pay for travel time or other expenses (e.g., gasoline). In this situation, the HHA bills under bill type 034x and reports revenue code 0636 along with the appropriate HCPCS code for the vaccine and revenue code 0771 a long with the appropriate HCPCS code for the administration. If a beneficiary meets the eligibility criteria for coverage, but his or her spouse does not, and the spouse wants an injection the same time as a nursing visit, HHAs bill in accordance with the last bullet point above. The following provides billing instructions for hospices: Hospices can provide the influenza virus, pneumococcal, and hepatitis B vaccines to those beneficiaries who request them including those who have elected the hospice benefit. These services may be covered when furnished by the hospice. For dates of service before October 1, 2016, services for vaccines and their administration provided by a hospice should be billed on a professional claim to the local MAC. Payment is made using the same methodology as if they were a supplier. Hospices that do not have a supplier number should contact their MAC to obtain one in order to bill for these benefits. For dates of service on or after October 1, 2016, services for vaccines a nd their administration provided by a hospice may be billed on an institutional claim. 10.2.4 - Payment Procedures for Renal Dialysis Facilities nal claims pay for pneumococcal, influenza virus, and hepatitis B virus vaccines for freestanding RDFs based on the lower of the actual charge or 95 percent of the average wholesale price and based on reasonable cost for provider - based RDFs. Deductible a nd coinsurance do not apply for influenza virus, hepatitis B virus, and pneumococcal vaccines. MACs must contact their professional claims processing staff to obtain information in order to make payment for the administration of these vaccines. 10.2.4.1 - Hepatitis B Vaccine Furnished to ESRD 10- 06-08) Hepatitis B vaccine and its administration (including staff time and supplies such as syringes) are paid to ESRD facilities in ad dition to, and separately from, the dialysis composite rate payment. Payment for the hepatitis B vaccine for ESRD patients follows the same general principles that are applicable to any injectable drug or biological. Hospital -based facilities are paid fo r their direct and indirect costs on a reasonable cost basis, and independent facilities are paid the lower of the actual charge or 95 percent of the AWP . The allowance for injectables is based on the cost of the injectable and any supplies used for admin istration, plus a maximum $2 for the labor involved, if the facility's staff administers the vaccine. In addition, the A/B MAC (A) makes an appropriate allowance for facility overhead. Where the vaccine is administered in a hospital outpatient department for home dialysis patients or for patients with chronic renal failure (but not yet on dialysis), payment is on a reasonable cost basis. Outpatient hospital vaccines for nondialysis purposes are paid under hospital outpatient PPS rules. 10.2.5 - Claims Submitted to A/B MACs Implementation: 10- 06-08) Medicare does not require that the influenza virus vaccine be administered under a physician's order or supervision. Effective for claims with dates of service on or after July 1, 2000, Medicare does not require that pneumococcal vaccinations be administered under a physician's order or supervision. Medicare still requires that the hepatitis B vaccine be administered under a physician's order with super vision. As a physician order is still required for claims for hepatitis B vaccinations, information on the ordering and/or referring physician must be entered on the claim. A. Reporting Specialty Code/Place of Service (POS) to CWF Specialty A/B MACs (B) use specialty code 60 (Public Health or Welfare Agencies (Federal, State, and Local)) for Public Health Service Clinics (PHCs). A/B MACs (B) use specialty code 73 (Mass Immunization Roster Billers) for centralized billers and specialty code 87 for pharma cists (all other suppliers (drug stores, department stores)). Entities and individuals other than PHCs and pharmacists use the CMS specialty code that best defines their provider type. A list of specialty codes can be found in chapter 26. The CMS specialty code 99 (Unknown Physician Specialty) is acceptable where no other code fits. Place of Service (POS) State or local PHCs use POS code 71 (State or Local Public Health Clinic). POS 71 is not used for individual offices/entities other than PHCs (e.g., a mobile unit that is non -PHC affiliated should use POS 99). Preprinted Form CMS-1500s (08-05) used for simplified roster billing should show POS 60 (Mass Immunization Center) regardless of the site where vaccines are given (e.g., a PHC or physician's of fice that roster claims should use POS 60). Individuals/entities administering influenza virus and pneumococcal vaccinations in a mass immunization setting (including centralized flu billers), regardless of the site where vaccines are given, should use PO S 60 for roster claims, paper claims, and electronically filed claims. Normal POS codes should be used in other situations. Providers use POS 99 (Other Unlisted Facility) if no other POS code applies. 10.2.5.1 - A/B MAC (B) Indicators for the Common submitted to CWF must contain the following indicators: Description Payment Indicator Payment Deductible Indicator Deductible Type of Service Pneumococcal \"1\" 100 percent \"1\" Zero deductible \"V\" Influenza \"1\" 100 percent \"1\" Zero deductible \"V\" Hepatitis B \"0\" 80 percent \"0\" Deductible applies \"1\" A payment indicator of \"1\" represents 100 percent payment. A deductible indicator of \"1\" represents a zero deductible. A payment indicator of \"0\" represents 80 percent payment. A deductible indicator of \"0\" indicates that a deductible applies to the claim. The record must also contain a \"V\" in the type of service field, which indicates that this is a pneumococcal or influenza virus vaccine. AB MACs (B) use a \"1\" in the type of service field which indicates medical care for a hepatitis B vaccine. 10.2.5.2 - A/B MAC (B) influenza virus, and hepatitis B vaccines follows the same standard rules that are applicable to any injectable drug or biological. (See chapter 17 for procedures for determining the payment rates for pneumococcal and influenza virus vaccines.) Effective for claims with dates of service on or after February 1, 2001, \u00a7114, of the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 mandated that all drugs and biologicals be paid based on mandatory assignment. Therefore, all providers of influenza virus and pneumococcal vaccines must accept assignment for the vaccine. Prior to March 1, 2003, the administration of pneumococcal, influenza virus, and hepatitis B vaccines, (HCPCS codes G0008, G0009, and G0010), though not reimbursed directly through the MPFS, were reimbursed at the same rate as HCPCS code 90782 on the MPFS for the year that corresponded to the date of service of the claim. Prior to March 1, 2003, HCPCS codes G0008, G0009, and G0010 are reimbursed at the same rate as HCPCS code 90471. Assignment for the administration is not mandatory, but is applicable should the provider be enrolled as a provider type \"Mass Immunization Roster Biller,\" submits roster bills, or participates in the centralize d billing program. A/B MACs (B) may not apply the limiting charge provision for pneumococcal, influenza virus vaccine, or hepatitis B vaccine and their administration in accordance with \u00a7\u00a71833(a)(1) and 1833(a)(10)(A) of the Social Security Act (the Act.) The administration of the influenza virus vaccine is covered in the influenza virus vaccine benefit under \u00a71861(s)(10)(A) of the Act, rather than under the physicians' services benefit. Therefore, it is not eligible for the 10 percent Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) in centive payment or the 5 percent Physician Scarcity Area (PSA) incentive payment. No Legal Obligation to Pay Nongovernmental entities that provide immunizations free of charge to all patients, regardless of their ability to pay, must provide the immuniza tions free of charge to Medicare beneficiaries and may not bill Medicare. (See Pub. 100- 02, Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, chapter 16.) Thus, for example, Medicare may not pay for influenza virus vaccinations administered to Medicare beneficiaries if a physician provides free vaccinations to all non- Medicare patients or where an employer offers free vaccinations to its employees. Physicians also may not charge Medicare beneficiaries more for a vaccine than they would charge non -Medicare patients. (See \u00a71128(b)(6)(A) of the Act.) When an employer offers free vaccinations to its employees, it must also offer the free vaccination to an employee who is also a Medicare beneficiary. It does not have to offer free vaccinations to its non- Medicare employees. Nongovernmental entities that do not charge patients who are unable to pay or reduce their charges for patients of limited means, yet expect to be paid if the patient has health insurance coverage for the services provided, may bill Medicare and expect payment. Governmental entities (such as PHCs) may bill Medicare for pneumococcal, hepatitis B, and influenza virus vaccines administered to Medicare beneficiaries when services are rendered free of charge to non- Medicare beneficiaries. 10.3 - Simplified Roster Claims for Mass (Rev. 06-08) The simplified roster billing process was developed to enable Medicare beneficiaries to participate in mass pneumococcal and influenza virus vaccination programs offered by PHCs and other individuals and entities that give the vaccine to a group of beneficiaries, e.g. at PHCs, shopping malls, grocery stores, senior c itizen homes, and health fairs. Roster billing is not available for hepatitis B vaccinations. Properly licensed individuals and entities conducting mass immunization programs may submit claims using a simplified claims filing procedure known as roster billing to bill for the influenza virus vaccine benefit for multiple beneficiaries if they agree to accept assignment for these claims. They may not collect any payment from the beneficiary. Effective November 1, 1996, roster billing is also available to i ndividuals and entities billing for pneumococcal vaccinations. Effective July 1, 1998, immunization of at least five beneficiaries on the same date is no longer required for any individual or entity to qualify for roster billing to A/B MACs (B). However, the rosters should not be used for single patient claims and the date of service for each vaccination administered must be entered. Entities that submit claims on roster claims must accept assignment and may not collect any \"donation\" or other cost shari ng of any kind from Medicare beneficiaries for pneumococcal or influenza virus vaccinations. However, the entity may bill Medicare for the amount, which is not subsidized from its own budget. For example, an entity that incurs a cost of $7.50 per vaccina tion and pays $2.50 of the cost from its budget may bill Medicare the $5.00 cost which is not paid out of its budget. A. Provider Enrollment Criteria for Mass Immunizers Those entities and individuals that desire to provide mass immunization services, but may not otherwise be able to qualify as a Medicare provider, may be eligible to enroll as a provider type \"Mass Immunization Roster Biller.\" These individuals and entities must enroll by completing the Provider/Supplier Enrollment Application, Form CMS -855. Individuals and entities that enroll as this provider type may not bill Medicare for any services other than pneumococcal and/or influenza virus vaccines and their administration. In addition, claims submitted by the provider type \"Mass Immunization Roster Biller\" are always reimbursed at the assigned payment rate. B. Payment Floor for Roster Claims Roster claims are considered paper claims and are not paid as quickly as electronic media claims (EMC). If available, offer electronic billing softwar e free or at -cost to PHCs and other properly licensed individuals and entities. A/B MACs (B) must ensure that the software is as user friendly as possible for the pneumococcal and influenza virus vaccine benefits. C. Medicare Advantage Plans Processing R equirements Medicare Advantage Plans may use roster billing only if vaccinations are the only Medicare- covered services furnished by the Medicare Advantage Plans to Medicare patients who are not members of the Medicare Advantage Plans. Medicare Advantage Plans must use Place of Service (POS) code 60 for processing roster claims. 10.3.1 - Roster Claims Submitted to A/B MACs (B) for Mass Immunization Roster Claims Submitted to AB MACs (B) for Mass Immunization (Rev. PHC or other individual or entity qualifies to submit roster claims, it may use a preprinted Form CMS -1500 that contains standardized information about the entity and the benefit. See chapter 26, \u00a710 for more information about the CMS -1500 claim form. Key information from the beneficiary roster list and the abbreviated claim form is used to process pneumococcal and influenza virus vaccination claims. Separate CMS -1500 claim forms, along with separate roster bil ls, must be submitted for pneumococcal and influenza roster billing. If other services are furnished to a beneficiary along with pneumococcal or influenza virus vaccine, individuals and entities must submit claims using normal billing procedures, e.g., submission of a separate claim for each beneficiary. A/B MACs (B) must create and count one claim per beneficiary from roster bills. They must split claims for each beneficiary if there are multiple beneficiaries included in a roster bill. Providers must show the unit cost for one service on the claim. The A/B MACs (B) must replicate the claim for each beneficiary listed on the roster. A/B MACs (B) must provide Palmetto -Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) with local pricing files for pneumococcal and influenza virus vaccine and their administration. If PHCs or other individuals or entities inappropriately bill pneumococcal or influenza virus vaccinations using the roster billing method, A/B MACs (B) return the claim to the provider with a cover letter explai ning why it is being returned and the criteria for the roster billing process. A/B MACs (B) may not deny these claims. Providers must retain roster bills with beneficiaries' signatures at their permanent location for a time period consistent with Medicar e regulations. A. Modified Form CMS -1500 for Cover Document Entities submitting roster claims to A/B MACs (B) must complete the following blocks on a single modified Form CMS -1500, which serves as the cover document for the roster for each facility where services are furnished. In order for A/B MACs (B) to reimburse by correct payment locality, a separate Form CMS -1500 must be used for each different facility or physical location where services are furnished. Item # Instruction Item 1: An X in the Medicare block Item 2: (Patient's Name): \"SEE ATTACHED 20: Lab?): An \"X\" in the NO block Item 21: (Diagnosis or Nature of Illness): Line A: Choose appropriate diagnosis c ode from \u00a710.2.1 ICD Ind.

If your system is unable to accept a line item charge of 0.00 for an immunization service, do not key the line item. Likewise, electronic media claim (EMC) billers should submit line items f or free immunization services on EMC pneumococcal or influenza virus vaccine claims only if your system is able to accept them. Item 27: (Accept Assignment): An \"X\" in the YES block. Item 29: (Amount Paid): \"$0.00\" Item 31: (Signature of Physician or S upplier): The entity's representative must sign the modified Form CMS -1500.

Item 33a: Effective May 23, 2007, and later, enter the NPI of the billing provider or group. B. Format of Roster Claims Qualifying individuals and entities must attach to the CMS -1500 claim form, a roster which contains the variable claims information regarding the supplier of the service and individual beneficiaries. While qualifying entities must use the modified Form CMS - 1500 without deviation, A/B MACs (B) must work with these entities to develop a mutually suitable roster that contains the minimum data necessary to satisfy claims processing requirem ents for these claims. A/B MACs (B) must key information from the beneficiary roster list and abbreviated Form CMS -1500 to process pneumococcal and influenza virus vaccination claims. The roster must contain at a minimum the following information: Provi der name and number; Date of service; NOTE: Although physicians who provide pneumococcal or influenza virus vaccinations may roster bill if they vaccinate fewer than five beneficiaries per day, they must include the individual date of service for each be neficiary's vaccination on the roster form. Control number for A/B NOTE: A stamped \"signature on file\" qualifies as an actual signature on a roster claim form if the provider has a signed authorization on file to bill Medicare for services rendered. In this situation, the provider is not required to obtain the patient s ignature on the roster, but instead has the option of reporting signature on file in lieu of obtaining the patient's actual signature. The pneumococcal roster must contain the following language to be used by providers as a precaution to alert beneficiari es prior to administering the pneumococcal vaccination. WARNING: Beneficiaries must be asked if they have received a pneumococcal vaccination. Rely on patients' memory to determine prior vaccination status. 10.3.1.1 - Centralized Billing for Influenza Virus and Pneumococcal Vaccines to A/B MACs currently authorizes a limited number of providers to centrally bill for influenza virus and pneumococcal immunization claims. Centralized billing is an optional program available to providers who qualify to enroll with Medicare as the provider type \"Mass Immunization Roster Biller,\" as well as to other individuals and entities that qualify to enroll as regular Medicare p roviders. Centralized billers must roster bill, must accept assignment, and must bill electronically. To qualify for centralized billing, a mass immunizer must be operating in at least three payment localities for which there are three different contract ors processing claims. Individuals and entities providing the vaccine and administration must be properly licensed in the State in which the immunizations are given and the contractor must verify this through the enrollment process. Centralized billers must send all claims for influenza virus and pneumococcal immunizations to a single contractor for payment, regardless of the jurisdiction in which the vaccination was administered. (This does not include claims for the Railroad Retirement Board, United Mi ne Workers or Indian Health Services. These claims must continue to go to the appropriate processing entity.) Payment is made based on the payment locality where the service was provided. This process is only available for claims for the influenza virus and pneumococcal vaccines and their administration. The general coverage and coding rules still apply to these claims. This section applies only to those individuals and entities that provide mass immunization services for influenza virus and pneumococcal vaccinations and that have been authorized by CMS to centrally bill. All other providers, including those individuals and entities that provide mass immunization services that are not authorized to centrally bill, must continue to bill for these claims to their regular A/B MAC (B) per the instructions in \u00a710.3.1 of this chapter. The cl aims processing instructions in this section apply only to the designated processing contractor. However, all A/B MACs (B) must follow the instructions in \u00a710.3.1.1.J , below, \"Provider Education Instructions for All A/B MACs (B).\" A. Processing Contractor The CMS central office will notify centralized billers of the appropriate contractor to bill when they receive their notification of acceptance into the centralized billing program. B. Request for Approval Approval to participate in the CMS centralized billing program is a two part approval process. Individuals and corporations who wish to enroll as a CMS mass immunizer centralized biller must send their request in writing. CMS will complete Part 1 of the approval process by reviewing preliminary demographic information included in the request for participation letter. Completion of Part 1 is not approval to set up vaccination clinics, vaccinate beneficiaries, and bill Medicare for reimbursement. All new participants must complete Part 2 of the approval process (Form CMS -855 Application) before they may set up vaccination clinics, vaccinate Medicare beneficiaries, and bill Medicare for reimbursement. If an individual or entity's request is approved for centralized billing, the approval is limited to 12 months from September to August 31 of the next year. It is the responsibility of the centralized biller to reapply for approval each year. The designated contractor shall provide in writing to CMS and approved centralized billers notification of completion and approval of Part 2 of the approval process. The designated contractor may not process claims for any centralized biller who has not completed Parts 1 and 2 of the approval process. If claims are submi tted by a provider who has not received approval of Parts 1 and 2 of the approval process to participate as a centralized biller, the contractor must return the claims to the provider to submit to the A/B MAC (B) for payment. C. Notification of Provider P articipation to the Processing Contractor Before September 1 of every year, CMS will provide the designated contractor with the names of the entities that are authorized to participate in centralized billing for the 12 month period beginning September 1 a nd ending August 31 of the next year. D. Enrollment Though centralized billers may already have a Medicare provider number, for purposes of centralized billing, they must also obtain a provider number from the processing contractor for centralized billin g through completion of the Form CMS -855 (Provider Enrollment Application). Providers/suppliers are encouraged to apply to enroll as a centralized biller early as possible. Applicants who have not completed the entire enrollment process and received appr oval from CMS and the designated contractor to participate as a Medicare mass immunizer centralized biller will not be allowed to submit claims to Medicare for reimbursement. Whether an entity enrolls as a provider type \"Mass Immunization Roster Biller\" o r some other type of provider, all normal enrollment processes and procedures must be followed. Authorization from CMS to participate in centralized billing is dependent upon the entity's ability to qualify as some type of Medicare provider. In addition, as under normal enrollment procedures, the contractor must verify that the entity is fully qualified and certified per state requirements in each state in which they plan to operate. The contractor will activate the provider number for the 12- month period from September 1 through August 31 of the following year. If the provider is authorized to participate in the centralized billing program the next year, the contractor will extend the activation of the provider number for another year. The entity need not re -enroll with the contractor every year. However, should there be changes in the states in which the entity plans to operate, the contractor will need to verify that the entity meets all state certification and licensure requirements in those new states. E. Electronic Submission of Claims on Roster Bills Centralized billers must agree to submit their claims on roster bills in an electronic media claims format. The processing contractor must provide instructions on acceptable roster billing formats to the approved centralized billers. Paper claims will not be accepted. F. Required Information on Roster Bills for Centralized Billing In addition to the roster billing instructions found in \u00a710.3.1 of this chapter, centralized billers must provide on the claim the ZIP code (to determine the payment locality for the claim), and the provider of service/supplier's billing name, address, ZIP code, and telephone number. In addition, the NPI of the billing provider or group must be appropriately reported. G. Payment Rates and Mandatory Assignment The payment rates for the administration of the vaccinations are based on the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) for the appropriate year. Payment made through the MPFS is based on geographic locality. Therefore, payments vary based on the geographic locality where the service was performed. The HCPCS codes G0008 and G0009 for the administration of the vaccines are not paid on the MPFS. However, prior to March 1, 2003, they must be paid at the same rate as HCPCS code 90782, which is on the MPFS. The designated contractor must pay per the correct MPFS file for each calendar year based on the date of service of the claim. Beginning March 1, 2003, HCPCS codes G0008, G0009, and G0010 are to be reimbursed at the same rate as HCPCS code 90471. In order to pay claims correctly for centralized billers, the designated contractor must have the correct name and address, including ZIP code, of the entity where the service was provided. The following remittance advice and Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) messages apply: Claim adjustment reason code 16 , \"Claim/service lacks information which is needed for adjudication. At least one Remark Code must be provided (may be comprised of either the Remittance Advice Remark Code or NCPDP Reject Reason Code, Remittance advice remark code MA114 , \"Missing/incomplete/invalid information on where the services were furnished.\" MSN 9.4 - \"This item or service was denied because information required to make payment was incorrect.\" The payment rates for the vaccines must be determined by the standard method used by Medicare for reimbursement of drugs and biologicals. (See chapter 17 for procedures for determining the payment rates for vaccines.) Effective for claims with dates of service on or after February 1, 2001, \u00a7114, of the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 mandated that all drugs and biologicals be paid based on mandatory assignment. Therefore, all providers of influenza virus a nd pneumococcal vaccines must accept assignment for the vaccine. In addition, as a requirement for both centralized billing and roster billing, providers must agree to accept assignment for the administration of the vaccines as well. This means that they must agree to accept the amount that Medicare pays for the vaccine and the administration. Also, since there is no coinsurance or deductible for the influenza virus and pneumococcal benefit, accepting assignment means that Medicare beneficiaries cannot b e charged for the vaccination. H. Common Working File Information To identify these claims and to enable central office data collection on the project, special processing number 39 has been assigned. The number should be entered on the HUBC claim record to CWF in the field titled Demonstration Number. I. Provider Education Instructions for the Processing Contractor The processing contractor must fully educate the centralized billers on the processes for centralized billing as well as for roster billing . General information on influenza virus and pneumococcal coverage and billing instructions is available on the CMS Web site for providers. J. Provider Education Instructions for All A/B MACs (B) By April 1 of every year, all A/B MACs (B) must publish i n their bulletins and put on their Web sites the following notification to providers. Questions from interested providers should be forwarded to the central office address below. A/B MACs (B) must enter the name of the assigned processing contractor wher e noted before sending. NOTIFICATION TO PROVIDERS Centralized billing is a process in which a provider, who provides mass immunization services for influenza virus and pneumococcal pneumonia virus (PPV) immunizations, can send all claims to a single contractor for payment regardless of the geographic locality in which the vaccination was administered. (This does not include claims for the Railroad Retirement Board, United Mine Workers or Indian Health Services. These claims must continue to go to the appropriate processing entity.) This process is only available for claims for the influenza virus and pneumococcal vaccines and their administration. The administration of the vaccinations is reimbursed at the assigned rate based on the Medicare physician fee schedule for the appropriate locality. The vaccines are reimbursed at the assigned rate using the Medicare standard method for reimbursement of drugs and biologicals. Individuals and entities interested in centralized billing must contact CMS central office, in writing, at the following address by June 1 of the year they wish to begin centrally billing. Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services Division of Practitioner Claims Processing Provider Billing Group 7500 Security Boulevard Mail Stop C4 -10-07 Baltimore, Maryland 21244 By agreeing to participate in the centralized billing program, providers agree to abide by the following criteria. CRITERIA FOR CENTRALIZED BILLING To qualify for centralized billing, an individual or entity providing mass immu nization services for influenza virus and pneumococcal vaccinations must provide these services in at least three payment localities for which there are at least three different contractors processing claims. Individuals and entities providing the vaccine and administration must be properly licensed in the state in which the immunizations are given. Centralized billers must agree to accept assignment (i.e., they must agree to accept the amount that Medicare pays for the vaccine and the administration). Since there is no coinsurance or deductible for the influenza virus and pneumococcal benefit, accepting assignment means that Medicare beneficiaries cannot be charged for the vaccination, i.e., beneficiaries may not incur any out -of-pocket expense. For exa mple, a drugstore may not charge a Medicare beneficiary $10 for an influenza virus vaccination and give the beneficiary a coupon for $10 to be used in the drugstore. NOTE: The practice of requiring a beneficiary to pay for the vaccination upfront and to file their own claim for reimbursement is inappropriate. All Medicare providers are required to file claims on behalf of the beneficiary per \u00a71848(g)(4)(A) of the Social Security Act and centralized billers may not collect any payment. The contractor assigned to process the claims for centralized billing is chosen at the discretion of CMS based on such considerations as workload, user - friendly software developed by the contractor for billing claims, and overall performance. The assigned contractor for this year is [Fill in name of contractor.] The payment rates for the administration of the vaccinations are based on the Medicare physician fee schedule (MPFS) for the appropriate year. Payment made through the MPFS is based on geographic locality. The refore, payments received may vary based on the geographic locality where the service was performed. Payment is made at the assigned rate. The payment rates for the vaccines are determined by the standard method used by Medicare for reimbursement of drug s and biologicals. Payment is made at the assigned rate. Centralized billers must submit their claims on roster bills in an approved electronic format. Paper claims will not be accepted. Centralized billers must obtain certain information for each bene ficiary including name, health insurance number, date of birth, sex, and signature. [Fill in name of contractor ] must be contacted prior to the season for exact requirements. The responsibility lies with the centralized biller to submit correct beneficiary Medicare information (including the beneficiary's Medicare Health Insurance Claim Number) as the contractor will not be able to process incomplete or incorrect claims. Centralized billers must obtain an address for each beneficiary so that a Medicare S ummary Notice (MSN) can be sent to the beneficiary by the contractor. Beneficiaries are sometimes confused when they receive an MSN from a contractor other than the contractor that normally processes their claims which results in unnecessary beneficiary i nquiries to the Medicare contractor. Therefore, centralized billers must provide every beneficiary receiving an influenza virus or pneumococcal vaccination with the name of the processing contractor. This notification must be in writing, in the form of a brochure or handout, and must be provided to each beneficiary at the time he or she receives the vaccination. Centralized billers must retain roster bills with beneficiary signatures at their permanent location for a time period consistent with Medicare regulations. [Fill in name of contractor ] can provide this information. Though centralized billers may already have a Medicare provider number, for purposes of centralized billing, they must also obtain a provider number from [Fill in name of contractor ]. This can be done by completing the Form CMS - 855 (Provider Enrollment Application), which can be obtained from [ Fill in name of contractor]. If an individual or entity's request for centralized billing is approved, the approval is limited to the 12 month period from September 1 through August 31 of the following year. It is the responsibility of the centralized biller to reapply to CMS CO for approval each year by June 1. Claims will not be processed for any centralized biller without permission from CMS. Each year the centralized biller must contact [Fill in name of contractor] to verify understanding of the coverage policy for the administration of the pneumococcal vaccine, and for a copy of the warning language that is required on the roster bill. The centralized biller is responsible for providing the beneficiary with a record of the pneumococcal vaccination. The information in items 1 through 8 below must be included with the individual or entity's annual request to participate in centralized billing: 1. Estimates for the number of beneficiaries who will receive influenza virus vaccinations; 2. Estimates for the number of beneficiaries who will receive pneumococcal vaccinations; 3. The approximate dates for when the vaccinations will be g iven; 4. A list of the states in which influenza virus and pneumococcal clinics will be held; 5. The type of services generally provided by the corporation (e.g., ambulance, home health, or visiting nurse); 6. Whether the nurses who will administer the influenza virus and pneumococcal vaccinations are employees of the corporation or will be hired by the corporation specifically for the purpose of administering influenza virus and pneumococcal vaccinations; 7. Names and addresses of all entities operating under the corporation's application; 8. Contact information for designated contact person for centralized billing program. 10.3.2 - Claims Submitted to A/B MACs (A) for Mass Immunizations of Influenza Virus such as hospital outpatient departments and HHAs, have expressed concern about the complexity of billing for the influenza virus vaccine and its admin istration. Consequently, to increase the number of beneficiaries who obtain needed preventive immunizations, simplified (roster) billing procedures are available to mass immunizers. The simplified (roster) claims filing procedure has been expanded for the pneumococcal vaccine. A mass immunizer is defined as any entity that gives the influenza virus vaccine or pneumococcal vaccine to a group of beneficiaries, e.g., at public health clinics, shopping malls, grocery stores, senior citizen homes, and health fairs. To qualify for roster billing, immunizations of at least five beneficiaries on the same date are required. (See \u00a710.3.2.2 for an exception to this requirement for inpatient hospitals.) The simplified (roste r) claims filing procedure applies to providers other than RHCs and FQHCs that conduct mass immunizations. Since independent and provider based RHCs and FQHCs do not submit individual Form CMS-1450s for the influenza virus vaccine, they do not utilize the simplified billing process. Instead, payment is made for the vaccine at the time of cost settlement. The simplified process involves use of the provider billing form (Form CMS-1450) with preprinted standardized information relative to the provider and t he benefit. Mass immunizers attach a standard roster to a single pre -printed Form CMS-1450 that contains the variable claims information regarding the service provider and individual beneficiaries. Qualifying individuals and entities must attach a roster , which contains the variable claims information regarding the supplier of the service and individual beneficiaries. The roster must contain at a minimum the following information: Provider name and number; Date of service; Patient name and address; Patient date of birth; Patient sex; Patient health insurance claim number; and Beneficiary signature or stamped \"signature on file.\" In addition, for inpatient Part B services (12x and 22X) the following data elements are also needed: Admission date; Admission type; Admission diagnosis; Admission source code; and Patient status code. NOTE: A stamped \"signature on file\" can be used in place of the beneficiary's actual signature for all institutional providers that roster bill from an inpatient or outpatient department provided the provider has a signed authorization on file to bill Medicare for services rendered. In this situation, they are not required to obtain the patient signature on the roster. However, the provider has the option of reporti ng \"signature on file\" in lieu of obtaining the patient's actual signature on the roster. The pneumococcal vaccine roster must contain the following language to be used by providers as a precaution to alert beneficiaries prior to administering the pneumoc occal vaccine. Warning: Beneficiaries must be asked if they have been vaccinated with the pneumococcal vaccine. Rely on the patients' memory to determine prior vaccination status. If patients are uncertain whether they have been vaccinated within the p ast 5 years, administer the vaccine, If patients are certain that they have been vaccinated within the past 5 years, do not revaccinate. For providers using the simplified billing procedure, the modified Form CMS -1450 shows the following preprinted infor mation in the specific form locators (FLs). Information regarding the form locator numbers that correspond to the data element names below is found in chapter 25: The words \"See Attached Roster\" (Patient Name); Patient Status code 01 (Patient Status); Condition code M1 (Condition Code) (See NOTE below); Condition code A6 (Condition Code); Revenue code 636 (Revenue Code), along with the appropriate HCPCS code in FL 44 (HCPCS Code); Revenue code 771 (Revenue Code), the \"G\" HCPCS code (HCPCS Code); \"Medicare\" line A); Diagnosis code 9-CM - V03.82 for the pneumococcal vaccine or V04.8 for Influenza Virus vaccine (Principal Diagnosis Code). For influenza virus vaccine claims with dates of service October 1, 2003 and later, use diagnosis code V04.81. ICD- 10-CM - Use Z23 for an encounter for immunization effective with the implementation of ICD -10. Influenza virus vaccines require: the UPIN SLF000 on claims submitted before May 23, 2007, or the provider's own NPI to be reported in the NPI field for the attending physician on claims submitted on or after May 23, 2007. Providers conducting mass immunizations are required to complete the following fields on the preprinted Form CMS -1450: Type of Bill; Total Charges; Provider Representative; and Date. NOTE: Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) utilization editing is bypassed in CWF for all mass immunization roster bills. However, if the provider knows tha t a particular group health plan covers the pneumococcal vaccine and all other MSP requirements for the Medicare beneficiary are met, the primary payer must be billed. First claim development alerts from CWF are not generated for the pneumococcal and infl uenza virus vaccines. Contractors use the beneficiary roster list to generate claim records to process the pneumococcal vaccine claims by mass immunizers indicating condition code M1 to avoid MSP editing. Standard System Maintainers must develop the necessary software to generate records that will process through their system. Providers that do not mass immunize must continue to bill for the pneumococcal and influenza virus vaccines using the normal billing method, e.g., submission of a Form CMS -1450 or electronic billing for each beneficiary. 10.3.2.1 - Simplified Billing for Influenza Virus and Pneumococcal Vaccine Services by following billing instructions apply to HHAs that roster bill for influenza virus and pneumococcal vaccines. When an HHA provides the influenza virus vaccine or the pneumococcal vaccine in a mass immunization setting, it does not have the option to pick and choose whom to bill for this serv ice. If it is using employees from the certified portion, and as a result will be reflecting these costs on the cost report, it must bill the A/B MAC (HHH) on the Form CMS -1450. If the HHA is using employees from the noncertified portion of the agency (employees of another entity that are not certified as part of the HHA), and as a result, will not be reflecting these costs on the cost report, it must obtain a provider number and bill their A/B MAC (B) on the Form CMS -1500. If employees from both certified and noncertified portions of the HHA furnish the vaccines at a single mass immunization site, they must prepare two separate rosters, e.g., one for employees of the certified portion to be submitted to the A/B MAC (HHH) and one roster for employees of t he noncertified portion to be submitted to the A/B MAC (B). 10.3.2.2 - Hospital Inpatient Implementation: 10- 06-08) The following billing instructions apply to hospitals that roster bill for the influenza virus vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine provided to inpatients: Hospitals do not have to wait until patients are discharged to provide the vaccine. They may provide it anytime during the patient's stay; The roster should reflect the actual date of service; The requirement to provide the vaccine to five or more patients at the same time to meet the requirements for mass immunizers is waived when vaccines are provided to hospital inpatients. Therefore, the roster may contain fewer than five patients or fewer than five patients on the same day; and The roster should contain information indicating that the vaccines were provided to inpatients to avoid questions regarding the number of patients or various dates. 10.3.2.3 - Electronic R oster Claims (Rev. Effective: 10- for all other Medicare -covered services, AB MACs (A) pay electronic claims more quickly than paper claims. For payment floor purposes, roster bills are paper bil ls and may not be paid as quickly as EMC. (See chapter 1.) If available, AB MACs (A) must offer free, or at -cost, electronic billing software and ensure that the software is as user friendly as possible for the influenza virus vaccine benefit. 10.4 - CWF Edits to prevent duplicate payments for influenza virus and pneumococcal vaccination claims by the A/B MAC (B) and the centralized billing contractor, effective for claims received on or after July 1, 2002, CWF has implemented a number of edits. NOTE: 90659 was discontinued December 31, 2003. CWF returns information in Trailer 13 information from the history claim. The following fields are returned to the contract or: Trailer Code; Contractor Number; Document Control Number; First Service Date; Last Service Date; Provider, Physician, Supplier Number; Claim Type; Procedure code; Alert Code (where applicable); and, More history (where applicable.) 10.4.1 - CWF Edits on A/B MAC to prevent duplicate payment by the same A/B MAC (A), CWF edits by line item on the A/B MAC (A) number, the beneficiary Health Insurance Claim (HIC) number, and the date of service, the influenza virus or 90732, and the administration codes G0008 or G0009. If CWF receives a i t already has on record a claim with the same HIC number, same A/B MAC (A) number, same date of service, and any one of those HCPCS codes, the second claim submitted to CWF rejects. If CWF receives a claim with HCPCS codes 90670 or 90732 and it already has on record a claim with the same HIC number, same A/B MAC (A) number, same date of service, and the same HCPCS code, the second claim submitted to CWF rejects when all four items match. If CWF receives a claim with HCPCS administration codes G0008 or G 0009 and it already has on record a claim with the same HIC number, same A/B MAC (A) number, same date of service, and same procedure code, CWF rejects the second claim submitted when all four items match. CWF returns to the A/B MAC (A) a reject code \"726 2\" for this edit. A/B MACs (A) must deny the second claim and use the same messages they currently use for the denial of duplicate claims. 10.4.2 - CWF Edits on A/B MAC to prevent duplicate payment by the same A/B MAC (B), CWF will edit by line item on the A/B MAC (B) number, the HIC number, the date of service, the influenza and the administration code G0008 or G0009. If CWF receives a it already has on record a claim with the same HIC number, same A/B MAC (B) number, same date of service, and any one of those HCPCS codes, the second claim submitted to CWF will reject. If CWF receives a claim with HCPCS codes 90670 or 90732 and it already has on record a claim with the same HIC number, same A/B MAC (B) number, same date of service, and the same HCPCS code, the second claim subm itted to CWF will reject when all four items match. If CWF receives a claim with HCPCS administration codes G0008 or G0009 and it already has on record a claim with the same HIC number, same A/B MAC (B) number, same date of service, and same procedure code, CWF will reject the second claim submitted. CWF will return to the A/B MAC (B) a specific reject code for this edit. A/B MACs (B) must deny the second claim and use the same messages they currently use for the denial of duplicate claims. In order to prevent duplicate payment by the centralized billing contractor and local A/B MAC (B), CWF will edit by line item for A/B MAC (B) number, same HIC number, same date of service, the influenza and the administration code G0008 or G0009. If CWF receives a it already has on record a claim with a different A/B MAC (B) number, but same HIC number, same date of service, and any one of those same HCPCS codes, the second claim submitted to CWF will reject. If CWF receives a claim with HCPCS codes 90670 or 90732 and it already has on record a claim with the same HIC number, different A/B MAC (B) number, same date of service, and the same HCPCS code, the second claim submitted to CWF will reject. If CWF receives a claim with HCPCS administration codes G0008 or G0009 and it already has on record a claim with a different A/B MAC (B) number, but the same HIC number, same date of service, and same procedure code, CWF will reject the second claim submitted. CWF will return a specific reject code for this edit. A/B MACs (B) must deny the second claim. For the second edit, the reject code should automatically trigger the following Medicare Summar y Notice (MSN) and Remittance Advice (RA) messages. MSN: 7.2 - \"This is a duplicate of a claim processed by another contractor. You should receive a Medicare Summary Notice from them.\" Claim Adjustment Reason Code 18 - Exact duplicate claim /service 10.4.3 - CWF Crossover Edits a claim from the A/B MAC (B), it will review Part B outpatient claims history to verify that a duplicate cla im has not already been posted.

A/B MACs (B) must deny the second claim and use the same messages they currently use for the denial of duplicate claims. 10.5 - Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) (Rev. 1586, Issued: 09- 05-08, Effective: 10- 06-08, Implementation: 10- 06-08) Contractors must generate a Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) for the pneum ococcal, influenza virus, hepatitis B vaccines, and their administration. For vaccines rendered to beneficiaries other than pneumococcal, influenza virus or hepatitis B, which are not covered by Medicare, they must send the following MSN message. MSN: 18 .2: This immunization and/or preventive care is not covered. The Spanish version of this MSN message should read: Esta Mammography Beginning January 1, 1991, Medicare provides Part B coverage of screening mammographies for women. Screening mammographies are radiologic procedures for early detection of breast cancer and include a physician's interpretation of the results. A doctor's prescription or referral is not necessary for the procedure to be covered. Whether payment can be made is determined by a woman's age and statutory frequency parameter. S ee Pub. 100 -02, Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, chapter 15, section 280.3 for additional coverage information for a screening mammography. Section 4101 of the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 provides for annual screening mammographies for women over age 39 and waives the Part B deductible. Coverage applies as follows: Age Groups Screening Period Under age 35 No payment allowed for screening mammography. 35-39 Baseline (pay for only one screening mammography performed on a woman between her 35th and 40th birthday) Over age 39 Annual (11 full months have elapsed following the month of last screening NOTE: Count months between screening mammographies beginning the month after the date of the examination. For example, if Mrs. Smith received a screening mammography examination in January 2005, begin counting the next month (February 2005) until 11 months have elapsed. Payment can be made for another screening mammography in January 2006. B. Diagnostic Mammography A diagnostic mammography is a radiological mammogram and is a covered diagnostic test under the following conditions: A patient has distinct signs and symptoms for which a mammogram is indicated; A patient has a history of breast cancer; or A patient is asymptomatic, but based on t he patient's history and other factors the physician considers significant, the physician's judgment is that a mammogram is appropriate. Beginning January 1, 2005, Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003, \u00a7644, Public Law 108- 173 has changed the way Medicare pays for diagnostic mammography. Medicare will pay based on the MPFS in lieu of OPPS or the lower of the actual change. 20.1 - Certification of Mammography Act (MQSA) provides specific standards regarding those qualified to perform screening and diagnostic mammograms and how they should be certified. The MQSA requires the Secretary to ensure th at all facilities that provide mammography services meet national quality standards. Effective October 1, 1994, all facilities providing screening and diagnostic mammography services (except VA facilities) must have a certificate issued by the Food and Dr ug Administration (FDA) to continue to operate. The FDA, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, is responsible for collecting certificate fees and surveying mammography facilities (screening and diagnostic). The FDA provides CMS with a listing of al l providers that have been issued certificates to perform mammography services and CMS notifies A/B MACs (A) and (B) accordingly. A/B MACs (A) and (B) are also notified of situations where a provider's certificate has expired, or has been suspended or rev oked. The information provided includes the provider's name, address, 6- position certification number, effective/expiration dates and the letter \"T\" to designate the facility as terminated. Medicare will reimburse only FDA -certified mammography centers for mammography services. A/B MACs (B) must inform physicians and suppliers at least annually, through their provider/supplier publications, of those facilities centers, that are certified. A/B MACs (B) encourage physicians to inform their patients about centers that are certified. Mammography facilities that perform screening mammographies are not to release screening mammography x -rays for interpretation to physicians who are not approved under the facility's certification number unless the patient has requested a transfer of the mammography from one facility to another for a second opinion, or unl ess the patient has moved to another part of the country where the next screening mammography will be performed. Interpretations are to be performed only by physicians who are associated with the certified mammography facility. A/B MACs (B) are not required to maintain a list of these associations unless there is a specific reason for doing so and only on a case - by-case basis. When adjudicating a screening mammography claim, MACs refer to the table of certified facilities provided by the FDA through CMS and confirm that the facility listed on the claim is in fact certified to perform the service. When the MAC determines that the facility that performed the mammography service has not been issued a certificate by the FDA or the certificate is suspended or revoked, the claim will be denied utilizing the denial language in \u00a720.8.1 of this chapter, related to certified facilities. 20.1.1 - Services Under Arrangements mammography services are obtained for patients under arrangements with another facility, the provider arranging the service must ensure that the facility performing the services has been issued an MQSA certificate by the FDA. 20.1. 2 - FDA Certification furnishes data to CMS on a weekly basis, which specify the certification of facilities under the MQSA. This data are contained in a \"MQSA file.\" Prior to April 1, 2003, the MQSA file showed all facilities that are certified to perform film screening and diagnostic mammograms. After April 1, 2003, the file shows a new Record Type with two indicators, \"1\" for film and \"2\" for digital to determine which mammograms the facility is certified to perform. Section 104 of the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act (BIPA) of 2000, entitled \"Modernization of Screening Mammography Benefit,\" provided new payment methodologies for both diagnostic and scree ning mammograms that utilize digital technology. The new digital mammography codes have a higher payment rate. In order for Medicare to know whether the mammography facility is certified to perform digital mammography and, therefore, due a higher payment rate, CMS relies upon the FDA certification data contained in the MQSA file. The FDA sends an updated file via the CMS Mainframe Telecommunications System (CMSTS), formerly Network Data Mover, on a weekly basis. Effective July 1, 2006, the MQSA file shows: Name of Facility, Certification number of the facility, Film certification obtained (Record -type =1) or digital certification obtained (Record - type = 2), Effective and Expiration dates of each certification, Letter \"T\" to designate the facility as terminated, Some mammography facilities are certified to perform both film and digital mammography. In this case, the facility's name and FDA certification number shows up on this file twice. One line will indicate film certification with effective date/expiration date while the other line will indicate digital certification with effective date/expiration date. NOTE: The FDA does not issue printed certification which indicates film or/and digital. Refer to the MQSA file for proof of types of mammograph y the facility is certified to perform. If the MQSA file appears to be in error, contact your regional office mammography coordinator. The coordinators will contact the FDA to research the apparent error. 20.2 - HCPCS and Diagnosis Codes for Mammography Services are used bill for mammography services. HCPCS Code Definition 77065* (G0206*) Diagnostic 77067* (G0202*) Screening mammography, bilateral (2 -view study of each breast), including computer -aided detection (CAD) when performed HCPCS Code Definition 77063** Screening Breast Tomosynthesis; bilateral (list separately in addition to code for primary procedure). G0279** Diagnostic digital breast tomosynthesis, unilateral or bilateral (List separately in addition to code for primary procedure) *NOTE: For claims with dates of service January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 providers report HCPCS codes G0202, G0204, and G0206. For claims with dates of service on or after January 1, 2018 providers report CPT codes 77067, 77066, 77063 and G0279 are effective for claims with dates of service on or after January 1, 2015. New Modifier \" -GG\": Performance and payment of a screening mammography and diagnostic mammography on same patient same day - This is bille d with the Diagnostic Mammography code to show the test changed from a screening test to a diagnostic test. A/B MACs (A) and (B) will pay both the screening and diagnostic mammography tests. This modifier is for tracking purposes only. This applies to c laims with dates of service on or after January 1, 2002. A. Diagnosis for Services On or After January 1, 1998 The BBA of 1997 eliminated payment based on high- risk indicators. However, to ensure proper coding, one of the following diagnosis codes shoul d be reported on screening mammography claims as appropriate: ICD- 9-CM V76.11 - \"Special screening high - risk patients\" or; V76.12 ICD- 10-CM Z12.31 - Encounter for screening mammogram for malignant neoplasm of breast. Beginning October 1, 2003, A/B MACs (B) are not permitted to plug the code for a screening mammography when the screening mammography claim has no diagnosis code. Sc reening mammography claims with no diagnosis code must be returned as unprocessable for assigned claims. For unassigned claims, deny the claim. In general, providers report diagnosis codes in accordance with the instructions in the appropriate ASC X12 837 claim technical report 3 (institutional or professional) and the paper claim form instructions found in chapters 25 (institutional) and 26 (professional). In addition, for institutional claims, providers report diagnosis code V76.11 or V76.12 (ICD -9-CM) or \"Principal Diagnosis Code\" if the screening mammography is the only service reported on the claim. If the claim contains other services in addition to the screening mammography, these diagnostic codes V76.11 or V 76.12 (ICD -9-CM) Z12.31 Diagnostic Codes.\" NOTE: Information regarding the form locator number that corresponds to the principal and other diagnosis codes is found in chapter 25. A/B MACs (B) receive this diagnosis in field 21 and field 24E with the appropriate pointer code of Form CMS -1500 or in Loop 2300 of ASC - X12 837 professional claim format. Diagnosis codes for a diagnostic mammography will vary according to diagnosis. 20.2.1 - Digital Breast Screening Breast Tomosynthesis Effective for claims with dates of service January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, HCPCS code 77063, \"Sc reening Digital Breast Tomosynthesis, bilateral, must be billed in conjunction with the primary service mammogram code G0202. Effective for claims with dates of service January 1, 2018 and later HCPCS code 77063, \"Screening Digital Breast Tomosynthesis, bi lateral, must be billed in conjunction with the primary service mammogram code 77067. A/B MACs (A) and (B) must assure that claims containing code 77063 also contain HCPCS code 77067* (G0202*). A/B MACs (A) return claims containing code 77063 that do not also contain HCPCS code 77067* (G0202*)with an explanation that payment for code 77063 cannot be made when billed alone. A/B MACs (B) deny payment for 77063 when billed without 77067* (G0202*). NOTE: When screening digital breast tomosynthesis, code 77063, is billed in conjunction with a screening mammography, code 77067* (G0202*), and the screening mammography 77067* (G0202*) fails the age and frequency edits in CWF, both services will be rejected by CWF. B. Diagnostic Breast Tomosynthesis Effective wit h claims with dates of service January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 HCPCS code G0279, \"Diagnostic digital breast tomosynthesis, unilateral or bilateral\", must be billed in conjunction with the primary service mammogram code G0204 or G0206. Effective with claims with dates of service January 1, 2018 and later, HCPCS code G0279, \"Diagnostic digital breast tomosynthesis, unilateral or bilateral\", must be billed in conjunction with the primary service mammogram code 77065 or 77066.Effective for claims wit h dates of service January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 A/B MACs (A) and (B) must assure that claims containing code G0279 also contain HCPCS code G0204 or G0206. A/B MACs (A) or (B) deny claims containing code G0279 that do not also contain HCPCS code G0202 or G0206 with an explanation that payment for code G0279 cannot be made when billed alone. Effective for claims with dates of service January 1, 2018 and later A/B MACs (A) and (B) must assure that claims containing code G0279 also contain HCPCS code 77065 or 77066. A/B MACs (A) or (B) deny claims containing code G0279 that do not also contain HCPCS code 77065 or 77066 with an explanation that payment for code G0279 cannot be made when billed alone. Claims for diagnostic breast tomosynthesis, H CPCS code G0279, submitted with a revenue code other than 0401, 096X, 097X, or 098X will be return to providers. Claims for diagnostic breast tomosynthesis, HCPCS code G0279, submitted with a TOB other than 12X, 13X, 22X, 23X, or 85X will be return to providers. 20.2.2 - Claim Adjustment Reason Codes (CARCs), Remittance Advice Remark Codes (RARCs), Group Codes, and Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) Messages (Rev. Issued: 08- 18-17, Effective: 01 claim lines for HCPCS code 77063 that are not submitted with the diagnosis code V76.11 or V76.12, the contractor shall use the following remittance advice messages and associated codes when rejecting/denying claims under this policy. This CARC/RARC combination is co mpliant with CAQH CORE Business Scenario Three. CARC: 167 RARC: N386 MSN: 14.9 Group Code PR (Patient Responsibility) assigning financial responsibility to the beneficiary (if a claim is received with a GA modifier indicating a signed ABN is on file). Group Code CO (Contractual Obligation) assigning financial liability to the provider (if a claim is received with a GZ modifier indicating no signed ABN is on file). When denying claim lines for HCPCS code G0279 that are not submitted with HCPCS 77066 Implementation: no Part B deductible or coinsurance for screening mammographies. The anti - markup payment limitation on physician billing for diagnostic tests does not apply to these services. Following are three categories of billing for mammography services: Professional component of mammography services (that is the physician's interpretation of the results of the examination); Technical component (all other servic es); or Both professional and technical components (global). However, global billing is not permitted for services furnished in provider outpatient departments, except for CAHs electing the optional method of payment for mammography services furnished on or after January 1, 2002. 20.3.1 - Payment for Screening Mammography Services Provided On and After January 1, 2002 (Rev. Issued: 08- 18-17, Effective: 01 -01-18, Implementation: 01- 02-18) The payment limitation methodology does not apply to claims with dates of service on or after January 1, 2002. A/B MAC (A) Claims For claims with dates of service on or after January 1, 2002, \u00a7104 of the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act (BIPA) 2000, provides for payment of screening mammography under the Medicare physician fee schedule (MPFS) when furnished in hospitals, skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), and CAHs not electing the optional method of payment for outpatient services. However, payment under the physician fee schedule is not applicable to hospit als subject to the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) until April 1, 2002. The payment for code 77067* is equal to the lower of: The actual charge or Locality specific technical component payment amount under the MPFS. Part B deductible and co insurance does not apply. This is a final payment. A/B MACs (A) use the benefit -pricing file provided by CMS to pay mammography codes. Payment for the add -on code 76085 is made under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. Deductible does not apply, however , coinsurance is applicable. *For claims with dates of service prior to January 1, 2007, providers report CPT code 76092. For claims with dates of service January 1, 2007 and later, providers report CPT code 77057. A/B MACs (B) Claims Physicians and suppliers are paid by the A/B MACs (B) for all mammography tests (including screening mammography) under the MPFS. Separate prices for the technical component, the professional component and the global service are included on the MPFS. The Medicare allow ed charge is the lower of: The actual charge, or The MPFS amount for the service billed. The Medicare payment for the service is 80 percent of the allowed charge. Coinsurance is 20 percent of the lower of the actual charge or the MPFS amount. Part B deductible is waived and does not apply to screening mammography. As with other MPFS services, the nonparticipating provider reduction and the limiting charge provisions apply to all mammography tests (including screening mammography). 20.3.1.1 - Outpatient Hospital Mammography for screening mammography in the Hospital Outpatient Setting (Revenue code 403) is the lesser of charge, or TC of MPFS for code 77067* ( G0202*). Neither deductible nor a coinsurance applies. Payment for diagnostic mammography, bilateral in the Hospital Outpatient Setting (Revenue code 401) is the lesser of charge, or TC of MPFS for code 77066* (G0204*). Payment for diagnostic mammograp hy, unilateral in the Hospital Outpatient Setting (Revenue code 401) is the lesser of charge, or TC of MPFS for code 77065* (G0206*). Deductible and coinsurance apply. Beginning January 1, 2005, Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization A ct (MMA) of 2003, \u00a7644, Public Law 108- 173 has changed the way Medicare pays for diagnostic mammography. Medicare payment will be based on the MPFS. Payment will no longer be made under the OPPS. 20.3.1.2 - Critical Access Hospital Payment Effective: 01 -01-18, to a CAH for screening mammography is not subject to applicable Part B deductible, but coinsurance does apply. Any deductible or coinsurance collected is deducted from the pay ment. A. Under the Optional (All Inclusive) Method Section 403(d) of the BBRA amended \u00a71834(g) of the Act to permit a CAH to elect an optional method of payment for outpatient services. This option is e ffective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2001. A CAH may elect to be paid for outpatient services by reasonable costs for facility services and \u00a7202 of BIPA allows an amount equal to 115 percent of the allowed amount for profes sional component. (Costs related to professional services are excluded from the cost payment.) CAHs electing the optional method of reimbursement bill the A/B MAC (A) with type of bill 85X, revenue code 0403 and HCPCS code 77067* (G0202*). They also incl ude the professional component on a separate line, with revenue code 96X, 97X, or 98X and HCPCS code 77067* (G0202*). B. Under the Standard Method CAHs reimbursed on the standard method of payment bill the technical component of a screening mammography to the A/B MAC (A) on type of bill 85X, revenue code 0403 and HCPCS code 77067* (G0202*). Professional services are billed to the A/B MAC (B) and paid based on the fee schedule by the A/B MAC (B). For claims with dates of service on or after January 1, 2002, \u00a7104 of the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act (BIPA) 2000, provides for payment of screening mammographies under the Medicare physician fee schedule (MPFS) in CAHs not electing the optional method of payment for outpatient services. 20.3.1.2.1 - CAH Screening Mammography Payment Table for Screening Mammography in the Critical Access Hospital Outpatient Setting Method 1 (Standard) TOB Rev Code HCPCS Payment Services on or after January 1 2002 Technical Component Deductible does not apply.

Deductible and coinsurance apply. 20.3.1.4 - Independent type of mammography service (Screening or diagnostic), it must have a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) certification to perform such services. An entity that only performs diagnostic mammography service should not be enrolled as an IDTF. Screening mammographies (including those that are self -referred) are payable by Medicare when performed in and by an IDTF entity. For additional information, refer to 100- 04 - Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 35 - Independent Diagnostic Testing Facility, Section 10.2 - Claims Processing. 20.4 - Billing Requirements - A/B MAC (A) Claims (Rev. weekly -updated MQSA file to verify that the billing facility is certified by the FDA to perform mammography services, and has the appropriate certification to perform the type of mammogram billed (film and/or digital). (See \u00a720.1.) A/B MACs (A) use the provider number submitted on the claim to identify the facility and use the MQSA data file to verify the facility's certification(s). A/B MAC (A) complete the following activities in processing mammography claims: If the provider number on the claim does not correspond with a certified mammography facility on the MQSA file, then A/B MACs (A) deny the claim. When a film mammography HCPCS code is on a claim, the claim is checked for a \"1\" film indicator. If a film mammography HCPCS code comes in on a claim and the facility is certified for film mammography, the claim is paid if all other relevant Medicare criteria are met. If a film mammography HCPCS code is on a claim and the facility is certified for digital mammography only, the claim is denied. When a digital mammography HCPCS code is on a claim, the claim is checked for \"2\" digital indicator. If a digital mammography HCPCS code is on a claim and the facility is certified for digital mammography, the claim is paid if all other relevant Medicare criteria are met. If a digital mammography HCPCS code is on a claim and the facility is certified for film mammography only, the claim is denied. NOTE: The Common Working File (CWF) no longer receives the mammography file for editing purposes. Except as provided in the following sections for RHCs and FQHCs, t he following procedures apply to billing for screening mammographies: The technical component portion of the screening mammography is billed on Form CMS - 1450 under bill type 12X, 13X, 14X**, HCPCS code 77067* (G0202*). The technical component portion of the diagnostic mammography is billed on Form CMS -1450 under bill type 12X, 13X, 14X**, code 77065* (G0206*),* 77066*(G0204). Separate bills are required for claims for screening mammographies with dates of service prior to January 1, 2002. Providers include on the bill only charges for the screening mammography. Separate bills are not required for claims for screening mammographies with dates of service on or after January 1, 2002. See separate instructions below for rural health clinics (RHCs) and federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). * For claims with dates of service January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, providers report CPT codes G0202, G0204, and G0206. For claims with dates of service January 1, 2018 and later, providers report CPT codes 77067, 77066, and 77065 respectively. ** For claims with dates of service April 1, 2005 and later, hospitals bill for all mammography services under the 13X type of bill or for dates of service April 1, 2007 and later, 12X or 13X as appropriate. The 14X type of bill is no longer applicable. Appropriate bill types for providers other than hospitals are 22X, 23X, and 85X. In cases where screening mammography services are self -referred and as a result an attending physician NPI is not available, the provider shall duplicate their facility NPI in the attending physician identifier field on the claim. 20.4.1 - Rural Health Clinics and Federally Qualified Health & FQHC - Technical Component The technical component of a screening or diagnostic mammography is outside the scope of the RHC/FQHC benefit. In a provider -based RHC or FQHC, the technical component is billed by the base provider to the A/B MAC (A) under bill type 12X, 13X, 22X, 23X or 85X as appropriate using the provider's outpatient provider number (not the RHC/FQHC provider number). The revenue code f or a screening mammography is 0403, and the HCPCS code is 77067*, (G0202)*). The revenue code for a diagnostic mammography is and the HCPCS codes are 77065* (G0206*), 77066* (G0204*). Payment is based on the payment method for the base provider. **G0236 is a deleted code after December 31, 2003. Use 76082* for claims with dates of service January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2006, and code 77051 for claims with dates of service January 1, 2007 and later. * For claims with dates of service January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, report CPT codes G0206, G0204, and G0202. For claims with dates of service January 1, 2018 and later, report CPT codes 77065, 77066, and 77067respectively. B. Independent RHCs and Freestanding FQHCs - Technical Component The technical component of a screening or diagnostic mammography is outside the scope of the RHC/FQHC benefit. The practitioner that renders the technical service bills their A/B MACs (B) using Form CMS -1500. Payment is based on the MPFS national non- facility rate. C. Provider -Based RHC & FQHC, Independent RHCs and Freestanding FQHCs - Professional Component The professional component of a screening or diagnostic mammography is within the scope of the RHC/FQHC benefit and is billed under the RHC AIR or the FQHC PPS payment methodology with revenue code 052X. A/B MACs (A) should assure payment is not made for revenue code 0403 (screening mammography) or 0401 (diagnostic mammography). No payment is made on the line item reporting revenue code 0403. For claims with dates of service on or after April 1, 2005, RHCs and FQHCs bill the A/B MAC (A) under bill type 71X or 77X for the professional component of a diagnostic mammography. No payment is made for the professional component of a diagnostic mammography unless there is a qualifying visit on the same day. The services should be billed with the appropriate revenue code. HCPCS coding is required for the diagnostic mammography. 20.4.2 - A/B MAC (A) Requirements A/B MAC (A) will consider the following when determining whether payment may be made: Presence of revenue code 0403; Presence of HCPCS code 77067* (G0206*); Presence of high risk diagnosis code indicator where appropriate; Date of last screening mammography; and Age of beneficiary. The A/B MACs (A) must accept revenue code 0403 for bill types 13X, 22X, 23X, 71X, 73X, or 85X. * For claims with dates of service January 1, 2017 thru December 31, 2017 providers report HCPCS code G0206. For claims with dates of service January 1, 2018 and later, providers report CPT code 77067. 20.4.2.1 - A/B MAC (A) Data for CWF and the Provider Statistical and Reimbursement Report (PS&R) records are annotated with the date of the first (technical) screening mammography claim received. The record is updated based on the next covered (technical) claim received. A/ B MACs (A) and (B) assume the claim is the first received for the beneficiary where records do not contain a date of last screening and process accordingly. The A/B MACs (A) include revenue code, HCPCS code, units, and covered charges in the CWF record fields with the same name. They report the payment amount for revenue code 0403 in the CWF field named \"Rate\" and the billed charges in the field named \"Charges\" of the CWF record. In addition, A/B MACs (A) report special override code 1 in the field named \"Special Action\" of the CWF record to avoid application of the Part B deductible. The A/B MACs (A) include in the financial data portion of the PS&R record, revenue code, HCPCS code, units, charges, and rate (fee schedule amount). The PS&R system will include screening mammographies on a separate report from cost - based payments. See the PS&R guidelines for specific information. 20.5 - Billing Requirements - A/B MAC (B) Claims the weekly -updated file to verify that the billing facility is certified by the FDA to perform mammography services, and has the appropriate certification to perform the type of mammogram billed (film and/or digital). A /B MACs (B) match the FDA assigned, 6 -digit mammography certification number on the claim to the FDA mammography certification number appearing on the file for the billing facility. A /B MACs (B) complete the following activities in processing mammography claims: If the claim does not contain the facility's 6 -digit certification number, then A/B MACs (B) return the claim as unprocessable. If the claim contains a 6 -digit certification number that is reported in the proper field or segment (as specified in the pre vious bullet) but such number does not correspond to the number specified in the MQSA file for the facility, then A/B MACs (B) deny the claim. When a film mammography HCPCS code is on a claim, the claim is checked for a \"1\" film indicator. If a film mammography HCPCS code comes in on a claim and the facility is certified for film mammography, the claim is paid if all other relevant Medicare criteria are met. If a film mammography HCPCS code is on a claim and the facility is certified for digital mammogra phy only, the claim is denied. When a digital mammography HCPCS code is on a claim, the claim is checked for \"2\" digital indicator. If a digital mammography HCPCS code is on a claim and the facility is certified for digital mammography, the claim is paid if all other relevant Medicare criteria are met. Process the claim to the point of payment based on the information provided on the claim and in A/B MAC (B) claims history. Identify the claim as a screening mammography claim by the CPT -4 code and diagnosis code(s) listed on the claim. Assign physician specialty code 45 to facilities that are certified to perform only screening mammography. Ensure that entities that bill globally for screening mammography contain a blank in modifier position #1. Ensure that entities that bill for the technical component use only HCPCS modifier \" -TC.\" Ensure that physicians who bill the professional component separately use HCPCS modifier \" -26.\" Ensure all those who are qualified include the 6- digit FDA -assigned certif ication number of the screening center on the claim. Providers report this number in item 32 on the paper 1500 claim form. A/B MACs (B) retain this number in their provider files. When a mammography claim contains services subject to the anti -markup payment limitation and the service was acquired from another billing jurisdiction, the provider must submit their own NPI with the name, address, and ZIP code of the performing physician/supplier. Refer to Pub. 100- 04, chapter 1, section 10.1.1.1., for claim s processing instructions for payment jurisdiction. Beginning October 1, 2003, A/B MACs (B) are no longer permitted to add the diagnosis code for a screening mammography when the screening mammography claim has no diagnosis code. Screening mammography cl aims with no diagnosis code must be returned as unprocessable for assigned claims. For unassigned claims, deny the claim. A/B MAC (B) Provider Education Educate providers that when a screening mammography turns to a diagnostic mammography on the same da y for the same beneficiary, add the \" -GG\" modifier to the diagnostic code and bill both codes on the same claim. Both services are reimbursable by Medicare. Educate providers that they cannot bill an add- on code without also billing for the appropriate mammography code. If just the add -on code is billed, the service will be denied. Both the add- on code and the appropriate mammography code should be on the same claim. Educate providers to submit their own NPI in place of an attending/referring physicia n NPI in cases where screening mammography services are self -referred. 20.5.1 - A/B MACs (B) Record MACs complete the type of service field in the CWF Part B claim record with a \"B\" if the patient is a high risk screening mammography patient or a \"C\" if she is a low risk screening mammography patient for services prior to January 1, 1998. For services on or after January 1, 1998, the type of servi ce field on CWF must have a value of \"1\" for medical care (screening) or a \"4\" for diagnostic radiology (diagnostic). Fill in POS. Fill in deductible indicator field with a \"1\"; not subject to deductible if screening mammography. Submit the claim to the CWF host. Trailer 17 of the Part B Basic Reply record will give the date of the last screening mammography. The CWF edits for age and frequency for screening mammography. There are no frequency limitations on diagnostic tests. 20.5.2 - Transportation Costs for Mobile Units (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) B3-4601.2.J Transportation costs are associated with mobile units for diagnostic mammography tests only. CMS formally added diagnostic mammography to the regulation language of the portable x -ray benefit in 42 CFR 410.32(c)(3) . These units are usually reserved for screening tests only. For the screening tests performed in a mobile unit, there is no separate transportation cost allowed. A/B MACs (B) should investigate transportation costs associated w ith the mobile mammography diagnostic tests that exceed data analysis guidelines. To receive transportation payments, the approved portable x -ray supplier must also meet the certification requirements of \u00a7354 of the Public Health Service Act. 20.6 - Instructions When an Interpretation Results in Additional Films (Rev. 3844, Issued: who interprets a screening mammography is allowed to order and interpret additional films based on the results of the screening mammogram while a beneficiary is still at the facility for the screening exam. When a radiologist's interpretation results in additional films, Medicare will pay for both the screening and diagnostic mammogram. A/B MACs (B) Clai ms For A/B MACs (B) claims, providers submitting a claim for a screening mammography and a diagnostic mammography for the same patient on the same day, attach modifier \" - GG\" to the diagnostic mammography. A modifier \" -GG\" is appended to the claim for the diagnostic mammogram for tracking and data collection purposes. Medicare will reimburse both the screening mammography and the diagnostic mammography. A/B MAC (A) Claims A/B MACs (A) require the diagnostic claim be prepared reflecting the diagnostic reven ue code (0401) along with and \" -GG\" and payment of a screening mammogram and diagnostic mammogram on the same patient, same day.\" Reporting of this modifier is needed for data collection purposes. Regular billing instructions remain in place for a screening mammography that does not fit this situation. Both A/B MACs (A) and (B) systems must accept the GH and GG modifiers where appropriate. * For claims with dates of service prior to January 1, 2017 thru December 31, 2017, providers report CPT codes G0206 and G0204. For claims with dates of service January 1, 2018 and later, providers report CPT codes 77065 and 77066 respectively. 20.7 - Mammograms Performed With New 01 -01-18, Implementation: 01- 02-18) Section 104 of the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act 2000, (BIPA) entitled Modernization of Screening Mammography Benefit, provides for new payment methodologies for both diag nostic and screening mammograms that utilize advanced new technologies for the period April 1, 2001, to December 31, 2001 (to March 31, 2002 for hospitals subject to OPPS). Under this provision, payment for technologies that directly take digital images w ould equal 150 percent of the amount that would otherwise be paid for a bilateral diagnostic mammography. For technologies that convert standard film images to digital form, payment will be derived from the statutory screening mammography limit plus an ad ditional payment of $15.00 for A/B MACs (B) claims and $10.20 for A/B MAC (A) (technical component only) claims. Payment restrictions for digital screening and diagnostic mammography apply to those facilities that meet all FDA certifications as provided u nder the Mammography Quality Standards Act. However, CAD codes billed in conjunction with digital mammographies or film mammographies are not subject to FDA certification requirements.

CARC: 16 RARC: MA128 Group Code: CO 30 - of the Act (42 USC 1395x(nn)) provides Medicare Part B coverage for a screening Pap smear for women under certain conditions. See the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15, for coverage of screening PAP smears. To be covered screening Pap smears must be ordered and collected by a doctor of medicine or osteopathy (as defined in \u00a71861(r)(l) of the Act), or other authorized practitioner (e.g., a certified nurse midwife, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist, who is authorized under State law to perform the examination) under one of the conditions identified in \u00a730.1, below. 30.1 - Pap Smears From January 1, 1998, Through June 30 2001 (Rev. 10- 01-03) B3-4603.1A.1, B3- 4603.1A.2, B3- 4603.1A.3, A3 -3628.1A The following requirements must be met. 1. The beneficiary has not had a screening Pap smear test during the preceding three years (i.e., 35 months have passed following the month that the woman had the last covered Pap smear. Use one of the following ICD -9-CM codes V 76.2, V76.47, or V76.49; or 2. There is evidence (on the basis of her medical history or other findings) that she is of childbearing age and has had an examination that indicated the presence of cervical or vaginal cancer or other abnormalities during any of the preceding 3 years; and at least 11 months have passed following the month that the last covered Pap smear was performed; or 3. She is at high risk of developing cervical or vaginal cancer (use ICD -9-CM code V15.89, other specified personal histor y presenting hazards to health) and at least 11 months have passed following the month that the last covered screening Pap smear was performed. The high risk factors for cervical and vaginal cancer are: a. Cervical Cancer High Risk Factors: Early onset of sexual activity (under 16 years of age) Multiple sexual partners (5 or more in a lifetime) History of a sexually transmitted disease (including HIV infection) Fewer than three negative or any Pap smears within the previous 7 years b. Vaginal Cancer High Risk Factors: DES (diethylstilbestrol) -exposed daughters of women who took DES during pregnancy. NOTE: The term \"woman of childbearing age\" means a woman who is premenopausal, and has been determined by a physician, or qualified practitioner, to be of childbearing age, based on her medical history or other findings. COUNTING: To determine the 11 -, 23-, and 35 -month periods, start counts beginning with the month after the month in which a previous test/procedure was performed. COUNTING EXAMPLE: A b eneficiary identified as being at high risk for developing cervical cancer received a screening Pap smear in January 2000. Start counts beginning with February 2000. The beneficiary is eligible to receive another screening Pap smear in January 2001 (the month after 11 full months have passed). 30.2 - Pap Smears On and After July 1, 2001 the beneficiary does not qualify for more frequent screening based on paragraphs (2) and (3) above, for services performed on or after July 1, 2001, payment may be made for a screening PAP smear after 23 months have passed after the end of the month of the last covered smear.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has determined that the evidence is sufficient to add HPV testing once every five years as an additional preventive s ervice benefit under the Medicare program for asymptomatic beneficiaries aged 30 to 65 years in conjunction with the Pap smear test. CMS will cover screening for cervical cancer with the appropriate U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved/cleared laboratory tests, used consistent with FDA -approved labeling and in compliance with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) regulations. Effective for claims with dates of service on or after July 9, 2015, payment may be made for HCPCS G0476 (cervical cancer screening, all -inclusive HPV co -test with cytology (Pap smear) to detect HPV DNA or RNA sequences). For claims with date of service from July 9, 2015 through December 31, 2016, HCPCS G0476 will be contractor priced. Beginning with date of ser vice January 1, 2017 and after, HCPCS G0476 will be priced and paid according to the CLFS. G0476 will be included in the January 2017 CLFS, January 1, 2016 IOCE, the January 2016 OPPS and January 1, 2016 MPFSD. HCPCS G0476 will be effective retroactive t o July 9, 2015 in the IOCE & OPPS.

RHCs and FQHCs bill the A/B MAC (A) under bill type 71X or 73X for the professional component along with revenue code 052X. See Chapter 9, for RHC and FQHC bill proces sing instructions. The technical component of a screening Pap smear is outside the scope of the RHC/FQHC benefit. If the technical component of this service is furnished within an independent RHC or freestanding FQHC, the provider of that technical servi ce bills the A/B MAC (B) on Form CMS -1500. If the technical component of a screening Pap smear is furnished within a provider -based RHC/FQHC, the provider of that service bills the A/B MAC (A) under bill type 13X, 14X, 22X, 23X, or 85X as appropriate usin outpatient provider number (not the RHC/FQHC provider number since these services are not covered as RHC/FQHC services). The appropriate revenue code is 311. Effective 4/1/06, type of bill 14X is for non-patient laboratory specimens. 30.5 - Screening Pap Smears: Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) Codes analysis and design; 10- 03-16 - CWF Coding, Tes ting and Implementation, MCS, and FISS Implementation; 01 -03-17 - Requirement BR9434.04.8.2) The following HCPCS codes can be used for screening Pap smear: A. Screening Pap Smears: Codes Billed to the A/B MAC (B) and Paid Under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) The following HCPCS codes are submitted by those providers/entities that submit claims to A/B MACs (B). The deductible is waived for these services effective January 1, 1998, however, coinsurance applies. NOTE : These codes are not bil led on A MAC claims except for HCPCS Q0091 which may be submitted to A/B MACs (B). Payment for HCPCS Q0091 performed in a hospital outpatient department is under the outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) (see 30.5C). Q0091 - Screening Papanicolaou (Pap) smear, obtaining, preparing and conveyance of cervical or vaginal smear to laboratory; P3001 - Screening Papanicolaou smear, cervical or vaginal, up to three smears requiring interpretation by a physician; G0124 - Screening cytopathology, cervical or vaginal (any reporting system), collected in preservative fluid, automated thin layer preparation, requiring interpretation by physician; and G0141 - Screening cytopathology smears, cervical or vaginal, performed by automated system, with manual re -screening, requiring interpretation by physician. B. Screening Pap Smears: Codes Paid Under the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule by A/B MACs The following codes are billed to A/B MACs (A) by providers they serve, or billed to A/B MACs (B) by the physicians/suppl iers they service. Deductible and coinsurance do not apply. P3000 - Screening Papanicolaou smear, cervical or vaginal, up to three smears, by a technician under the physician supervision; G0123 - Screening cytopathology, cervical or vaginal (any reporti ng system) collected in preservative fluid; automated thin layer preparation, screening by cytotechnologist under physician supervision; G0143 - Screening cytopathology, cervical or vaginal, (any reporting system), collected in preservative fluid, automat ed thin layer preparation, with manual screening and re -screening, by cytotechnologist under physician supervision; G0144 - Screening cytopathology, cervical or vaginal, (any reporting system), collected in preservative fluid, automated thin layer prepara tion, with screening by automated system under physician supervision; G0145 - Screening cytopathology, cervical or vaginal, (any reporting system), collected in preservative fluid, automated thin layer preparation, with screening by automated system and m anual re- screening under physician supervision; G0147 - Screening cytopathology smears, cervical or vaginal, performed by automated system under physician supervision; and G0148 - Screening cytopathology smears, cervical or vaginal, performed by automated system with manual reevaluation. C. Screening Pap Smears: Payment of Q0091 When Billed to A/B MACs (B) Payment for HCPCS Q0091 in a hospital outpatient department is under OPPS. A skilled nursing facility (SNF) is paid using the technical com ponent of the MPFS. For a critical access hospital (CAH), payment is on a reasonable cost basis. For rural health clinics/Federally qualified health centers (RHC/FQHCs) payment is made under the all- inclusive rate for the professional component. Deducti ble is not applicable, however, coinsurance applies. The technical component of a screening Pap smear is outside the RHC/FQHC benefit. If the technical component of a screening Pap smear is furnished within a provider -based RHC/FQHC, the provider of that service bills the A MAC under type of bill (TOB) 13X, 14X, 22X, 23X, or 85X as appropriate using their base provider number (not the RHC/FQHC provider number since these services are not covered as RHC/FQHC services). For independent RHCs/FQHCs, the prac titioner bills the technical component to the A/B MACs (B) on Form CMS -1500 or the ANSI X12N 837 P. Effective April 1, 2006, TOB 14X is for non- patient laboratory specimens. D. Screening Pap Smears: Payment of HCPCS Q0091 When Billed to A/B MACs (B) Payment for HCPCS Q0091 is paid under the MPFS. Deductible is not applicable, however the coinsurance applies. Effective for claims with dates of service on and after July 1, 2005, on those occasions when physicians must perform a screening Pap smear (HCPCS Q0091) that they know will not be covered by Medicare because the low -risk patient has already received a covered Pap smear (HCPCS Q0091) in the past 2 years, the physician can bill HCPCS Q0091 and the claim will be denied appropriately. The physician shall obtain an advance beneficiary notice (ABN) in these situations as the denial will be considered a not reasonable and necessary denial. The physician indicates on the claim that an ABN has been obtained by using the GA modifier. Effective for claims w ith dates of service on or after April 1, 1999, a covered evaluation and management (E/M) visit and HCPCS Q0091 may be reported by the same physician for the same date of service if the E/M visit is for a separately identifiable service. In this case, the modifier \" -25\" must be reported with the E/M service and the medical records must clearly document the E/M reported. Both procedure codes should be shown as separate line items on the claim. These services can also be performed separately on separate of fice visits. E. Screening Pap Smears: CWF Editing for HCPCS Q0091 The CWF will edit for claims containing HCPCS Q0091 effective for dates of service on and after July 1, 2005. Previously, the editing for HCPCS Q0091 had been removed from the CWF. Medi care pays for a screening Pap smear every 2 years for low -risk patients based on the low -risk diagnoses, see sections 30.2 and 30.6. Medicare pays for a screening Pap smear every year for a high -risk patient based on the high- risk diagnosis, see sections 30.1 and 30.6. This criteria will be the CWF parameters for editing HCPCS Q0091. In those situations where unsatisfactory screening Pap smear specimens have been collected and conveyed to clinical labs that are unable to interpret the test results, another specimen will have to be collected. When the physician bills for this reconveyance, the physician should annotate the claim with HCPCS Q0091 along with modifier - 76, (repeat procedure by same physician). 30.6 - Screening Pap Smears: Diagnoses the current diagnoses that should be used when billing for screening Pap smear services. Effective July 1, 2005, ICD -9 V72.31 is being added to the CWF edit as an addit ional low -risk diagnosis. The following chart lists the diagnosis codes that CWF must recognize for low -risk or high- risk patients for screening Pap smear services. Low Risk Diagnosis Codes Definitions V76.2 Special screening for malignant neoplasms, ce rvix V76.47 Special screening for malignant neoplasm, vagina Special screening for malignant neoplasm, other sites NOT E: providers use this diagnosis for women without a cervix. V72.31 Routine gynecological examination NOTE : This diagnosis should only be used when the provider performs a full gynecological examination. High Risk Diagnosis Code V15.89 Other specified personal history presenting hazards to health A. Screening Pap Smears: Applicable Diagnoses for Billing A/B MAC (B) There are a number of appropriate diagnosis codes that can be used in billing for screening Pap smear services that the provider can list on the claim to give a true picture of the patient's condition. Those diagnoses can be listed in Item 21 of Form CMS -1500 or the electronic equivalent (see Chapter 26 for electronic equivalent formats). In addition, one of the following diagnoses shall appear on the claim: the low -risk diagnosis of V76.2, V76.47, V76.49 and (effective July 1, 2005, V72.31) or the high- risk diagnosis of V15.89 (for high risk patients). One of the above diagnoses must be listed in item 21of the Form CMS -1500 or the electronic equivalent to indicate either low risk or high risk depending on the patient's condition. Then either the low -risk or high- risk diagnosis must also be pointed to in Item 24E of Form CMS -1500 or the electronic equivalent. Providers must make sure that for screening Pap smears for a high- risk beneficiary, that the high- risk diagnosis code of V15.89 appears in Item 21 and V15.89 is the appropriate diagnosis code that must be pointed to in Item 24E or the electronic equivalent. If Pap smear claims do not point to one of these specific diagnoses in Item 24E or the electronic equivalent, the claim will reject in the CWF. Periodically, A/B MACs (B) should do provider education on diagnosis coding of Pap smear claims. B. Screening Pap Smears: Applicable Diagnoses for Billing A/B MACs (A) Providers report one of the following diagnosis codes in Form CMS -1450 or the electr onic equivalent ( NOTE: Information regarding the form locator numbers that correspond to the diagnosis codes and a table to crosswalk its CMS -1450 form locator to the 837 transaction is found in Chapter 25.): Low-risk diagnosis codes: ICD-9 V76.2, special screening for malignant neoplasms, vagina, or, ICD-9 V76.49, special screening for malignant neoplasms, other sites (used for women without a cervix), or, ICD-9 V72.31, routine gynecol ogical exams ICD-10 Z12.4, encounter for malignant neoplasm of the cervix ICD-10 Z12.72, encounter for screening for malignant neoplasm of the vagina ICD-10 Z12.79, encounter for screening for malignant neoplasm of other genitourinary organs, or, ICD-10 Z12.89, encounter for screening for malignant neoplasm of other sites ICD-10 Z01.411, encounter for gynecological exam (general)(routine) with abnormal findings, ICD-10 Z01.419, encounter for gynecological exam (general)(routine) wit hout abnormal findings High -risk diagnosis codes ICD-9 V15.89, other specified personal history hazardous to health ICD-9 V87.39, contact with and (suspected) exposure to other potentially hazardous substances ICD-9 V69.2, high- risk sexual behavior ICD-10 Z77.9, other contact with and (suspected) exposures hazardous to health, or, ICD-10 Z91.89, other specified personal risk factors, not elsewhere classified, or, ICD-10 Z92.89, personal history of other medical treatment, or, ICD-10 Z77.29, contact with and (suspected) exposure to other hazardous substances ICD-10 Z72.51, high -risk heterosexual behavior, or, ICD-10 Z72.52, high -risk homosexual behavior, or, ICD-10 Z72.53, high -risk bisexual behavior.

Effective July 1, 2001, the Consoli dated Appropriations Act of 2001 (P.L. 106- 554) modifies \u00a71861(nn) to provide Medicare Part B coverage for biennial screening pelvic examinations. A screening pelvic examination with or without specimen collection for smears and cultures, should include a t least seven of the following eleven elements: Inspection and palpation of breasts for masses or lumps, tenderness, symmetry, or nipple discharge; Digital rectal examination including sphincter tone, presence of hemorrhoids, and rectal masses; External genitalia (for example, general appearance, hair distribution, or lesions); Urethral meatus (for example, size, location, lesions, or prolapse); Urethra (for example, masses, tenderness, or scarring); Bladder (for example, fullness, masses, or tenderne ss); Vagina (for example, general appearance, estrogen effect, discharge, lesions, pelvic support, cystocele, or rectocele); Cervix (for example, general appearance, lesions or discharge) Uterus (for example, size, contour, position, mobility, tendernes s, consistency, descent, or support); Adnexa/parametria (for example, masses, tenderness, organomegaly, or nodularity); and Anus and perineum. 40.1 - Screening Pelvic Examinations From January 1, 1998, Through June 30 2001 (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) B3-4603.2.A, B3- 4603.5, A3- 3628.1.B.1, R1888.A.3 Dated 6- 3-2003 The following requirements must be met. The exam must be performed by a doctor of medicine or osteopathy (as defined in \u00a71861(r)(1) of the Act), or by a certified nurse midwife (as defined in \u00a71861(gg) of the Act), or a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist (as defined in \u00a71861(aa) of the Act) who is authorized under State law to perform the examination. This examination does not have to be ordered by a physician or other authorized practitioner. Payment may be made: Once every three years on an asymptomatic woman only if the individual has not had a screening pelvic examination paid for by Medicare during the preceding 35 months following the month in which the last Medicare -covered screening pelvic examination w as performed. The provider uses one of the following ICD -9-CM codes V76.2, V76.47, or V76.49. Exceptions are as follows: Payment may be made for a screening pelvic examination performed more frequently than once every 35 months if the test is performed by a physician or other practitioner and there is evidence that the woman is at high risk (on the basis of her medical history or other findings) of developing cervical cancer, or vaginal cancer. (providers use ICD -9-CM code V15.89, other specified personal history presenting hazards to health.) The high risk factors for cervical and vaginal cancer are: Cervical Cancer High Risk Factors Early onset of sexual activity (under 16 years of age) Multiple sexual partners (five or more in a lifetime) History of a sexually transmitted disease (including HIV infection) Fewer than three negative or any Pap smears within the previous seven years Vaginal Cancer High Risk Factors DES (diethylstilbestrol) -exposed daughters of women who took DES during pregnancy. ICD-9-CM code V15.89, other specified personal history presenting hazards to health is used to indicate that one or more of these factors is present; or Payment may also be made for a screening pelvic examination performed more frequently than once every 36 months if the examination is performed by a physician or other practitioner, for a woman of childbearing age, who has had such an examination that indicated the presence of cervical or vaginal cancer or other abnormality during any of the preceding thre e years. The term \"women of childbearing age\" means a woman who is premenopausal, and has been determined by a physician, or qualified practitioner, to be of childbearing age, based on her medical history or other findings. Payment is not made for a screening pelvic examination for women at high risk or who qualify for coverage under the childbearing provision more frequently than once every 11 months after the month that the last screening pelvic examination covered by Medicare was performed. For claims with dates of service on or after July 1, 2001, if the beneficiary does not qualify for an annual screening pelvic exam as noted above, pay for the screening pelvic exam only after at least 23 months have passed following the month during which the benefi ciary received her last covered screening pelvic exam. All other coverage and payment requirements remain the same. Calculating the Frequency Limitations To determine the screening periods, start counts beginning with the month after the month in which a previous test/procedure was performed. Frequency Limitation Example A beneficiary identified as being at high risk for developing cervical cancer received a pelvic exam in January 2002. Start counts beginning with February 2002. The beneficiary is el igible to receive another screening exam, if high risk, in January 2003 (the month after 11 full months have passed). 40.2 - Screening Pelvic Examinations on and After July 1, 2001 (Rev. the beneficiary does not qualify for a more frequently performed screening pelvic exam noted in \u00a740.1 of this chapter, items 2, or 3, the screening pelvic exam may be paid only after at least 23 months have passed following the month during which the beneficiary received her last covered screening pelvic exam. All other coverage, claim preparation, and payment requirements remain the same, except ICD -10-CM codes replace ICD -9-CM codes when mandated. 40.3 - Deductible and Coinsurance (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) B3-4603.2.C, A3- 3628.1.B.3 The Part B deductible for screening pelvic examinations is waived effective January 1, 1998. Coinsurance is applicable. A. Action When Submitting Claims to CWF and CWF Edit B3-4603.4, B3- 4603.6, A3- 3628.1.C.1 When an A/B MAC (B) receives a claim for a pelvic examination, performed on or after January 1, 1998, it must enter a deductible indicator of 1 (not subject to deductible) in field 65 of the HUBC record. When an A/B MAC (A) receives a claim for a screening pelvic examination (including a clinical breast examination), performed on or after January 1, 1998, it reports spec ial override Code 1 in the \"Special Action Code/Override Code\" field of the CWF record for the line item, indicating the Part B deductible does not apply. CWF edits for screening pelvic examinations performed more frequently than allowed according to the presence of high risk factors. 40.4 - Diagnoses Codes (Rev. are the current diagnoses that should be used when billing for screening pelvic examination services. Effective, Jul y 1, 2005, ICD -9-CM diagnosis code V72.31 was added to the CWF edit as an additional low risk diagnosis. The following chart lists the diagnosis codes that CWF must recognize for low risk or high risk patients for screening pelvic examination services. Low Risk Diagnosis Codes ICD-9- CM codes Description ICD-10- CM codes Description V72.31 Routine gynecological examination \u2014NOTE: This diagnosis should only be used when the provider performs a full gynecological examination. Z01.411 Encounter for gynecological examination (general) (routine) with abnormal findings V72.31 Routine gynecological examination -NOTE: This diagnosis should only be used when the provider performs a full gynecological examination Z01.419 Encounter for gynecological examination (general) (routine) without abnormal findings V76.2 Screening for malignant neoplasms of the cervix Z12.4 Encounter for screening for malignant neoplasm of cervix V76.47 Special screening for malignant neoplasms, vagina Z12.72 Encounter for screening for malignant neoplasm of vagina V76.49 Special screening for malignant neoplasms, other sites NOTE: Providers use this diagnosis for women without a cervix. Z12.79 Encounter for screening for malignant neoplasm of other genitourinary organs V76.49 Special screening for malignant neoplasms, other sites- NOTE: Providers use this diagnosis for women without a cervix. Z12.89 Encounter for screening for malignant neoplasm of other sites High Risk Diagnosis Codes ICD-9- CM codes Description ICD-10- CM codes Description V15.89 Other specified personal history presenting hazards to health Z77.22 Contact with and (suspected) exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (acute) (chronic) V15.89 Other specified personal history presenting hazards to health Z77.9 Other contact with and (suspected) exposures hazardous to health V15.89 Other specified personal history presenting hazards to health Z91.89 Other specified personal risk factors, not elsewhere classified V15.89 Other specified personal history presenting hazards to health Z72.89 Personal history of other medical treatment V69.2 High risk sexual behavior Z72.51 High risk heterosexual behavior V69.2 High risk sexual behavior Z72.52 High risk homosexual behavior V69.2 High risk sexual behavior Z72.53 High risk bisexual behavior A. Applicable Diagnoses for Billing an A/B MAC (B) For professional claims, providers report diagnosis codes according to the instructions in the ASC X12 837 professional claim technical report 3 for electronic claims and chapter 26 of this manual for paper claims. Part of this reporting includes pointing (relating) the claimed service to a diagnosis code on the claim. There are a number of appropriate diagnosis codes that can be used in billing for screening pelvic examinations that the provider can list on the claim to give a true picture of the patient's condition. In addition, one of the diagnoses listed in either the high risk or low risk tables above (\u00a740.4) must be on the claim to indicate eit her low risk or high risk depending on the patient's condition, and the screening pelvic examination service must point to this diagnosis code. Providers must make sure that, for screening pelvic exams for a high risk beneficiary, a high risk diagnosis code appears on the claim and that the screening pelvic examination service points to this diagnosis code. If pelvic examination claims do not point to one of these specific diagnoses, the claim will reject in the CWF. If these pointers are not present on claims submitted to A/B MACs (B), CWF will reject the record. Periodically, A/B MACs (B) should do provider education on diagnosis coding of screening pelvic examination claims. B. Applicable Diagnoses for Billing an A/B MAC (A) For institutional claims , providers report diagnosis codes according to the instructions in the ASC X12 837 institutional claim technical report 3 for electronic claims and chapter 25 of this manual for paper claims. (Chapter 25 also contains additional general billing information for institutional claims.) Appropriate diagnoses are shown above in this section for low risk and high risk beneficiaries. Periodically provider education should be done on diagnosis coding of screening pelvic exam claims. 40.5 - Payment Method (Rev under the MPFS, whether billed to the A/B MAC (A) or (B) except : Hospital outpatient services are paid under OPPS; See \u00a740.5.B of this chapter for proper billing by RHC/FQHCs for the professional and technical components of a screening pelvic examination. RHCs/FQHCs are paid under the all -inclusive rate for the professional component; or based on the provider's payment me thod for the technical component; CAH payment is under reasonable cost. NOTE: SNFs are paid under the MPFS and bill the A/B MAC (A). Physicians and other individual practitioners bill the A/B MAC (B). 40.6 - Revenue Code and HCPCS Codes for Billing A/B MAC (B) Code G0101 (cervical or vaginal cancer screening, pelvic and clinical breast examination) is used. Effective for services on or after January 1, 1999, a covered evaluation and management (E/M) visit and code G0101 may be reported by the same physician for the same date of service if the E/M visit is for a separately identifiable service. In this case, the modifier \"-25\" must be reported with the E /M service and the medical records must clearly document the E/M service reported. Both procedure codes should be shown as separate line items on the claim. These services can also be performed separately on separate office visits. B. Billing to the A/B MAC (A) The applicable bill types for a screening pelvic examination (including breast examination) are 12X, 13X, 22X, 23X, and 85X. The applicable 0770. (See \u00a770.1.1.2 for RHCs and FQHCs.) Effect ive April 1, 2006, type of bill 14X is for non-patient laboratory specimens and is no longer applicable for a screening pelvic examination. The professional component of a screening pelvic examination furnished within an RHC/FQHC by a physician or nonphys ician is considered an RHC/FQHC service. RHCs and FQHCs bill the A/B MAC (A) under bill type 71X or 73X for the professional component along with revenue code 052X. The technical component of a screening pelvic examination is outside the scope of the RHC /FQHC benefit. If the technical component of this service is furnished within an independent RHC or freestanding FQHC, the provider of that technical service bills the A/B MAC (B) on the ASC X12 837 professional claim format or hardcopy Form CMS - 1500. If the technical component of a screening pelvic examination is furnished within a provider -based RHC/FQHC, the provider of that service bills the A/B MAC (A) under bill type 12X, 13X, 22X, 23X, or 85X as appropriate using their outpatient provider number (not the RHC/FQHC provider number since these services are not covered as RHC/FQHC services). The appropriate revenue code is 0770. Effective April 1, 2006, type of bill 14X is for non- patient laboratory specimens and is no longer applicable for a screenin g pelvic examination. 40.7 - MSN Messages no high risk factors, and the screening Pap smear and/or screening pelvic examination is being denied because the procedure/examination is performed more frequently than allowed, A/B MACs (A) and (B) use MSN 18- 17: Medicare pays for a screening Pap smear and/or screening pelvic examination only once every (2, 3) years unless high risk factors are present. 40.8 - Remittance Advice Codes high risk factors are not present, and the screening Pap smear and/or screening pelvic examination is being denied because the procedure/examination is performed more frequently than allowed, use existing ASC X12 835: Claim adjustment reason code 119 - \"Benefit maximum for this time period has been reached \" at the line level, and Remark code M83 - \"Service is not covered unless the patient is class ified as at high risk\" at the line item level. 50 - Prostate Cancer Screening Tests and Procedures (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) B3-4182, A3- 3616 Sections 1861(s)(2)(P) and 1861(oo) of the Act (as added by \u00a74103 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997), provide for Medicare Part B coverage of certain prostate cancer screening tests subject to certain coverage, frequency, and payment limit ations. Effective for services furnished on or after January 1, 2000, Medicare Part B covers prostate cancer screening tests/procedures for the early detection of prostate cancer. Coverage of prostate cancer screening tests includes the following procedu res furnished to an individual for the early detection of prostate cancer: Screening digital rectal examination, and Screening prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test. Each test may be paid at a frequency of once every 12 months for men who have attained age 50 (i.e., starting at least one day after they have attained age 50), if at least 11 months have passed following the month in which the last Medicare -covered screening digital rectal examination was performed (for digital rectal exams) or PSA test was performed (for PSA tests). 50.1 - Definitions (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) A3-3616.A.1 and 2 A. Screening Digital Rectal Examination Screening digital rectal examination means a clinical examination of an individual's prostate for nodules or other abnor malities of the prostate. This screening must be performed by a doctor of medicine or osteopathy (as defined in \u00a7186l(r)(1) of the Act), or by a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, cl inical nurse specialist, or by a certified nurse mid- wife (as defined in \u00a71861(aa) and \u00a71861(gg) of the Act), who is authorized under State law to perform the examination, fully knowledgeable about the beneficiary, and would be responsible for explaining the results of the examination to the beneficiary. B. Screening Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Tests Screening prostate specific antigen (PSA) is a test that measures the level of prostate specific antigen in an individual's blood. This screening must be ordered by the beneficiary's physician or by the beneficiary's physician assistant, nurse practitioner, clinical nurse s pecialist, or certified nurse midwife (the term \"physician\" is defined in \u00a71861(r)(1) of the Act to mean a doctor of medicine or osteopathy and the terms \"physician assistant, nu rse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or certified nurse midwife\" are defined in \u00a71861(aa) and \u00a71861(gg) of the Act) who is fully knowledgeable about the beneficiary, and who would be responsible for explaining the results of the test to the benefic iary. 50.2 - Deductible and Coinsurance (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) B3-4182.3 The screening PSA test is a lab test to which neither deductible nor coinsurance apply. Both deductible (if unmet) and coinsurance are applicable to screening rectal examinations. 50.3 - Payment Method - A/B MACs (A) and (B) (Rev. 795, Issued: 12- 30-05; Effective: 10- 01-04; Implementation: 04 -03-06) Screening PSA tests (G0103) are paid under the clinical diagnostic lab fee schedule. Screening rectal examinations (G0102) are paid under the MPFS except for the following bill types identified (A/B MAC (A) only).

For claims with dates of service on or af ter January 1, 2002, A/B MACs (A) and (B) pay for screening flexible sigmoidoscopies (HCPCS G0104) for beneficiaries who have attained age 50 when these services were performed by a doctor of medicine or osteopathy, or by a physician assistant, nurse pract itioner, or clinical nurse specialist (as defined in \u00a71861(aa)(5) of the Social Security Act (the Act) and in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at 42 CFR 410.74, 410.75, and 410.76) at the frequencies noted above. For claims with dates of service prio r to January 1, 2002, Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) pay for these services under the conditions noted only when a doctor of medicine or osteopathy performs them. For services furnished from January 1, 1998, through June 30, 2001, inclusive: Once every 48 months (i.e., at least 47 months have passed following the month in which the last covered screening flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed). For services furnished on or after July 1, 2001: Once every 48 months as calculated above unless the beneficiary does not meet the criteria for high risk of developing colorectal cancer (refer to \u00a760.3 of this chapter) and he/she has had a screening colonoscopy (HCPCS G0121) within the preceding 10 years. If such a beneficiary has had a screening colono scopy within the preceding 10 years, then he or she can have covered a screening flexible sigmoidoscopy only after at least 119 months have passed following the month that he/she received the screening colonoscopy (HCPCS G0121). NOTE: If during the cours e of a screening flexible sigmoidoscopy a lesion or growth is detected which results in a biopsy or removal of the growth; the appropriate diagnostic procedure classified as a flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsy or removal along with modifier - PT should be billed and paid rather than HCPCS G0104. HCPCS G0105 - Colorectal Cancer High Risk Screening colonoscopies (HCPCS code G0105) may be paid when performed by a doctor of medicine or osteopathy at a frequency of once every 24 months for beneficiaries at high risk for developing colorectal cancer (i.e., at least 23 months have passed following the month in which the last covered HCPCS G0105 screening colonoscopy was performed). Refer to \u00a760.3 of this chapter for the cr iteria to use in determining whether or not an individual is at high risk for developing colorectal cancer. NOTE: If during the course of the screening colonoscopy, a lesion or growth is detected which results in a biopsy or removal of the growth, the appropriate diagnostic procedure classified as a colonoscopy with biopsy or removal along with modifier - PT should be billed and paid rather than HCPCS G0105. A. Colonoscopy Cannot be Completed Because of Extenuating Circumstances 1. A/B MACs (A) When a covered colonoscopy is attempted but cannot be completed because of extenuating circumstances, Medicare will pay for the interrupted colonoscopy as long as the coverage conditions are met for the incomplete procedure. However, the frequency standards asso ciated with screening colonoscopies will not be applied by CWF. When a covered colonoscopy is next attempted and completed, Medicare will pay for that colonoscopy according to its payment methodology for this procedure as long as coverage conditions are m et, and the frequency standards will be applied by CWF. This policy is applied to both screening and diagnostic colonoscopies. When submitting a facility claim for the interrupted colonoscopy, providers are to suffix the colonoscopy. Use of HCPCS codes with a modifier of \" -73\" or\" -74\" is appropriate to indicate that the procedure was interrupted. Payment for covered incomplete screening colonoscopies shall be consistent with payment methodologies currently in place for complete screening colonoscopies, including those contained in 42 CFR 419.44(b). In situations where a CAH has elected payment Method II for CAH patients, payment shall be consistent with payment methodologies currently in place as outlined in chapter 3 of this manual. As such, instruct CAHs that elect Method II payment to use modifier \" -53\" to identify an incomplete screening colonoscopy (physician professional service(s) billed in revenue code 096X, 097X, and/or 098X). Such CAHs will also bill the technical or facility component of the interrupted colonoscopy in revenue code 075X (or other appropriate revenue code) using the \" -73\" or \" -74\" modifier as appropriate. Note that Medicare would expect the provider to maintain adequate information in the patient's medical record in case it i s needed by the A/B MAC (A) to document the incomplete procedure. 2. A/B MACs (B) When a covered colonoscopy is attempted but cannot be completed because of extenuating circumstances (see chapter 12, section 30.1), Medicare will pay for the interrupted c olonoscopy at a rate that is calculated using one -half the value of the inputs for the codes. The Medicare physician fee schedule database has specific values for codes 44388- 53, 45378- 53, G0105- 53 and G0121- 53. When a covered colonoscopy is next attempted and completed, Medicare will pay for that colonoscopy according to its payment methodology for this procedure as long as coverage conditions are met. This policy is applied to both screening and diagnostic colonoscopies. When submitting a claim for th e interrupted colonoscopy, professional providers are to suffix the colonoscopy code with a modifier of \" -53\" to indicate that the procedure was interrupted. When submitting a claim for the facility fee associated with this procedure, Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASCs) are to suffix the colonoscopy code with modifier \" -73\" or \" -74\" as appropriate. Payment for covered screening colonoscopies, including that for the associated ASC facility fee when applicable, shall be consistent with payment for diagnostic colonoscopies, whether the procedure is complete or incomplete. Note that Medicare would expect the provider to maintain adequate information in the patient's medical record in case it is needed by the A/B MAC (B) to document the incomplete procedure. HCPCS G0106 - Colorectal Cancer Screening; Screening Sigmoidoscopy Screening barium enema examinations may be paid as an alternative to a screening sigmoidoscopy (code HCPCS G0104). The same frequency parame ters for screening sigmoidoscopies (see those codes above) apply. In the case of an individual aged 50 or over, payment may be made for a screening barium enema examination (code HCPCS G0106) performed after at least 47 months have passed following the month in which the last screening barium enema or screening flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed. For example, the beneficiary received a screening barium enema examination as an alternative to a screening flexible sigmoidoscopy in January 1999. Start count beginning February 1999. The beneficiary is eligible for another screening barium enema in January 2003. The screening barium enema must be ordered in writing after a determination that the test is the appropriate screening test. Generally, it is expe cted that this will be a screening double contrast enema unless the individual is unable to withstand such an exam. This means that in the case of a particular individual, the attending physician must determine that the estimated screening potential for the barium enema is equal to or greater than the screening potential that has been estimated for a screening flexible sigmoidoscopy for the same individual. The screening single contrast barium enema also requires a written order from the beneficiary's att ending physician in the same manner as described above for the screening double contrast barium enema examination. -Occult Blood Test, 1 -3 Simultaneous Determinations Effective for services fu rnished on or after January 1, 1998, screening FOBT (code 82270* (HCPCS G0107*) may be paid for beneficiaries who have attained age 50, and at a frequency of once every 12 months (i.e., at least 11 months have passed following the month in which the last c overed screening FOBT was performed). This screening FOBT means a guaiac- based test for peroxidase activity, in which the beneficiary completes it by taking samples from two different sites of three consecutive stools. This screening requires a written o rder from the beneficiary's attending physician, or effective for dates of service on or after January 27, 2014, the beneficiary's attending physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist. (The term \"attending physician\" is defined to mean a doctor of medicine or osteopathy (as defined in \u00a71861(r)(1) of the Act) who is fully knowledgeable about the beneficiary's medical condition, and who would be responsible for using the results of any examination performed in the overall management of the beneficiary's specific medical problem.) Effective for services furnished on or after January 1, 2004, payment may be made for an immunoassay -based FOBT (HCPCS G0328, described below) as based FOBT, CPT 82270* (HCPCS G0107*). Medicare will pay for only one covered FO BT per year, either CPT 82270* (HCPCS G0107*) or HCPCS G0328, but not both. *NOTE : For claims with dates of service prior to January 1, 2007, physicians, suppliers, and providers report HCPCS G0107. Effective January 1, 2007, HCPCS G0107 is Colorectal Cancer Blood Test, 1 -3 Simultaneous Determinations Effective for services furnished on or after January 1, 2004, screening FOBT, (HCPCS G0328) may be paid as an a lternative to CPT 82270* (HCPCS G0107*) for beneficiaries who have attained age 50. Medicare will pay for a covered FOBT (either CPT 82270* (HCPCS G0107*) or HCPCS G0328, but not both) at a frequency of once every 12 months (i.e., at least 11 months have passed following the month in which the last covered screening FOBT was performed). Screening FOBT, immunoassay, includes the use of a spatula to collect the appropriate number of samples or the use of a special brush for the collection of samples, as determined by the individual manufacturer's instructions. This screening requires a written order from the beneficiary's attending physician, or effective for claims with dates of service on or after January 27, 2014, the beneficiary's attending physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist. (The term \"attending physician\" is defined to mean a doctor of medicine or osteopathy (as defined in \u00a71861(r)(1) of the Act) who is fully knowledgeable about the beneficiary's medical condition, a nd who would be responsible for using the results of any examination performed in the overall management of the beneficiary's specific medical problem.) HCPCS G0120 - Colorectal Screening Colonoscopy Screening barium enema examinations may be paid as an alternative to a screening colonoscopy (HCPCS G0105) examination. The same frequency parameters for screening colonoscopies (see those codes above) apply. In the case of an individual who is at high risk for colorectal cancer, payment may be made for a screening barium enema examination (HCPCS G0120) performed after at least 23 months have passed following the month in which the last screening barium enema or the last screening colonoscopy was performed. For example, a beneficiary at high risk for developing colorectal cancer received a screening barium enema examination (HCPCS G0120) as an alternative to a screening colonoscopy (HCPCS G0105) in January 2000. Start counts beginning Februa ry 2000. The beneficiary is eligible for another screening barium enema examination (HCPCS G0120) in January 2002. The screening barium enema must be ordered in writing after a determination that the test is the appropriate screening test. Generally, it is expected that this will be a screening double contrast enema unless the individual is unable to withstand such an exam. This means that in the case of a particular individual, the attending physician must determine that the estimated screening potential for the barium enema is equal to or greater than the screening potential that has been estimated for a screening colonoscopy, for the same individual. The screening single contrast barium enema also requires a written order from the beneficiary's atten ding physician in the same manner as described above for the screening double contrast barium enema examination. HCPCS G0121 - Colorectal Screening; Colonoscopy on Individual Not Meeting Criteria for High Risk - Applicable On and After July 1, 2001 Effec tive for services furnished on or after July 1, 2001, screening colonoscopies (HCPCS G0121) performed on individuals not meeting the criteria for being at high risk for developing colorectal cancer (refer to \u00a760.3 of this chapter) may be paid under the following conditions: At a frequency of once every 10 years (i.e., at least 119 months have passed following the month in which the last covered HCPCS G0121 screening colonoscopy was performed.) If the individual would otherwise qualify to have covered a HCPCS G0121 screening colonoscopy based on the above but has had a covered screening flexible sigmoidoscopy ( HCPCS G0104), then he or she may have covered a HCPCS G0121 screening colonoscopy only after at least 47 months have passed following the month in which the last covered HCPCS G0104 flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed. NOTE: If during the course of the screening colonoscopy, a lesion or growth is detected which results in a biopsy or removal of the growth, the appropriate diagnostic procedure classified as a colonoscopy with biopsy or removal along with modifier - PT should be billed and paid rather than HCPCS G0121. HCPCS Cancer Screening Test - CologuardTM Effective for d ates of service on or after October 9, 2014, colorectal cancer screening using the CologuardTM multitarget sDNA test (G0464/81528) is covered once every 3 years for Medicare beneficiaries that meet all of the following criteria: Ages 50 to 85 years, Asymptomatic (no signs or symptoms of colorectal disease including but not limited to lower gastrointestinal pain, blood in stool, positive guaiac fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test), and, At average risk of developing colorectal cancer ( no personal history of adenomatous polyps, colorectal cancer, or inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn's Disease and ulcerative colitis; no family history of colorectal adenomatous 100- 03, Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual, chapter 1, section 210.3, for complete coverage requirements. Effective for claims with dates of service on or after October 9, 2014, providers shall report the following diagnosis codes when submitting claims for the Cologuard January 1, Colorectal Cancer Screening; code is not covered by Medicare. 60.2.1 - Common Working Files dates of service January 1, 1998, and later, CWF will edit all colorectal screening claims for age and frequency standards. The CWF will also edit A/B MAC (A) claims for for valid HCPCS codes for A/B/MACs (B). (See \u00a760. 6 of this chapter for TOBs.) *NOTE : For claims with dates of service prior to January 1, 2007, physicians, suppliers, and providers report HCPCS G0107. Effective January 1, 2007, HCPCS G0107 is discontinued and replaced with CPT 82270. ** Effective January 1, 2016, HCPCS G0464 is discontinued and replaced with CPT 81528. 60.2. 2 - Ambulatory Surgical used to code a diagnostic colonoscopy, is on the list of procedures approved by Medicare for payment of an ambulatory surgical center facility under 1833 of the Act. CPT code 45378 is currently assigned to ASC payment group 2. Code G0105, colorectal cancer screening; colonoscopy on individuals at high risk, was added to the ASC list effective for services furnished on or after January 1, 1998. Code G0121, colorectal cancer screening; colonoscopy on individual not meeting criteria for high risk, was added to the ASC list effective for services furnished on or after July 1, 2001. Codes G0105 and G0121 are assigned to ASC payment group 2. The ASC facility service is the same whether the procedure is a screening or a diagnostic colonoscopy. If during the course of the screening co lonoscopy performed at an ASC, a lesion or growth is detected which results in a biopsy or removal of the growth, the appropriate diagnostic procedure classified as a colonoscopy with biopsy or removal should be billed rather than code G0105. Effective for services performed on or after January 1, 2007, a 25 percent coinsurance payment will apply for the colorectal cancer screening services (G0105 and G0121). 60.3 - Determining High Risk for Developing Colorectal Cancer 09- 14-15) A.

Coverage : As described in implementing regulations at 42 CFR 410.16, 411.15(a)(1), and 411.15(k)(11), the IPPE may be performed by a doctor of medicine or osteopathy as defined in sect ion 1861 (r)(1) of the Social Security Act (the Act) or by a qualified nonphysician practitioner (NPP) (physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist), not later than 12 months after the date the individual's first coverage begins under Medicare Part B. (See section 80.3 for a list of bill types of facilities that can bill A/B MACs for this service.) The IPPE includes: (1) review of the individual's medical and social history with attention to modifiable risk factors for disease detection, (2) review of the individual's potential (risk factors) for depression or other mood disorders, (3) review of the individual's functional ability and level of safety; (4) an examination to include measurement of the individual's height, weight, body mass index, blood pressure, a visual acuity screen, and other factors as deemed appropriate, based on the beneficiary's medical and social history; (5) end-of-life planning, upon agreement of the individual.

The type of service (TOS) for each of these codes is as follows: G0344: TOS = 1 G0366: TOS = 5 G0367: TOS = 5 G0368: TOS = 5 A/B MACs (B) shall pay physicians or qualified nonphysician practitioners for only one IPPE performed not later than 6 months after the date the individual's first coverage begins under Medicare Part B, but only if that coverage period begins on or after January 1, 2005. Effective for dates of service on and after January 1, 2009, A/B MACs (B) shall recognize the HCPCS codes G0402, G0403, G0404, and G0405 shown above in \u00a780.1 for an IPPE. The TOS for each of these codes is as follows: G0402: TOS = 1 G0403: TOS = 5 G0404: TOS = 5 G0405: TOS = 5 Under the MIPPA of 2008, A/B MACs (B) shall pay physicians or qualified nonphysician practitioners for only one IPPE performed not later than 12 months after the date the individual's first coverage begins under Medicare P art B only if that coverage period begins on or after January 1, 2009. A/B MACs (B) shall allow payment for a medically necessary Evaluation and Management (E/M) service at the same visit as the IPPE when it is clinically appropriate. Physicians and qual ified nonphysician practitioners shall use CPT report an E/M with CPT modifier 25 to indicate that the E/M is a significant, separately identifiable service from the IPPE code reported (G0344 or G0402, whichever applies based on the da te the IPPE is performed). Refer to chapter 12, \u00a730.6.1.1, of this manual for the physician/practitioner billing correct coding and payment policy regarding E/M services. If the EKG performed as a component of the IPPE is not performed by the primary physician or qualified NPP during the IPPE visit, another physician or entity may perform and/or interpret the EKG. The referring physician or qualified NPP needs to make sure that the performing physician or entity bills the appropriate G code for the screening EKG, and not a CPT code in the 93000 series. Both the IPPE and the EKG should be billed in order for the beneficiary to receive the complete IPPE service. Effective for dates of service on and after January 1, 2009, the screening EKG is optional and is no longer a mandated service of an IPPE if performed as a result of a referral from an IPPE. Should the same physician or NPP need to perform an additional medically necessary EKG in the 93000 series on the same day as the IPPE, report the appropriate EKG CPT code(s) with modifier 59, indicating that the EKG is a distinct procedural service. Physicians or qualified nonphysician practitioners shall bill the A/B MACs (B) the appropriate HCPCS codes for IPPE. The HCPCS codes for an IPPE and screening EK G are paid under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS). See \u00a71.3 of this chapter for waiver of cost sharing requirements of coinsurance, copayment and deductible for furnished preventive services available in Medicare. 80.3 - A/B MAC (A) Billing for IPPE or EKG only when the services are submitted on one of the following TOBs: 12X, 13X, 22X, 71X, 73X and 85X. Type of facility and setting determines the basis of payment: For the IPPE or the screening EKG tracing only performed on a 12X and 13X TOB, hospital inpatient Part B and hospital outpatient, for hospitals subject to the outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS), under the OPPS. Hospitals not subject to OPPS shall be paid under current methodologies. For services performed on an 85X TOB, Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs), pay on reasonable cost. For services performed in a skilled nursing facility, TOB 22x, make payment for the technical component of the EKG based on the MPFS. For inpatient or outpatient services in hospitals in Maryland, make payment according to the Health Services Cost Review Commission. For services performed on a 12X TOB, Indian Health Services (IHS) hospitals, payment is made based on an all -inclusive ancillary per diem rate. For services performed on a 13X TOB, IHS hospitals, payment is made based on the all -inclusive rate (AIR). For services performed on an 85X TOB, IHS CAHs, payment is made base d on an all -inclusive facility specific per visit rate. All CAHs are paid for the technical or facility component of the IPPE itself. They are also paid for the technical component of the EKG, the tracing only, if the EKG is performed. Only CAHs paid under the optional method are paid for the professional component of the IPPE itself (in addition to the facility payment) for charges under revenue code 0960. If the EKG is performed, CAHs paid under the optional method may also be paid for the interpretat ion of the EKG (in addition to the payment for the tracing) when billed under revenue codes 0985 or 0986. 80.3.1 - Rural Health Clinic (RHC)/Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) Special Billing Physical Examination ( IPPE) instructions that are unique to Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) and Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). Refer to chapter 9, section 70.6 of this manual for a description of these instructions. 80.3.2 - Indian Health Services (IHS) Hospitals Special Billing the period January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2008, the designated A/B MAC (A) pays IHS hospitals when G0344 is submitted; this includes the IPPE whether or not the screening EKG is performed at the same time. The designated A/B MAC (A) will also pay IHS hospitals for the screening EKG if HCPCS code G0367 is present. For the professional component of the EKG, the designated A/B MAC (B) shall pay the bi lling physician or other practitioner the established amount. Effective January 1, 2009 the following new HCPCS codes have been developed for the IPPE benefit and replace the codes in the paragraph above: G0402 for the IPPE itself, and G0404 for the technical component (tracing only) of the EKG. 80.3.3 - Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) use modifier - 25 when billing the IPPE G0344 along with the technical component of the EKG, G0367, on the same claim. The same is true when billing IPPE code G0402 along with the technical component of the screening EKG, code G0404. This is due to an OPPS Outpatient Code Editor (OCE) which contains an edit that requires a modifier - 25 on any evaluation and management (E/M) HCPCS code if there is also a status \"S\" or \"T\" HCPCS procedure code on the claim. 80.4 Coinsurance deductible and coinsurance apply for the IPPE provided before January 1, 2009. The Medicare deductible is waived effective for the IPPE provided on or after January 1, 2009. Coinsurance continues to apply for the IPPE provided on or after January 1, 2009. As a result of the Affordable Care Act, effective for the IPPE provided on or after January 1, 2011, the Medicare deductible and coinsurance (for HCPCS code G0402 only) are waived. 80.5 - G0367 and G0368, A/B MACs (A) and (B) shall use MSN 18.22 - This service was denied because M edicare only covers the one-time initial preventive physical exam with an electrocardiogram within the first 6 months that you have Part B coverage, and only if that coverage begins on or after January 1, 2005.

When denying additional claims for G0402 (or claims with dates of service beyond the 12 month period) A/B MACs (A) and (B) shall use MSN 20.91 - This service was denied. Medicare covers a one -time initial preventive physical exam (Welcome to Medicare physical exam) if you get it within the first 12 months of the effective date of your Medicare Part B coverage. The Spanish version is: Este obtiene los primeros 12 meses de la fecha efectiva de su inscripci\u00f3n a la Parte B de Medicare.
