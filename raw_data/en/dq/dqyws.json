ANIMAL RESEARCH USD A Says Cats Will No Longer Be Used in Deadly R esearch TestsThe U.S. D epartment of Agriculture's (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) ended a contr oversial food-tasting testing practice that has been responsible for the deaths of mor e than 3000 cats since 1982. USDA officials said to xoplasmosis research will no longer use cats to study the effects of the parasite.The ARS used kittens to study to xoplasmosis by feeding them raw meat, and putting the animals do wn once the parasite harvested in their system and their infected feces had been obtained. A ccording to the USDA and Centers for Disease Control, toxoplasmosis is the leading cause of death due to food-borne illness in the U nited States, though its rates hav e been cut in half since the ARS began its research into the disease.Lawmakers in Congr ess had been pressuring the USDA to end the testing. Congr essman Jimmy Panetta (D-CA) and Senator Jeff Merkley (D-OR) sponsored the Kittens in T raumatic Testing Ends Now Act (KITTEN Act) that sought to end taxpay er funded experiments on cats. \"I commend the USDA for their decision to end this type of testing on kittens, \" Panetta's office said in a statement.The USDA said no cats hav e been infected for research purposes on the premises of any ARS facility since S eptember 2018. ORGANIZA TION NEWSA VMA Task Force Will Look at Ways to Promote the Utiliza tion of Veterinary TechniciansAn American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) task force has been conv ened to develop a plan to improve veterinary technician utilization. Among the issues the gr oup will tackle are how to encourage the consistent use of cr edentialed veterinary technicians as part of a health care team, the lack of r ecognition for technicians, the differences between employees trained on the job and cr edentialed technicians, and the high turnover rates, low job satisfaction, and lo w wages for technicians. The 10-member task for ce has until Dec. 31, 2019, to provide a report to the A VMA board of directors.

Prior to administration of CORAXIS , dogs should be tested for existing heartworm infection. At the discretion of the veterinarian, infected dogs should be treated with an adulticide to remove adult heartworms. CORAXIS is not effective against adult D. immitis . (See ANIMAL SAFETY - Safety Study in Heartworm-Positive Dogs.) ADVERSE REACTIONS: Since CORAXIS contains 2.5% moxidectin, studies that demonstrated the safe use of a topical solution containing 2.5% moxidectin + 10% imidacloprid were acceptable to demonstrate the safety of CORAXIS .Field Studies: Following treatment with a topical solution containing 2.5% moxidectin + 10% imidacloprid or an active control, dog reported the following post-treatment reactions: OBSERV ATIONMoxidectin + Imidacloprid n = 128 Active = 68 Pruritus 19 dogs (14.8%) 7 dogs (10.3%) Residue 9 dogs (7.0%) 5 dogs (7.4%) Medicinal Odor 5 dogs (3.9%) None obser vedLethargy 1 dog (0.8%) 1 Hyperactivity 1 dog (0.8%) None obser vedDuring a field study of a topical solution containing 2.5% moxidectin + 10% imidacloprid using 61 dogs with pre-existing flea allergy dermatitis, on e (1.6%) dog experienced localized pruritus immediately after product application, and one investigator noted hyperkeratosis at the application site of one dog (1 .6%).Laborator y Effectiveness Studies: One dog in a laboratory effectiveness study experienced weakness, depression and unsteadiness between 6 and 9 days aft er application of a topical solution containing 2.5% moxidectin + 10% imidacl oprid. The signs resolved without inter vention by day 10 post-application. The signs in this dog may have been related to peak serum levels of moxidectin, which var y between dogs, and occur between 1 and 21 days after product application. The following clinical obser vations also occurred in laboratory effectiveness studies following application of a topical solution containing 2.5% moxidectin + 1 0% imidacloprid and may be directly attributed to the drug or may be secondar y to the intestinal parasite burden or other underlying conditions in the dogs: diarrhea, bloody stools, vomiting, anorexia, lethargy , coughing, ocular discharge and nasal discharge. Obser vations at the application sites included damp, stiff or greasy hair, the appearance of a white deposit on the hair , and mild erythema, which resolved without treatment within 2 to 48 hours. ANIMAL SAFETY :In a controlled, double-masked, field safety study , a topical solution containing 2.5% moxidectin + 10% imidacloprid was administered to 128 dogs of various breeds, 3 months to 15 years of age, weighing 4 to 157 pounds. The moxidectin + imidacloprid topical solution was used safely in dogs concomitantly receiving ACE inhibitors, anticonvulsants, antihistamines, thyroid hormones, and urinar y acidifiers. Owners reported the following signs in their dogs after application of moxidectin + imidacloprid topical solution: pruritus, flaky/greasy residue at the treatment site, medicinal odor , lethargy, inappetence and hyperactivity.
