Ayurvedic treatment is a holistic system of medicine that has been used for centuries in India to treat various health conditions, which is why Ayurveda is known as the oldest healing science in existence. The Ayurvedic treatment approach to healthcare involves identifying and treating the root cause of the problem rather than just the symptoms. Ayurvedic treatments are designed to restore balance in the body by restoring balance in the dosha. Dosha is the fundamental energy that governs all aspects of human health and well-being. According to ayurvedic treatment, there are three doshas: - Vata dosha: Responsible for movement in the body and is made up of the elements of air and ether.

And it is recommended to increase the intake of warm cooked food, avoid cold raw food, and more protein and fat. - Pitta dosha: Responsible for transformation, digestion, and metabolism and is made up of the elements of fire and water. A person with this type of dosha imbalance is usually a person who is of medium build, often feels cold, and has acne-prone skin. They tend to be busy, accomplished, and always on the move. And it is advisable to take cold showers, consume comfort food or drinks, and avoid hot, spicy, or fermented foods. - Kapha dosha: Responsible for stability, structure, and lubrication in the body and is made up of the elements of earth and water. A person with this type of dosha imbalance can usually cause jealousy, lethargy, and weight gain. And it is advisable to avoid oily foods and solid carbohydrates such as pasta and rice. Instead, choose bitter, astringent ingredients and lots of fresh fruit and vegetables. How do Ayurvedic treatments help to treat varicose veins?
