While Allopathic Medicine Practitioners (AMPs) continue to adhere to allopathic medicine (AM) techniques, the use of TM endures for a variety of reasons. Given the requirement for TM disclosure, AMPs must encourage open communication with patients to persuade those who use TM and AM to disclose. We sought to understand and describe how South African AMPs facilitate disclosure of TM use during a consultation with patients who use both TM and AM and how it in\u0000uences the patient's willingness to disclose TM use. Methods This qualitative case study on AMPs at Gauteng district hospitals in South Africa was conducted between 2021 and 2022. Non-probability purposive sampling was employed to sample 14 AMPs. Individual participants were encouraged to share their unique experiences and interpretations of the phenomenon. Data were audio recorded, transcribed, loaded in ATLAS.ti and analysed. Using inductive content analysis, the material was reduced into themes that may meet the study questions. Results The data revealed four main themes: 'providing a suitable atmosphere for disclosure,' 'encouraging patients to TM usage to AMPs,' 'patient autonomy,' and 'AMP training'. During a consultation with patients who use both TM and AM, participants expressed their experiences and perceptions of TM nondisclosure. They also discussed several methods for encouraging patients to disclose their TM usage, particularly when TM is used concurrently with AM. Conclusion This study goes beyond the previously widely reported and explored distinctions in barriers and facilitators and investigates the issues driving non-disclosure of TM during a consultation with patients who use TM and AM without disclosing. Many AMPs struggle to initiate TM conversations with their patients which result in non-disclosure. This necessitates facilitation that is appropriate for all patients, assuming the possibility of TM use. Background Sub-Saharan African nations generally acknowledge the use of TM, but most of the research is visible in nations like Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, and Uganda [1]. The history of the development of TM use dates to the Stone Age [2]. In some communities, TM plays a crucial role in maintaining health [3]. Traditional medicine is backed by archives of scienti\u0000c observations that support its use [4]. In general, AMPs frequently view the use of traditional as behaviour that makes no appreciable contribution, even ifPage 3/17the practice persists despite a lack of healthcare facilities [5]. Since AMPs' perceptions of TM appear to be aligned with western approaches, it may be necessary to decolonize the mindset to change their attitudes [6] since those attitudes and beliefs may ultimately affect patient health care [7]. There has been a signi\u0000cant global trend over the past 25 years to encourage the integration of TM use and personal care methods into recognized allopathic practices [8]. When the TM used by patients who use both TM and AM is not disclosed, patients receive fragmented care which leads to subpar patient management [9]. A study published in 2015 [9], to determine the prevalence of TM use, treatment preferences, and AM substitution found that the primary cause of fragmented patient care is due to a lack of proper communication between patients who use TM without disclosing to AMPs and AMPs. AMPs should facilitate a dialogue to encourage patients to disclose, which not only aims to reduce interaction risks between TM and AM through a discussion but also builds trust and encourages more disclosure during the consultation [10]. Furthermore, they should create a conducive environment, AMPs should respect their patients' beliefs about TM and be aware of the implications of not disclosing its use during consultations [11]. Previous studies found that AMPs can facilitate this dialogue by asking direct questions which can elicit numerous reasons for non-disclosure [12, 13]. Undoubtedly, discussing their TM usage with the AMPs is crucial for the overall well-being of these patients. In addition, to improve the standard of health care for all patients, it is crucial to develop strategies for training AMPs to operate in ways that complement TM and respect various forms of knowledge [3, 14]. Organisations such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) are important in the development of strategies to improve healthcare worldwide. This organisation implemented a strategy (WHO TM Strategy 2014-2023) to help member states to develop programs that enhance the use of TM in healthcare, for those who want to implement them [15]. In addition, policymakers must make it easier for Traditional Medicine Practitioners and AMPs, regulatory agencies, community organizations, and the public to communicate and work together [16]. This holds importance as there are now policies in place that incentivize Traditional Health Practitioners (THPs) to o\u0000cially register their practices [17]. However, there is a considerable amount of research indicating that patients' reluctance to reveal information to their healthcare providers is heavily in\u0000uenced by their perceptions of their AMPs [18, 19]. Therefore, patients should be involved in their care and receive clear information about recommended treatments as well as alternative treatment options [20]. In South Africa, Allopathic Medicine Practitioners are required to perform six essential functions [21]. These functions comprise providing care, serving as a consultant, building capacity, training in clinical settings, leading clinical governance, and advocating for community-oriented primary care. Allopathic Medicine Practitioners are aware of the possibility that their patients are using TM when performing these essential roles; as a result, disclosure of TM use during a consultation must be encouraged [22, 23], but AMPs detach themselves from this issue when performing their roles [24]. Consequently, patientsPage 4/17conclude that disclosure of TM use is unimportant to AMPs when AMPs do not inquire about TM use [24]. Ekor [25] claims that AMPs receive very little instruction on how non-disclosure of TM use affects TM the care they give to patients. Fischer and Ereaut [26] presented an idea for creating a consultation model, which they liken to a situation where the AMP and the patient are dancing together but only the AMP is aware of the music and the steps. However, this consultation model does not provide how patients can disclose during consultation. To close this gap, the current study may shed light on how AMPs can facilitate disclosure of TM use during a consultation with patients who use both TM and AM to close this gap. Methods Study design and setting The study used a qualitative, case study design to investigate facilitating disclosure of TM use during a consultation with patients who use both TM and AM. A qualitative case study refers to an in-depth investigation of circumstances connected to an incident that is limited as opposed to something that lacks speci\u0000city [27]. Semi-structured interviews were used to investigate how AMPs facilitate disclosure of TM use. The one-on-one semi-structured interviews motivated the AMPs to detail their experiences and perceptions on the factors that in\u0000uence non-disclosure of TM use. The interview guide that was used contained semi-structured questions on the facilitation of disclosure of traditional medicine use to AMPs, barriers to disclosure of TM use and opinions on how to promote disclosure of TM use to AMPs. The population of interest included all AMPs working in selected District hospitals in Gauteng. Participants And Sampling Procedure After obtaining permission from the selected institutions, the primary researcher initiated the recruitment process. To ensure the exploration of the facilitation of TM use disclosure, the researchers recruited samples from multiple sites [28]. Fourteen AMPs (n=14) sampled through non-probability purposive sampling participated in the study. The authors (L.G, P.B.N. and N.M.S.) assume that most AMPs need to facilitate disclosure during a consultation with patients who use both TM and AM. The AMPs had varied demographics concerning age, marital status, highest quali\u0000cations, and work experience. Both male and female AMPs participated in the study. All registrars, retired AMPs, and AMPs on community service were excluded from this study. Data Collection Qualitative data were collected through individual in-depth interviews from November 2021 to July 2022. All eligible participants were approached face-to-face and given an information letter and consent formPage 5/17for consideration and those who were interested were arranged appointments with the primary researcher at a time convenient to them. All participants who willingly consented to participate in the study were engaged individually by the primary researcher through one-on-one interviews, adhering to the necessary COVID-19 restrictions. The primary researcher is a South African female with diagnostic radiography background. She is studying for PhD in Health Sciences. She is also a lecturer with Masters in health sciences and has experience in conducting semi-structured interviews among health professionals in South Africa. Each interview lasted for 30-45 minutes and data were collected until data saturation. The interviews were audio-recorded with the permission of the participants. The investigation was guided by the following questions: 1) How do AMPs make it easier for patients who use both TM and AM to disclose their use during a consultation? 2) How could patient disclosure of TM use during a consultation be affected by disclosure facilitation? 3) How does the non-disclosure affect the AMPs' overall patient consultation service? Probes to con\u0000rm and clarify the participants' opinions during the interviews were used [29]. This process allowed the primary researcher to identify patterns, emergent themes, and concepts. Data saturation was observed when the interviews were not yielding any new information to contribute to the study. To help maintain track of all the observations in case they were forgotten over time, \u0000eld notes were made during each interview. Ethical Considerations Ethical approval was obtained from the Durban University of Technology Institutional Research Ethics Committee (IREC 016/21). Before the commencement of the interviews, the research objectives were communicated and explained to the participants through the information letter. Informed consent was obtained before data collection. Data analysis The \u0000rst three transcripts were transcribed by the primary researcher and sent to the second (P.B.N) and third (N.M.S) authors, who oversaw the coding and theme identi\u0000cation procedures to ensure high-quality data. The subsequent transcripts were further discussed in case of divergent points of view to reach an agreement. The primary researcher continued to transcribe and validate the subsequent transcripts with the two authors and then uploaded them to ATLAS.ti-9 for analysis using content analysis. To enable the authors to develop a conceptual understanding through interpretation and explanation, the data analysis procedure was accomplished through an inductive content analysis approach [30]. These authors described the following steps: 1. initial coding, 2. \u0000rst phase of coding to determine the overall meaning units, 3. subcategories and detailed codes are developed using second-round coding and lastly is the re\u0000nement of the detailed subcategories [30]. Through social constructivism, the researchers ensured that data were the interpretations of the lived experiences [31] of the AMPs who consulted with the patients who use both TM and AM. This provided a general picture of how non-disclosure may have affected consultation with patients who use both TM and AM by highlighting all the similarities and differences between AMPs' experiences.Page 6/17To ensure trustworthiness through the data analysis, four standard criteria: credibility, dependability, con\u0000rmability, and transferability were used [32]. For the data to echo the reality of the occurrence as experienced by the AMPs, credibility was veri\u0000ed through triangulation. Giving speci\u0000cs about the study's methodology could make the \u0000ndings more understandable and reliable. To ensure con\u0000rmability, the researchers maintained a record of all the information gathered and came to an understanding regarding the themes and subthemes discovered during the debrie\u0000ng. By interviewing AMPs with a range of experiences, the researchers were able to offer adequate background descriptions to make the study transferable and allow comparison with related studies. Results This study is a component of a wider investigation that aimed to develop guidelines for disclosing TM usage to AMPs at hospitals in Gauteng, South Africa. During the study, 14 AMPs were interviewed. This study adheres to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ). Please see Supplementary File 1 for more details. To highlight the anonymized opinions of AMPs for privacy, we selected typical excerpts labelled with pseudonyms. Facilitating disclosure of traditional medicine use to AMPs was divided into 4 primary themes (Table 1) (creating a conducive environment for disclosure, encouraging patients to disclose TM use to AMPs, patient autonomy, and Training of AMPs) and 7 subthemes (a safe environment to disclose, free and comfortable disclosure, asking non-prejudiced direct questions, provision of information to the patient, supporting patient's choice, patients' right to choose, treatments of their choice, trained mainly on the use of AM). These connected themes and sub-themes are all discussed below. Table 1 Themes and subthemes Themes Subthemes Creating a conducive environment for disclosure. A safe environment to disclose. Free and comfortable disclosure Encouraging patients to disclose TM use to AMPs.Asking non-prejudiced direct questions Provision of information to the patient Patient autonomy. Supporting patient's choice Patients' right to choose treatments of their choice Training of AMPs. Trained mainly in the use of AM Theme 1: Creating A Conducive Environment For Disclosure Of Tm UsePage 7/171.1 A safe environment to disclose. Participants in this study acknowledged that AMPs have to create a welcoming environment for all patients, and they demonstrated awareness of this obligation. Many showed a desire to make the patients feel welcome to encourage disclosure. They claimed that regardless of their position on TM usage, having a uniform mode of approach for all patients would help to ensure that patients who use TM could disclose. \"Uhm, I believe if a patient discloses in a safe environment. It is our responsibility as healthcare providers to create a safe environment in which patients can disclose anything, even if it is not traditional medicine. However, whatever adjuvant treatment they are receiving, we must create a safe environment.\" [AMP3] \"Patients, in my opinion, should be required to disclose. I believe that practitioners must keep an open mind and be able to create an environment in which the patient can speak. So, does the practitioner have to create an environment?... First, the environment must be clear and conducive, and trust must be established by you (the AMP). It is the practitioner's responsibility to create that platform to clarify the implications of the patient's illness and treatment. Practitioners must foster an environment in which patients are encouraged to disclose.\" [AMP7] 1.2 Free and comfortable disclosure To ensure effective communication between AMPs patients and to foster a comfortable environment of trust, disclosure during a consultation with AMPs must not be restricted. According to the participants, patients would not be willing to disclose anything beyond what they believed is necessary to receive assistance at the time if they did not feel accepted in the environment. Most participants indicated that a safe environment would instil within the patient some sense of trust towards the person they were interacting with. \"... Ok. First, when I consult with a patient, I want the patient to feel safe and con\u0000dent; when the patient is with me, I want the patient to trust me because I'm here to help, not to harm; and once the patient trusts you (the AMP), I believe it will be easy for the patient to disclose.\" [AMP4] \"Uh, we'd like patients to fully disclose because we don't want them to be hiding anything from us. So, we'd like to provide an environment in which a patient feels very safe to disclose and is not judged by whatever treatment they're using, but ultimately, we'd like patients to give us full disclosure about what they're using because it affects how we manage them further.\" [AMP13] Theme 2: Encouraging Patients To Disclose Tm Use To Amps 2.1 Asking non-prejudiced direct questionsPage 8/17Participants expressed that patients could be encouraged to reveal if they were properly communicated with and given the right tools. They claimed that patients would readily disclose their use of TM during a consultation if they could see that other patients were aware of it. They suggested that even if a patient disputed responsibility for their circumstances, they still needed to feel con\u0000dent that they could contact the AMPs and trust that they would handle the disclosure effectively. \"... However, if you ask the patient directly, they will not disclose unless they believe you [the AMP] are receptive. If I'm curious, I'll tell the patient that most of my patients take traditional medications. So, when they suspect that they are not the only ones using traditional medicine, they reveal it. But if I simply asked, they would not reveal.\" [AMP1] \"We (the AMPs) should not judge patients for their own choices to allow the patient to disclose. We must recognize that patients have rights. We should also inform patients that their rights entail responsibilities. We [the AMPs] also have a responsibility to protect patients.\" [AMP3] \"... In my opinion, I want the patient to disclose because I want to know everything about the patient when I'm treating him or her. As a result, if the patient discloses, we should always inquire as to how long this has been going on. Is there anything else wrong with them? And what other medications are they taking? You'll discover that some medication could be the source of the patient's symptoms?\" [AMP4] 2.2 Provision of information to the patient Participants believed that providing the patient with pertinent information could result in effective treatment. They believe that patients would get the intended bene\u0000t from the treatment and help them avoid adverse reactions. Some participants thought that these patients would be capable of making informed decisions regarding the use of TM if they had access to enough information. \"OK, so they would disclose, one, if they are aware of information that would bene\u0000t them. So, having explained the preceding point. They should be allowed to fully express themselves. That they should be aware of the impact of their treatment plans on their condition, as well as the interaction of their treatment plans with other treatments that they may be using. As a result, if they are aware of such information, it will be easier for them to disclose.\" [AMP13] \"For the patient to disclose, I usually ask the patient. I ask the patient to tell me the truth, and when I discover they are using traditional medicine, I don't dismiss them; instead, I speak appropriately. I show them that traditional medicines in this condition are not to be used because they will all harm your kidneys.\" [AMP9] \"So, when patients come to us, uh [AMPs]. Uh, I'd usually ask them that, but I'd also give them information about our treatment plan, and they'd decide which plan they wanted to go with on their own.\" [AMP13] Theme 3: Patient AutonomyPage 9/173.1 Supporting patients' choice Participants agreed that patients who use TM and AM concurrently cannot be pressured to just use AM if they believe TM to be useful for them. They felt that it was necessary to support patients to choose the treatments that best suited them. \".... I don't mind if there are no negative interactions between traditional medicines and our allopathic medicine.\" [AMP2] \"For example, in traditional medicine, let's say a patient comes in for an acute illness and they don't necessarily have any chronic conditions, and I have no reason to suspect any other chronic illnesses. I don't usually have a problem with that (referring to the use of TM).\" [AMP5] \"Uhm...We [AMPs[ have a responsibility to make sure that we are always constant, and the patient autonomy is respected.\" [AMP3] \"I used to be autocratic before I went to get my speciality, but not anymore. I no longer use that method; instead, I simply allow the patient to make their own decision because, at the end of the day, it is the patient's choice. I can't make the patient do anything.\" [AMP1] \"...The patient must consider the outcomes. However, it is ultimately the patient's choice. I can't force it.\" [AMP4] \"I always keep an open mind when dealing with patients who have different perspectives on medical treatment. So, if a patient has a different point of view. I'm always willing to sit down with a patient and talk about it [the TM use].\" [AMP7] 3.2 Patients' right to choose treatments of their choice. Participants argue that patients should be softly persuaded while being shielded from any attempts at control. Patients should be allowed to take responsibility for their behaviour, they recommended, because if they are controlled, they might not be able to do so and won't feel liable for any consequences. Participants think that patients should be able to use their rights without fear of reprisal. \"We should not pass judgment on patients based on their own choices. We must recognize that patients have the right to choose their treatments. We should also remind patients that their rights come with responsibilities. On the other hand, we have a responsibility to protect the patients and maintain our commitment to patient autonomy.\" [AMP3] \"Yeah, well, we should talk properly. They [the patients] are of legal drinking age. They have the right to make their own decisions. They have the right to know as well. The more information we provide, the clearer their decisions will be.\" [AMP9]Page 10/17Theme 4: Training Of Allopathic Medicine Practitioners 4.1 Trained mainly on the use of allopathic medicine. Participants stated that AMPs are trained to consider other complementary methods of treating the patient. However, they also mentioned that TM was not considered an alternative to AM, except in instances where the individual AMP had previous exposure to TM use. They also mentioned that traditional health practitioners (THPs) could also bene\u0000t from health education as this could encourage their visibility as people who are involved in patient treatment. \".... It is our training that will make us opposed to the use of traditional medicine.\" [AMP2] \"...We [AMPs] were primarily trained in the use of a medical treatment\" [AM]. So, our approach would be for the patient to use what we recommended. As a result, my opinion strongly supports what I know about the medical treatment aspect. As a result, we usually advise patients to use medical treatment rather than other treatment options about which we are unsure.\" [AMP13] \"But our medical training does not prepare us for this type of scenario [referring to patients who use TM], because you are always told to do what is best for the patient, but this is not always the case... However, during their undergraduate training, doctors are exposed to technology that does not allow us to know what they [THPs] are doing; we simply assume they throw bones [a method of checking with the ancestors to determine what problems the patient may be experiencing] and then [showing a gesture of bare hands]. There is very little understanding of what occurs on the other side.\" [AMP1] \".... if I \u0000nd out the patient is using traditional medicine, as a medical practitioner, I don't have a clue about traditional medicine.\" [AMP12] Discussion Allopathic Medicine Practitioners have a responsibility to ensure that all patient consultations take place in a friendly setting where the patient can divulge any additional information that might help with treatment planning. As a result, creating a safe setting for the patient and demonstrating empathy can promote open communication and increase the likelihood of disclosure [19]. Because non-disclosure is so common, it is necessary to create an inclusive healthcare system supported by AMPs who can interact with different patient types [33]. Allopathic Medicine Practitioners should be aware of the barriers to disclosure and endeavour to improve their interactions with these patients [34]. According to recent research on the subject, patients who take both TM and AM should disclose their TM use to improve their treatment outcomes overall [35, 36]. Available data linked to this study discovered that AMP acceptance of TM and allowing AM to be openly addressed in a non-prejudice way may foster trust and enable disclosure to support safe and dependable treatments for patients [37, 38].Page 11/17Allopathic Medicine Practitioners should accept their patients' decisions to use TM and work to provide them with all of their available options because they are also people with varied viewpoints [39]. TM offers patients simple access to care, allowing them to work together to make their own health decisions and increasing patient autonomy [1]. In light of this, patients should have access to information about the TM they use to exercise their choice, as this is crucial to ensure the quality of TM since this is an important issue globally [40]. However, as an initial step TM should be integrated into the training programme of AMPs, there should be cross-practice between AMPs and THPs and recommendations for highly regarded TM in health facilities should be made [41, 1, 42]. Furthermore, AMPs should actively enquire about the use of TM, but this can only be achieved through the inclusion of TM education in the AM curricula to develop the AMPs' ability to initiate the discussion of TM use during the consultation [43] Therefore, the acquired knowledge of TM and the relationships between TM and AM among patients and AMPs would enable AMPs to be more open with their prescriptions and involve patients in their care [44]. Implications For Practice It may not be possible for AMPs in their institutions to change some of the variables impacting the AMPs' impressions of TM, such as the scepticism of THP training. However, TM should be incorporated into AMPs' training programmes, there should be cross-practice between AMPs and THPs, and suggestions for highly valued TM in health institutions should be made to legitimise and justify TM in terms of practice and knowledge. The development of a scaffolded TM and AM training that gradually integrates AMPs into an understanding of TM with a focus on both increasing their knowledge and identifying primary cause perceived TM effects to be informed about the many issues. AMPs could better achieve their treatment objectives by encouraging patients who use both TM and AM to disclose their use of TM. Implications To Research It is probably critical to look for methods to make disclosure of TM use to AMPs easier. Future studies may investigate the relationship between AMP training and patients who use both TM and AM without disclosing their TM use. Furthermore, research on speci\u0000c recommendations for how AMPs could improve the TM disclosure process is critical. Strengths And Limitations Of The Study To the best of our knowledge, this is the \u0000rst comprehensive study on the facilitation of disclosure of traditional medicine used to AMPS in the academic literature. The researcher (L.G) exclusively used AMPs. Because of the diverse social backgrounds of their patients, our participants were informed about the non-disclosure of TM use by patients who use both TM and AM. When offering suggestions on how to increase disclosure by patients who use both TM and AM, the AMPs who participated were able to draw on their training expertise through authentic dialogue. This made it possible for them to openly talk about di\u0000culties and crises they had encountered during their training and how those had affected howPage 12/17they interacted with patients who used both TM and AM. When compared to other ethnic groups, the sample exhibited a large proportion of black AMPs. This sampling may have constrained the study in terms of different social attitudes on TM use that could have been linked to other ethnic groups not included in the study. Despite our efforts to increase TM disclosure to AMPs, we need to fully comprehend all perspectives. Conclusion This study investigated how AMPs facilitate disclosure of TM use during a consultation with patients who use both TM and AM. Despite the participants' consensus regarding the importance of disclosure of TM use, the study noted variations in the understanding of TM disclosure facilitation during a consultation with AMPs. The study found that patients' motivation to disclose TM use and the decision- making process varies with AMPs. The causes of variations included establishing a setting that encourages transparency, encouraging patients to be forthcoming to AMPs about their use of TM and preparations of AMPs through training for such encounters. The study also noted that AMPs might feel pressured to treat patients who use both TM and AM without any con\u0000rmation as part of their fundamental roles. More guidance is needed on how these factors can be addressed during a consultation so that patients are adequately guided towards voluntary disclosure of TM use. Furthermore, the process of TM disclosure should have a degree of \u0000exibility depending on the patient's circumstance to yield better treatment outcomes. This study recommends training of all AMPs be incorporated into the curriculum of their training. In response to the study \u0000ndings, the researcher initiated a process of formulating guidelines that will help facilitate the disclosure of TM use to AMPs. These will be published separately. The use of personal opinions and preferences may not be ideal when dealing with patients who may be concealing their use of TM. The TM disclosure process should be standardised for all consultations with AMPs. This will promote understanding of AMPs as patients are more likely to be in\u0000uenced by the initial interaction with the AMP.
