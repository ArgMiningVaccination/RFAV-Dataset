You might find your overall workload increasing and your energy levels going down. You can take steps to restore your energy levels and boost your immune system this fall with Myers' Cocktail intravenous (IV) therapy. This [vitamin and mineral infusion treatment](https://www.healthline.com/health/under-review-IV-vitamin-therapy#Whats-happening-to-your-body-when-you-get-an-IV-drip-of-vitamins?), named after the late Dr. John Myers of Maryland, may reduce your fatigue and help with symptoms of seasonal allergies, asthma, and even chronic pain problems like fibromyalgia. [Raymond Douglas, MD, PhD](/meet-dr-douglas), supports new and existing patients at his office in Beverly Hills, California. After you receive your Myers' Cocktail IV treatment, you could start feeling invigorated right away, ready to face whatever challenges come your way. How can a Myers' Cocktail boost your health? Containing a mix of calcium, magnesium, B vitamins, and vitamin C, the Myers' Cocktail treatment increases your blood concentration of these key nutrients much more quickly than chewing a handful of oral supplements. That's because when nutrients pass through your gastrointestinal tract, their absorption may not be efficient. But with a Myers' Cocktail, the vitamins and minerals infuse directly into your bloodstream so they can be delivered to your cells. You may feel an immediate energy boost after your short treatment session, and some patients with fatigue say their increased energy levels last for days or even weeks. In some patients, pain and inflammation observably decrease after an infusion treatment. And, your immune system gets a boost to help protect you from viral illnesses. IV treatment comes with only a few slight risks, such as local irritation around the vein used for your infusion. Our team takes care to insert the small catheter carefully, minimizing soreness and bruising around the treatment site. Who can benefit from a Myers' Cocktail? A quick-acting extra dose of nutrients can help patients with a variety of conditions, including chronic complaints. You could potentially benefit from treatment with a Myers' Cocktail IV if you: - Are experiencing unexplained fatigue - Have chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia - Have asthma or an upper respiratory tract infection - Suffer from chronic sinusitis or seasonal allergies - Suffer from migraines A Myers' Cocktail may also help if you have a chronic gastrointestinal condition, such as ulcerative colitis, that negatively impacts your digestion and absorption of nutrients. The nutrients in a Myers' Cocktail treatment also act to support your muscles. Treatment can enhance your athletic performance, as well as relieve acute muscle spasms. To boost your immune system this fall, or find support for healing a chronic or acute condition, try a Myers' Cocktail IV infusion. You may need multiple treatments to experience your best results, and patients with chronic conditions may benefit from regular infusions.
