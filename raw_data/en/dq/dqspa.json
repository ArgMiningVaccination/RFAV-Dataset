The biotech firm's new three-story campus, which is slated to be finished in 2012, will house scientists working on such infectious disease threats as AIDS and Dengue fever, and will focus more on human clinical trials than its parent campus at Oregon Health & Science University. The design, building, permitting and equipment costs for the facility come to $48.8 million, a spokesman said. VGTI Florida, as it's known, has about 50 employees in a temporary facility on the third floor of the adjacent Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Sciences building. It plans to have about 200 employees by 2018 with an average wage of $60,000 per year. \"This is the opportunity to lay the foundation for what will become one of the leading scientific facilities in the world,\" Daniel Dorsa, chairman and board of directors of VGTI Florida, said during a ceremony commemorating the pouring of the foundation for the new facility. \"Within two years, we're going to have a building here. You're potentially close to the site of what might be the discovery of the treatment or cure of HIV.\" Persuading VGTI to open a campus in Port St. Lucie was a coup for the city and state. The institute was lured in 2008 with $60 million in incentives from the state's Innovation Incentive Fund and a $53 million investment from the city of Port St. Lucie; the agreement to open the campus more than doubled the city's biotech industry. Gov. Charlie Crist's office, which signed off on the $60 million in incentives, has estimated that the institute and related startup companies will create more than 1,460 positions - directly and indirectly - plus $2 billion in payroll and $4.2 billion in gross state product in its first 20 years in Florida. Torrey Pines, the city's first biotech institute, was also instrumental in bringing VGTI to Port St. Lucie. \"Torrey Pines is the reason we're here,\" said Jay Nelson, executive director and vice president of VGTI Florida. He added that he sees this area becoming a nucleus of institutes and biotech firms. \"We look at them being here as important for bringing other scientists to this area.\" VGTI Florida is the home of prominent HIV-vaccine researcher Rafick-Pierre Sekaly, who moved his team from Montreal to Port St. Lucie. His presence is expected to help recruit other scientists. \"Scientists don't like to work by themselves. They come in flocks,\" Nelson said during the ceremony Wednesday. \"We are going to bring recognition to the county here with our work.\" Sekaly said VGTI Florida already has \"top-notch\" candidates lined up now and for when the building opens. \"Excellence is what drives science. It's like a domino effect,\" Sekaly said. \"We already have international recognition for our work. We're already on the map. The dot will just grow bigger.\" VGTI Florida "}
