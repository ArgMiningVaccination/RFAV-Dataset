However, with our fast-paced modern lifestyle and exposure to an increasing number of harmful and toxic substances, our body's natural cleansing ability has become overworked and compromised. Many signs and symptoms attributed to stress are now being linked to exposure from harmful substances such as PCBs, pesticides, herbicides, antibiotics, growth hormones, and mercury in food and liquids as well as dioxins and formaldehyde in the air. These substances most notably affect the healthy functioning of the liver and immune system. Common symptoms of dysfunction in these systems include: - Fatigue, anxiety and depression - Allergies and frequent infections - Unexplained weight gain and difficulty losing or gaining weight - Joint pain and muscle weakness - Difficulty focusing and memory loss - Indigestion, constipation, diarrhea, gas and/or abdominal bloating - Skin rashes, skin eruptions and/or acne - Recurrent yeast/fungal infections - Rapid aging Harmful and toxic substances from our chemically laden food and polluted environment have also become implicated as a leading cause of many serious illnesses such as: - Cancer - Degenerative diseases - Infertility, birth defects and genetic changes To counter this growing situation, the practitioners at Chinese Medicine Lady have developed a Cleansing and Detoxification Program that is unique and highly useful in ridding the body of many harmful and toxic substances. In designing the detox program, [Lydia](https://chinesemedicinelady.com/about/) has drawn upon the centuries-old Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) principles and 14 generations of TCM knowledge past down from her ancestors to solve a modern problem. The detox program combines selected TCM techniques that work together synergistically such as acupuncture, cupping, herbal medicine, nutritional therapy, moxibustion, tuina bodywork and mind body exercise. How Does It Work? The Cleansing and Detoxification Program is scheduled as a three-day program or as a week-long program. The procedures used are designed to stimulate the release of harmful substances stored in the tissues and liver. Once the toxins are released into the circulatory system, it is important to remove them as soon as possible. This is why the chosen treatment modalities are so important. Acupuncture Acupuncture stimulates neurological, immunological, and endocrine responses beneficial to tissue cleansing and cell rejuvenation. It also stimulates the release of endorphins that reduce the pain and discomfort sometimes experienced when detoxifying and withdrawing from addictive substances such as alcohol, caffeine, drugs, nicotine and sugar. Chinese Herbal Medicine Our proprietary herbal formulations that have been past down for generations focus on drawing the toxins directly out of the body through increased sweating, urination, and bowel movements. Some of the herbs directly support the filtering function of the liver and assist it in cleansing and promoting cell repair and cell regeneration.* [Learn more about Chinese herbal medicine](https://chinesemedicinelady.com/herbal-therapy/). Moxibustion Therapy The moxibustion has a dual effect of tonification and purgation. The heat and deep vibratory action of the moxa energy promotes the release of toxins through increased circulation and thermal and infrared effects. Moxa therapy differs from the conventional heat therapy in its ability to penetrate deeply beneath the superficial layers of the skin. Studies show that the moxa helps to rid the body of toxins that are stored beyond the superficial layers of the skin. The excreted toxins include: cholesterol, fat soluble toxins, toxic heavy metals (such as mercury and aluminum), sulfuric acid, sodium, ammonia and uric acid.

Tuina Bodywork Toxins often accumulate in the connective tissues creating blockages and impeding blood and fluid circulation. Our tuina bodywork protocol consists of dry brushing, lymphatic drainage, joint rotations, and cupping. The strong suction action of the cupping stimulates blood and lymphatic fluid to flow near the skin's surface and to key areas of the body for easy and direct release of toxins.
